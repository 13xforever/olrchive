00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,240
This week, the crowdfunding train rolls on with news of everything from campaigns getting

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,080
a physical release to indie hopefuls backing down from their labor of love.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,640
For now, we're bringing you all the details in a game of our very own, and it all starts

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,640
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,740
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,680
where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 604, July the 5th of 2015.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,080
Hope you all had a happy July 4th weekend if you're here in the States.

9
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,360
If you are up in Canada, then I hope you all had a great Canada Day.

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,280
If you're somewhere else in the world, well, I hope you had a good week.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,220
My name is Rob Roberts here in studio to talk games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle

12
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:06,480
with my co-host, say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,000
And is that your final word on the matter?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How are you, Jamie?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm okay.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Good, good.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Just okay.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,720
Yeah, I was going to go get milk tea, and their credit card machine's been broken for

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,860
three months, and I still haven't fixed it, and I'm like, but I want milk tea.

21
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,980
What place is this?

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,020
It's the tea culture place that I go to.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,020
Oh, it must be.

24
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,020
It's like on-

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,020
I was like, what kind of place does-

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,580
Florin whatever the hell that turns into Twat Avenue.

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:34,780
I was like, what kind of place doesn't get their little credit thing fixed?

28
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,780
It's crazy.

29
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,780
It's a tile.

30
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,780
Fix your tile.

31
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,380
Anyway, I was going to say, you know where I went today.

32
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,940
You always talk about this place here locally.

33
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,780
We're going to talk locally for a minute, so you all deal with this.

34
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,660
But I'm sure you have one of these in your town somewhere.

35
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,940
Alan and I finally went over to the International Market in Rancho Cordova.

36
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,940
We hadn't been there.

37
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,580
I don't think I've ever been there.

38
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,580
Well, okay.

39
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,980
I remember when it was just a little Asian grocery store, but at some point, it absorbed

40
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,740
the Albertsons or whatever it was that used to be next to it, and now it's a mega store

41
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,060
of international stuff.

42
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,140
And I was going to bring green tea Kit Kat to the show because they have the flavored

43
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,860
Kit Kats and stuff, and I was like, nah.

44
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,500
I still visit Oto's as well.

45
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
I like candy.

46
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Probably a bad idea.

47
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,500
I don't know.

48
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,900
Matcha Kit Kats, pretty bomb.

49
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,980
They only had green tea and dark chocolate, but still, you don't see the other flavors

50
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,980
in the States ever.

51
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,100
You know what they get at Oto's though?

52
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,620
They have the cookies and cream Oreo soft cookies.

53
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,940
That sounds real good.

54
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:31,940
Mm-hmm.

55
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Real good.

56
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,940
All right.

57
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,940
Oh, they have matcha Oreos too.

58
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,620
Well, we're talking about food before we talk about video games, so it must be a good time

59
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,620
to introduce us.

60
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,620
Well, Tech Master, Loki.

61
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,620
Hello.

62
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,620
How you doing, Loki?

63
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
I'm doing fine.

64
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,620
Have you been to the International Market?

65
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,620
Yeah.

66
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,620
Yeah?

67
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,620
There's some good stuff over there.

68
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,940
All sorts of things.

69
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,940
I don't know.

70
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,460
I guess maybe one of these days I'll load us up on candy and bring it to the show.

71
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,860
What I was trying to find over in the ... They had a Japanese candy aisle, and I was trying

72
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,460
to find some of the stuff that Akuma JP sent us in the care package a while ago.

73
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,180
I did find Hello Kitty marshmallows, and I almost bought those, but I didn't want to

74
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,740
walk up to the checkout and just be like, hi, I just want to buy these Hello Kitty marshmallows

75
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,300
because then I'm kind of creepy.

76
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Let's be real.

77
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,300
You would not be the first.

78
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,100
They don't care.

79
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,780
I would not be the first to only buy Hello Kitty marshmallows at the grocery store?

80
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,900
I did have my Japanese food experience today because I found a place near my house that

81
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,860
does curry rice.

82
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,900
On top of that, they did karaoke curry rice.

83
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,900
Nice.

84
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,900
I was happy.

85
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Nom, nom, nom.

86
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,900
All right.

87
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
It's like my ...

88
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,900
Lots of food talk.

89
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,420
Yes, I did say Twat Avenue.

90
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,420
It's what, but ...

91
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,140
Hey, if you want to join us and comment on the show, and Dark Sakura will randomly respond

92
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,860
to you as she just did, you can participate with us live every Sunday night at the Voice

93
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,640
of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

94
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Bobby Black Wolf show.

95
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,460
If you are listening live, join us and chat, live.vognetwork.com, who Tigerclaw, taking

96
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,100
the opportunity because I brought up Hello Kitty, Tigerclaw bouncing in with the opportunity

97
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,620
to remind us they're going to be making a movie out of Hello Kitty.

98
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,660
I don't know if you saw that news this week, but they are officially making a Hello Kitty

99
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,720
movie, which I guess the distinction is it's probably the first big screen movie because

100
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,700
there's tons of Hello Kitty VHSs and stuff already.

101
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,940
I'm sure there's like mini movies and stuff, but this is like the first big movie, Hello

102
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,220
Kitty's big fucking deal.

103
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,840
If you want to see the best thing that Sanrio ever put out, just watch Turin's Bell, and

104
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
then cry.

105
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,420
Cry like you've never cried before because it will make you cry like you're three years

106
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,780
old and someone stepped on your foot and took your lollipop.

107
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,180
On a scale of one to Grave of the Fireflies, how hard am I going to cry?

108
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,580
Probably Grave of the Fireflies.

109
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,580
That's pretty bad.

110
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,740
It's Doug of Flanders level.

111
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
Oh, dang.

112
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
All right.

113
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,460
Except instead of all the sad, it's also got all of the violence.

114
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,460
All right.

115
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,460
And this is for children.

116
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,020
On a scale of one to the ending of Dancer in the Dark, how wet will my t-shirt be?

117
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,740
You know, I haven't seen Dancer in the Dark.

118
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,740
Okay.

119
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,740
But I know it's really sad.

120
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,740
It's really sad.

121
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,260
So I'm going to say it's as sad as Bjork's last experimental album.

122
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,520
Oh, that's not sad.

123
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
That's tragic.

124
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
There's a difference.

125
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
Tragic.

126
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,520
It's tragic.

127
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Don't cry.

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
All right.

129
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,800
Speaking of tragic, let's introduce our guests for tonight.

130
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,440
You like that segue?

131
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,040
No, I love this.

132
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,780
This guy has not been on the show in a very, very long time.

133
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,720
He's really old school when it comes to OLR.

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,120
And we're really happy to have him back on the show.

135
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,400
Everybody, please give a warm welcome back to Intern Druunami.

136
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
He's here tonight.

137
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Hey there, internet.

138
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
You miss me?

139
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,440
No, but our aim is improving.

140
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
How are you?

141
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
How have you been?

142
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Oh, God.

143
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
I've been on this show.

144
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,760
You knocked over the soundboard in, what, 2007, 2008?

145
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,200
Yeah, I heard that that one came home to Roos not too long ago.

146
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Yeah.

147
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,600
Well, I think somebody put together like a top 10 OLR moments, and I'm pretty sure that

148
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
was in it somewhere.

149
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Oh, Jesus.

150
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,640
You're right there up with the diva fit, Loki singing.

151
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,720
That's all up there.

152
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
The tingle bet.

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
I think we're all in the...

154
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,560
Actually, Loki was not the only one singing that day, too.

155
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,440
I made an ass out of myself then, too.

156
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
That's right.

157
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
It was a fun episode.

158
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,840
It has been a couple of years, but I figured I'd pop on it.

159
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,280
I just barely missed the birthday show, which is also my birthday show, but life goes on.

160
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,600
We were both born.

161
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,960
When you put both and born together, you get borth.

162
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,960
We were borth on June...

163
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,520
We were brought forth by birth.

164
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
We were both...

165
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Somebody call the Game Grumps.

166
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
We've got something going here now.

167
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,040
On June 23rd.

168
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
What does that even mean?

169
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
I don't know.

170
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
Was that shade?

171
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,600
Was that shade in my own house?

172
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Just a touch.

173
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,000
Were we borth on June 23rd, both of us?

174
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Indeed.

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Indeed.

176
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There you go.

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,360
Now, you were mentioning before the show...

178
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,360
Hold on.

179
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,360
Okay.

180
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,340
How old were you when you first came on OLR for the very first time?

181
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
You were 17, right?

182
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,340
Oh, yeah.

183
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,340
I was 17.

184
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,340
You were 17.

185
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
Episode 29.

186
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,340
Oh, my God.

187
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,340
Okay.

188
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,820
So you were 17 years old, and that's why we used to pick on you.

189
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,160
We call you Intern Drew, because you're a youngin'.

190
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,680
You're a dumb kid, right?

191
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,680
Uh-huh.

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,360
And how old did you just turn on your birthday?

193
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
30.

194
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Oh, my God.

195
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,000
Now I'm officially in the old folks' home with rest of y'all.

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, my God.

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hold on a minute.

198
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,400
No, no, no, no, no.

199
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,880
I'm not in the old folks' home.

200
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,120
I'm one of those crazy old people who's going out skiing and riding roller coasters.

201
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,560
You don't have to hit me with your walker like that.

202
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
I can't watch my swingin'.

203
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Hold on.

204
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Hold on.

205
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
What?

206
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
I say this with the utmost respect.

207
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,200
That dumb ass kid turned 30.

208
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,080
This dumb ass kid turned 30.

209
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
Wowie.

210
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,560
I'm just a dumb ass man.

211
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Okay, here we go.

212
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Love it.

213
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Yeah, you're still a kid.

214
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,800
Nah, you're still a kid compared to the rest of us.

215
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,920
Kid or squid now?

216
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Are you a kid or a squid?

217
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
You decide.

218
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Uh, wait.

219
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Hold on.

220
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,200
Get this right, or you're leaving.

221
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
You will be voting...

222
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,200
Teamcat.net.

223
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Thank you.

224
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,200
All right, thank you.

225
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
You even knew the question.

226
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
I don't even have the Wii U yet, but Teamcat.

227
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,200
Thank you.

228
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Thank you.

229
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Anybody who's Teamdog, you're not allowed tonight.

230
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
That was bullshit that you won.

231
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Get out.

232
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
We'll throw you out.

233
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Tuck and roll.

234
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I'm just kidding.

235
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
I can see Act Def sitting there at his keyboard fuming.

236
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
You're just salty, Rob Roberts.

237
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
The salt must flow.

238
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Yes, I am.

239
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,940
Yes, I am salty.

240
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,800
Just dip me in ketchup and feed me to the McDonald's fans.

241
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,240
Speaking of ketchup and food, you did see what I made Friday night as my celebration

242
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,920
of all things American by making Canadian food.

243
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
Oh, you made poutine.

244
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
I made poutine.

245
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Poutine.

246
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,240
It was your like amalgamation of Canada and 4th of July.

247
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,240
It was your...

248
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,640
And then you know what we had on the 4th of July?

249
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
What?

250
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
Panda Express!

251
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Cuz murica.

252
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Cuz murica.

253
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,800
Well, let's be real.

254
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
That ain't Chinese food.

255
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
I know, right?

256
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Oh, don't worry.

257
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,920
There was nothing more murica than me having a burrito for lunch yesterday.

258
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
Geez.

259
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
That was so fun.

260
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Let's see.

261
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,040
Welcome back to our chat room live.vognetwork.com.

262
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,480
ActDeft in chat says, team dog one, deal with it.

263
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
You know what?

264
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,160
I'm gonna give you something to deal with in a minute here.

265
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,800
S2100Matt says, Drew is probably the only 30 year old intern on a gaming podcast.

266
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,920
Is that, is that research?

267
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,920
Is that verifiable?

268
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Can we verify that?

269
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Can we vet that?

270
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Yeah.

271
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Can we vet that?

272
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
I wasn't listening to you.

273
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,000
DarkTetsuya in chat says, yeah, last time Drew was on was episode 417, the ninth anniversary.

274
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,240
Hey, I don't update the Wiki for nothing.

275
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Wow.

276
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,240
DarkTetsuya.

277
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,240
Wow.

278
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
He's, he's like encyclopedia Britannica of this show.

279
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
So you haven't been on the show in about four years.

280
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,640
I'm hoping to make it a little bit more regular, but you know, we never know.

281
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,320
Well, let me, let me level set a bit here.

282
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,380
Cause we do, we do talk about video games here on OLR, believe it or not.

283
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,560
And there's people that, you know, probably never, who is this guy?

284
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,840
Who's this guy you're making jokes with and picking on?

285
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,640
You know, believe it or not, like more people find OLR and actually stick around after they

286
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,260
download an episode or two.

287
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,560
So we have some listeners here that we haven't had, we didn't have four years ago.

288
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,800
So let's reintroduce Drew a little bit to the listeners.

289
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,200
So you're, you're 30 here in the same area where we're at.

290
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,520
What types of video games do you play?

291
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,880
What kind of gamer are you?

292
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,320
Well, primarily these days, well, I've always been a big RPG gamer, um, been dabbling into

293
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,120
final fantasy since, you know, the very start.

294
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,040
So more JRPG stuff, uh, dabbling final fantasy 11 for a while.

295
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,080
Ragnarok online, 14 still play a lot of wow.

296
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,960
Uh, though lately I've been becoming the kind of the stereotypical Atlas nerd real big into

297
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,600
the persona series, but, uh, so you're definitely JRPG.

298
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,280
If you're following Atlas like that, that's usually a sign, right?

299
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Oh yeah.

300
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,260
Edit my seat, waiting for persona five to hit all big tales of fan boy, things like

301
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,260
that.

302
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,720
But, uh, I try to dabble all sorts of stuff.

303
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,800
How many stuffed printies do you own?

304
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,840
Um, just the one actually.

305
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Just one?

306
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Okay.

307
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,200
Uh, you know, collection going, but I, uh, they explode too often, you know, uh, they're

308
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
up to what?

309
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,680
Disgaea five just came out in Japan.

310
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Is that here?

311
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
I can't remember.

312
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Yeah.

313
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,560
I haven't big that been that big into this, uh, Disgaea series, uh, when my strategy fix

314
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,640
had been mostly into Fire Emblem lately.

315
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
Okay.

316
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,000
That game was in the news a lot last week with strategy waifu simulator.

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah.

318
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah.

319
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Okay.

320
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,520
Uh, so you're, you're mostly JRPGs, uh, console favorite console that you play on or are you

321
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,320
more PC, Mac, still kind of evenly split between PC and PS three.

322
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,440
I'm trying to get into PS four and, and, uh, is, is getting more games up there.

323
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,800
I'm probably one of the only people alive that still owns a Vita, but you know, persona.

324
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,680
We're going to talk about that in a little bit, actually you're not, and we'll talk about

325
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:52,120
why in a little bit, but, uh, yeah, just a Mr. RPG still play a few music games, still

326
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:57,760
hyped up for rock band for, uh, whenever they decide to fully release that.

327
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,600
So kind of waiting for the song list, but you know, some of it's creeping out there.

328
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,380
What do you think about the whole fact that you can use your old library with rock band

329
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,380
four?

330
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,380
I think that's rad.

331
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,600
Well, I'd hate to have all that, uh, TLC be for nothing here.

332
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,800
Well, here's the thing.

333
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,800
It was actually, I would say it was about a good 25% of what factored my decision to

334
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,440
finally buy an Xbox one was the fact that all my rock band songs are on three 60 and

335
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,320
they, they will, if you get Xbox one, you will be able to bring in the three 60s library.

336
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,400
That was part of my decision to get a PS four, come to think of it as like, if they decided

337
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,280
to ignore, you know, completely ignore that I'm like, I'd probably be all torches and

338
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,360
pitch pitch works about it.

339
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,320
Um, let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vog network.com, uh, tech 2030 and

340
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,240
chat says, quote, tales of a fan boy.

341
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,520
I already like them.

342
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,640
There it is.

343
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
They like you drew it.

344
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
They really like you.

345
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,120
Um, let's see, what do you mean?

346
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,720
Well, we'll get into your gaming weeks a little later, but, uh, let's talk about some of your

347
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,720
very favorite.

348
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,040
I always like to ask what's like your favorite game of all time period.

349
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
Oh geez.

350
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,080
Um, I'd have to pander to Jamie and probably see it somewhere close to the guardian legend.

351
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Uh, that's pandering to me too, although tales of the abyss comes close.

352
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Okay.

353
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,920
It is almost in all fashion is a perfect RPG.

354
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
All right.

355
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Awesome.

356
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,920
Awesome.

357
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,960
Uh, how did you meet all of us here at OLR?

358
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,600
Oh God, everybody was in the DDR scene over in Roseville and, uh, happened to see you

359
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,400
guys play in DDR one day, uh, went to, uh, went out on vacation in New York, saw this

360
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,160
podcast is like, wait, I know these folks wound up tuning into what was very, very first

361
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,040
episode of OLR.

362
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,560
You, you are part of the circle of 12 you there's, there were 12 people that listened

363
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,880
to the first episode of OLR.

364
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,480
We know dark Tetsuya was one JV Mon was one, and now you're one, I mean, hell I was there

365
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,800
and I wasn't even listening.

366
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
You're not listening now.

367
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,360
So you listen, how else did I respond?

368
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,760
She just selected very, she'll be doing her thing.

369
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,280
Like, you know, I'm typing, I'm typing, I'm typing.

370
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,600
And then just, I randomly will say, and then, Oh man, that really, that moment really sucked

371
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
in dragon age.

372
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
And then she'll perk up.

373
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
What are you talking about?

374
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
About my dragon age.

375
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
What, what, what?

376
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,320
I am not writing fanfiction during the show tonight.

377
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Thank you for the first time.

378
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,040
I'm already three chapters ahead.

379
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,400
She worked at, she worked ahead everybody so she could participate tonight.

380
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Good job.

381
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
All right.

382
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Anyway.

383
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Read my fanfic.

384
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
Damn it.

385
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
All, all, uh, all that joking aside.

386
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
So, okay.

387
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,560
So you discovered our show and you were on the other coast.

388
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Just by coincidence.

389
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Yeah.

390
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,400
I just have to be in, in upstate New York on summer vacation.

391
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,640
I was like, I need something to watch here.

392
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,400
I'm bored out of my skull.

393
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Need something to listen to.

394
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I need something to do.

395
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
I was like, okay, fine.

396
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,880
Well, I, you know, this, this whole live 360, whatever it is site, sure.

397
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,880
I'll go for it.

398
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Yeah.

399
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
Why not?

400
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
And a dial up friendly radio.

401
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
That's what we used to be.

402
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,880
All right.

403
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,240
Uh, before we move on and get into some more modern, what have you been doing this week

404
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,760
in games and in the gaming news for this week?

405
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
One more question.

406
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,040
Since you did mention you were a DDR fan and you, uh, were brought to this show through

407
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,520
all of our mutual love of DDR back in the day, favorite mix and favorite song.

408
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Oh geez.

409
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,280
Don't you pick one only one.

410
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
Oh man.

411
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,960
No ties on the record.

412
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,320
Get the Wiki ready to update.

413
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,160
The thing is, I have to say my favorite song is, is my usual warmup song.

414
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,340
It's why it's, it's on every mix these days.

415
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,720
It's always the first song I play just to get warmed up.

416
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,880
Uh, so fifth mix, which I guess is kind of the black sheep of the series.

417
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,840
You don't see too many machines out there of it.

418
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,040
Uh, but that's why, that's why it's a lot of people's favorite abyss DJ Taka abyss.

419
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Okay.

420
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
That's a good pic.

421
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,600
Low second goes to summer vacation, but that was a 2DX song.

422
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,440
That was a 2DX song.

423
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
That never even made it to DDR.

424
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,080
I think they finally did put it in DDR like way later.

425
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,760
I think it was in like a home version at some point.

426
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,040
So there you go.

427
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
All right.

428
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
Very cool.

429
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,480
Well, Drew, you feel free to pipe in if you need to on the news.

430
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,320
I know we were talking a little bit about, uh, some of the things we're talking about

431
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,320
tonight.

432
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,640
I know you have some things to say as a PC gamer on some of the things going on lately.

433
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,740
So we'll get into some of that.

434
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,740
Feel free to chime in as necessary.

435
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:10,300
Uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com zappy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

436
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,060
says over here in French, Canada, we just had poutine fest this weekend.

437
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,700
I love poutine so much.

438
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,700
Why was I not invited?

439
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
I know.

440
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
Where's our invite zappy?

441
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,700
What's up with that?

442
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Well, you know what?

443
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,340
You know what they had up the hill in Reno?

444
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,940
Cause we almost went to Reno this weekend.

445
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,020
So while they've got poutine fest in Canada, you know what they have in Reno?

446
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,580
Angry I lost all my money fest?

447
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,580
No.

448
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,580
Chicken wing fest.

449
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,580
Right?

450
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,580
Where's my invite?

451
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,580
Jesus.

452
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,580
That's it.

453
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,340
We just need to have like a cooking on the show night and I'll just make poutine.

454
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,340
I love that idea.

455
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,340
That's a great idea.

456
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
Uh, let's see.

457
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,820
I still have a bag of cheese curds at home.

458
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,380
Uh, Ragenator in chat says upstate New York.

459
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
Cool.

460
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,380
I'm from Buffalo.

461
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,380
Uh, it was Watertown at the time out in Fort Drum.

462
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,860
I have no idea where those places are.

463
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,580
I went to Poughkeepsie for like three days.

464
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,060
We'll just say Southern Canada.

465
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Okay.

466
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
That's pretty much what it was.

467
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,700
It was like 20 miles to the border.

468
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,180
Did you go to poutine fest?

469
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,540
I wish.

470
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Poutine's awesome.

471
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,540
All right.

472
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,180
Uh, let's get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games that you have

473
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,780
been playing this week.

474
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,780
Dark soccer.

475
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,780
We'll start with you.

476
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,780
You had a pretty big week, huh?

477
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,780
Kinda.

478
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,860
Well, he just fixed my computer today.

479
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:22,180
Um, Dragon Age Inquisition broke my computer kinda and now it's fixed before like my fans

480
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,380
would just kick in like blah.

481
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,420
So we put in four more fans and doubled my ram and now my computer is like, Oh, I love

482
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,540
Dragon Age Inquisition.

483
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,020
How quaint.

484
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,900
And no problem at all.

485
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,660
Um, I actually did log in a little bit for Final Fantasy 14.

486
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,380
Um, I'm going to be trying to set at least a night a week to do my progression stuff.

487
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,900
Um, and we got a PS4 this week.

488
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:54,080
So Dan's been playing Battlemon and I very, very, very much have decided that the next

489
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,300
game that I'm going to get is going to be Puyo Puyo Tetris, but I, um, probably going

490
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,100
to have to wait until a couple of weeks before I order it from Playage or something.

491
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,540
But I really, really, really, really, really, really, really want Puyo Puyo Tetris because

492
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,700
it's fucking Puyo Puyo and Tetris.

493
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,940
And then I've been like polling people for other good games and I don't know, cause people

494
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,100
keep mentioning genre that I'm not really a big fan of.

495
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,380
Like I don't like a lot of first person shooters and I don't like a lot of games that have

496
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:29,820
a lot of crazy ass motion in it cause I will throw up on people.

497
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,880
I think, uh, I, I use, you asked this on Twitter, which you're using Twitter again.

498
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
What is up with that?

499
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
I know.

500
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
I just decided to.

501
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,720
You got to get, get with the cool kids on Twitter.

502
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,720
We're super cool.

503
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,780
I was, no, cause I did my hipster thing for a while and didn't want to be on Twitter cause

504
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,780
it was too mainstream.

505
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,780
Mm hmm.

506
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
Well, welcome to the mainstream.

507
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,780
I was on Tumblr.

508
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,820
Do, uh, now Tumblr, Yahoo owns Tumblr.

509
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,820
Tell me that ain't mainstream.

510
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,820
Yeah.

511
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
And then I went on Ello.

512
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,380
Anyway, uh, I think Flaco Jones had some really good suggestions for you, especially, and

513
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,700
I really have to recommend for you in particular velocity two X, I think is a really good pick

514
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,140
because you know, we, we joke about our love of the guardian legend, but it's actually

515
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,140
not a joke.

516
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,140
We really love that game.

517
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,140
And velocity two X.

518
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,380
The only kind of difference is instead of being, it obviously has the shooter bits,

519
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,580
but then instead of being like an RPG over the shoulder type of thing, it's more like

520
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,740
a platformer in that part.

521
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,640
Otherwise it's, it's very similar.

522
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,740
So is that like just online only?

523
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,740
Yeah.

524
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,300
It's like an online $10 download type of thing.

525
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Okay.

526
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
Yeah.

527
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,660
It's like PlayStation four, but I think velocity two X is on like steam and I think it's one

528
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
of those.

529
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
It's multi it's all over the place.

530
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,660
I have to check that out.

531
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
Yeah.

532
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,660
Yeah.

533
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,660
I think you'd like that too.

534
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,660
And that's an indie game.

535
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,840
So I don't feel bad about whoring it for free here on the show.

536
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:46,240
So well, I've, I've been trying to think of like more actual disc based games to add to

537
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,240
the collection.

538
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,780
Cause I mean, we only have Batman right now and a few things that were, and I was so angry

539
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:59,820
because PT was sitting there in my library online and I'm like, you bastards, somebody

540
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,820
will feed.

541
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,740
That's going to be the thing that gets people to hack a PS four.

542
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,740
Just wait.

543
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,740
Yeah.

544
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,500
If it's not already doable to put PT on there somehow, but I, but I think we're pretty much

545
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,220
decided it's going to be Puyo Puyo Tetris is the next game we want.

546
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,220
So there you go.

547
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,220
All right.

548
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,260
Well, congratulations on the new PS four.

549
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,980
Just if you have PS plus stay on top of that and download your free games cause like velocity

550
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,240
was a free game at one point.

551
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,920
So Dan's doing it on his account and we're just going to add mine as a secondary.

552
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Good.

553
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
Smart.

554
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,440
Um, Dan's is gun star.

555
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,960
Mine is dark Sakura, O R. Is there an underscore or anything?

556
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Nope.

557
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,680
I need to add you if I ever sign into it.

558
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,320
Oh, do it for me.

559
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
Dark soccer.

560
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Do it for me.

561
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
I'll do it for the children.

562
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,320
All right.

563
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Just, just do it.

564
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,400
Don't let your dreams be dreams.

565
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
I will.

566
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Don't dream it.

567
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
And be it.

568
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Let's move on to tech master Loki.

569
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
How was your gaming week?

570
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Um, it was okay.

571
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
I mostly worked on my game.

572
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,680
Um, but I did play a few things, uh, one being, which is, I'm actually playing right now.

573
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,560
Portal stories, Mel.

574
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:09,320
It's like a free to, uh, free to download if you have, um, portal to, um, expansion

575
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:16,580
or a fan made game, I guess this is what people do when valve is allergic to the number three

576
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,580
type of thing.

577
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,580
Yeah.

578
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,660
So it's like a side story type thing.

579
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,800
It's another test subject that was testing the sleep chambers and of course the sleep

580
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,580
chambers didn't work right.

581
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:31,660
And so she's in the future now and it's hilarious because you know, they've got it, all of it's

582
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,660
voice acted.

583
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,340
They have cave Johnson in there, but you know, another person doing his voice and then they

584
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,840
have another, um, personality sphere that's helping me along and it's just got that same

585
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,780
type of humor, but the puzzles are really damn hard.

586
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,460
So just keep that in mind.

587
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,980
It's kind of nice though, as you get to actually see the outside of like, uh, aperture science,

588
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
which is kind of cool.

589
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,420
So you get to wander around through that.

590
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,160
Um, but yes, the puzzles are damn hard.

591
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,940
So just keep that in mind.

592
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:06,140
Sounds to me like they got Mel from the original second player for co-op mode.

593
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,380
Possibly.

594
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,980
I don't know what the story is behind that.

595
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,840
Um, and then the other thing I played was called the do modern warfare two because my,

596
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:19,880
my old coworkers want to play and so I played just like old times.

597
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Yep.

598
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,800
And I beat him just like old times.

599
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Keep them in their place.

600
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Loki.

601
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,800
Yeah.

602
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,920
So they're like, well, we were having fun until you came make, make them remember why

603
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,560
they didn't want to play with you anymore.

604
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Exactly.

605
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,360
Well, they just have to bring their ringers with them and then, then they actually, I

606
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,240
have a hard time keeping up with them because you know, it's wow.

607
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Love it.

608
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
All right.

609
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,160
Uh, if that's it for your gaming week, I think that's it.

610
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,560
Then, uh, Drew, how about you?

611
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,560
How was your game?

612
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,720
I've been all over the place.

613
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:54,080
Um, been mostly focused on PC this week was really struggling to enjoy a certain PC game

614
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,400
that shall remain nameless for right now.

615
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,920
But barring that I switched over to my 3DS.

616
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,920
You can, we talked a little bit about this last week.

617
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Yeah.

618
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,760
A few optimization woes as Arkham Knight.

619
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,720
We'll put it like that, um, switched my 3DS for a while, knocked out a little bit of persona

620
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,400
queue, a little dungeon diving there.

621
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Hold on.

622
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Let me back you up.

623
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,800
Cause I, I just have to, cause you know, when we were reporting on the, the, uh, Arkham

624
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,040
Knight stuff last year, I shouldn't say reporting, but discussing the Arkham Knight stuff last

625
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,080
week, cause we don't break news.

626
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,640
We just try to fix it.

627
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,640
Um, we were talking about the Arkham Knight woes, but to be fair, I haven't played it

628
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
on PC.

629
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,880
I don't think either of my co-hosts have.

630
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,120
How bad is it Drew?

631
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
Oh God.

632
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:39,040
Uh, I can turn V-Sync off and get 25 frames usually.

633
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,920
I don't have a modest system.

634
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,080
Uh, the minute I turn V-Sync on, five frames per second.

635
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,600
So that's the biggest problem is just the frame rate is shit.

636
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Yeah.

637
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
Frame rate is absolute crap.

638
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,200
Uh, the game itself is fun.

639
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
It's just the specs and optimization.

640
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,360
It was a shitty port.

641
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,200
But it's like one of those old flip books where you flip through the pictures.

642
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Exactly.

643
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,280
It's like, I'm not, I'm not terribly pissed off about it.

644
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,520
I can wait, but I'd rather not have to.

645
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,760
But uh, you know, after struggling with that and trying to find things to make it work

646
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,360
better, I decided to just grab my 3DS, play a little Persona Q, uh, try and finally finish

647
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,480
Fire Emblem Awakening.

648
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,800
I keep on getting distracted, uh, got in some MKX even though I kind of suck at it and started

649
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:29,060
playing probably one of the most beautiful games I've ever played in my life, uh, courtesy

650
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,060
of Steam.

651
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,680
Cause usually it's, uh, otherwise be a, uh, Xbox one exclusive, uh, Ori and the Blind

652
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Forest.

653
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,000
Oh, I've heard a lot of good things about this game.

654
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,680
Uh, Xtifer, uh, my buddy Xtifer is a big fan of this.

655
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,600
It is an absolutely beautiful metroidvania.

656
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Hmm.

657
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,360
And I'm really looking forward to, you know, getting some more abilities there and kind

658
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,600
of blast my way through the game and kind of seeing all the scenery.

659
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,600
Excellent.

660
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,720
All right, well have fun with it.

661
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,320
So you're playing that on Steam, not X, oh you don't own Xbox one.

662
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,760
I don't own Xbox one, I'm, I'm firmly in the Sony camp at this point.

663
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,440
No ill will towards Xbox, I'm just kind of in the little Sony ecosystem right now.

664
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,480
It's expensive to have both.

665
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
Trust me.

666
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,680
Cause I just, I just finally got the Xbox one and it's a little, a little expensive.

667
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
It's expensive.

668
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Happy, expensive.

669
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Happy.

670
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,680
Anyway.

671
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
Um, Mikey Mueg.

672
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,840
Uh, so, okay, here's a funny story.

673
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,360
So Drew mentioned a minute ago that he's one of the few like people that like still owns

674
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Evita.

675
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,360
Right.

676
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,360
So here's the thing.

677
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,040
Um, I had a birthday, uh, around the same time that OLR did.

678
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,000
And um, you know, I don't, I don't expect that I'm going to get a lot of presents or

679
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
whatever.

680
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,440
I'm not usually like big on the whole, like expecting gifts and all that stuff.

681
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,880
Uh, but especially with somebody like Alan, uh, we don't oftentimes really know what to

682
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
get each other.

683
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,920
We're at a fortunate enough place in our lives where we want something, we just kind of go

684
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,920
get it.

685
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,880
And our tastes are like, I'm not saying like we're rich or anything.

686
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,120
We don't get to do extravagant things, but for the most part of the things that we need,

687
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,080
we kind of are able to take care of.

688
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,680
So it makes it very hard to be able to buy presents for each other.

689
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:08,680
In fact, the funny part of that is that, um, the first gift that Alan actually bought

690
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,480
for me was a Ness Amiibo because he knew that I was kicking and screaming about that whole

691
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,560
GameStop preorder thing was bullshit and I want a Ness Amiibo and I'm just going to preorder

692
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,320
one from Japan or whatever.

693
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,680
So he actually went onto one of those auction things and paid the money to get me a Ness

694
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:29,300
Amiibo only to find out that I was able to get one on Playasia and I also got a Ness

695
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,300
Amiibo.

696
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
And then Shane got one too.

697
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,580
I was getting like three Ness Amiibo.

698
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,820
So oops on that.

699
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,940
So Alan had to go back to the drawing board and figure out what's he going to get me that

700
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,740
I'm definitely not going to buy for myself.

701
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:49,060
So you can imagine my shock when Monday the gift arrived and I opened it up and Alan had

702
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:53,620
bought me because I had made a comment once about, Oh my God, that's so gorgeous.

703
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,620
I want that.

704
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,620
Oh my God.

705
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,620
But that's going to be expensive.

706
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:05,180
You know, uh, Alan bought me the Heavensward PlayStation Vita from Japan imported.

707
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,300
So here it is right here and it's one of the 2.0 models and you can see, so it's a little

708
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,340
lighter and thinner and uh, if you want to mess around with this just so you can see

709
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,340
how it feels.

710
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,340
I will fight you for that.

711
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,000
No, you will not have the original model, but you can see there on the back, it's got

712
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,820
like the Heavensward decorations and then it actually came with a Heavensward theme.

713
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,880
So if I actually turned it on here a little bit, you can actually see the little splash

714
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,860
screen is the Heavensward, like a little screen.

715
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,940
Then when you open it up, it actually plays music from the game.

716
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,420
So you know what, Rob?

717
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,420
It's rad.

718
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,420
Like I'm not even going to lie.

719
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
This thing is rad.

720
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,300
This kind of makes this sort of system cousins because I have the WonderSwan color for Final

721
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,500
Fantasy.

722
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,220
Our WonderSwan and our PlayStation Vita are distantly related.

723
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,620
Yeah, they're distantly related.

724
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,620
Yeah.

725
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,060
And now I get to loan you a buttload of games for Vita.

726
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,060
I'm excited.

727
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,060
Well, here's the thing.

728
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,140
Okay, but here's the thing, Drew.

729
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,780
I already own a PlayStation Vita American.

730
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,400
I bought one of the earlier models.

731
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,580
So this is not the first one you had.

732
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,580
Not the first one.

733
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:15,220
So you might be one of the few people that actually owns a Vita.

734
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,660
And you're one of the few people that own two.

735
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,660
That owns two.

736
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,460
And you're going to lend one to Jamie.

737
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,140
And the market just doubled.

738
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,700
Thank you, Sony.

739
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Here's what I did.

740
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,980
I'm actually very proud of myself for figuring out how to do this.

741
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,980
I used to...

742
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,980
I didn't do it all myself.

743
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,980
I used tutorials and stuff.

744
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,420
But I actually went online.

745
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,600
I registered a Japanese account.

746
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,300
And that's a Japanese region or whatever, PlayStation Vita.

747
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,380
And I figured out how to redeem the code for Heaven's Word so I could actually get that

748
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,900
theme or whatever.

749
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,900
So I'm actually very proud of myself.

750
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,260
So now that is my Japanese system.

751
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,780
And then the other one is my American system.

752
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,740
Because you know the Vita is way better supported in Japan than it is here anyway.

753
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,540
And I'm looking in the store and I'm like, I want Taiko no Tatujin.

754
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,540
They have that for the Vita?

755
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,900
I'm like, I'm going to get that.

756
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,560
And then there's all sorts of other games as well.

757
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,780
So now I just have to get a card that has money on it.

758
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:06,500
So I'll just get one of those from Playasia or whatever.

759
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,420
Anyway, Alan wants to say a little something about the Heaven's Word Vita.

760
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,660
He's here at the studio.

761
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:14,940
It also comes with a very pretty box that we get to show off.

762
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,700
Which I brought into studio.

763
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,380
And also, don't expect anything like that for Christmas.

764
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:28,060
It's not that I don't care about Christmas, but it's a different holiday to me.

765
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,740
And since we both have summer birthdays, if I'm going to spoil the shit out of you, the

766
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,380
birthday is the big one for Christmas.

767
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,860
I'll just get you like a Target card or something.

768
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,340
At least he's honest.

769
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,340
That's all.

770
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,340
My favorite.

771
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,700
First, he brought the box in to show off on the radio show.

772
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,500
Just so y'all know, anyway.

773
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,580
But also, here's the other thing I love about it is that Alan told me.

774
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:55,140
He said, you know, a part of that gift, just so you know, is the insane amount of jealousy

775
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,060
that Shayna's going to have towards you because I got you that.

776
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,340
You know what else I think is funny is that Heaven's Word isn't on Vita.

777
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,940
Yeah, right?

778
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,140
They have a whole Heaven's Word Vita and Heaven's Word isn't even on Vita.

779
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,460
But certainly the PlayStation 4 Remote Play, a lot of people are doing the crafting and

780
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,180
gathering on the Vita from PlayStation 4.

781
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,980
So that's kind of a little thing.

782
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,340
Ladies and gentlemen of the internet, please feel free to use your imaginations on that

783
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,340
box.

784
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,340
Right?

785
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,700
It's just got butts and dicks all over it.

786
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,820
No, it does not have butts and dicks.

787
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,820
I could take a picture.

788
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,300
It can have butts and dicks on it in a few minutes.

789
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,940
I don't even want to think about that.

790
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,940
Excuse me.

791
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
I have to leave the room and heave.

792
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:37,140
SSG100Matt in chat over at live.vognetware.com says, no, no, no, Shayna will be like, whatever.

793
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,340
No, I think this one actually did get a response out of him.

794
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,940
It was more like, I hate you and that type of thing.

795
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,940
Act Deaf degrees.

796
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,820
I do want Taiko no Tatsujin Vita though.

797
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,820
Yeah.

798
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,660
I'm like, I don't want that.

799
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,140
That'd be awesome.

800
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,560
So anyhow, other games that I played besides messing around with the new system.

801
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:02,220
Thank you, Alan, for the new Vita that I said I wanted and didn't actually think I'd get.

802
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,620
That's awesome.

803
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,540
I was still playing around with the Xbox One a little bit, playing more Forza Horizon 2,

804
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:13,300
which I have to voice something that kind of ticked me off about Horizon 2 as much as

805
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,300
I love the game.

806
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,940
And it's a solid racer.

807
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,060
And having also played Drive Club a little bit this week.

808
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,060
Here we go.

809
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,060
No, I'm sorry.

810
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,660
Forza Horizon 2 is just like probably the best racing game right now.

811
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,660
It really is.

812
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,420
Until maybe there's a new burnout to try and challenge it or something.

813
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:32,180
I really think Forza Horizon 2 is like the best racing game right now.

814
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:37,420
But here's the thing that ticked me off about it is that, okay, so I'm doing a race and

815
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,420
what have you.

816
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:43,220
So I finish up the sequence of races and then suddenly it cuts away to a trailer and I'm

817
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,420
like, oh, it's like another one of those in-game cutscenes where it's going to be this

818
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,580
whole bad Fast and Furious thing where the guy's going to tell me to go to a new city.

819
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,860
And it's like, this island just opened up and we have to go and there's all new races

820
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,620
and da-da-da-da-da and all this stuff.

821
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,460
It's a fucking ad for their DLC, the Storm Island DLC or whatever.

822
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,060
And so at the end of this, just woven right into the gameplay trailer that they do, they're

823
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,100
like, press Y now to buy it for $20.

824
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:13,180
And I'm like, as interested as I am in something like that, I will clear the base game.

825
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,620
Then I'll buy an expansion thing.

826
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,900
I'm not going to buy the expansion until I finish the base game.

827
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,900
No, no, no.

828
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
Buy our shit now.

829
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,900
Don't wait.

830
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Do it now.

831
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,060
No, as, but here, as if that wasn't good enough.

832
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,760
So I hit no, thank you.

833
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,540
And so it gives me the next mission and programs into the GPS where to go next.

834
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,540
I'm like, all right.

835
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:35,080
So I drive and I'm driving to the harbor and I'm like, why is the goal point that I'm driving

836
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,900
to the Storm Island Harbor?

837
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,660
I get to the harbor and I press X to finish the mission or whatever.

838
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:47,220
And it said, you can deport or you can depart for Storm Island now by spending $19.99.

839
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,700
I'm like, really?

840
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,300
This fucking game just made it a mission for me to go and like spend the money.

841
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,660
And so I, I did what any gamer would do in this day and age.

842
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,340
I went on Twitter and I wrote some angry things.

843
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,860
But did you throw your controller?

844
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,500
No, God, those controls are expensive.

845
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,060
Are you fucking kidding me?

846
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,940
That's not what we, that's, that's what happened, Drew, that's what happened.

847
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,460
We don't, we don't throw controllers anymore.

848
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,920
We go on Twitter and say something mean.

849
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,400
That's what we do is that's what I did.

850
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,660
I went on Twitter and I said something mean, and then I got it out of my system.

851
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,020
So there it is.

852
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:24,840
I was just a little irritated, a lot of irritated that Forza Horizon.

853
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,100
Outside of that, I still love the game.

854
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,680
But seriously, stop shoving that DLC down our throats.

855
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,020
It's tacky.

856
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:36,860
Like I get, if you want to put in the menu, a little banner now available, or even if

857
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,300
on the little radio station, a DJ comes on and says, Hey, check out the store.

858
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
There's some new DLC.

859
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,060
Like I understand, but like to like go so far as to make it the next mission for me

860
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,060
to do.

861
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Yeah.

862
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,060
That won't be breaking immersion or anything.

863
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
Hey, there's DLC on the store.

864
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,620
Oh my, that was just so tacky.

865
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,420
Oh, like an interruption of your mission isn't immersion breaking as it is?

866
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Yeah.

867
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,200
Weiland in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, I do like storm Island though.

868
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,900
It's the only DLC I bought for the game.

869
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,780
I'm sure it's amazing.

870
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:08,620
But my whole thing is that I don't want to go and spend more money to extend the game

871
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,340
when I have barely scratched the surface of the game to be in with.

872
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,060
Like I've still got like a hundred races I got to do in the game.

873
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,140
I've got plenty to do without the DLC.

874
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,140
That's my whole thing.

875
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,740
When I get through all that, will I probably end up getting storm Island?

876
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,060
Yeah, probably.

877
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:27,500
So Bobby Black Wolf says, for most people, that storm Island cut scene showed up well

878
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,340
after you beat the game because of the timing, but yeah, that sounds like bad timing.

879
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,340
That's a good point.

880
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,180
I'm probably seeing this where I'm seeing it and a lot of other people are like, what

881
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,180
is wrong?

882
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,180
Rob?

883
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,180
I didn't see anything like that.

884
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:41,360
Well, keep in mind, I just bought an Xbox one, what, two weeks ago.

885
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,420
So I'm just experiencing all this for the first time.

886
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,500
So it's a little different for me.

887
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,660
It's like people that played mass effect three and never had to see that original ending

888
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,260
like dark soccer is raising her hand.

889
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,300
Original ending angst was never a thing for her.

890
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,300
Anyway.

891
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,300
Nope.

892
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,300
I live a happy, sheltered life.

893
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,300
There you go.

894
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Uh, let's see.

895
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,860
Also I've been playing, of course, a lot of heaven's word.

896
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,380
Uh, I just did the Bismarck fight today.

897
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:09,460
That was fun, even though it was a cluster, but, Oh, the soundtrack is so good.

898
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:15,140
Like I know people associate Square Enix with no bully Matsu and with good reason, cause

899
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,960
that man does a lot of great, great work and has done just legendary, uh, historical great

900
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,760
video game tracks of all time.

901
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,440
But I'm telling you, Soken is a real worthy successor over at Square.

902
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,220
That man does brilliant work with Final Fantasy 14.

903
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,880
That soundtrack is so stinking good.

904
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,780
Uh, if you haven't checked it out, uh, check out the final fantasy 14 soundtrack heaven's

905
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
word and the base game.

906
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,560
They're both amazing.

907
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,260
And uh, it's, it's not no bully Matsu, although nobody Matsu did like a theme for heaven's

908
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
word.

909
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,740
And, and probably that theme is, is heard in a lot of the others.

910
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:50,480
I really think Soken deserves a big, big, big, a bunch of credit for his work.

911
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,160
Maybe it's just the nostalgia talking, but when I think final fantasy MMOs, I still can't

912
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,780
get the vanity or March out of my head.

913
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,780
You know what?

914
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,460
And Final Fantasy 11 was great for what it is too, but you want to talk about like fan

915
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:06,680
service and all this 14 does such a good job of referencing other final fantasy games without

916
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,960
necessarily like going over the top with it.

917
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,540
Like they actually weave magitech armor, moogles, chocobos, and all that stuff like into the

918
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,180
story without it being like crazy.

919
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,060
Um, and then like the story in 14 is really good.

920
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,940
This expansion has a really good story that's worthy of final fantasy.

921
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,340
I'm probably going to need to check it out.

922
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,540
I wound up taking a scholar to 50, almost got through the main story, found out that

923
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,540
I need to raid all over again.

924
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,140
I'm like, I have wow for this.

925
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,900
I'm not going to do this again and just up and quit.

926
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,300
I'll give it another shot.

927
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,460
Hopefully it'll be a little bit more friendly to us.

928
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,500
Oh God, I'm a casual now.

929
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,140
What am I saying?

930
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,860
Well it's interesting because they made a controversial decision where heavens where

931
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,620
I want to keep this brief because I want to get into other games.

932
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,720
I've talked a lot about how 14 on the show, but they made a controversial decision where

933
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,880
unlike wow, all of the expansion content is in heaven's word, including the new jobs.

934
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,960
So if you want to go play a machinist or a, uh, uh, astrologian or a dark knight or whatever,

935
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,920
you have to go to Ishgard, the new city to unlock it, which is actually, that is what

936
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,400
they did in final fantasy 11.

937
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
So it's not exactly new for square to do that.

938
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,760
I remember my paladin quest.

939
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Hell yeah.

940
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,520
But what is a little weird is that in order to get to Ishgard, you have to completely

941
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,940
finish the story of realm reborn.

942
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,100
So you will not be able to go to the new stuff until you finish the old stuff.

943
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,600
And from a story perspective, like the more I'm playing heaven's word, I get it.

944
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,660
The end of the story of realm reborn is very important for what happens in heaven's word,

945
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,660
critically important.

946
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:38,260
So from that end I get it, but I can see where it also turned off people that kind of slept

947
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,060
on the game for six months that want to get back in and join their friends.

948
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,180
It's like, Oh, I'm going to be a step behind another step behind because I have to beat

949
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,420
all this stuff first.

950
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,580
But you get experience now for doing all of your raids.

951
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,100
Yeah, that is, that is kind of the, okay.

952
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:59,180
So at least now what they did do is that all the story content now gives you not only experience

953
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,900
so that you'll be a leg up when you get into heaven's word, but it also gives you gear

954
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,900
now, I hear.

955
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,460
So that way you don't have to go in and do the raids to gear, to gear score up.

956
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,500
You'll get it naturally through the story.

957
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,860
So at least they lessened the blow a little bit.

958
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,820
I'm still trying to work on all the poetics so, cause now it's no longer the soldiery

959
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
tomes.

960
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,820
It's poetics.

961
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,820
Yep.

962
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,820
And now it's law.

963
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,380
This is in heaven's word, but anyway, uh, so that's enough about that.

964
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:29,740
Uh, I also want to briefly mention, so I played clicker heroes this week a lot.

965
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,540
In fact, Drew, have you played this game is crack.

966
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,540
Yes.

967
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,540
It is crap.

968
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,380
Like at least 30, 300,000 souls.

969
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,380
Do you really?

970
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,380
Oh my God.

971
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,500
I think I'm only on like my 12th ascension, but still, here's the thing.

972
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
Here's what's big.

973
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Y'all.

974
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,500
This is why I bring it up.

975
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,100
I played clicker heroes this week.

976
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,240
Please don't say you bought rubies.

977
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
Please don't say about rubies.

978
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,540
I spent $10 on rubies.

979
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,540
No!

980
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,100
Is there no God?

981
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,660
I spent money on a free to play game, but this is why I did it.

982
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,900
I did it for the sole reason that I felt the developers deserved a little bit of my money

983
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,100
because I was going to say, I thought it was because of steam trading cards.

984
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,460
No, no, no.

985
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,620
I didn't realize that till after the fact that I was like, Ooh, I got a steam trading

986
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,460
card out of it.

987
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,020
But no, I did it because I felt, you know, with all the hours I've sunk into clicker

988
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:25,020
heroes, even if passively, because I'll run clicker heroes in the background while I'm

989
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:28,900
playing Final Fantasy.

990
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,300
I felt that with all the time I've sunk into that, they deserve a little bit of money.

991
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,580
So I tossed them $10 and I bought the rubies and bought like the permanent double damage

992
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,500
thing or whatever it is they're selling.

993
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,260
So there it is.

994
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:43,220
I spent real money on a free to play game, but they deserve it.

995
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,220
You sold out.

996
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,220
They deserve it.

997
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,220
Come on.

998
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,540
This isn't candy crush or some shit.

999
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,180
It's clicker heroes and they deserve it.

1000
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
Come on.

1001
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,180
All right.

1002
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,180
Fair.

1003
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,180
I'm just giving you a hard time.

1004
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,180
I know you are.

1005
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,180
By the way.

1006
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,180
I do remember another game I played.

1007
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,180
Hmm.

1008
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,180
Very solitaire.

1009
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,180
Oh jeez.

1010
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
When, when my.

1011
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,180
Our soccer's favorite game of all time.

1012
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:06,580
No, I, it was the only thing that I trusted my computer to run until I got it fixed.

1013
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,100
It could run clicker heroes.

1014
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,260
I will not play it.

1015
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,260
I will not.

1016
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,260
You don't.

1017
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,260
Don't get sucked in.

1018
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,260
It plays itself.

1019
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,300
I won't touch it.

1020
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,300
All right.

1021
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,300
Bobby.

1022
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,300
That's what she said about mass effect.

1023
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,300
Wants people.

1024
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,300
All right.

1025
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,300
Bobby black said mass effect is a good game.

1026
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,380
Bobby black Wolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, who is this person

1027
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,140
that person that is hosting a well R it is not sky.

1028
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,740
Uh, tech 2030 says you can totally hack the game to get rubies by the way.

1029
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,740
Haha.

1030
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,860
That's what mean people do.

1031
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,820
That is what mean people do.

1032
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,820
I'm looking at low case.

1033
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
I don't know what you mean.

1034
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,820
Yeah.

1035
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,820
Right.

1036
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,300
Uh, I don't have the game to get rubies.

1037
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,460
Kaijuto says, I've never even heard of that game.

1038
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,700
It sounds awful.

1039
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:52,020
If you played the steam summer game, uh, summers, if you played the steam summer sale game,

1040
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:57,820
it's a lot like that only, uh, it actually works and you don't get anything out of it

1041
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,820
whatsoever.

1042
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,660
You don't get anything out of it whatsoever.

1043
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,140
So except I don't know, achievements, steam achievements.

1044
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:05,140
That's it.

1045
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,580
Uh, fifth dreaming on chat says, God damn it.

1046
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,100
You're making me play clicker heroes now.

1047
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,240
I'm sorry.

1048
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,800
I apologize in advance for that.

1049
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,520
SSG100 Matt says, I'm too afraid to play clicker heroes and with good reason.

1050
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,040
Let's be real.

1051
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,240
All right.

1052
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,480
That's going to do it for our gaming week.

1053
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,680
Uh, some quick housekeeping, twitter.com slash OLR, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

1054
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,520
and google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

1055
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,200
Um, I want to address one other quick thing here real quick.

1056
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,400
I wasn't sure if I wanted to like say a lot about this cause it has to do with another

1057
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,560
show, but um, I just want to make sure I'm, I'm very clear on, on some things here before

1058
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,240
rumors start and that whole thing.

1059
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,360
Um, so as some of you all saw on twitter, there was a decision made this week to put

1060
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,880
my other show, uh, that I cohost with extfer and grandpa on Wednesdays, a horde house on

1061
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,520
a hiatus for a while.

1062
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,840
Um, and there's nothing wrong.

1063
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:59,640
We didn't all get into like a bust up fight or anything like that.

1064
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,760
Um, you know, uh, if you've been following horde house, you know that extrovert took

1065
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,320
a break a couple months ago, uh, because he needed to focus on some things, IRL and so

1066
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
on.

1067
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,400
Um, I think I kind of, kind of got to a similar point in this last week where I wanted to

1068
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,080
focus on some different things for a little bit.

1069
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:20,520
I have a lot going on that I don't talk about here on OLR because it's none of y'all business.

1070
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,720
It has nothing to do with video games, um, but it was impacting, you know, what I was

1071
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,040
doing on weeknights and so forth.

1072
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,080
So long, long story short, um, I just, I just kind of had to put horde house on hold for

1073
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,800
a little bit so I could focus on some other things, but you guys all know, I think grandpa

1074
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,800
is very talented as I do extra for our both very talented folks.

1075
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,400
Uh, Shane was a great asset to that show for the time he was there as well.

1076
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Um, but even I got to a point, I think even Shane did where it was like, you know, talking

1077
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,440
about all these MMOs, like it's, it's hard when there's only one I'm really invested

1078
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,520
in right now.

1079
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,280
And I think that's kind of the point I got to is that, you know, I love the world of

1080
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,280
Warcraft community.

1081
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,960
Um, there's some great people.

1082
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,080
I've met some friends for life through that community.

1083
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,520
I don't care about your game anymore.

1084
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,420
That's my honest, like, sorry if that really sticks you, but it's like, it's really hard

1085
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:14,000
for me to feign this enthusiasm about world of Warcraft.

1086
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,360
And I felt like we still had a big audience that was kind of holding onto that a little

1087
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,360
bit.

1088
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,520
And I kind of feel like every week I'm faking it and letting you down.

1089
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,040
So that's part of what played into the reason a little bit as well.

1090
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,040
Anyhow.

1091
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,500
Uh, grandpa of course, still on star board, power coupling extra for still doing his thing

1092
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,500
over on Twitch.

1093
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,300
And, um, you know, Shane comes on this show sometimes, I don't know what projects he'll

1094
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:42,180
go into in the future, but I imagine some of us will reform and do another project again

1095
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,860
at a later date, maybe after the summer and some IRL things calm down a little bit.

1096
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:51,820
Uh, so I just wanted to address that and make sure there were no rumors that people were

1097
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,660
fighting or quitting or whatever.

1098
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,660
So there it is.

1099
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:00,940
There's my very honest answer as to why Horde house ended right there on the table for now.

1100
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:05,380
Um, and it may come back, you know, I may just rediscover my love of MMOs.

1101
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,620
And if grandpa and extra for both in the same boat, then we might say, let's do a Horde

1102
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,620
house again.

1103
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,780
But if not, we'll probably say, let's take all this energy creatively that we do and

1104
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,700
the chemistry that we have between us and, and grandpa riffing on me and extra for talking

1105
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,260
about nonsensical things and all that.

1106
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:22,740
And let's do this other project and we'll probably do that instead.

1107
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,960
So there it is.

1108
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,960
It's weird.

1109
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,540
Cause I, I'm not used to podcasts ending.

1110
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:34,300
I don't know what to say about it because this one seems like it's never going to like

1111
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,300
you better not be.

1112
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,300
I know.

1113
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,300
I'm like, no, no, no, no.

1114
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,300
I'm not.

1115
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,300
I wouldn't rebel rebel rebel.

1116
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:44,420
It's I find to the timing of a Sunday night show is a lot easier on me than a Wednesday

1117
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:49,060
night show because with Sunday it's like I've had the whole weekend for RNR to relax and

1118
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,260
rest up and you know, be ready to do it.

1119
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,980
Whereas on Wednesday it's like I just got home from work and I got to roll over and

1120
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,980
do a show.

1121
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,840
So it's, it's harder.

1122
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,900
It's much harder to do one on a Wednesday night.

1123
00:44:58,940 --> 00:44:59,940
All right.

1124
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,940
So there you go.

1125
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:02,940
Let's move on.

1126
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,940
Let's get into some gaming news.

1127
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,940
Shall we?

1128
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,820
Uh, Loki start us off tonight with some video game news.

1129
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,820
All right.

1130
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:10,780
So there's the rumor of course.

1131
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,940
Um, well we know that Nintendo is working on another system.

1132
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,980
Um, no, it's going to be out probably soon, maybe next year.

1133
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,820
The rumor is now that it's supposed to be out in July of 2016.

1134
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,820
Where's this rumor coming from?

1135
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:29,740
Well, it's coming from the report that apparently they've been visiting with, uh, supply chain

1136
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:37,460
partners and, um, are looking to submit orders on February or March, 2016.

1137
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,260
And I think this also comes, if I remember correctly, I think Foxconn won a bid or something

1138
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,660
for manufacturing the system.

1139
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:50,940
And so somehow they've, uh, extrapolated that it's going to be coming out maybe July, 2016.

1140
00:45:50,940 --> 00:46:00,300
I would hope, just me, that Nintendo reflecting on past, you know, launches and how they've

1141
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:06,180
been a clusterfuck as far as, oh, shortages, shortages that they just realize, Hey, you

1142
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,180
know what?

1143
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,940
Let's take the extra months and release a holiday.

1144
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,140
But you know, with a better name, please.

1145
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,540
Well, NX is not the name.

1146
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,540
It's not the name.

1147
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,540
No, no, no, no, no.

1148
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,180
With a better name than what they had so far.

1149
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,180
Yeah, yeah.

1150
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,020
Let's not come up with some stupid, like Wii again.

1151
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,180
I, well, I, I kind of think, here's the thing.

1152
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,300
I think Wii really worked for them.

1153
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:34,620
I know it was, I know, haha, PP, Wii, Wii, but Wii U, I don't think worked for them because

1154
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,140
too many people thought, you know, remember when it even, they went on, he went on Jimmy

1155
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:43,620
Kimmel or one of those late night shows and yeah, the, the guy thought it was, it's an

1156
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,620
add on for the Wii, right?

1157
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,620
And no, no, no.

1158
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:49,500
I think that was the real naming problem with Wii U.

1159
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,100
So yeah, in that regard, yes.

1160
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,800
Do not call it Wii anything.

1161
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,300
And I don't think it will.

1162
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,100
If this is some new initiative, if some of these rumors about that they're going to be

1163
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:03,460
combining the DS and the Wii into something.

1164
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,640
Just call it the Nintendo Entertainment System.

1165
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,020
Just reboot that shit.

1166
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,220
I'm all for that.

1167
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,220
I'd love to see that.

1168
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,900
I'd love to see Nintendo just like go old school with it.

1169
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,780
Why not go back to the days where everybody just called the video game system a Nintendo?

1170
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,420
Why don't you just call it the Nintendo?

1171
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,700
Didn't we say this?

1172
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:22,660
I feel like we had this exact same discussion like 10 years ago when Wii was first coming

1173
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,660
out.

1174
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:26,700
No, this is back when they were doing like the new iPad, but I don't like that idea either

1175
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:31,580
because it gets really confusing, especially with the iPad, you know, where it's like the

1176
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,580
new iPad.

1177
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,580
Well, come on.

1178
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,980
Yeah, it's the same with Xbox One.

1179
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,340
Xbox One was, that's a dumb name.

1180
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,340
I'm sorry.

1181
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,340
It doesn't make any sense.

1182
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,340
It's confusing.

1183
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,340
Just don't do that.

1184
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:45,180
I like the Nintendo Entertainment System because no one's really going to be like, oh, you're

1185
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,180
talking about NES.

1186
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:48,180
Yeah, you're talking about a system from 1984.

1187
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,180
It's been a long time.

1188
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,340
It's not like, you know, we just had, you know, whatever it is, an iPad last year.

1189
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:58,800
I mean, if you're talking like something that's been, you know, over at least two generations

1190
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,340
or generations, I mean, you know, granted you have the Xbox and then the Xbox 360, then

1191
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,460
the Xbox One, that's too soon.

1192
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,620
You mean you could, I don't know.

1193
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,660
And I only think they should really just call the Xbox One.

1194
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,620
I think they should have just called it, I don't know, the new Xbox or something.

1195
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,780
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, let's just call it the Nintendo One.

1196
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,780
There it is.

1197
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:20,460
Act Deaf referring to the new 3DS.

1198
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,100
So maybe Nintendo is going to go down that path.

1199
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,100
Who knows?

1200
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,100
Please don't.

1201
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,860
Well, they're not going to call it the new Wii U.

1202
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,420
Okay, so let's go back.

1203
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,660
Naming wank aside, because, you know, none of us are going to know until, you know, they

1204
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,140
come out on stage or their digital event and say it.

1205
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,540
July 2016, realistic or no?

1206
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,540
I mean, that would be...

1207
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,540
I don't think...

1208
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,540
When was the last time a console released?

1209
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,740
Not during the holiday period.

1210
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,740
Well, lots.

1211
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,740
It's been a very long time.

1212
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,740
Lots of consoles.

1213
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,740
3DS launched in March.

1214
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,740
There's a...

1215
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,740
Dreamcast.

1216
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,740
Dreamcast in February.

1217
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,740
I guess that's a very good point.

1218
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,740
Nah, I'd say Dreamcast is still holiday period.

1219
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,740
Not September.

1220
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:56,740
September?

1221
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,740
Yeah.

1222
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,740
Early September.

1223
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,740
I'd call it.

1224
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:00,740
Yes, that's holiday, unfortunately.

1225
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,740
Close enough.

1226
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:02,740
Yeah.

1227
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,740
On the bubble.

1228
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,740
On the bubble.

1229
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,740
Holiday runs from, like, September to November.

1230
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,100
If it's after Labor Day, I consider it a holiday.

1231
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,100
Yeah.

1232
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,100
July, that's a wishful thing.

1233
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,420
Holiday is much more of a sad...

1234
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:15,940
Any mention of July, I think is probably gonna be the new Namco game of Tails from Someone's

1235
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,940
Ass.

1236
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,940
Nothing comes out in July.

1237
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:23,220
July is, like, barren, so if they release it, they would get the full attention, I suppose,

1238
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,620
but I don't know.

1239
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:29,540
It seems risky in a way, but if this supply thing you're talking about, you know, if Nintendo's

1240
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,780
gonna be always forever plagued with these supply issues...

1241
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,060
They're gonna do it for hype.

1242
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:35,660
They're gonna fuckin' do it for hype.

1243
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:41,880
It's really goddamn annoying, because seriously, everybody fucking knows it's artificial, okay?

1244
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,500
There's no fucking...

1245
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,180
You can't be this dumb at this point.

1246
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:48,300
Look, he looks like, we don't know how to manufacture shit.

1247
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,500
We just started doing this.

1248
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,500
Please understand.

1249
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,500
Please understand.

1250
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,980
Oh, fuck him and his please understand.

1251
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:55,140
I don't understand how you can be this dumb.

1252
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,620
I mean, seriously, they know what they're doing.

1253
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:04,300
They play it conservative with this stuff, and I guess they don't want it to be sitting

1254
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,740
on the shelves because it makes it seem like no one wants it.

1255
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:09,740
I'm sorry.

1256
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,740
It's perception retarded.

1257
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,740
Please understand.

1258
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,740
It's all according to plan, then.

1259
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,380
Then the shortage will be over by the holidays, and they go July.

1260
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,700
I revise my previous statement.

1261
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,220
Here's the other thing with that whole thing.

1262
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:26,460
I thought, and memory could be, you know, I'm getting old, Drew, I'm getting old, but

1263
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,020
with the 3DS releasing in April, that was over here, didn't it come out in Japan earlier

1264
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,020
than we got it?

1265
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:41,500
Yeah, 3DS came out holiday, it was like December or November in Japan, and then it came out

1266
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:46,580
over here in March, the end of March, yeah, it was the end of March over here because

1267
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,540
I bought, I'd imported one.

1268
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:52,980
And it seems like when we get systems in that time frame, like even the PlayStation 2 was

1269
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:57,260
like a, you know, release in the early months of the year, Japan had it for the holiday.

1270
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:01,500
So it's usually because we got it second because Japan had it first.

1271
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,780
But I mean, I don't know, we live in a more global market than we did even 10 years ago.

1272
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,620
So you know, if somebody wants something from Japan, right now, that new Zelda games for

1273
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,340
the next system is not for the Wii U.

1274
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:20,260
I feel like, and I granted you might say they're full of shit, which is which is a fair retort,

1275
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,020
but they've come out and said it's not for the next system.

1276
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,020
Uh huh.

1277
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,020
Loki.

1278
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,020
Loki.

1279
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,020
Two words.

1280
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,020
Twilight Prince.

1281
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,020
Yeah, exactly.

1282
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,820
Oh, it's not for the new system, except it is for the new system, you know, except it's

1283
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,300
also for the new system.

1284
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,420
He's left handed on this one.

1285
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,640
The only thing that I think could shut you down on that, and I think it's worth considering

1286
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:48,860
Loki is that we're also talking about now the Wii U's big tie in is the tablet.

1287
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:52,260
And so the Zelda game is going to have something to do with the tablet and so forth.

1288
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:57,180
So if the NX has a new twist, a new Nintendo-fied twist, we don't know what if we knew what

1289
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,180
it was, we would be able to talk about it.

1290
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,440
But whatever that new Nintendo twist is on a new way to play games, can Zelda really

1291
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,100
be parked into that when it's already for the Wii U's tablet game thing?

1292
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,100
Do you know what I mean?

1293
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,900
Yeah, I hope that new twist is fucking beefy ass hardware that can keep up with the modern

1294
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,900
games.

1295
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,260
No, I'm not trying to be like ridiculous here.

1296
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:21,980
I'm just saying that's definitely going to help them with the whole third party support

1297
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:26,820
thing because when you're running the system that's last generation specs, it's going to

1298
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,780
be hard to get the Fallout 4's and all that shit.

1299
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,380
So I would appreciate if they had a system that was up to spec with this stuff.

1300
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:39,220
I think they should even push it just a little further, which is kind of what the Wii U kind

1301
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,940
of did that, but it wasn't enough.

1302
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:47,820
Yeah, it was a little bit further with the Xbox 360, but unfortunately not, I don't know,

1303
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:52,400
even then it couldn't run some of the stuff that was on those systems and it's too bad

1304
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,260
because they had potential.

1305
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:59,100
Well, here's the interesting thing is that if Nintendo can get out that system next year

1306
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,700
and it's a little beefier than an Xbox One, let's say it's more like an Xbox One and a

1307
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,140
half, okay?

1308
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,100
Let's say they get that thing out next year.

1309
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:12,060
This isn't going to be like the Wii U was because the Wii U came out like right as the

1310
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:16,180
PS4's coming out and right as the Xbox One coming out, I mean there was maybe one year

1311
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:17,660
of opportunity.

1312
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:21,780
Well now if the typical life cycle happens with these current consoles that are out,

1313
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,580
we're more mid-cycle right now.

1314
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,740
We're not even really to the full brunt of the mid-cycle yet with these consoles.

1315
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,620
And let's be honest- So, I mean, Nintendo would get a really big

1316
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,620
jump.

1317
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:35,860
Yeah, and let's be honest, they haven't really taken advantage of these consoles lately.

1318
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,340
Look at PlayStation 4's lineup for holidays.

1319
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,340
It's been crap.

1320
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:40,340
They haven't had anything.

1321
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,340
What lineup?

1322
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:42,340
Exactly.

1323
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,240
They haven't had any first party shit come out of the- ooh, LittleBigPlanet 3.

1324
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,100
I'm not buying a console because of that, sorry.

1325
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:53,100
So many people are buying PlayStation 4's.

1326
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:54,100
You bought one!

1327
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,100
I bought one!

1328
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,100
He bought one!

1329
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,960
It's because of the next-gen games, or the current-gen games, the third-party stuff that

1330
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,580
we're buying it for right now, and we see a lot of potential with stuff coming out.

1331
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,820
Because every time you hear about games coming out, it's like, oh, it runs better on PlayStation

1332
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,820
4 than Xbox One.

1333
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:10,420
I mean, that was my conscious thinking, oh, and that, and they're giving me a ton of free

1334
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:11,420
games.

1335
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,420
You know, that also helps.

1336
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,420
Alright.

1337
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:19,580
Let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1338
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:23,780
Tech2030 says, wasn't there a report that NX wasn't going to be a rival to PlayStation

1339
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:24,900
4 in terms of power?

1340
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,180
I think that's a dangerous slope for Nintendo to go down, though, when it comes to third

1341
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,180
parties.

1342
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:33,500
If the game does not- something is easily ported from one system to another, that's

1343
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:37,420
gonna leave them in a position where they're at right now, I think.

1344
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:42,140
Bonds006 says, the new Nintendo system will be powered by loyalist love and fanboy money.

1345
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,780
Well, they're always gonna have that, so.

1346
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,780
I just-

1347
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:48,780
I'm worried-

1348
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,300
The Amiibo thing doesn't go full throttle.

1349
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,500
That's my one fear about this new system, is that Amiibo is gonna go full throttle.

1350
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:59,580
I'm worried that this new system actually may not, if they can't get the momentum, you

1351
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:03,580
know, they're hoping that this new system's gonna do better, and I hope it does, but what

1352
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:04,580
if it doesn't?

1353
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:06,060
What if it just doesn't catch on?

1354
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,060
Then what?

1355
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:08,060
Then what?

1356
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,060
Then where are you at?

1357
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,060
Then they'll always still have a 3DS.

1358
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,060
It's like, oh shit, you know.

1359
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,580
I mean, eh.

1360
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:16,460
Let's hope it's not PSP Go.

1361
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:17,460
It's not that dumb.

1362
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,020
It's gotta be better than that idea.

1363
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,660
Alright, well, you know what?

1364
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:27,460
We can- this is all rumors right now, and we can speculate, speculate, speculate, but

1365
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,660
you know what?

1366
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:32,140
It isn't really gonna change whatever's gonna happen next year, or not happen next year,

1367
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,540
so stay tuned, everybody.

1368
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:39,740
Meanwhile, let's move on to what's a game that's supposed to be within the next, you

1369
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:44,900
know, 12 months, if what we heard about Nintendo's E3 showing is to be true, that all the games

1370
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:47,060
they showed are for the next year.

1371
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:51,500
One of those games that was shown, of course, was Metroid Prime Federation Force.

1372
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:59,180
And as y'all know, it was not the most well-received game because it bears the Metroid title, yet

1373
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:02,020
it was just a very different creative direction for the game.

1374
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:06,340
In fact, it went so far as to inspire a Change.org petition that has, I don't know how many thousands

1375
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:09,780
of English- angry, angry internet people everywhere signing it.

1376
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,780
Grr-org.

1377
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,780
Yeah, exactly.

1378
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,260
When has Change.org actually changed anything?

1379
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,620
I mean, have any of those petitions actually done anything?

1380
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:24,420
Well, well, Nintendo, Reggie Fils-Aime was talking about, you know, all this stuff with

1381
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:29,900
Mashable and talked about the reaction, talking a little bit about that Change.org petition

1382
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,140
saying, quote, what the fan at home saw was something in the Metroid Prime universe that

1383
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,780
they weren't expecting.

1384
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,540
The reaction has been negative.

1385
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,540
There's no sugar-coating it.

1386
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:44,060
This is an example where fans who aren't able to get their hands on the game may be at a

1387
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:46,460
bit of a competitive disadvantage.

1388
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:50,620
Everyone who has played what we are showing regarding Metroid Prime, they came across

1389
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:51,860
really pleased.

1390
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,580
My ask is that fans trust us.

1391
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:57,940
Oh, bullshit damage control, Reg.

1392
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,660
This is the ultimate please understand.

1393
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,060
No!

1394
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:06,580
If you want to give us something in that series that the fans are going to enjoy, if you're

1395
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:12,580
going to put that name on it, you give us something from that that we can identify with

1396
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:13,900
and show that.

1397
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:17,260
Fans don't say, oh, we had the play testers play that and they were very pleased.

1398
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,980
No, we want to see that at home.

1399
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:22,660
Yeah, but to be fair, reaction at the E3 booth was pretty positive.

1400
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,980
Then you need to learn how to market the game better then.

1401
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,060
If that's the problem, if the game's good, but your marketing's not showing that, then

1402
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:32,140
you need to rework that.

1403
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,500
It's so interesting to me because I honestly feel like if they had just called this game

1404
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:38,740
Federation Force, this wouldn't even be a thing right now.

1405
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:39,740
It wouldn't be a thing.

1406
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,740
This would not even be a, we would not have a discussion.

1407
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:41,740
It wouldn't be a thing.

1408
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:44,580
It would, if it was just Federation Force, wouldn't even be a thing.

1409
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:48,020
What if they called it F-Zero Federation Force?

1410
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,620
What if they called it F-Zero Federation Force?

1411
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:52,140
I'd be like, yay, Nintendo still acknowledges F-Zero.

1412
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,340
No, I mean, seriously, this is how ridiculous it is.

1413
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:00,900
I mean, it's like, I don't know, like, it's just not the same.

1414
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:04,180
Actually, Loki, I'd kind of like to see them do a different game.

1415
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,100
There's so many characters in F-Zero, like they all had their fucking own theme songs

1416
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,100
in GX.

1417
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,460
They didn't like do anything with that.

1418
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:15,420
I kind of think F-Zero could have a side game, so sorry your little retort didn't work

1419
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,540
so well.

1420
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,540
But I actually, I'd like to see that.

1421
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,260
I have three words for you, Rob.

1422
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,660
Star Fox Adventures.

1423
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,320
Did it have anything to do with being in a ship?

1424
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,700
It had freaking dinosaurs.

1425
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,700
There's some people-

1426
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,180
It wasn't supposed to be a Star Fox game.

1427
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,740
But there's some people that still stand so hard for that game, even though it's like

1428
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,740
not-

1429
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,740
Of course.

1430
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,740
I mean, there's-

1431
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,140
It could be a perfectly good game on its own.

1432
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:42,380
It maybe shares a couple of characters, but you don't necessarily call that a Star Fox

1433
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:43,380
game.

1434
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,340
I think the problem is, and this is just, you know, again, we would not even be having

1435
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,500
this discussion right now if it was just called Federation Force, but because they invoke

1436
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:57,100
the name Metroid, it's kind of like them standing up there and going, we know y'all love Metroid,

1437
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,300
and yep, here's a game that doesn't have Samus in it, so why don't you just open up those

1438
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,300
wounds.

1439
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,300
We're just gonna pour a little salt in it.

1440
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,300
Well, I mean, that's fine.

1441
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,220
They had Halo Reach, and that didn't have Master Chief in it, as far as I'm aware, but

1442
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,980
I didn't play it, but it's a similar type of thing.

1443
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:15,020
It's still in the same universe, but that seemed like a Halo game, whereas this doesn't

1444
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:16,820
seem like a Metroid Prime game.

1445
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:17,820
But maybe-

1446
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:22,380
And maybe that's where we have to suspend disbelief a little bit, because it did show

1447
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,380
45 seconds.

1448
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,380
I'm not suspending shit, okay?

1449
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:25,380
You know why?

1450
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,380
Because I'm a consumer.

1451
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:29,620
I'm not gonna just trust you and buy it, because you know what?

1452
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:31,980
You know who says just trust us about shit?

1453
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:34,900
Warner Brothers says just trust us about buying Batman Arkham-

1454
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:35,900
Exactly.

1455
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,900
No, no, it's-

1456
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:42,140
No, EA says trust us, Battlefield Hardline's gonna work just fine, it'll be fine, just

1457
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,260
trust us.

1458
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,260
Fuck that.

1459
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:48,040
I am not trusting anybody until I see a reason to buy this game.

1460
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,040
I'm not picking it up.

1461
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,420
Well, that and I don't own the system, so I'm not buying a system to buy this game.

1462
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:57,140
I would not be this passionate about it if I didn't love Metroid, I didn't love Nintendo,

1463
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:01,340
but Reggie's pretty much giving us the gaming equivalent of open your mouth and close your

1464
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,340
eyes.

1465
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,780
You'll get a big surprise.

1466
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:10,300
SSJ100Matt says, if it were Mother 3 Federation Force, heaven help them.

1467
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,580
Kaijuto says, I'm excited about that Metroid game to be honest.

1468
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:17,980
Tigerclaw says, I like that Metroid Federation Force takes place in that universe.

1469
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:23,180
There are more things about the Metroid universe besides Samus Aran, there are other characters

1470
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,500
they can expand on.

1471
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,140
Okay, I'm gonna take that point and run with it for a minute here, because what if this

1472
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:34,780
game, in its cutesy chibi style, what if this game is about the animals?

1473
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:40,420
What if Nintendo saw all this fucking craziness about save the animals when they do those

1474
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,500
speeders, what if this game is about the animals?

1475
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,900
Because they said, oh, people get all worried, this is the animal game.

1476
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,860
Well, it's better than it being about the baby.

1477
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:54,820
Well, they didn't show anything like that, so I'm gonna suspend my disbelief, you know,

1478
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:56,380
until I see this.

1479
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,540
I'm gonna say that with a wink and a nod to Reggie, here's your shovel to get you out

1480
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:05,600
of this situation, wink, make it about the animals, wink, then people are gonna have

1481
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,700
a lot less problem with it, I'm just saying.

1482
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:12,540
Give us a kind of touchstone, give us something we can go on to bring us back to the series.

1483
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:17,100
I think they're going to, you know, if this is true, what he's saying, that people need

1484
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:22,420
to get their hands on it, then they'll take it out to Best Buys across the nation around

1485
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:26,300
the time of, I don't know, Gamescom or whenever the hell they want to do it, honestly, around

1486
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,860
the holidays, and they'll get the game in people's hands.

1487
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:30,860
Why take it to Best Buys?

1488
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:34,260
Take it to your chum-chum friends at Evil G, you know?

1489
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,260
I'm sure they'll push your shit.

1490
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:36,260
Maybe that's what they'll do, too.

1491
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:38,540
Or, how about a downloadable demo, like we used to do?

1492
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:43,100
Oh, well, you can play that for 30 seconds, and then that's it, because, you know, fuck

1493
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,580
you guys, demos are just for one time.

1494
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:49,380
We don't want you to get any actual enjoyment out of it for an extended period of time,

1495
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,620
because you may not buy the game.

1496
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,020
You might analyze it too hard.

1497
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:55,780
If you're that worried about me purchasing your game after playing your demo, I mean,

1498
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,180
that doesn't make any sense at all.

1499
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:02,140
Let me play the demo countless times, so I'm like, damn, I really want this game.

1500
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:03,140
I don't know.

1501
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,140
I'm disappointed.

1502
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:08,820
I'm not getting my new 2D Metroid, but I don't want to write this completely off until I

1503
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:09,820
get my hands on it.

1504
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:15,500
I can just say that when I saw the trailer, I was like, meh, so, but I don't have this

1505
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,420
like seething rage that Change.org does over this whole thing.

1506
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:22,580
If I can put a Metroid game that's done in that same engine that they did Rayman in,

1507
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:23,860
the new Rayman games?

1508
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:24,860
Yes, please.

1509
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:26,620
That's what I want to see.

1510
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:27,620
Alright.

1511
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:33,700
Hey, speaking of Nintendo criticisms, by the way, Act F says, Loki, you're anti-Nintendoing

1512
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:34,980
so hard right now it hurts.

1513
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,380
I'm not anti-Nintendoing.

1514
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:39,780
I'm totally for Nintendo.

1515
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,780
That's what you don't get.

1516
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:44,300
I like Nintendo, I just think they're making stupid decisions.

1517
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:46,100
That's why you get really mad when they make bad decisions.

1518
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,100
Exactly.

1519
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,700
If we're talking like fucking Majesco- This hurts me more than it hurts you.

1520
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,460
It's like when you have a close friend that you see do something stupid, and you're like,

1521
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,620
oh no, bitch.

1522
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,540
It's like if we were talking like, oh man, I really hate this direction that Madden's

1523
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:01,580
going in, I'd be like, I don't fucking care.

1524
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:02,580
And that would be intimate.

1525
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,580
Let it burn.

1526
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:04,580
Let it all burn.

1527
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,580
Exactly.

1528
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:06,580
Who cares?

1529
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:07,580
We wouldn't be this pissed off if we didn't like Nintendo.

1530
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,700
I wish more Nintendo fans got that about you, Loki.

1531
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:10,700
I really do.

1532
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,700
It's like, I love Nintendo.

1533
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,700
Why would I?

1534
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,700
I'm not mad at them.

1535
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,100
Like, I want to support this stuff.

1536
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:20,620
I want to, you know, buy a good Metroid game, but I'm not buying that game.

1537
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:22,020
That's not going to sell me a system.

1538
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,780
I want something to sell me a system.

1539
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:28,100
Dungeon Buster says Loki's all about tough Nintendo love.

1540
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:32,420
You know, I think Loki should star in like a version of the video game Bachelor where

1541
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:37,980
like, you know, all the games at E3 try to win over Loki's affection and he has roses

1542
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,280
that he gives out or dollars that he gives out to games.

1543
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:45,380
And every week, you know, some poor game is voted off the show.

1544
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:46,620
I think that's what I'd like to see.

1545
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,620
Wouldn't you?

1546
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:48,620
Yeah.

1547
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,900
But at the end of the series, he's just going to go home and play Call of Duty anyway.

1548
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,660
I don't play Call of Duty that often.

1549
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,660
Earth Defense Force.

1550
01:03:53,660 --> 01:03:56,980
I don't play Earth Defense Force either, which is, I don't play much of anything anymore,

1551
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,860
but no, seriously, you know, I don't play that much Call of Duty.

1552
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:00,860
I played it when it came out.

1553
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:02,340
I played the story missions.

1554
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,580
It was about a little bit of the multiplayer.

1555
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,020
That was about it.

1556
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:10,220
Bonds 006 says another Sunday with Nintendo getting no love at OLR.

1557
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,220
Hey, hey, that is not true.

1558
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:17,120
I have a lot of love for Nintendo, but only if you're Team Cat.

1559
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,700
And I think I made this point clear earlier in the show.

1560
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:22,340
Well, I'd love Nintendo, and I seriously want to get like a Wii U for, I would love

1561
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:27,700
to get a Wii U for Super Mario Maker, but I don't want to buy it just for Super Mario

1562
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:28,700
Maker.

1563
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,140
Hey, drop that shit down the $99.

1564
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,140
Okay.

1565
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,380
No, I'll buy it for just Super Mario Maker.

1566
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,580
I kind of think something like that's coming.

1567
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,580
But oh yeah.

1568
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:37,580
Yeah.

1569
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,580
Once that comes in, I'll be like, okay, really?

1570
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:40,860
What do you have coming around the corner then?

1571
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:41,860
Just don't forget.

1572
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:42,860
Don't don't forget.

1573
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,860
You know, Wii U's been out for like three years now.

1574
01:04:44,860 --> 01:04:45,900
There's a back catalog.

1575
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,500
There's there's Mario 3D World, Mario Kart 8.

1576
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,980
There's a lot of games worthy of your attention, even like Zombie U and shit is still like

1577
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:52,980
really good.

1578
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,980
So.

1579
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:54,980
All right.

1580
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:58,140
Anyway, speaking of Nintendo, let me just keep piling it on here.

1581
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:02,340
But this is stuff that's working around the blogs this week because, you know, Nintendo

1582
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:07,420
had to face the investors this week and talking about their E3 conference and how some folks

1583
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:11,420
decided to create change.org petitions out of it.

1584
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,220
Comment from Seguro Miyamoto on this whole thing.

1585
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:19,740
Quote, Sony and Microsoft had many announcements of future titles that were not playable.

1586
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:22,060
VR lined the floor as a dream exhibit.

1587
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:25,220
There were lots of video demos of those titles.

1588
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:29,340
And he went on to talk about how the Nintendo had the playable demos and Miyamoto said they

1589
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:30,820
got high praise.

1590
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,460
This is what Nintendo's booth looked like.

1591
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:33,940
It was different from other companies.

1592
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:37,180
Everyone was smiling, having fun with games.

1593
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:40,740
There are years when products are more finished and we can communicate their appeal.

1594
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,940
This may explain the difference this year.

1595
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:47,620
And they also said there are some unannounced third-party collaborations that are still

1596
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:48,900
in the works.

1597
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:49,900
I don't know.

1598
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:54,180
I just, again, and, you know, I try not to be like super harsh for Nintendo.

1599
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:55,820
I try to be open-minded.

1600
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:01,100
But like, it's a total line of bullshit, this whole thing, where we believe that at E3 we

1601
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:06,620
should only be showing the games six to twelve months out or whatever when just last year.

1602
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:07,620
Just last.

1603
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:08,620
That's why I don't buy the argument.

1604
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:12,060
Like, I was fucking there last year when they were showing Mario Maker and Star Fox the

1605
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:16,260
first time and some of these other games, like the Miyamoto concept games, that still

1606
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,260
aren't out.

1607
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:18,700
So I'm like, I'm sorry.

1608
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,780
That's some decision you just arbitrarily made this year on why you're showing what

1609
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:23,780
you're showing this year.

1610
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,660
But Rumble is a last-gen feature.

1611
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:26,660
Anyway.

1612
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:27,660
Exactly.

1613
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:31,740
That's the one thing that gets me going about these Nintendo lines is I do not buy that

1614
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:32,740
for a minute.

1615
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:33,740
I'm sorry.

1616
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,740
I'm sorry.

1617
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:38,780
Even if that's your whole new philosophy on E3, then that's one you decided on this year.

1618
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:39,780
It's not something you've done forever.

1619
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:40,780
Exactly.

1620
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:41,780
Be just honest.

1621
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,500
You know what?

1622
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:44,500
This year we decided that we're only going to show these games.

1623
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,500
Yeah.

1624
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,020
We have other stuff in the, you know, we're working on other things, but this is all we're

1625
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:50,020
showing you.

1626
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,020
All right.

1627
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:55,240
Anyhow, that's, that's enough on the Nintendo front right now, especially when half of this

1628
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,240
is rumor.

1629
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,580
Let's move on to some other stuff.

1630
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,580
Dark Sakura.

1631
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,380
The voice of reason.

1632
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:02,380
Usually.

1633
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,180
She'll give you one reason.

1634
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:13,020
Well, there is a new bit of goodies for folks who have donated, well I should say back to

1635
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:16,100
the Shenmue 3 Kickstarter.

1636
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:21,260
At the $60 level, they'll get a physical copy of the game, which is nice because there are

1637
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:24,400
people out here who like physical copies of their damn games.

1638
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:30,380
Who have entire rooms of their house dedicated to physical copies of their damn game.

1639
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:37,300
So you'll either get it for PS4 or Windows, whichever choice you want.

1640
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:46,700
And they also included an apology, excuse me, for their Twitch broadcast and basically

1641
01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:48,620
just said it didn't work very well.

1642
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:49,620
Sorry.

1643
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:51,340
I didn't hear about the Twitch broadcast.

1644
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:52,340
What went wrong?

1645
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:53,340
Did anybody follow that?

1646
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,340
It just said that it botched.

1647
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,420
Uh oh.

1648
01:07:55,420 --> 01:08:01,980
Did it botch like Final Fantasy 14 on the Mac bad or are we talking like, I'm just saying.

1649
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:05,960
I didn't say anything and I honestly don't really watch much on Twitch.

1650
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,140
So I didn't watch it.

1651
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:10,540
I didn't even know there was a Twitch broadcast, but they said sorry.

1652
01:08:10,540 --> 01:08:15,780
So well, a lot of times that's something they'll do to try and raise money for Kickstarters

1653
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:19,540
is that the creators will kind of get on Twitch and take their case to the public basically

1654
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:23,660
and you know, show some more art or any types of renderings that they put together and so

1655
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:24,660
forth.

1656
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,940
And that was something they were showing with Shenmue, but they must have just had some

1657
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:30,060
technical difficulties or something.

1658
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:32,180
So let's see.

1659
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,600
Fifth Dream in chat says the guys on it were kind of goofy and we're trying to be funny

1660
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,140
instead of trying to hype people to pledge and it kind of flopped.

1661
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:42,620
So maybe they said they were sincerely sorry.

1662
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,260
Get me to host a telethon.

1663
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,380
I'll raise money.

1664
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:47,980
Get Dark Sakura and Loki.

1665
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:50,500
If you don't donate to this, you're an idiot.

1666
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:51,940
So here's the list of reasons why.

1667
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:52,940
Someone gets me a burrito.

1668
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:53,940
I'll run a telethon.

1669
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:59,580
Let's go to the tote board and see how many tacos are in my tummy.

1670
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:05,260
But eight, only eight, I need some more tacos here right now.

1671
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,740
I'm actually legit hungry.

1672
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:10,820
So everything reminds me of tacos.

1673
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,980
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Twitch is too mainstream for Dark Sakura.

1674
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:16,940
You going to go over to hitbox?

1675
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,340
No.

1676
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:22,700
I've broadcasted on Twitch before, but only when I was playing Hot to Full Boyfriend.

1677
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,180
So maybe I'll do another replay.

1678
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:26,700
But then it became too mainstream, so you know.

1679
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,700
Whatever.

1680
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:34,560
So maybe I'll do another replay of the secret Hurtful Boyfriend ending that takes literally

1681
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:35,560
three hours to play through.

1682
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:36,560
What about the sequel?

1683
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,980
Aren't they making a sequel?

1684
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:38,980
That was the sequel.

1685
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:43,920
It was, well not, there were other versions, there were other games that were in the series

1686
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,060
and like a visual novel and some stuff, but you only need Hot to Full Boyfriend.

1687
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:50,620
I thought the developer was making a news.

1688
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,580
No, they're doing, it's just Hot to Full Boyfriend.

1689
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:59,460
It's not even any type of new or anything, it's just Hot to Full Boyfriend.

1690
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,220
The new Hot to Full Boyfriend.

1691
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:05,780
It's just Hot to Full Boyfriend, the same one, which is nothing new.

1692
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:10,220
Alright, let's move on to some more stories, Loki.

1693
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:15,300
So perfect example of hey, if you're not going to make it, then we'll make it and we'll leave

1694
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,420
your company and make it anyways.

1695
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:23,980
So Comcept has gone back to announce that they're going to be putting out yet another

1696
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:24,980
game.

1697
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:30,340
This was announced during Anime Expo, it's a game called Red Ash and it is a legendary

1698
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:37,180
game with legends and yes, it's headed- Legendary?

1699
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:40,600
It's very legend-y, legendary.

1700
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,980
It's a mega man, it's a legend.

1701
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:49,780
Yes so, it's basically Mega Man Legends minus Mega Man.

1702
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:56,260
So Red Ash or Re-Dash?

1703
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:02,780
It's pretty clever, these Kickstarter titles for games that publishers won't do anymore,

1704
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:05,900
they're cracking me up more than anything with the whole blood-stained ritual.

1705
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:11,660
Because it's, because people want this shit and they're funding it and they're buying

1706
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:12,660
it.

1707
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:17,780
Fuck you Capcom, we don't need you anymore and I think that's- hello, maybe you should

1708
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:19,520
listen to your audience.

1709
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,160
If people want the game, they're going to find a way to get it.

1710
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:25,700
Why can't you fund a lower budget project or something?

1711
01:11:25,700 --> 01:11:31,700
I don't understand why people are so- I guess they have shareholders, a lot of good they're

1712
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,820
doing you.

1713
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:38,280
Well here's the thing with this Kickstarter, although this is very exciting and I'm excited

1714
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:44,160
to hear about this, I have to admit, I'm very cautious because I find it odd that we're

1715
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:48,360
going to Kickstarter for the next project when Mighty No. 9 isn't out.

1716
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,720
But it's got a release date and it's got a physical disc version that they're going to

1717
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:52,720
be pressing.

1718
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:53,720
I get it.

1719
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:54,720
It's towards the end.

1720
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,200
And judging from the beta, it's almost done.

1721
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,600
Yeah and I know there's a beta, so I know people have had their hands on it and so forth,

1722
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:07,640
but I don't know, I do find it- and I realize that they work on games like they're starting

1723
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:12,600
this cycle, it's kind of like, I don't know, what's a game that's almost out like in stores

1724
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,600
right now?

1725
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,260
What's coming out like in September?

1726
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:16,260
Yarn Yoshi or something?

1727
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:19,360
Yarn, okay, Yoshi's Yarn, well that's already out in Europe, but whatever.

1728
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:23,200
Yoshi's Yarn work was probably done in like February, you know, or even sooner than that,

1729
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:24,440
probably before the holidays.

1730
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,640
You know, it just takes a little time to get all the discs printed, get all the, you know,

1731
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,640
publishing and things done.

1732
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:30,720
They go bold though only a few weeks prior to launch.

1733
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,600
It's not that- they're literally working up to date.

1734
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:33,960
But they're starting their next project.

1735
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:34,960
Well yeah.

1736
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,040
There's very few people working on it at the end.

1737
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:40,440
The rest, everybody else wants to keep a job, so they're thinking about their next project

1738
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,440
in advance.

1739
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:46,640
So from that end, I get it, but at the same time, just as a consumer on Kickstarter, I

1740
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,560
feel like, I don't know how I feel about backing your project when I haven't really been able

1741
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:52,240
to assess your first project.

1742
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,240
But I think that this-

1743
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,240
And if I trust you-

1744
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,720
It's a little bit different than say, you know, oh, they just finished funding for Mighty

1745
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:03,420
Number Nine and like two months later, oh, we're funding another Kickstarter project.

1746
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:09,260
It's a little bit different when this is like just coming out in a few months, literally

1747
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,260
like two months away.

1748
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,260
Yeah.

1749
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,260
That's release candidate type stuff.

1750
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:15,660
You know, now you've got a new project being Kickstarted.

1751
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,700
I'm kind of okay with that.

1752
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:21,900
It's when you have no- and I understand they have really no track record right now, but

1753
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:27,660
it's- people have actually seen it, played it, they know it's good.

1754
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:29,460
It's coming out very soon.

1755
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:30,460
I mean-

1756
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:33,200
I haven't heard a hundred percent positive, I'm just saying.

1757
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:36,920
Like there's been some things I've seen- and granted, I can't really judge myself till

1758
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:37,920
I play it.

1759
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:38,920
I haven't.

1760
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,920
So, you know, disclaimer, whatever.

1761
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,380
But I'm seeing some people were like, this isn't really what I was expecting.

1762
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:44,380
So-

1763
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:49,960
A lot of people are also expecting it to look exactly like the concept art, which is stupid.

1764
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,660
It never looks exactly like the concept art.

1765
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,040
That's why it's concept art.

1766
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:57,160
Go to our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com.

1767
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,420
Dungeon Buster says Deep Silver's already on board as a distributor and technically

1768
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:04,060
it was supposed to be out a few months ago, actually hitting its estimated release date

1769
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:05,460
before more happened.

1770
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:08,980
MXC says the build of Mighty No. 983 seemed practically done.

1771
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:12,860
I would have preferred that concept waited until it released for this new Kickstarter

1772
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:13,860
though.

1773
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:19,100
And Bobby Blackwolf says they don't need artists for games they're currently in final bug fix.

1774
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:25,180
So this is probably about, you know, starting that next project before the other one is,

1775
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:26,180
you know-

1776
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:27,860
And I'm all over a new Mega Man Legends game.

1777
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:28,860
I know.

1778
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:34,500
And there's still a part of me that's very like, I feel like I really want to play Mighty

1779
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:35,500
No. 9.

1780
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:36,620
Well, I didn't back Mighty No. 9.

1781
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:37,620
You know what?

1782
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:38,620
I didn't either, actually.

1783
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:39,620
Funny enough.

1784
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:40,620
But I'll buy it when it comes out.

1785
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:45,100
I just, I'm not, you know, I didn't back Bloodstained either.

1786
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,100
I don't know.

1787
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:49,260
The last thing I backed was We Happy Few.

1788
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,620
I'll check out Mighty No. 9 when it comes out.

1789
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:56,100
And then if I like that, I'll buy this other one when it comes out, probably.

1790
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,780
You know, I'm interested enough in it, but I don't, I don't know.

1791
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:03,660
Like does that make me a bad fan because I don't want to run to Kickstarter and pay

1792
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:04,660
in advance?

1793
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:07,420
Like, I don't think there's also anything wrong with saying, that looks neat, can't

1794
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:08,420
wait to play it when it's out.

1795
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,460
You know, like I don't have to back it.

1796
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:11,460
That's all right.

1797
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:12,980
It's, there's two sides of the fence here.

1798
01:15:12,980 --> 01:15:14,700
I'll fully display my own bias.

1799
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:19,940
I'm probably at least a hundred bucks or so deep into both of those projects and soon

1800
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:24,340
Red Ash, but still and all, you know, if you want to be a little bit more patient about

1801
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:25,620
it, just wait till it's out.

1802
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:26,620
That's okay too.

1803
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:31,380
I mean, there are those that, I guess in this whole crowdfunding world now, the game isn't

1804
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:36,620
going to even have a chance if some people don't dive in, but you know, it's, it's just

1805
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,620
one of those things.

1806
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:38,620
Yeah.

1807
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,620
And I get that.

1808
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:42,460
And like, if I don't contribute on the Kickstarter, then I can't complain if it doesn't happen,

1809
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:44,500
which I'm willing to accept that.

1810
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:48,940
But I was gonna say, you're, you're a high roller on some of these Kickstarters.

1811
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:52,020
You say you dropped a hundred bucks on Bloodstained and Mighty No. 9?

1812
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,020
Yeah.

1813
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:54,020
Wow.

1814
01:15:54,020 --> 01:15:55,900
What, why, why'd you roll big on those?

1815
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:57,580
For one, I'm probably...

1816
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,540
First, you should spend your money however the hell you want.

1817
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:03,300
I'm not asking you to justify that, but I'm just saying, what, what drove you to that?

1818
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,300
Fanboyism.

1819
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,540
I'll come to you about fanboyism.

1820
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,540
I love your honesty.

1821
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:09,540
I'm like, fine.

1822
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:14,540
You know, I am the big, you know, Mega Man fan, and I've not been too pleased with the

1823
01:16:14,540 --> 01:16:16,300
lack of titles lately.

1824
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:20,220
So as soon as I saw that Imafune was on board trying to make something, you know, a spiritual

1825
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:23,140
successor, I'm like, okay, fine.

1826
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:24,900
I can, I can be okay with this.

1827
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:28,580
You know, spiritual successor's down, you know, System Shock 2 going to BioShock.

1828
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:29,580
Okay.

1829
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:30,580
I liked that.

1830
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,580
Wasn't exactly the same thing, but it was close.

1831
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:33,580
So okay.

1832
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:35,800
Creator on board with Mighty No. 9.

1833
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,180
I have high hopes for this.

1834
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:40,260
Let me go ahead and back this, you know, right away.

1835
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:44,940
Ditto for, uh, uh, for Iga and, uh, and Bloodstained.

1836
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:51,220
What do you think about the whole, um, um, the Mega Man re-release thing?

1837
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:54,020
Cause you said, you said that they haven't been showing Mega Man a lot of love, but then

1838
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:57,220
we just had this news come out about 1 through 6 HD or whatever.

1839
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:59,060
I posted about this a while back.

1840
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:01,260
When's that coming out, by the way?

1841
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:02,260
I don't know if I caught it.

1842
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:03,780
Did anybody in chat catch the release date for that?

1843
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:06,920
I would assume it's before Holiday or around Holiday.

1844
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:12,700
What if they're trying to piggyback on Mighty No. 9 coming out to try to, like, get some

1845
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:13,700
stuff?

1846
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:14,700
That's, that's business, bitches.

1847
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,700
Yeah, I understand that, but I'm just saying.

1848
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,700
That's what they do.

1849
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,340
Oh, here's the thing about the Legacy Collection.

1850
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:21,180
I, I, I made a post about it.

1851
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:22,180
In fact, I think it is.

1852
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,420
I think it is right around the time of Mighty No. 9's release, and I think it's, you're,

1853
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:26,420
you're probably right.

1854
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,420
That's business, bitches.

1855
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:28,420
It is.

1856
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:29,420
What is it?

1857
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:32,780
Why do they, why do they do those direct-to-video things when, like, Jurassic World is coming

1858
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:33,780
out?

1859
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:34,780
Oh, mockbusters.

1860
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,780
Why do they, yeah, the mockbusters.

1861
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:36,780
They come out with, like, Dinosaur Planet.

1862
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:38,500
Oh yeah, because those companies do that.

1863
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:39,620
That's, that's their company.

1864
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,620
They do that.

1865
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:41,620
I mean, it's.

1866
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:42,620
That's what they do.

1867
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,620
Anyway, Drew, sorry.

1868
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:46,020
So here's the thing about the Legacy Collection, and I, I, I spoke on this a while back when

1869
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:47,460
it was, when it was first announced.

1870
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:54,340
I made a couple posts about it, but Capcom kind of puts die-hard Mega Man fan-moi into

1871
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:56,260
kind of a catch-22.

1872
01:17:56,260 --> 01:18:02,140
If I don't buy it, it pretty much means that, oh, the fans aren't, you know, people aren't

1873
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:05,900
interested in the Mega Man series anymore, and we don't see any new games.

1874
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:11,300
If I do buy it, and other, you know, other fans, if we do buy it, it says, okay, it says

1875
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:16,020
to Capcom, oh, they're, they'll go ahead and keep on buying the old shit, and no new games

1876
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,740
are going to be made in the series.

1877
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:22,420
I know they're trying to test the waters, but it does put the fans in a difficult position.

1878
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:26,260
That said, I'll buy it anyway, Capcom, take my money.

1879
01:18:26,260 --> 01:18:28,940
No, no, here's, here's, here's how you have to look at it, actually.

1880
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:33,820
Look at it, look at it, you know, a few years back with Konami.

1881
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:38,540
Oh, sure, we'll support all your fucking, you know, Bomani stuff, and we'll support

1882
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:43,980
your, oh, Rock Revolution, okay, that shit, you know, but we'll keep supporting this stuff

1883
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:47,380
because we're hoping that another Dance Dance Revolution game comes out or something, but

1884
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:48,380
it never does.

1885
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:52,980
So, you can support Mega Man and those old collections all you want.

1886
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:56,740
That shit ain't going to fucking come out, regardless if you support it or not.

1887
01:18:56,740 --> 01:19:01,500
My understanding is that, you know, Digital Eclipse is really making this with, you know,

1888
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,820
Capcom's blessing or whatever, and, and I think part of the reason why I'm prone to

1889
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:09,300
support it is I'm kind of swayed over by Digital Eclipse's argument of that it is more of a

1890
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:14,260
criterion collection of games, and, okay, they may have picked a game that, you know,

1891
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:18,660
already had this collection or whatever, but I kind of like that idea about, like, if we're

1892
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:25,220
going to go back and revisit old shit, like, let's give it a real pristine, you know, release.

1893
01:19:25,220 --> 01:19:29,060
Let's go back and, you know, update little things and inject some leaderboards into it.

1894
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:32,700
This is all I've ever talked about for Virtual Console, right, like, I would love it if all

1895
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:36,100
the Virtual Console releases looked kind of like this Mega Man thing is shaping up to

1896
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:37,100
be.

1897
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:40,220
I don't know, in that regard, I'm kind of won over a little bit.

1898
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:46,140
I mean, even that Mega Man collection, you know, it wasn't, it didn't have online leaderboards

1899
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:49,820
or any of those, you know, social things that these new systems have or whatever, and I

1900
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:53,540
realize these aren't big things and probably aren't winning everybody over, but I just

1901
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:57,100
kind of think those are things that are weighing on my decision and I'll probably end up getting

1902
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:58,100
it.

1903
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:02,980
The thing is, I know I'm not alone here when, you know, I say I'm, I love the older games,

1904
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:06,620
I'm sick and tired of seeing them all over again.

1905
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:12,340
This is going to be, what, the fourth or fifth time in Virtual Console, anniversary collections,

1906
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:13,460
what have you.

1907
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:14,460
Give me something new!

1908
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:18,140
I am sick of The Wizard of Oz and I wish they would stop screening it in theaters.

1909
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:22,140
I am just so goddamn sick of that movie, they don't need to release, The Wizard of Oz on

1910
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:27,020
Blu-ray, stop fucking up my Blu-ray section with another goddamn release of The Wizard

1911
01:20:27,020 --> 01:20:28,020
of Oz.

1912
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,020
Exactly.

1913
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:35,500
All their jolly singing, this isn't what I want to see.

1914
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,460
Do lollipop men piss you off, Loki?

1915
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:41,940
No, you know what, I want to see that fucking crossover, the Avengers fucking, you know,

1916
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:47,300
Wizard of Oz shit with the fucking dark ass, you know, tin man, that's the shit I want

1917
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,300
to see.

1918
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:51,820
Let's get some fucking Tim Burton shit out here, fuck Johnny Depp being in it and stuff,

1919
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:58,340
I want some dark ass Wizard of Oz, you know, fucking, I want it to be so goddamn dark that

1920
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:03,580
Return of Oz seems like fucking ponies and magic and rainbows and shit, you know, that's

1921
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,100
what I want to see.

1922
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:09,220
I want kids to go in there, oh, Wizard of Oz, that sounds awesome, and I want them to

1923
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:14,540
come out fucking scared for their goddamn lives, like holy shit, I want them to be fucked

1924
01:21:14,540 --> 01:21:15,540
up.

1925
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:18,980
That was Return of Oz, that queen collected heads in a jar, that's why our generation

1926
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:21,140
is fucked up, Loki, that movie.

1927
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:24,940
Because people weren't ready for that yet, and then Futurama came out and it was okay.

1928
01:21:24,940 --> 01:21:30,060
They were giving Farooza bulk like shock therapy, it was like part of the plot of that movie.

1929
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:32,060
It was an awesome movie.

1930
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:33,300
Have you ever read the books?

1931
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,860
Actually, yes, they're messed up too.

1932
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:39,620
Yeah, but they were, honestly, I thought they were good.

1933
01:21:39,620 --> 01:21:43,900
That's why I'm saying, they need to take the books and adapt it to fucking darken shit.

1934
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:48,460
Well jeez, Rob, you and your ruby shoes just invalidated my entire pissed off argument,

1935
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:50,500
that makes it all okay now!

1936
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:54,940
Well, actually, in the book, they were silver slippers, I'll have you know.

1937
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:55,940
Ewwww.

1938
01:21:55,940 --> 01:21:56,940
Yes.

1939
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:57,940
Ewwww.

1940
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:04,260
So they need to remake the whole fucking movie because the slippers were the wrong fucking

1941
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:05,260
color.

1942
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:07,260
So they need to go back and do it.

1943
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:11,540
The whole reason that they did that is because they would show up better on screen.

1944
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:12,540
The end.

1945
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:15,180
That's not a problem now in this day.

1946
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:20,540
I didn't buy no goddamn high definition television for you to tell me it can't show certain colors.

1947
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:22,820
Alright, anyhow.

1948
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:32,860
Let's move on, shall we?

1949
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:33,980
Let's talk about something else.

1950
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:35,620
Let's talk about music games.

1951
01:22:35,620 --> 01:22:40,820
Better yet, Vocaloid games, because who doesn't love Hatsune Miku type of games, you know?

1952
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:42,900
I bought Project Diva.

1953
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:43,900
Did you?

1954
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:44,900
Yep.

1955
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:45,900
Actually, those are fun games.

1956
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:50,900
I really can't hate on those types of games, because Hatsune Miku, that's a fun series.

1957
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:54,620
Well there's another series, this actually isn't a story about Hatsune Miku, but Vocaloid

1958
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:58,460
type games are pretty popular over in Japan.

1959
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:00,580
Like, you know, they have that growing popularity.

1960
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:05,940
They might not be as popular here, but there could be a reason for that.

1961
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:10,160
And that is that they can't seem to ever release them here.

1962
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:15,320
One game I want to talk about is Tamsoft's IAVT Colorful.

1963
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:19,980
It's a rhythm game that's based on first place's Vocaloid Idol.

1964
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:24,180
So, and you know what, this trailer has Japanese narration in it, but you can definitely hear

1965
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:38,500
the music, so you'll know what I'm talking about here.

1966
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,920
Like it's so happy.

1967
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,260
How can you possibly be in a bad mood when you're playing a game like that and hearing

1968
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,260
music like that?

1969
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:46,420
Well, can we work on that title first off?

1970
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,020
I know, right?

1971
01:23:48,020 --> 01:23:49,020
That's a winning title for the American market.

1972
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:53,260
It might need a different title if it comes over here, but anyway, here's the thing.

1973
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:56,580
As cute as that game sounds, you're probably going to have to import it if you ever want

1974
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:57,980
to play it.

1975
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:03,220
Producer of the game Kenshiro Takaaki said in an interview with Silicon Era, quote, since

1976
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:08,400
it's a music title and since music is arguably one of the most protected media types artists

1977
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:13,140
have, it just means more doors to knock on and more approvals to get.

1978
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:16,300
It's far more difficult than a Senran Kagura title.

1979
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:20,860
So in other words, a lot of these, you know, music rights issues and we, you know, covering

1980
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:27,900
music games, we know that this is always an issue with trying to get games over here

1981
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:30,860
is that the music licensing is always a pain in the ass.

1982
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:35,780
And to this day, here we are, what, 14 years later, I say this is why Konami turned a blind

1983
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:38,640
eye to the DDR machines being over here.

1984
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:42,220
At the end of the day, Konami didn't care because they were, you know, they probably

1985
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:46,800
cared about the pirated machines, but the legit sale ones, whatever, they couldn't release

1986
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:52,340
those games here because the US music industry wasn't going to license those songs at the

1987
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:54,660
same rates that the Japanese industry was.

1988
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:59,880
So Konami could build up awareness of the games and release the home versions that did

1989
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,660
have those, you know, I don't understand what the big deal is anyway.

1990
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:05,860
So what, you release something in another country and someone imports it.

1991
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:10,360
Who gives a shit if, you know, licensing rights weren't paid over here as well as over there?

1992
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:14,360
I mean, it just goes, I think they do give a shit because money, right money.

1993
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:18,040
Well, I understand, but like, I just don't understand why they feel that they're entitled

1994
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:21,400
to more money because they feel like they're always entitled to more money.

1995
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:25,300
Well, I think the music industry is just woefully out of touch with the fact that we are in

1996
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:31,580
this global, you know, world now that we're connected because the internet and some would

1997
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:35,600
say that's what fucked over the music industry in the late nineties was that Napster broke

1998
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:42,740
down that wall real quick of, you know, being able to get stuff in Japan and the, you know,

1999
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:46,980
no longer do people have to drop all this extra money to import CDs from other companies.

2000
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:49,140
God, I remember I used to buy import CDs.

2001
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:53,800
I used to buy import singles to get like that extra rare bonus track and all that stuff.

2002
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,780
I don't have to do that in the digital age.

2003
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:56,780
That's done.

2004
01:25:56,780 --> 01:25:59,740
I mean, now we're in the world of Spotify and Pandora and Apple music.

2005
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:01,660
What have you just started like this?

2006
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:02,660
Yeah.

2007
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:07,620
So, but I dunno, I kind of feel like in some ways the licensing needs to catch up a little

2008
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:08,620
bit too.

2009
01:26:08,620 --> 01:26:11,820
And if you're gonna license things, it needs to be a global license in this day and age.

2010
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:16,060
Like I just don't understand the whole, and I'm sure there's more legal reasons, but I

2011
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:21,700
just from a, from a consumer viewpoint of I'll just import the damn thing from Japan,

2012
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:25,260
whatever, you know, I, it just feels really out of touch with the global world we live

2013
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:26,260
in.

2014
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:30,100
Well, the licensing and the, uh, I guess the existing fan base, I mean, that does at least

2015
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:35,700
explain why for some odd reason we actually are getting persona for dancing all night.

2016
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:38,860
You want to talk about a niche spinoff title?

2017
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:43,380
Do you know that I know several people that imported that though, because they can't wait.

2018
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:44,900
I almost did.

2019
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,900
I almost did.

2020
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:48,900
I'll wait.

2021
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:49,900
I have on pre-order.

2022
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:50,900
I'm a bad person.

2023
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:54,060
That's the one thing that's kept Shane out of heaven's word for like several hours this

2024
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:57,700
weekend is the fact that, oh yeah, I was not lying cause I was playing persona for dancing

2025
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:58,700
all night.

2026
01:26:58,700 --> 01:26:59,700
I'm like, of course you were.

2027
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:00,700
Of course you were.

2028
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:01,700
Yeah.

2029
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:05,700
When I got my PlayStation, um, TV last week, I was like, well, can you guys pick up like

2030
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:07,340
a physical gaming video with that?

2031
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:11,540
That's all that's on the Vita nowadays is Japanese import games.

2032
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:16,220
If that's what you're into, the Vita is your system right there and all sorts of the classics.

2033
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:21,700
Hence why my new Vita is Japanese region this time, so I can actually play some new games.

2034
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:24,100
There you go.

2035
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:29,420
Anyway, uh, that's, I just wanted to bring that up on, you know, we love music games.

2036
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:32,740
Uh, anyhow, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

2037
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,380
Hopefully tacos.

2038
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:42,500
Um, well, this one is, uh, I have been reading the speculation for a while on this one, um,

2039
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:47,900
and BioWare has this bad habit of putting out surveys that sort of, uh, not really leaks

2040
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:53,620
as much as spills out in a torrent of information, everything ever about anything they're going

2041
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:55,300
to do.

2042
01:27:55,340 --> 01:28:05,180
So the survey that was released, um, said that there are ideas out for a $14.99 a DLC

2043
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:07,940
for Dragon Age Inquisition related to the story.

2044
01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:14,820
And it said that this is, uh, supposed to be like the last adventure as well as your

2045
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:15,820
next mission.

2046
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:18,780
So basically it's the fate of the Inquisition.

2047
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:24,980
Um, and the quote on here says that it's going to revolve around, and this is where the quote

2048
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:30,660
starts, the one who started it all and facing a great evil before it is too late.

2049
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:33,260
So of course, plenty of us are wondering, is it the Wolf Hunt?

2050
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,080
Is it the Wolf Hunt?

2051
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:40,380
Some people think it's going to go in another direction, you know, but we're...

2052
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:46,180
But what you didn't know is that BioWare hired special guest author for this DLC, George

2053
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:49,180
R.R. Martin, and everyone will be killed.

2054
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:50,180
Yay!

2055
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:54,620
And then Porky Pig comes out at the end, bleep, bleep, bleep, that's all folks.

2056
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:58,900
Anyway, I'll read exactly what was in the, uh, the email thing.

2057
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:03,660
It said, uh, having saved the world of Thedas by closing the breach, your next mission will

2058
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,100
determine the future of the Inquisition.

2059
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:10,300
Your mark suddenly glows, erupting with magic connected to the Fade, which makes me instantly

2060
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,820
think of who I think it is.

2061
01:29:12,820 --> 01:29:17,560
Assassin's attack in shadow, an invasion of enemies begins, when a race against time to

2062
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:20,580
face a great evil before it is too late.

2063
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:25,500
In this story-based expansion, playable after the events of Dragon Age Inquisition, you

2064
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:29,860
will embark on a last adventure with your team to confront the one who started it all.

2065
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:33,180
Part of me also hopes that this is our version of Citadel.

2066
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,180
Of the Citadel DLC.

2067
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:36,100
Took the words right out of my mouth.

2068
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:39,500
And then they're traveling through the woods and all of a sudden they come across this

2069
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:45,460
crashed spaceship, happens to be the normal guy, and a strange child.

2070
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:49,180
From the bullet points, you get to fight a bunch of Qunari.

2071
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:54,380
You have brand new areas to go through, you get to go through the Fade, and different

2072
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:57,500
optional gameplay modes.

2073
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:01,420
More romance scenes, because the Citadel really brought some feels, like remember the Thane

2074
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:02,420
thing in the Citadel DLC?

2075
01:30:02,420 --> 01:30:03,740
That was some, that was some feels.

2076
01:30:03,740 --> 01:30:05,620
I should go.

2077
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:14,340
There's also an add-on pack that has spoils of Avvar, and that came from Jaws of Hakkon,

2078
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:17,760
we had the Black Emporium come out.

2079
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:22,900
I will tell you this, for anyone looking for folks who are playing the beta, there's

2080
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:29,600
no beta stuff out yet, and that's all I can say about it, because NDA, so.

2081
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,320
Yeah, but if anything was out there it would be all over the internet.

2082
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:36,360
Yeah, other people would say so, not me, but I'm just saying, if anyone's looking to beta

2083
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:40,480
testers to reveal anything, there's nothing out there yet.

2084
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,720
No beta releases.

2085
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,840
Go into the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

2086
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:49,320
Fifth Dream says, I got a survey about that DLC, so it's out there.

2087
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,320
She isn't making it up, folks.

2088
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,320
It's out there.

2089
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,600
Yeah, just, there's nothing out there being tested yet, so.

2090
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:59,380
What's the one thing you really want to see in this DLC as a big Dragon Age fan, Darzara?

2091
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:04,500
I definitely want to see a resolution for the Solas romance, because that was the first

2092
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:11,400
one I did, and now I'm all about Cullen, so whatever, but I would like to see a resolution

2093
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:16,200
and have that play into what I think is going to happen.

2094
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,200
Alright.

2095
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:18,200
Yeah.

2096
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,440
Well, in the meantime, we have some things that are coming out a little sooner than this

2097
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,440
DLC.

2098
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:25,680
It's travel around the world and check out some release dates, starting off with the

2099
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:26,880
US, Loki.

2100
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:31,540
As it previously stated when we were talking about Nintendo releasing the NX in July, there

2101
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:34,720
is nothing coming out in July, and that is the case this week.

2102
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,720
There is nothing coming out this week.

2103
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:38,720
Very slow month.

2104
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,720
It is an incredibly slow month, but it's typical.

2105
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,720
That's true.

2106
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:47,960
Not even, you would think with this holiday weekend we just had, we would have had something

2107
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:48,960
a little...

2108
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:49,960
Typically, no.

2109
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:50,960
Yeah.

2110
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:51,960
Alright.

2111
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,120
Well, traveling on over to Japan to see if the story is a little different there.

2112
01:31:54,120 --> 01:31:58,120
Checking out the Japanese releases, you know, I gotta say, it's looking a little empty in

2113
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:59,120
Japan as well.

2114
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,760
We don't really have releases on the PlayStation 4 until July 16th.

2115
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:08,240
That's when Batman Arkham Knight finally gets its release, but again, that is on July 16th.

2116
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:10,800
Xbox One, pretty much the same story.

2117
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:16,000
So I'm gonna turn to the Wii U, which also, July 16th is when Yoshi's Woolly World comes

2118
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
out.

2119
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,760
Otherwise, it's slow over there.

2120
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:23,520
Even the Vita, the only thing the Vita has this week is Taiko no Tatujin V version comes

2121
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,120
out on July 9th.

2122
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,880
So that is pretty much the lone release there on the Vita for this coming week.

2123
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:35,120
And then lastly, on the 3DS, we have a little more on the 3DS this week.

2124
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:43,240
For July 9th, we have Chō to Sōchū Atsumare Sakyō no Tūsōshia Tachi comes out from

2125
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:44,820
Bandai Namco.

2126
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:50,640
And on July 11th, this is kind of a big deal, Yokoi Watch Busters.

2127
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:53,400
Is this, are these games, this might be like a spinoff game.

2128
01:32:53,400 --> 01:33:00,320
I don't think this is actual Yokoi Watch game, but these are like a little spinoff game.

2129
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,400
Those are available on the 3DS this week.

2130
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:06,680
And that might be part of the reason why some other games are staying away, because those

2131
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:10,760
games are pretty big over in Japan, and they're going to see if they're going to end up being

2132
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:14,840
a big deal here in the coming months when they finally release it here stateside.

2133
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,800
But otherwise, that's really it for Japanese releases.

2134
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:17,800
How about the UK?

2135
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,840
Um, some things, not really much.

2136
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:27,040
On the 7th, Geometry Wars 3 Dimensions, Worms World Party Remastered for PC.

2137
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:29,440
And on the 8th, Numa Breath of Life.

2138
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,440
That's it.

2139
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:35,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

2140
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Loki.

2141
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:44,160
So, apparently, Warner Brothers was well aware of the PC version condition for Arkham Knight

2142
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,200
when it was released.

2143
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:55,520
Basically, they had some anonymous QA testers that, I guess, were part of a report to Kotaku.

2144
01:33:55,520 --> 01:33:59,320
They were talking about, you know, basically, I will say that it's pretty rich for Warner

2145
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:03,080
Brothers to act like they had no idea the game was in such a horrible state.

2146
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:07,360
It's been like this for months, and all the problems we see now are the exact same, unchanged

2147
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,360
almost a year ago.

2148
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:14,840
So, that's too bad.

2149
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:19,160
How does that make you feel, Drew, as the consumer of Arkham Knight on PC, to know that

2150
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:21,760
Warner knew what a hot mess it was?

2151
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,760
Released it anyway.

2152
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,520
Grrr.

2153
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:28,920
I don't have a rant for this.

2154
01:34:28,920 --> 01:34:31,720
I'm internalizing it right now, I just don't have a rant for this.

2155
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:36,720
It's like, they, I don't know, because I feel like, you know, they're having to eat a lot

2156
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:42,200
of money now with all these returns and things, so I just feel like, I don't know, if they

2157
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:47,280
knew about it and still released it, it was not a healthy decision.

2158
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:48,760
I feel like I'm...

2159
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:52,220
Some executive needs to reevaluate if that's the right career for them.

2160
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:56,960
It's like I was being mad at Obsidian over KOTOR 2 not being finished before I got pushed

2161
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,000
out the door.

2162
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
It's kind of like that.

2163
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,840
They said that only 10% of the testers are devoted to the PC version, and they were saying

2164
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:09,760
that the console versions were not nearly as easy to work with as expected, and they

2165
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:19,720
were testing primarily at 720p, and they were worried that the spoilers, you know, for Arkham

2166
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:21,520
Knight would come out.

2167
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:22,520
Interesting.

2168
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,520
Let's see.

2169
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:28,560
Oh, don't worry, by the time it comes out in a playable form, I'll already be spoiled

2170
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:29,560
on it.

2171
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:39,120
Yeah, so PC testing firms that are used to stress test games on different hardware conditions,

2172
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:42,700
but I guess maybe they weren't testing it well enough, I don't know.

2173
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:47,600
But it sounds like that they were aware of the situation, and maybe, I don't know, once

2174
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,940
again, like, if you know it's broken, then why release it?

2175
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:55,560
Were these test systems imaginary?

2176
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:59,300
Because I know that I've been running a pretty good spec machine myself.

2177
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:02,340
I just think that they're just like, ah, fuck it, we're gonna release it and make money

2178
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:04,980
off of it, and we'll patch it out later, you know.

2179
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:05,980
I don't know.

2180
01:36:05,980 --> 01:36:12,580
I don't know what they thought, but the problem was, you know, maybe they made this decision

2181
01:36:12,580 --> 01:36:15,420
prior to knowing that Steam was gonna do the refunds?

2182
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:17,840
I don't know.

2183
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:18,840
It says bad either way.

2184
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:23,200
Wait, let me, quick comment from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster

2185
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:27,880
says, gee, delay to fix it or suffer humiliation, be forced to pull it from sale, and then try

2186
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,580
to fix it while getting criticized after, decisions, decisions.

2187
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:34,820
As Joan Hunter-Matt says, they probably evaluated that more people would be pissed that they

2188
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:39,320
delayed it again, rather than just release it and fix it later.

2189
01:36:39,320 --> 01:36:40,960
How do you come up with that?

2190
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,960
Whatever.

2191
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:42,960
Whatever.

2192
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:43,960
Anyway.

2193
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,340
And then there was a little bit of talk about the Harley Quinn DLC missions, or pre-order

2194
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:52,720
DLC that came with the game that you really, you add the pre-order of that to get it, otherwise

2195
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:56,040
you're gonna miss out on 30 minutes of gameplay.

2196
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:57,040
That's how long it was.

2197
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:58,040
30 minutes long.

2198
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:59,040
30 minutes?

2199
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:00,040
30 minutes of gameplay.

2200
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:01,040
Oh my god.

2201
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:07,440
But hey, I will have you know though, even though the PC version's broken, Batgirl DLC

2202
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,440
is coming out.

2203
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:13,480
So be sure to pre-order that shit, because I'm glad that they're working on that and

2204
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,720
not fixing the game.

2205
01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:23,320
Alright, one more story I have for you guys, and a suitable segue into the classic game

2206
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:24,400
of the week.

2207
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:27,920
The console that never was, the Super Nintendo PlayStation.

2208
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,740
Yes, that's right, the Super Nintendo PlayStation.

2209
01:37:30,740 --> 01:37:33,560
You know, I bet a lot of you have probably already seen this on Facebook and other social

2210
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:39,120
media, but yeah, this really caught wildfire via Reddit, as some things tend to go viral

2211
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,920
over there.

2212
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:46,800
And this guy on Reddit posted that he had the device, was posting pictures, and I think

2213
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,840
he even posted a video of what this whole thing was.

2214
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,720
And basically, you know, it was the whole, my dad worked for Nintendo type of thing,

2215
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,700
although it was a little more complicated than that.

2216
01:37:55,700 --> 01:37:59,800
My dad worked for a company, and somebody he used to work with worked at Nintendo, and

2217
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:04,040
the dad's company went bankrupt, and the dad found it in a box of junk that he was supposed

2218
01:38:04,040 --> 01:38:05,040
to throw out.

2219
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:09,960
Now, here's the thing, the dude can't find a power cord that works on the system, so

2220
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,320
he can't, like, just plug it in and play with it.

2221
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:18,680
So we don't know what the thing does, or what this mysterious cartridge that's also with

2222
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:19,680
it.

2223
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:20,680
Yes, I'm sure it'll be-

2224
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:21,680
It said something on the cartridge, though.

2225
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:22,680
It did.

2226
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,860
I'm sure it would be impossible to, I don't know, pick up a universal power supply and

2227
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:26,400
figure out, you know...

2228
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,000
Yeah, they're not that difficult to make.

2229
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:34,880
Well, a lot of people are saying to be very careful, because this is very valuable hardware,

2230
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,200
so you don't want to just plug any old power supply into it.

2231
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,560
Well, doesn't that say what kind of voltage it is?

2232
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:39,560
It does.

2233
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:41,160
It says 7.6 volts.

2234
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:42,160
It says right there-

2235
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:43,160
There you go!

2236
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,160
That's gonna be too hard.

2237
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:48,880
Just find a 7.6 volts DC power adapter, plug it in, done.

2238
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:53,640
But I can also understand the whole, I don't want to, you know, maybe what's labeled isn't

2239
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:56,880
what's really in it, because these are test units.

2240
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:01,300
Just saying, you know, I can understand when this thing could be thousands of dollars to

2241
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:04,480
a collector, why you might not want it to catch fire.

2242
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,120
It's not gonna catch fire.

2243
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:07,720
10-6-92?

2244
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:13,120
Yeah, that's probably around the time frame when they were working on it.

2245
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:14,680
I can't read this.

2246
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:15,680
Yeah.

2247
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:20,440
So, anyhow, let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognet.com.

2248
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:23,840
Dungeon Buster says it's been sitting in a box of junk for years, so who knows what condition

2249
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:24,840
it's in.

2250
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,400
Hey, those Super Nintendos, though, they can take a beating.

2251
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:31,000
Like they'll turn an awful, awful color, but they work.

2252
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,040
I think Dan had one that fell down two flights of stairs and it still worked.

2253
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:35,440
Oh yeah, my Super Nintendo still works.

2254
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:38,000
But I bought Clue at a flea market a while ago.

2255
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,880
You can actually clean that discoloration off of it, too.

2256
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:41,880
Oh, can you?

2257
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:45,280
They have like something meant for that, actually, that yellowing.

2258
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,280
Nice.

2259
01:39:46,280 --> 01:39:48,400
Yeah, it was pretty hardcore plastic.

2260
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:54,080
We remember talking one time about the Game Boy that survived a bomb blast.

2261
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:59,280
Oh yeah, because they have it in the museum at the Nintendo store in New York City.

2262
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,280
Yep.

2263
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:01,280
Yeah, yeah.

2264
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:02,280
Crazy.

2265
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:09,400
That is a good segue, I think, for us to get into the classic game of the week.

2266
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:11,640
Dark Soccer is going to boot up her Super Nintendo PlayStation.

2267
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:17,080
Just kidding, she doesn't have one, but she does have a Super Nintendo and a PlayStation.

2268
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,080
Several of each.

2269
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:22,560
So smush them together and step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

2270
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,820
you kids should be checking out this game this week.

2271
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:25,820
Which actually...

2272
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:26,820
But don't do drugs.

2273
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,640
Which actually, I think, comes from one of those systems, doesn't it?

2274
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,640
Don't do drugs.

2275
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:31,220
Yes, don't do drugs.

2276
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:33,620
Or if you're, you know, going to do drugs.

2277
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:36,460
Do it with people watching you so they can laugh at you.

2278
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:37,460
Alright.

2279
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:38,460
And then put it on YouTube.

2280
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:39,460
Have a doctor's permission slip.

2281
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:40,460
Ooh, Oxycontin.

2282
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:42,820
I'm kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.

2283
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:49,260
Okay, so the game of the week actually is a PlayStation game called LSD.

2284
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:50,260
Don't do drugs.

2285
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:51,260
Yes, don't do drugs.

2286
01:40:51,260 --> 01:40:56,860
Also known as LSD Dream Emulator, which was released in Japan in 1998 and it came out

2287
01:40:56,860 --> 01:41:02,680
on the PlayStation based on a dream journal that one of the staff members at Asmik Ace

2288
01:41:02,680 --> 01:41:05,380
Entertainment had been keeping for over a decade.

2289
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:06,380
His name...

2290
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:14,700
Actually, I don't think it's a he because it sounds like a girl name, but Hiroko Nishikawa.

2291
01:41:14,700 --> 01:41:19,700
Anyway, there were three products that were released about the journal.

2292
01:41:19,700 --> 01:41:23,860
One of them is a music CD called LSD and Remixes.

2293
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:27,660
And Lovely Sweet Dream, both of those were limited.

2294
01:41:27,660 --> 01:41:33,220
And then the game itself, because it is just so weird, has a kind of a cult following on

2295
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:35,420
it.

2296
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:41,180
It also has been referenced that it could be sort of like a reference to the drug and

2297
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:45,500
the, you know, surreal state of mind that it can put one in.

2298
01:41:45,500 --> 01:41:52,820
Although there's different phrases that are attributed to it, like in LVS Dream, so in

2299
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:56,660
Life the Sensuous Dream, or in Limbo the Silent Dream.

2300
01:41:56,660 --> 01:42:02,380
There was a fan remake actually in progress since October 2011.

2301
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:05,420
There's a public alpha build out of it for Windows.

2302
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:10,580
So basically, it's a first person wander type of game.

2303
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:14,420
You can use the left and right directional buttons to look around, the up and down is

2304
01:42:14,420 --> 01:42:18,500
to make you move forward or backwards, the front shoulder buttons turn around, back shoulder

2305
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:21,580
is to strafe.

2306
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:23,780
And then you can hold the X button to run.

2307
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:27,820
You hear your footprint, your footsteps through the whole game too.

2308
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:30,220
And it's just depending on whatever type of environment that you're in.

2309
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:33,180
And then this kind of odd music in the background.

2310
01:42:33,180 --> 01:42:35,500
So basically you're in like a dream world.

2311
01:42:35,500 --> 01:42:38,300
You walk around and explore, you look around.

2312
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:45,460
If you bump into walls, you'll go into another dream because you are being linked into it.

2313
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:50,740
If you bump into people, animals, or special objects, you'll get an even weirder environment.

2314
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:55,340
Silent Stream is up to 10 minutes and then you'll wake up and then you'll be sent back

2315
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:56,700
to the menu.

2316
01:42:56,700 --> 01:43:01,380
If you fall off a cliff or into a hole, you will wake up immediately.

2317
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:06,860
And you get a graph that tracks the player's state of mind, whether it's up or down or

2318
01:43:06,860 --> 01:43:11,460
static or dynamic, depending on the areas that you go through.

2319
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:15,460
And different states will affect your future dreams.

2320
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:22,860
So there are some different things that will happen over, like you'll get eyes on the walls

2321
01:43:22,860 --> 01:43:25,380
that will stare at you.

2322
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:31,660
You can visit the same place several times, but it will change in different subtle ways.

2323
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:33,860
You'll get new items to encounter.

2324
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:39,780
You'll get new creatures, including a nymph that flies around, a wild horse running on

2325
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:40,780
the prairie.

2326
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:46,860
There's a man that fills up an entire room, a pterodactyl, and a face on legs.

2327
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:49,300
Moisturize me.

2328
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:50,300
What?

2329
01:43:50,300 --> 01:43:51,300
Yes, I went there.

2330
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:52,300
A Doctor Who reference.

2331
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:53,300
Fantastic.

2332
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:58,100
You'll also meet a man in a gray trench coat who people have called the shadow man or the

2333
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:01,620
gray man, and he glides only in one direction.

2334
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:04,700
He doesn't have any walking animation.

2335
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:11,700
You can walk around him and see his full model, but his head is always slightly bent

2336
01:44:11,700 --> 01:44:13,020
toward you.

2337
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:16,940
If you get too close to him, the screen will flash and he'll disappear.

2338
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:20,700
And then it removes your ability to recall the dream.

2339
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:24,380
So you can, you know, you get the ability to revisit some of the dreams, but these are

2340
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:25,900
the ones that you can't.

2341
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:33,180
You also get an abyss demon who lures you to a site that you just can't get to.

2342
01:44:33,180 --> 01:44:37,420
And then he will appear like, and make you go into a new game.

2343
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:42,280
He also will, there's sometimes a giant man in a wall who will headbutt you.

2344
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:48,020
So it's just a bunch of weirdness and you can, you know, after about 15 to 30 days of

2345
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:54,700
playing, you get the flashback, which is about two to four minutes of going back to some

2346
01:44:54,700 --> 01:44:57,500
of the previous dreams.

2347
01:44:57,500 --> 01:44:58,500
The...

2348
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:00,580
Kaijuto wants to know, is Freddy in it?

2349
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:01,580
No.

2350
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:02,580
It's me.

2351
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:03,980
You know what this reminds me of?

2352
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:09,020
Just looking at footage of this, it looks like a first person version of a game I heard

2353
01:45:09,020 --> 01:45:15,560
of called Yume Nikki, which is kind of a, I guess, more of a dream or nightmare simulator.

2354
01:45:15,560 --> 01:45:16,980
But that was like third person type stuff.

2355
01:45:16,980 --> 01:45:17,980
It's very strange.

2356
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:24,220
It looks like one of those fucked up VR demos used to download from a BBS in the 1990s.

2357
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:28,180
There's, the music in this game though is really striking for this.

2358
01:45:28,220 --> 01:45:36,020
It was composed by Osamu Sato, has 500 patterns of background music.

2359
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:44,860
And the soundtrack was compiled into the LSD and remixes.

2360
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:50,020
And there was also an album called Lucy in the Sky with Dynamites.

2361
01:45:50,020 --> 01:45:54,860
And yeah, so it's a really freaky game.

2362
01:45:54,860 --> 01:46:00,740
I actually have played an emulated version of it once and it gave me nightmares.

2363
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:04,420
So I probably wouldn't recommend it to too many people.

2364
01:46:04,420 --> 01:46:08,460
So don't play this game for the first time in Classic Game of the Week history.

2365
01:46:08,460 --> 01:46:10,300
It was the trench coat guy.

2366
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:11,500
It was just the weirdest thing.

2367
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:19,060
But I mean, I could make up a dream game, you know, like a literal dream game.

2368
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:23,460
The like from weird dreams that I have, because I have weird dreams all the fucking time.

2369
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:26,540
And mine would probably be more interesting and better rendered.

2370
01:46:26,540 --> 01:46:31,060
If I can play Slenderman and still always sleep at night, you can play LSD.

2371
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:35,340
You still haven't played that Five Nights at Freddy's that I got you.

2372
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:38,820
I still apparently have been given an open challenge to go through at least four nights.

2373
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:39,820
Good luck.

2374
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:43,380
I made it through two and then died on the third, so whatever.

2375
01:46:43,380 --> 01:46:45,020
All right.

2376
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:50,780
There it is, your Classic Game of the Week LSD Dream Emulator for the PlayStation 1.

2377
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:54,500
There's nothing quite like it out there, so check that out.

2378
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,420
Or don't, because it'll give you horrible nightmares.

2379
01:46:56,420 --> 01:46:58,220
Hey, we're going to take a quick break.

2380
01:46:58,220 --> 01:47:02,260
But when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, hey, something very special

2381
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:04,180
for you guys tonight.

2382
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:07,940
Because Drew is here and we have a blast from the past, I thought, you know what?

2383
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:11,860
Let's do a segment that we haven't done in a long time here on OLR.

2384
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:17,660
So tonight, the return of Video Game Match Game is coming back.

2385
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:27,860
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

2386
01:47:27,860 --> 01:47:34,020
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live with our 604th episode in progress

2387
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:37,860
for this July the 5th of 2015.

2388
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:40,860
And we're going to get right back into it here, because we've got a busy segment coming

2389
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:41,860
up.

2390
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:44,300
We're already running a little long, and we're throwing a match game into it.

2391
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:48,300
But of course, if you're just joining us live, we have Intern Drew coming back to the

2392
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:51,100
show for the first time in four years.

2393
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:52,100
You're welcome.

2394
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:53,100
You having fun tonight?

2395
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:54,500
I didn't ask for you to come.

2396
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:55,500
You just showed up.

2397
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:56,500
I'm just kidding.

2398
01:47:56,500 --> 01:48:02,060
A certain somebody walked by a certain someone else's cube at a certain locat and said, hey,

2399
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:03,140
you coming to the show?

2400
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:06,760
It's always good to see some old school people here in the studio.

2401
01:48:06,760 --> 01:48:08,820
We like the new school people, too.

2402
01:48:08,820 --> 01:48:10,580
We like a little bit of both.

2403
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:11,580
Just like us, better.

2404
01:48:11,580 --> 01:48:12,580
Whatever.

2405
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:13,580
All right.

2406
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:14,860
We're going to get back into it.

2407
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:16,500
We've got some rapid fire news coming at you.

2408
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:17,500
Loki.

2409
01:48:17,500 --> 01:48:25,260
So there's a game called Zero Gravity AX that's supposed to be coming to the Wii U, and it's

2410
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:30,900
basically an indie version of F-Zero, and it looks pretty amazing.

2411
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:36,140
However, unfortunately, as cool as it looks, they decided to take it down, because it's

2412
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:40,420
a little too much like F-Zero, like literally the ship that they put in there, that's straight

2413
01:48:40,420 --> 01:48:41,540
out of F-Zero.

2414
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:45,580
So they're retooling it right now.

2415
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:51,220
Basically the comment was, we're going to cancel the project due to the big amount of

2416
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:56,260
negative feedback in the discussion about the Blue Falcon, and copyright made our decision

2417
01:48:56,260 --> 01:48:57,260
easy.

2418
01:48:57,260 --> 01:49:00,340
The footage on the page was an earlier build and a prototype.

2419
01:49:00,340 --> 01:49:05,860
It never should be in the final game in this form, as written down on the Kickstarter page.

2420
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:11,740
However, we have learned that from that, we understand that now that an F-Zero indie

2421
01:49:11,740 --> 01:49:15,140
remake from a small dev team is not what you guys want.

2422
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:18,580
We thank everybody who shared our campaign and who gave us feedback.

2423
01:49:18,580 --> 01:49:19,700
So they'll probably come back at some point.

2424
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:20,700
It looks pretty amazing.

2425
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:26,080
It may look like an F-Zero game that was done by an indie team.

2426
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:30,180
It's sad that an indie team can pull off something that cool, but Nintendo doesn't want to bother

2427
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:31,180
with it.

2428
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:32,940
Oh, it's great that an indie team can pull off something that cool.

2429
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:38,140
I know, I'm just saying it's sad that Nintendo doesn't want to, but look at the potential

2430
01:49:38,140 --> 01:49:39,140
of this.

2431
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:40,140
It looks amazing.

2432
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:42,300
Follow the example of Axiom Verge, for instance.

2433
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:45,180
Yeah, Axiom Verge turned out great.

2434
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:47,900
I think there's a lot they can still do with that there.

2435
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:53,740
I even liked a game like Blur, which kind of was like F-Zero meets Mario Kart, but yet

2436
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:55,820
the public really rejected that game.

2437
01:49:55,820 --> 01:50:00,980
But I thought it was better than people made it out to be, that's for sure.

2438
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:07,780
In Australia, they have now banned some more video games, and the reason for this is that

2439
01:50:07,780 --> 01:50:16,220
they've adopted a new video game classification model to help age-rate digital games on Steam

2440
01:50:16,220 --> 01:50:24,540
and stuff like that, and based on that, they have refused classification to 220 different

2441
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:25,540
games.

2442
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:26,540
Geez.

2443
01:50:26,540 --> 01:50:34,460
And some of the games that are banned are Douchebag Beach Club and Drunk Driver, obviously

2444
01:50:34,460 --> 01:50:38,980
these go figure games.

2445
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:46,220
So apparently this is within a four month times ban that these 220 games have been refused

2446
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:53,780
classification, which is apparently four times the amount in the last past decade.

2447
01:50:53,780 --> 01:51:00,300
What was that game that was on GameCube, the one that had the, it was so bad, and then

2448
01:51:00,300 --> 01:51:02,980
it turned out there was like an underage girl in it, and it was really really awkward.

2449
01:51:02,980 --> 01:51:03,980
The guy game!

2450
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:04,980
The guy game.

2451
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:05,980
Oh, guy game, yep.

2452
01:51:05,980 --> 01:51:07,980
I'm sure that got banned.

2453
01:51:07,980 --> 01:51:12,500
Best way to pimp your game in other countries, say it was so hardcore, it got banned in Australia.

2454
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,780
Banned in Australia.

2455
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:16,660
Come play, what was that, Douchebag Beach Club?

2456
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:18,020
Douchebag Beach Club.

2457
01:51:18,020 --> 01:51:20,300
Douchebag Beach Club, banned in Australia.

2458
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:22,300
Or Drunk Driver.

2459
01:51:22,820 --> 01:51:27,340
Oh my god, anyway, well if you want to play something a little more friendly that's not

2460
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:31,500
going to be banned in Australia, because it's paint, it's not blood, it's paint, of course

2461
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:34,060
I'm talking about Splatoon.

2462
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:38,660
And Splatoon, you know, still rolling out some features and updates, you know, obviously

2463
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:41,740
we were going back and forth a little bit on the teen cat and dog thing, which was part

2464
01:51:41,740 --> 01:51:46,380
of the Splatfest that happened on the 4th of July, however before that happened, Tower

2465
01:51:46,380 --> 01:51:49,940
Control was actually released into ranked mode.

2466
01:51:50,180 --> 01:51:55,300
Tower Control is maps that have one floating tower in the center, and you're going to hop

2467
01:51:55,300 --> 01:51:58,420
on it and ride it towards the opponent's base.

2468
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:02,660
Holding the tower takes you further into the enemy territory, but of course that's going

2469
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:05,660
to leave you a little more vulnerable to getting splatted.

2470
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:10,380
So you have to use teamwork, which is interesting because there's no voice chat, but I'm not

2471
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:12,420
going to be that guy this week.

2472
01:52:12,420 --> 01:52:17,380
That is totally a ripoff of, what was it, Harmonics' first person shooter, they had

2473
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:18,780
something exactly like that.

2474
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:23,580
Well you know what though, it's still variety, I think that's a good thing, I think it's

2475
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:27,620
a good thing for Splatoon to keep adding those features and more fun for the game or what

2476
01:52:27,620 --> 01:52:28,620
have you.

2477
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:34,460
And by the way, with all that, the update to version 1.3.0, and some of the changes,

2478
01:52:34,460 --> 01:52:37,460
for example, when there are more members on one team than the other and the matchmaking

2479
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:42,880
process takes too long, members from the same team will be able to battle each other, interesting.

2480
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:47,860
Some ability adjustments to Ninja Squid, Stealth Jump, and Ink Resistance up, and yeah, so

2481
01:52:47,860 --> 01:52:53,820
lots of little things here and there, so check that out.

2482
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:57,700
Also in the world of Shovel Knight, Shovel Knight is coming to retail, Shovel Knight

2483
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:02,740
will be released on the Wii U, the 3DS, the PlayStation 4, and the Xbox One at retail.

2484
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:07,120
The date, October 13th for North America, October 16th in Europe.

2485
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:11,460
You will get everything that's been released so far, and there's going to be some other

2486
01:53:11,460 --> 01:53:12,780
stuff as well.

2487
01:53:12,780 --> 01:53:19,260
The Specter Knight campaign, the King Knight's campaign, battle mode, and body swap mode,

2488
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:23,940
so you can do that, which will allow you to change Shovel Knight into a lady and Shield

2489
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:28,380
Knight into a dude, so you can swap genders there, so there you go, and you can swap the

2490
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:30,460
rest of the cast if you want.

2491
01:53:30,460 --> 01:53:34,460
You also get an instruction booklet with the physical copies, so I think there's going

2492
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:39,140
to be a lot of people excited there about those Shovel Knight releases, which, speaking

2493
01:53:39,140 --> 01:53:44,820
of these physical releases, Wii U and 3DS are apparently going to be getting something

2494
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:46,620
a little bit special.

2495
01:53:46,620 --> 01:53:51,760
The Plague of Shadows and, no I'm sorry, those are actually, oops, sorry, misspoke, that's

2496
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:55,060
already coming into the game, the Plague of Shadows and the battle mode, you can tell

2497
01:53:55,060 --> 01:54:00,080
I have not played either of those yet, but apparently something is going to be happening

2498
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:04,860
for the Nintendo versions that's similar to the God of War content and the Sony one, or

2499
01:54:04,860 --> 01:54:07,220
the Battletoads and the Xbox One.

2500
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:12,760
So something will be happening there on the Nintendo platforms, but we don't know exactly

2501
01:54:12,760 --> 01:54:14,600
what it is.

2502
01:54:14,600 --> 01:54:16,920
Could it be a battle with Ganon?

2503
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:19,780
Something where maybe you work with Mario and Luigi?

2504
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:21,060
Who knows?

2505
01:54:21,060 --> 01:54:22,060
It's always Ganon.

2506
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:23,060
Amiibo support!

2507
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:24,060
Amiibo support?

2508
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:25,060
Oh please?

2509
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:26,060
Please, please?

2510
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:31,060
Dire Sakura, what do you have for us?

2511
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:33,980
Well, how many people really like Star Wars?

2512
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:35,420
A bunch.

2513
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:41,960
So Star Wars Battle, I'm sorry I'm still full of the delicious kettle corn, thanks Rob.

2514
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:47,540
Star Wars Battlefront is not going to be doing space battles, there are no space maps, but

2515
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:56,700
now also there will not be infantry battles, and there will not, at least on a map that

2516
01:54:56,700 --> 01:54:58,660
is based on the Death Star.

2517
01:54:58,660 --> 01:55:03,220
So there's not going to be basically a Death Star map, but they said stay tuned for more

2518
01:55:03,220 --> 01:55:06,940
details, so whatever, there's no Death Star, I'm not interested.

2519
01:55:06,940 --> 01:55:13,020
This is looking less and less like Battlefront.

2520
01:55:13,020 --> 01:55:21,980
And then Tekken, woo hoo Tekken, and you know what makes me happy, Kuma!

2521
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:31,940
Basically Tekken 7 has already been doing some teasers, and there have been, I'd probably

2522
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:38,540
say a few more different interesting things, but now there was, said that there's going

2523
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:46,500
to be a major announcement on July 7th, and I wish, I hope that it's gone.

2524
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:51,580
As in the character, gone, because.

2525
01:55:51,580 --> 01:55:52,700
Because dinosaurs.

2526
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:53,700
Because dinosaurs.

2527
01:55:53,740 --> 01:56:02,460
Well, and also that, and you might, there's been an allusion to Jack coming back as Jack

2528
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:04,980
7, so that's kind of cool.

2529
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:05,980
Anything's better than P-Jack.

2530
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:12,940
Alright, we'll see what becomes of this big Tekken tease soon.

2531
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:17,100
In the meantime, we're going to go to our Facebook and Google Plus communities, because

2532
01:56:17,100 --> 01:56:20,100
you smoosh those words together and you get foogle.

2533
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:31,540
It is time for the Foogle Question of the Week, where we ask our fan communities a question

2534
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:33,980
and mull over some of your answers.

2535
01:56:33,980 --> 01:56:38,940
This week we asked about the Red Ash Kickstarter, and we said, you know, Comcept is of course

2536
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:44,020
behind the previously successful Mighty No. 9 Kickstarter, and you'll see its legend,

2537
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:47,380
so Mega Man legend, wink wink, nudge nudge.

2538
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:48,380
What do you think about this Kickstarter?

2539
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:53,180
Are you excited, or do you have concerns when Mighty No. 9 has yet to hit shelves?

2540
01:56:53,180 --> 01:57:01,100
Let's see what y'all thought over on Facebook, where Silent Tom said, I understand developers

2541
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:04,460
should always be striving for the next big thing, but I feel they may have jumped the

2542
01:57:04,460 --> 01:57:11,020
gun on this, not even seeing how the public responded to Mighty No. 9, seems a bit strange.

2543
01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:14,820
Raginator says, I have no opinion, I never played the Mega Man Legends games, so I have

2544
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:18,700
no emotional ties to the series, plus I never Kickstarted anything, and I have no interest

2545
01:57:18,700 --> 01:57:20,500
to do so now.

2546
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:24,620
Andy R. said, the game itself doesn't interest me much, so I think I'll pass, I've generally

2547
01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:28,500
adopted a wait and see approach to Kickstarter, so if the game ends up coming out and is good,

2548
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:29,900
I'll pick it up then.

2549
01:57:29,900 --> 01:57:34,820
Tech 2030 said, not too hype on Mega Man, so not too interested in this, only Mega Man

2550
01:57:34,820 --> 01:57:39,660
related remake and successor I'm interested in is the Battle Network series.

2551
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:43,540
Interesting, so I don't know if we just didn't hear from enough people this week or what,

2552
01:57:43,540 --> 01:57:49,060
but Facebook seems pretty, uh, not into it, not feeling it.

2553
01:57:49,620 --> 01:57:52,660
Interesting, that was a very small sampling than what we usually get though, so we'll

2554
01:57:52,660 --> 01:57:55,860
see, but let's, let's, let's see if the same was on Google Plus.

2555
01:57:55,860 --> 01:58:01,500
Over on Google Plus, we had ActDeft who said, I think this is not the first time something

2556
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:05,300
like this has happened, granted this is a AAA title and people are still gonna be mad

2557
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:09,500
after they fix and re-release the game, but if the game, I'm sorry, that is from last

2558
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:13,100
week, what the hell am I doing, I'm starting to read that, I'm like, wait a minute, this

2559
01:58:13,100 --> 01:58:18,620
is about fixing the game, hold up, sorry, when I went into my notifications on Google

2560
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:23,420
Plus, it showed me that post at the top, did nobody answer on Google Plus this week?

2561
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:24,540
What's going on?

2562
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:30,500
No, we had one answer this week from Redertainment on Google Plus, who said, I have a problem

2563
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:36,540
with entities using Kickstarter for multiple projects, shouldn't the success of one project

2564
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:39,260
be used to fund other projects?

2565
01:58:39,260 --> 01:58:46,180
Hmm, so that's a pretty big no, again, that's a smaller sampling than we usually get on

2566
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:49,180
the FOOGLE question, I don't know if Facebook just didn't decide to show it to people this

2567
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:56,820
week or what, but I'm not feeling it on this one, it seems, so I'd welcome your emails,

2568
01:58:56,820 --> 01:59:00,780
if you feel differently on this, participate at orangelandrado.com, I think we already

2569
01:59:00,780 --> 01:59:06,660
discussed that here at length here in studio, so I don't know if we want to revisit it.

2570
01:59:06,660 --> 01:59:13,020
With that particular comment though, the success of one project, the game is not even out yet,

2571
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:20,220
so we're thinking cost of development plus profit hasn't really gone into retail production

2572
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:24,220
yet and actually sold some stuff, so they would still need money to fund the development

2573
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:31,300
of another game, at least until, this is a fairly new concept for people, or concept

2574
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:37,780
I suppose, but still and all, my answer though is not necessarily.

2575
01:59:37,780 --> 01:59:45,940
Alright, let's move on, and we're going to get to some more news, so that was it for

2576
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:48,980
the FOOGLE question of the week, so Loki, what do you have for us?

2577
01:59:48,980 --> 01:59:57,120
So Mad Catz, they are having some debt problems, and they are basically securing some extra

2578
01:59:57,120 --> 02:00:04,860
credit or further credit line to allow them to release Rock Band 4, and it's basically

2579
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:13,340
going to be, you know, whether they end up defaulting on their debt, it's all depending

2580
02:00:13,340 --> 02:00:18,260
on how well Rock Band 4 does, which hopefully they'll do well.

2581
02:00:18,260 --> 02:00:21,480
Hear that, buy Rock Band 4, do it now.

2582
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:25,460
Buy Rock Band 4 or you're going to drive this company bankrupt, that's what happened.

2583
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:29,060
Mad Catz isn't really, I mean they're mostly peripherals, they tried kind of getting into

2584
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:33,500
game development a little bit, and I mean, I guess they are publishing Rock Band 4, but

2585
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:38,740
aside from that, I mean they haven't really done a whole ton, so I don't know, and a lot

2586
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:44,220
of their bread and butter was those Rock Band peripherals, and it's been a while, so I don't

2587
02:00:44,220 --> 02:00:45,220
know.

2588
02:00:45,220 --> 02:00:47,020
Buy extra copies of Rock Band 4.

2589
02:00:47,020 --> 02:00:51,380
Buy copies for your friends and family members and so forth.

2590
02:00:51,380 --> 02:00:55,700
Alright, let's get into one more story here before we get to Match Game tonight about

2591
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:57,260
Dragon Quest.

2592
02:00:57,260 --> 02:01:00,660
I'm sure y'all are excited, Drew, you've got to be a Dragon Quest fan, if you like your

2593
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:01,660
JRPGs, right?

2594
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:02,660
Oh yeah.

2595
02:01:02,820 --> 02:01:07,420
How much did it piss you off that they did Dragon Quest 7 and 8 versions on the 3DS and

2596
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:10,260
they were like, nah, we're not going to release them in America, they're not coming out.

2597
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:11,260
I loved 8.

2598
02:01:11,260 --> 02:01:12,900
I know, 8 was great.

2599
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:14,740
Cor, blimey, I loved 8.

2600
02:01:14,740 --> 02:01:21,060
Anyhow, hey, there is hope, apparently these games may be heading west at some point.

2601
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:27,340
This is in speaking at the Japan Expo in Paris, the creator apparently made a little slip

2602
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:32,300
up about the games possibly coming out, so getting a little bit localized there, so some

2603
02:01:32,340 --> 02:01:38,380
tweets talking about 3DS for Dragon Quest 7 and 8 getting localized, I guess the translator

2604
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:43,700
got upset when that was announced, so hmm, does look promising, although surprisingly

2605
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:46,980
they wouldn't have said anything about that at E3, because that would have made a great

2606
02:01:46,980 --> 02:01:48,700
little holiday thing.

2607
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:54,340
ActDeft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, I want Theatrhythm Dragon Quest in

2608
02:01:54,340 --> 02:01:56,500
America now.

2609
02:01:56,500 --> 02:01:58,060
Yes please.

2610
02:01:58,060 --> 02:02:05,420
All right, well folks, I think it is time to do some matching, and we're going to bring

2611
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:10,780
up a segment that we haven't done in a very long time, it's time to play Video Game Match

2612
02:02:10,780 --> 02:02:15,620
Game.

2613
02:02:15,620 --> 02:02:19,940
I do this just to play that song, because I love this, the porny match game thing is

2614
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:21,460
the best thing ever.

2615
02:02:21,460 --> 02:02:26,220
All right, so in order to play the game, we're going to need some contestants, so I'm going

2616
02:02:26,220 --> 02:02:37,980
to say in chat here, if you want to play match game in chat, say, pick me for match

2617
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:39,460
game now.

2618
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:43,580
Okay, so we're going to find a chatter there in the chatroom to play match game, and then

2619
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:47,620
we're going to open up the Skype line here in just a moment for a contestant as well,

2620
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:51,780
1877 Game O.L.R., username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, so instead of Team Cat and Team

2621
02:02:51,780 --> 02:02:54,620
Dog, we have Team Skype and Team Chatter.

2622
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:59,900
So if you forgot how match game works, this is how it works, is that we're going to read

2623
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:05,440
some phrases, and in those phrases, there will be a blank, and your job as the contestant

2624
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:09,380
is to match your hosts here in studio.

2625
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:14,300
Now joining us in match game tonight are myself, Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura, who's playing for

2626
02:03:14,300 --> 02:03:24,100
the Taco Foundation, Loki, who's playing for the Let's Lower the Time It Takes Burger King

2627
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:36,100
to Make a Very Simple Order Foundation, Drew, who's playing for the AARP this week because

2628
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:39,100
he's 30.

2629
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:44,220
And of course, joining us in studio, playing to feed his addiction to Final Fantasy Record

2630
02:03:44,220 --> 02:03:50,380
Keeper is Alan, Alan is going to be joining us as well, so you have five people here in

2631
02:03:50,380 --> 02:03:51,960
studio that you can play with.

2632
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:57,040
So if you want to call and be a participant on match game, call us now, 1877 Game O.L.R.,

2633
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:59,420
our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2634
02:03:59,420 --> 02:04:03,180
Now somebody needs to put their neck out there and do this because this is going to be very

2635
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:06,420
embarrassing if I don't get any stinking contestants for the game tonight.

2636
02:04:06,420 --> 02:04:11,020
So if you want to be a contestant on Skype, 1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange

2637
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:14,080
Lounge Radio, call us right now.

2638
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:18,600
Fair warning to people who have not played O.L.R. match game before, this does sometimes

2639
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:21,480
devolve into cards against Orange Lounge Radio.

2640
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:22,480
Yes, a little bit.

2641
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:23,480
Be prepared.

2642
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:24,480
Be prepared.

2643
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:25,480
Be very prepared.

2644
02:04:25,480 --> 02:04:29,200
So there's a little bit of a buffer between the time, I should have said that at the start

2645
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:33,920
that somebody should call us, there's going to be a little bit of a buffer between when

2646
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:36,840
the message gets out there and when we'll actually start getting calls.

2647
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:43,960
So again, if you want to play match game, 1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange

2648
02:04:43,960 --> 02:04:46,020
Lounge Radio.

2649
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:51,300
No act deaf, nobody's called yet, so if you want a guaranteed you can get in, you can

2650
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:53,820
do that.

2651
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:55,660
Are people upset that we're bringing back match game?

2652
02:04:55,660 --> 02:04:59,260
When we used to do this, it would be like 20 people all calling at once.

2653
02:04:59,260 --> 02:05:00,260
Just do it.

2654
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:02,060
Don't let your dreams be dreams.

2655
02:05:02,060 --> 02:05:04,840
Just do it.

2656
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:06,260
Is that the Shia LaBeouf thing?

2657
02:05:06,260 --> 02:05:07,260
It is.

2658
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:08,260
I thought it was.

2659
02:05:08,260 --> 02:05:09,660
I didn't know what that was all about.

2660
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:10,660
Oh, thank God.

2661
02:05:10,660 --> 02:05:11,660
We have a call coming in.

2662
02:05:11,660 --> 02:05:12,660
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2663
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:13,660
Who's this?

2664
02:05:14,300 --> 02:05:16,500
This is Brad from Pod Culture.

2665
02:05:16,500 --> 02:05:18,260
Brad from Pod Culture?

2666
02:05:18,260 --> 02:05:19,900
You here to play the match game?

2667
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:20,900
Hi, Brad.

2668
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:25,740
Hey, well, I'm just forget I've never done one of your damn games with y'all before,

2669
02:05:25,740 --> 02:05:26,740
so why the hell not?

2670
02:05:26,740 --> 02:05:28,020
Why the hell not?

2671
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:29,740
I am with you there.

2672
02:05:29,740 --> 02:05:32,420
All right, so let's see.

2673
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:36,380
We don't have a lot of people in chat that really want to play this week, so.

2674
02:05:36,380 --> 02:05:37,540
The hell with all of you.

2675
02:05:37,540 --> 02:05:39,540
The hell with all of you.

2676
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:40,540
So let's see.

2677
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:41,540
I'm going to narrow it down.

2678
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:43,300
All right, heads or tails?

2679
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:44,300
Heads or tails?

2680
02:05:44,300 --> 02:05:45,300
Cats or dogs?

2681
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:46,300
Tails.

2682
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:47,300
Tails.

2683
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:50,700
All right, you're going to be playing against Zappi tonight.

2684
02:05:50,700 --> 02:05:57,020
Zappi is going to be your opponent here, so I'm going to make sure send your answers to

2685
02:05:57,020 --> 02:05:58,020
me.

2686
02:05:58,020 --> 02:05:59,020
Congrats.

2687
02:05:59,020 --> 02:06:02,460
You are playing against Brad.

2688
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:03,780
Poor Act Deaf got shut out.

2689
02:06:03,780 --> 02:06:04,780
You beat him.

2690
02:06:04,780 --> 02:06:08,260
You just beat him by a moment on the phone lines, and there you go.

2691
02:06:08,260 --> 02:06:10,120
And then Zappi beat him there in the chat room.

2692
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:12,240
So it's going to be Zappi versus Brad tonight.

2693
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:14,400
All right, finally, we can do this.

2694
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,160
All right, Brad, you comfortable with the rules?

2695
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:17,160
You know how this works?

2696
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:20,160
You're going to read a sentence, and there's going to be a blank?

2697
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,160
Yeah.

2698
02:06:21,160 --> 02:06:22,200
All right.

2699
02:06:22,200 --> 02:06:24,800
Now give us a little bit of time.

2700
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,560
Don't just shout out your answer, Brad.

2701
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:29,200
We have to tell you we're ready for your answer.

2702
02:06:29,200 --> 02:06:30,240
So listen carefully.

2703
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:31,240
Here it is.

2704
02:06:31,240 --> 02:06:32,240
Okay.

2705
02:06:32,240 --> 02:06:33,240
All right.

2706
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:34,240
Question.

2707
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:37,280
And then Zappi, you're going to say yours in a private message to me in the chat.

2708
02:06:37,280 --> 02:06:43,360
So if you guys want to help them out, you can leave your responses over at live.vognetwork.com.

2709
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,080
All right.

2710
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:46,880
So here we go.

2711
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:49,500
Question number one.

2712
02:06:49,500 --> 02:06:57,840
In a dark boardroom in Japan somewhere, executives were astounded at the success of Kickstarters

2713
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:03,000
for projects like Bloodstained and Mighty No. 9.

2714
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,760
That's it, a boardroom executive spoke up.

2715
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:12,720
The only way we're going to save this company is for our company, Konami, to run a Kickstarter

2716
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:18,720
for blank.

2717
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:20,040
Exploding president cat.

2718
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:21,040
Hold on.

2719
02:07:21,040 --> 02:07:23,480
Don't answer until I say we're ready for an answer.

2720
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:27,080
What did I just say?

2721
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:29,320
Maybe this is why we have to rethink your answer.

2722
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:30,320
Yeah.

2723
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:31,320
Now you have to come up with a new answer.

2724
02:07:31,320 --> 02:07:32,320
All right.

2725
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:33,320
I'm going to...

2726
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:34,320
Wait.

2727
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:35,320
I was...

2728
02:07:35,880 --> 02:07:38,000
So let me read that one more time.

2729
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:44,060
The only way we're going to save this company, Konami, is to run a Kickstarter for blank.

2730
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:45,060
So who's in?

2731
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:46,060
Ding.

2732
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:47,060
Ding.

2733
02:07:47,060 --> 02:07:48,060
Ding.

2734
02:07:48,060 --> 02:07:49,060
Ding.

2735
02:07:49,060 --> 02:07:50,060
Ding.

2736
02:07:50,060 --> 02:07:51,060
Ding.

2737
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:52,060
Ding.

2738
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:53,060
Ding.

2739
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:54,060
Ding.

2740
02:07:54,060 --> 02:07:55,060
Ding.

2741
02:07:55,060 --> 02:07:56,060
Ding.

2742
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:57,060
Ding.

2743
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:58,060
Ding.

2744
02:07:58,060 --> 02:07:59,060
Ding.

2745
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:00,060
Ding.

2746
02:08:00,060 --> 02:08:01,060
Ding.

2747
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:02,060
Ding.

2748
02:08:02,060 --> 02:08:03,060
Ding.

2749
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:04,060
Ding.

2750
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:05,060
Ding.

2751
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:06,800
All right.

2752
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:07,800
Ding.

2753
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:08,800
I went with a serious answer.

2754
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:09,800
I didn't have time to be funny.

2755
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:10,800
I'm still waiting on Zappi.

2756
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:13,620
Zappi, you got to send me your answer here.

2757
02:08:13,620 --> 02:08:14,620
Waiting on Zappi.

2758
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,620
Need.

2759
02:08:15,620 --> 02:08:16,620
Zappi!

2760
02:08:16,620 --> 02:08:26,820
In a dark boardroom in Japan, executives were astounded at the success of Kickstarters for

2761
02:08:26,820 --> 02:08:29,320
projects like Bloodstained and Mighty No. 9.

2762
02:08:29,320 --> 02:08:30,320
That's it.

2763
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:31,660
A boardroom executive spoke up.

2764
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:34,980
The only way we're going to save this company is for our company, Konami, to run a Kickstarter

2765
02:08:34,980 --> 02:08:35,980
for blank.

2766
02:08:35,980 --> 02:08:36,980
All right.

2767
02:08:36,980 --> 02:08:37,980
Zappi's got an answer in.

2768
02:08:37,980 --> 02:08:38,980
So Brad, here it is.

2769
02:08:38,980 --> 02:08:42,700
The only way we're going to save this company is for our company, Konami, to run a Kickstarter

2770
02:08:42,700 --> 02:08:45,700
for?

2771
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:47,180
Exploding President Kat.

2772
02:08:47,180 --> 02:08:48,500
Exploding President Kat.

2773
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:50,220
That's his story and he's sticking to it.

2774
02:08:50,220 --> 02:08:51,220
All right.

2775
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:54,260
Zappi says, okay, I'll say Guitar Freaks.

2776
02:08:54,260 --> 02:08:55,260
All right.

2777
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:56,260
Zappi says Guitar Freaks.

2778
02:08:56,260 --> 02:08:57,260
Let's see.

2779
02:08:57,260 --> 02:08:58,260
All right.

2780
02:08:58,260 --> 02:08:59,620
So we've got Guitar Freaks and Exploding President Kat.

2781
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:01,900
Let's see if we get any matches here in studio.

2782
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:03,600
Loki, what's your answer?

2783
02:09:03,600 --> 02:09:11,000
My answer is they're going to have to kickstart Thomas Howard's Girl's Butts, a next gen sequel

2784
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
to Rumble Roses.

2785
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Girl's Butts.

2786
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Look at that.

2787
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Girl's Butts.

2788
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,080
The next gen sequel to Rumble Roses.

2789
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,080
Not a match.

2790
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:20,080
I like that.

2791
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:21,080
You invoked Rumble Roses.

2792
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:22,080
All right.

2793
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:23,080
I'll go next.

2794
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:24,340
My answer is, I went serious.

2795
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:28,320
I said Suicoden 6 because that's the only way it's going to happen.

2796
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,840
And somewhere out there, Shane's heart is breaking.

2797
02:09:30,840 --> 02:09:31,840
Sorry, Shane.

2798
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:32,840
All right.

2799
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:34,360
Alan, you're up next.

2800
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:39,600
The only way we can save this company is to run a Kickstarter for Super Pachinko.

2801
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:42,440
Super Pachinko.

2802
02:09:42,440 --> 02:09:43,440
Not a match.

2803
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:44,440
Oh, look at the score.

2804
02:09:44,440 --> 02:09:45,440
Zero to zero.

2805
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:46,440
All right, Drew.

2806
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:47,480
Let's see if we get a match with you.

2807
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:51,560
The only way we can save this company is to do a Kickstarter for Hookers and Blow for

2808
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:52,560
Kojima.

2809
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,120
Hookers and Blow for Kojima.

2810
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:59,300
You got to win that son of a bitch back with Hookers and Blow.

2811
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:00,300
Not a match.

2812
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:01,300
But a good...

2813
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:02,300
That was a good...

2814
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:03,840
You're back in.

2815
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:05,460
Your 30s are your prime, Drew.

2816
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:06,460
All right.

2817
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:07,460
Last but not least.

2818
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:08,460
Ladies last.

2819
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:09,740
You're in O.L.R.

2820
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:11,540
Dark Sakura.

2821
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:14,420
The only way is to do a Kickstarter for...

2822
02:10:14,420 --> 02:10:15,420
Silent Hills.

2823
02:10:15,420 --> 02:10:17,420
Silent Hills.

2824
02:10:17,420 --> 02:10:19,460
Oh, look.

2825
02:10:19,460 --> 02:10:22,700
If you'd gone with Fifth Dream's answer, you would have matched.

2826
02:10:22,700 --> 02:10:23,700
There it is.

2827
02:10:23,700 --> 02:10:24,700
Silent Hills.

2828
02:10:24,700 --> 02:10:25,960
Fifth Dream gets a point, but he's not playing.

2829
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:27,460
So there it is.

2830
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:30,940
Zero to zero is the score.

2831
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:31,940
Brad, I'm sorry.

2832
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:33,100
He's still not on the board.

2833
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:34,100
Zappy, I'm sorry.

2834
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:37,100
But you still have three more chances.

2835
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:39,140
So here we go with question number two.

2836
02:10:39,140 --> 02:10:42,580
Now this time, Brad, don't blurt it out until I ask, okay?

2837
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:45,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2838
02:10:45,580 --> 02:10:48,580
Well, hell, I'll take a shot while you're talking.

2839
02:10:48,580 --> 02:10:49,580
Okay.

2840
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:50,580
Oh, he's taking shots.

2841
02:10:50,580 --> 02:10:53,580
He had a mouthful of fireballs.

2842
02:10:53,580 --> 02:10:54,580
What was that?

2843
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:56,380
He had a mouthful of fireballs.

2844
02:10:56,380 --> 02:10:57,580
That's actually accurate.

2845
02:10:57,580 --> 02:10:58,580
I'm sure that is...

2846
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:01,580
Absolutely what I was drinking.

2847
02:11:02,220 --> 02:11:03,220
Yes, what he's drinking.

2848
02:11:03,220 --> 02:11:04,220
I love it.

2849
02:11:04,220 --> 02:11:05,220
All right.

2850
02:11:05,220 --> 02:11:06,220
Here we go.

2851
02:11:06,220 --> 02:11:07,220
Question number two.

2852
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:16,740
Flash forward, E3 2016, the NX is revealed by Nintendo on stage at E3.

2853
02:11:16,740 --> 02:11:17,740
They're back on stage.

2854
02:11:17,740 --> 02:11:18,980
Just roll with me here.

2855
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:24,460
Reggie speaks up and says, we really listen to the fans out there this time.

2856
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:33,500
And so I'm pleased to announce that the Nintendo NX will be the industry leader in blank.

2857
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:34,500
Ding.

2858
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:35,500
Ding.

2859
02:11:43,500 --> 02:11:44,500
Ding.

2860
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:45,500
Ding for me as well.

2861
02:11:45,500 --> 02:11:46,500
Loki, did you ding?

2862
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:47,500
Oh, yes.

2863
02:11:47,500 --> 02:11:48,500
I ding.

2864
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:52,500
So once again, we're waiting on Zappi.

2865
02:11:52,500 --> 02:11:53,500
Oh, there it is.

2866
02:11:53,540 --> 02:11:54,540
He got his answer in.

2867
02:11:54,540 --> 02:11:55,540
Wow.

2868
02:11:55,540 --> 02:11:56,540
That's how it's...

2869
02:11:56,540 --> 02:11:57,540
Okay.

2870
02:11:57,540 --> 02:11:58,540
We're just a little rusty in round one.

2871
02:11:58,540 --> 02:11:59,540
We're getting...

2872
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:01,540
This is how LR got their groove back.

2873
02:12:01,540 --> 02:12:02,540
All right.

2874
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:03,540
Here it is.

2875
02:12:03,540 --> 02:12:04,540
Well, let's see.

2876
02:12:04,540 --> 02:12:05,540
I hope so.

2877
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:06,540
Let's see.

2878
02:12:06,540 --> 02:12:08,540
We really listen to the fans out there.

2879
02:12:08,540 --> 02:12:10,620
Nintendo listened to the fans, Brad.

2880
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:18,540
And so I'm pleased to announce that the Nintendo NX will be the industry leader in...

2881
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:19,540
Cybernetic implants.

2882
02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:21,540
Screw the controllers.

2883
02:12:21,580 --> 02:12:23,580
Cybernetic implants.

2884
02:12:23,580 --> 02:12:25,580
Screw the controllers.

2885
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:27,580
It's the $6 million system right there.

2886
02:12:27,580 --> 02:12:28,580
Cybernetic...

2887
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:30,580
That's where Jamie Summers got her name after all.

2888
02:12:30,580 --> 02:12:31,580
True facts.

2889
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:32,580
Cybernetic implants.

2890
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:39,580
Zappi said, I'm pleased to announce that the Nintendo NX will be the industry leader in...

2891
02:12:39,580 --> 02:12:40,580
Tingle.

2892
02:12:40,580 --> 02:12:41,580
There it is.

2893
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:42,580
The answer from Zappi.

2894
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:43,580
Tingle.

2895
02:12:43,580 --> 02:12:44,580
All right.

2896
02:12:44,580 --> 02:12:49,580
Let's go around the studio and let's see some of the random comments from chat.

2897
02:12:49,620 --> 02:12:51,620
HalfLife 3 said, Black Wolf.

2898
02:12:51,620 --> 02:12:53,620
Naked Samus said, Fifth Dream.

2899
02:12:53,620 --> 02:12:55,620
Ridge Racer said, Akuma JP.

2900
02:12:55,620 --> 02:12:57,620
Amiibo said, Act Deft.

2901
02:12:57,620 --> 02:12:59,620
Old Ass Games said, Fifth Dream.

2902
02:12:59,620 --> 02:13:00,620
Let's see.

2903
02:13:00,620 --> 02:13:01,620
Let's see how folks did.

2904
02:13:01,620 --> 02:13:05,620
How come only two of you wanted to play and then you're all participating in chat?

2905
02:13:05,620 --> 02:13:07,620
I think you're just...

2906
02:13:07,620 --> 02:13:11,620
Shane just texted me and Shane never goes there.

2907
02:13:11,620 --> 02:13:14,620
But he just texted me, Vibrators.

2908
02:13:15,620 --> 02:13:17,620
Are we going to see another Rez release?

2909
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:18,660
All right.

2910
02:13:18,660 --> 02:13:19,660
Let's see.

2911
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:20,660
Let's see.

2912
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:21,660
Let's go around the room.

2913
02:13:21,660 --> 02:13:22,660
The industry leader in...

2914
02:13:22,660 --> 02:13:23,660
Loki?

2915
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:24,660
Teledildonics.

2916
02:13:24,660 --> 02:13:25,660
Teledildonics.

2917
02:13:25,660 --> 02:13:33,660
So I think that's kind of maybe a half a point for Brad because he did say cybernetic implant

2918
02:13:33,660 --> 02:13:36,660
and, you know, fuck the controllers.

2919
02:13:36,660 --> 02:13:37,660
Let's go to the judges.

2920
02:13:37,660 --> 02:13:38,660
Fuck the controllers.

2921
02:13:38,660 --> 02:13:39,660
I'll give it.

2922
02:13:39,660 --> 02:13:40,660
Nah.

2923
02:13:40,660 --> 02:13:41,660
I'm saying no.

2924
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:43,660
Yeah, but you've been outvoted by three other people.

2925
02:13:43,660 --> 02:13:45,660
No, because Alan's given the X to.

2926
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:46,700
Alan's given the X to.

2927
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:47,700
Yeah, but three versus two.

2928
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:48,700
All right.

2929
02:13:48,700 --> 02:13:49,700
All right.

2930
02:13:49,700 --> 02:13:50,700
Three to two decision.

2931
02:13:50,700 --> 02:13:53,700
We're going to give Brad half point on that one.

2932
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:54,700
Congrats, Brad.

2933
02:13:54,700 --> 02:13:56,700
All right.

2934
02:13:56,700 --> 02:14:02,700
My answer, the industry leader in holodeck porn.

2935
02:14:02,700 --> 02:14:03,700
Come on, people.

2936
02:14:03,700 --> 02:14:05,700
It's always one step closer to the holodeck porn.

2937
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:08,700
One step closer to the holodeck porn.

2938
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:11,700
All right, Alan, let's see if we get a match.

2939
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:12,700
The industry leader in...

2940
02:14:12,700 --> 02:14:14,700
Fanboy Tears.

2941
02:14:14,740 --> 02:14:17,740
Not a match, unfortunately.

2942
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:19,740
Drew, the Nintendo NX.

2943
02:14:19,740 --> 02:14:21,740
The industry leader in...

2944
02:14:21,740 --> 02:14:22,740
Microtransactions.

2945
02:14:22,740 --> 02:14:24,740
Microtransactions.

2946
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:27,740
Jamie's favorite word in the English language.

2947
02:14:27,740 --> 02:14:29,740
The salt must flow.

2948
02:14:29,740 --> 02:14:30,740
Not a match.

2949
02:14:30,740 --> 02:14:31,740
Not a match.

2950
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:35,740
It's still half to zero because we deal fractions here.

2951
02:14:35,740 --> 02:14:38,740
Last but certainly not least, or she'd kick my butt.

2952
02:14:38,740 --> 02:14:41,740
Dark Sakura, the industry leader in...

2953
02:14:41,780 --> 02:14:42,780
Silent Hills.

2954
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:43,780
Silent Hills.

2955
02:14:43,780 --> 02:14:45,780
Also, not a match.

2956
02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:47,780
Well, it is big and it is rather black.

2957
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:48,780
All right.

2958
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:49,780
There it is.

2959
02:14:49,780 --> 02:14:50,780
Zappi.

2960
02:14:50,780 --> 02:14:53,780
Sadly, not a match, Zappi.

2961
02:14:53,780 --> 02:14:55,780
But you know what, Zappi?

2962
02:14:55,780 --> 02:14:58,780
Brad's only got a half point.

2963
02:14:58,780 --> 02:15:02,780
So you could still tie it up or even exceed.

2964
02:15:02,780 --> 02:15:04,780
It's not hard to get one full point.

2965
02:15:04,780 --> 02:15:06,780
It's not hard to get one full point.

2966
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:08,780
It's not hard to get one full point.

2967
02:15:08,820 --> 02:15:10,820
Tie it up or even exceed.

2968
02:15:10,820 --> 02:15:12,820
It's not hard to get one full point.

2969
02:15:12,820 --> 02:15:14,820
You just have to match something a little closer than Brad did.

2970
02:15:14,820 --> 02:15:15,820
All right.

2971
02:15:15,820 --> 02:15:16,820
Let's get to it.

2972
02:15:16,820 --> 02:15:17,820
Round three.

2973
02:15:17,820 --> 02:15:19,820
There's only four rounds you guys have to endure.

2974
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:20,820
Three.

2975
02:15:20,820 --> 02:15:21,820
Here it is.

2976
02:15:21,820 --> 02:15:22,820
Round three.

2977
02:15:22,820 --> 02:15:27,820
Did you hear about the Super Nintendo PlayStation that was

2978
02:15:27,820 --> 02:15:31,820
dug out of someone's garbage and posted on Reddit?

2979
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:36,820
Little did you know that not only was that system found,

2980
02:15:36,820 --> 02:15:41,820
but that cartridge contains an ultra rare copy of the Sony

2981
02:15:41,820 --> 02:15:46,820
created CD-ROM game Super Mario Blank.

2982
02:15:48,820 --> 02:15:49,820
Ding.

2983
02:15:49,820 --> 02:15:50,820
Ding.

2984
02:15:50,820 --> 02:15:51,820
Ding.

2985
02:15:51,820 --> 02:15:52,820
Ding.

2986
02:15:52,820 --> 02:15:57,820
Ding.

2987
02:15:57,820 --> 02:15:58,820
Let's see.

2988
02:15:58,820 --> 02:16:00,820
One more time.

2989
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:05,820
Did you hear about the Super Nintendo PlayStation that was

2990
02:16:05,820 --> 02:16:07,820
dug out of someone's garbage?

2991
02:16:07,820 --> 02:16:09,820
Little did you know not only was the system found,

2992
02:16:09,820 --> 02:16:12,820
but the cartridge contains an ultra rare copy of the Sony

2993
02:16:12,820 --> 02:16:17,820
created CD-ROM game Super Mario Blank.

2994
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:18,820
Zappie's a ding.

2995
02:16:18,820 --> 02:16:19,820
Brad's a ding.

2996
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:20,820
I think we've got dings.

2997
02:16:20,820 --> 02:16:21,820
Anyone need a dong?

2998
02:16:21,820 --> 02:16:22,820
All right.

2999
02:16:22,820 --> 02:16:24,820
Who dinged?

3000
02:16:24,820 --> 02:16:25,820
Here we go.

3001
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:30,820
Brad, an ultra rare copy of the Sony created CD-ROM game

3002
02:16:30,820 --> 02:16:33,820
Super Mario.

3003
02:16:34,820 --> 02:16:36,820
Naked oil wrestling.

3004
02:16:36,820 --> 02:16:39,820
Naked oil wrestling.

3005
02:16:39,820 --> 02:16:41,820
Someone's into the Turkish wrestling here.

3006
02:16:41,820 --> 02:16:43,820
Just like the Turkish wrestler in Super...

3007
02:16:43,820 --> 02:16:45,820
What was that guy in Street Fighter IV?

3008
02:16:45,820 --> 02:16:46,820
Brad, you mean Hakan.

3009
02:16:46,820 --> 02:16:47,820
All right.

3010
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:48,820
You mean Hakan, don't you?

3011
02:16:48,820 --> 02:16:49,820
There it is.

3012
02:16:49,820 --> 02:16:50,820
All right.

3013
02:16:50,820 --> 02:16:52,820
Well, surely Zappie has a more family friendly answer.

3014
02:16:52,820 --> 02:16:56,820
Zappie said an ultra rare copy of the Sony created CD-ROM game

3015
02:16:56,820 --> 02:16:58,820
Super Mario Porn.

3016
02:16:58,820 --> 02:17:02,820
He just said porn, which is a safe bet here at OLR.

3017
02:17:02,820 --> 02:17:04,820
When in doubt, just say porn.

3018
02:17:04,820 --> 02:17:05,820
So there it is.

3019
02:17:05,820 --> 02:17:06,820
Super Mario Porn.

3020
02:17:06,820 --> 02:17:08,820
Some comments from our chat room.

3021
02:17:08,820 --> 02:17:09,820
Let's see.

3022
02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:12,820
SSJ100Matt says, Super Mario Miss World 96.

3023
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:15,820
Black Wolf says, Super Mario Silent Hills.

3024
02:17:15,820 --> 02:17:18,820
Act Def says, Super Mario Crash Spiral.

3025
02:17:18,820 --> 02:17:21,820
Dungeon Buster says, Super Mario Uncharted.

3026
02:17:21,820 --> 02:17:23,820
Orange Right says, Super Mario Orgy.

3027
02:17:23,820 --> 02:17:26,820
Dungeon Buster says, Super Mario Kill Zone.

3028
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:28,820
Zappie said, I was tempted to say hills.

3029
02:17:28,820 --> 02:17:29,820
So let's see what happens.

3030
02:17:29,820 --> 02:17:32,820
Super Mario blank.

3031
02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:33,820
All right.

3032
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:35,820
Let's go around the room and see if we've got a match.

3033
02:17:35,820 --> 02:17:38,820
So we got Turkish oil wrestling and porn.

3034
02:17:38,820 --> 02:17:42,820
Loki, the unreleased game Super Mario.

3035
02:17:42,820 --> 02:17:43,820
Bandicoot.

3036
02:17:43,820 --> 02:17:44,820
Super Mario Bandicoot.

3037
02:17:44,820 --> 02:17:46,820
It's going for a safe answer.

3038
02:17:46,820 --> 02:17:47,820
And there it is.

3039
02:17:47,820 --> 02:17:48,820
All right.

3040
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:49,820
All right.

3041
02:17:49,820 --> 02:17:50,820
Super Mario Bandicoot.

3042
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:52,820
Not a match.

3043
02:17:52,820 --> 02:17:56,820
My answer, an ultra rare copy of the Sony created CD-ROM game

3044
02:17:57,820 --> 02:18:00,820
Super Mario Cross Night Trap.

3045
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:02,820
Because it's a CD-ROM game.

3046
02:18:02,820 --> 02:18:03,820
Come on.

3047
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:05,820
Fuck all of you.

3048
02:18:05,820 --> 02:18:06,820
Come on.

3049
02:18:06,820 --> 02:18:08,820
Luigi can investigate a haunted mansion.

3050
02:18:08,820 --> 02:18:10,820
He can certainly investigate a panty party.

3051
02:18:10,820 --> 02:18:11,820
Come on, people.

3052
02:18:11,820 --> 02:18:12,820
Super Mario.

3053
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:13,820
That would be a more interesting game.

3054
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:14,820
It's a Dana Plato.

3055
02:18:14,820 --> 02:18:15,820
Exactly.

3056
02:18:15,820 --> 02:18:16,820
Come on.

3057
02:18:16,820 --> 02:18:18,820
Who would not play Super Mario Cross Night Trap?

3058
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:19,820
All right.

3059
02:18:19,820 --> 02:18:20,820
Alan.

3060
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:22,820
You have to be a zombie now.

3061
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:23,820
Alan.

3062
02:18:23,820 --> 02:18:25,820
Super Mario Cross.

3063
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:27,820
Sorry, Super Mario what?

3064
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:28,820
Arena Toshinden.

3065
02:18:28,820 --> 02:18:30,820
Arena Toshinden.

3066
02:18:30,820 --> 02:18:35,820
A good answer for Sony, but not a match with either of our listeners tonight.

3067
02:18:35,820 --> 02:18:37,820
It's still half a point to no point.

3068
02:18:37,820 --> 02:18:38,820
Drew.

3069
02:18:38,820 --> 02:18:40,820
Super Mario.

3070
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:42,820
Featuring Jumping Flash.

3071
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:43,820
Featuring Jumping Flash.

3072
02:18:43,820 --> 02:18:44,820
Who would play the fuck out of that?

3073
02:18:44,820 --> 02:18:46,820
I would play the fuck out of that too.

3074
02:18:46,820 --> 02:18:47,820
Good answer.

3075
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:48,820
Not a match.

3076
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:51,820
Last but not least, Dark Sakura Super Mario.

3077
02:18:51,820 --> 02:18:52,820
Silent Hills.

3078
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:53,820
Silent Hills.

3079
02:18:54,820 --> 02:18:57,820
You knew it was coming to this point, ladies and gentlemen.

3080
02:18:57,820 --> 02:19:00,820
I'm surprised that nobody thought I would go there.

3081
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:04,820
Some of the chat, Zappy said in chat, I almost said Silent Hills.

3082
02:19:04,820 --> 02:19:05,820
Well, you lose.

3083
02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:06,820
You lose.

3084
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:11,820
You could have been a half a point ahead of Brad, but no.

3085
02:19:11,820 --> 02:19:12,820
All right.

3086
02:19:12,820 --> 02:19:14,820
We had to be unique.

3087
02:19:14,820 --> 02:19:15,820
We had to be special snowflakes.

3088
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:16,820
Here it is, guys.

3089
02:19:16,820 --> 02:19:22,820
It's the final round, but there's a twist because you notice I've been bringing these old OLR games back.

3090
02:19:22,820 --> 02:19:24,820
I've been putting a twist.

3091
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:26,820
So here's the twist for question four.

3092
02:19:26,820 --> 02:19:29,820
There's two blanks.

3093
02:19:29,820 --> 02:19:31,820
This is the wedgie of match game.

3094
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:32,820
That's right.

3095
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:34,820
There's two blanks in this one.

3096
02:19:34,820 --> 02:19:38,820
So you have the opportunity to earn two points.

3097
02:19:38,820 --> 02:19:44,820
This, I mean, if Zappy matches even one person, he could just fuck Brad's game right up.

3098
02:19:44,820 --> 02:19:47,820
Or Brad could just move this into the stratosphere.

3099
02:19:47,820 --> 02:19:48,820
So here it is.

3100
02:19:48,820 --> 02:19:50,820
Two blanks on this last question.

3101
02:19:51,820 --> 02:19:53,820
Question number four.

3102
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:58,820
The last question as I scroll it off my screen.

3103
02:19:58,820 --> 02:19:59,820
Here we go.

3104
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:00,820
Question number four.

3105
02:20:00,820 --> 02:20:11,820
The first ever Nintendo Splatoon Splatfest was extremely successful as people battled for Team Cat and Team Dog everywhere.

3106
02:20:11,820 --> 02:20:14,820
It was such a success with kids and teens everywhere.

3107
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:26,820
However, in an attempt to win more adults over to Splatoon, Nintendo announced that the next Splatfest will be Team Blank versus Team Blank.

3108
02:20:32,820 --> 02:20:43,820
In an effort to win more adults over to Splatoon, Nintendo announced that the next Splatfest will be Team Blank versus Team Blank.

3109
02:20:43,820 --> 02:20:45,820
I'm going to that special hell.

3110
02:20:54,820 --> 02:20:55,820
All right.

3111
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:57,820
I'm going to ding there.

3112
02:20:57,820 --> 02:20:58,820
Oh, my God.

3113
02:20:58,820 --> 02:20:59,820
You people in chat are nasty.

3114
02:20:59,820 --> 02:21:00,820
I can't read this on air.

3115
02:21:00,820 --> 02:21:01,820
I cannot read this on air.

3116
02:21:01,820 --> 02:21:03,820
You can't, so.

3117
02:21:03,820 --> 02:21:04,820
All right.

3118
02:21:04,820 --> 02:21:05,820
Because we're about to.

3119
02:21:05,820 --> 02:21:06,820
I'm still waiting on Zappy's answer.

3120
02:21:06,820 --> 02:21:07,820
Is everybody ding?

3121
02:21:07,820 --> 02:21:08,820
Yeah, I think so.

3122
02:21:08,820 --> 02:21:09,820
Does anybody need a dong?

3123
02:21:09,820 --> 02:21:11,820
Does anyone give a dang?

3124
02:21:11,820 --> 02:21:12,820
coding.

3125
02:21:12,820 --> 02:21:13,820
All right.

3126
02:21:13,820 --> 02:21:15,820
I'm still I'm just waiting on Zappy.

3127
02:21:15,820 --> 02:21:16,820
But no dong.

3128
02:21:16,820 --> 02:21:17,820
No dung.

3129
02:21:17,820 --> 02:21:18,820
Dung is not allowed.

3130
02:21:18,820 --> 02:21:21,820
All right.

3131
02:21:21,820 --> 02:21:22,820
All right.

3132
02:21:22,820 --> 02:21:23,820
Hurry up, Zappy.

3133
02:21:23,820 --> 02:21:24,820
If you hear my voice.

3134
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:28,820
Do it.

3135
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:29,820
You better get that locked in.

3136
02:21:29,820 --> 02:21:30,820
All right.

3137
02:21:30,820 --> 02:21:32,820
He's locked in his answer.

3138
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:34,820
Let's do this.

3139
02:21:34,820 --> 02:21:37,820
The first ever Nintendo Splatoon Splatfest was successful.

3140
02:21:38,820 --> 02:21:42,820
But in an attempt to win more adults over, Nintendo announced that the next Splatfest

3141
02:21:42,820 --> 02:21:46,820
will be Team what, Brad?

3142
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:52,820
Team Pyramid Head versus Team Peach.

3143
02:21:52,820 --> 02:21:55,820
Team Pyramid Head versus Team Peach.

3144
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:56,820
Okay.

3145
02:21:56,820 --> 02:21:57,820
I see what he's doing there.

3146
02:21:57,820 --> 02:21:59,820
He's trying to do the Silent Hill angle there on that answer, isn't he?

3147
02:21:59,820 --> 02:22:00,820
All right.

3148
02:22:00,820 --> 02:22:01,820
Let's see if that works for him.

3149
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:08,820
Well, Zappy in chat said it will be Team Silent versus Team Hills.

3150
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:09,820
He's not.

3151
02:22:09,820 --> 02:22:11,820
He's not going to let that go this time.

3152
02:22:11,820 --> 02:22:13,820
Oh, we're just doubling down on this now, aren't we?

3153
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:14,820
He's doubling down.

3154
02:22:14,820 --> 02:22:17,820
He's doubling down to see if that inside joke comes back.

3155
02:22:17,820 --> 02:22:18,820
All right.

3156
02:22:18,820 --> 02:22:22,820
Zappy in chat said porn didn't work for me, so I decided against it this time.

3157
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:24,820
Some other chat answers.

3158
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:27,820
Act F said Republicans versus Democrats.

3159
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:30,820
Black Wolf said Silent versus Hills.

3160
02:22:30,820 --> 02:22:34,820
SS Dream said Bukake versus Cat.

3161
02:22:34,820 --> 02:22:35,820
Wow.

3162
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:37,820
Tiger Claw said Penis versus Vagina.

3163
02:22:37,820 --> 02:22:40,820
SSJ100Matt said Missionary versus Doggy.

3164
02:22:40,820 --> 02:22:43,820
And Black Wolf said Ding versus Dong.

3165
02:22:43,820 --> 02:22:48,820
All right.

3166
02:22:48,820 --> 02:22:51,820
The next Splatoon Splatfest will be...

3167
02:22:51,820 --> 02:22:54,820
I don't even see the damn chat.

3168
02:22:54,820 --> 02:22:56,820
Loki, Team...

3169
02:22:56,820 --> 02:22:58,820
Team Squid versus Team Kid.

3170
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:03,820
Team Squid versus Team Kid, which is what everybody actually thinks it should be.

3171
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:08,820
So a very logical answer, not a match.

3172
02:23:08,820 --> 02:23:10,820
My answer, Team...

3173
02:23:10,820 --> 02:23:14,820
And by the way, y'all, I went for the old OLR inside joke.

3174
02:23:14,820 --> 02:23:17,820
There's going to be two of you out here who understand this.

3175
02:23:17,820 --> 02:23:23,820
Team Cylon Occupied Caprica versus Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.

3176
02:23:23,820 --> 02:23:24,820
Boo this man.

3177
02:23:24,820 --> 02:23:26,820
That's my answer.

3178
02:23:26,820 --> 02:23:28,820
All right.

3179
02:23:28,820 --> 02:23:31,820
I would have accepted Cylons versus Humans, though.

3180
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:32,820
Come on, let's be real.

3181
02:23:32,820 --> 02:23:33,820
All right, Alan.

3182
02:23:33,820 --> 02:23:36,820
Splatoon Splatfest will be Team...

3183
02:23:36,820 --> 02:23:39,820
Act F really needed to think more about the Splatoon angle,

3184
02:23:39,820 --> 02:23:48,820
but my answer is Team Bukake versus Team Cream Pies.

3185
02:23:48,820 --> 02:23:51,820
And it's all white ink.

3186
02:23:51,820 --> 02:23:52,820
That's it.

3187
02:23:52,820 --> 02:23:53,820
Show's canceled.

3188
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:54,820
We're done.

3189
02:23:54,820 --> 02:23:55,820
Too hot for any of you.

3190
02:23:55,820 --> 02:23:56,820
Shut her down.

3191
02:23:56,820 --> 02:23:59,820
Banned in Australia.

3192
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:11,820
We're earning that explicit tag today.

3193
02:24:11,820 --> 02:24:13,820
Because it's Splatoon, everybody.

3194
02:24:13,820 --> 02:24:14,820
Get it?

3195
02:24:14,820 --> 02:24:15,820
That's why it's funny.

3196
02:24:15,820 --> 02:24:16,820
Because the game is called Splatoon.

3197
02:24:16,820 --> 02:24:18,820
He was lucky I wasn't taking the shot.

3198
02:24:18,820 --> 02:24:20,820
All right, you're out of liquor at this point, Brad.

3199
02:24:20,820 --> 02:24:21,820
Don't try to fool me.

3200
02:24:21,820 --> 02:24:22,820
Rob, here's the problem with that.

3201
02:24:22,820 --> 02:24:23,820
All the ink would only be one color.

3202
02:24:24,820 --> 02:24:26,820
All right.

3203
02:24:26,820 --> 02:24:29,820
Not if you get enough Vitamin C in your diet.

3204
02:24:29,820 --> 02:24:31,820
Drew.

3205
02:24:31,820 --> 02:24:33,820
Team...

3206
02:24:33,820 --> 02:24:35,820
If we're going to go for the adult demographic,

3207
02:24:35,820 --> 02:24:38,820
the age-old debate of Team Tits versus Team Ass.

3208
02:24:38,820 --> 02:24:42,820
Team Tits versus Team Ass.

3209
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:43,820
Tits and Ass.

3210
02:24:43,820 --> 02:24:44,820
There it is.

3211
02:24:44,820 --> 02:24:45,820
All right.

3212
02:24:45,820 --> 02:24:48,820
Last but not least, DarkSakura.

3213
02:24:48,820 --> 02:24:49,820
What did she pick?

3214
02:24:49,820 --> 02:24:50,820
Team...

3215
02:24:50,820 --> 02:24:52,820
Alan Wake.

3216
02:24:53,820 --> 02:24:56,820
Versus...

3217
02:24:56,820 --> 02:24:58,820
D.

3218
02:24:58,820 --> 02:24:59,820
Versus D?

3219
02:24:59,820 --> 02:25:00,820
D.

3220
02:25:00,820 --> 02:25:01,820
D?

3221
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:04,820
Survival Horror.

3222
02:25:04,820 --> 02:25:10,820
So DarkSakura just screwed Zappi over by flipping the script

3223
02:25:10,820 --> 02:25:12,820
and saying Team...

3224
02:25:12,820 --> 02:25:13,820
What the hell did she say again?

3225
02:25:13,820 --> 02:25:14,820
Alan Wake.

3226
02:25:14,820 --> 02:25:16,820
Team Alan Wake versus Team D.

3227
02:25:16,820 --> 02:25:21,820
D, which was the Saturn Survival Horror psychological.

3228
02:25:21,820 --> 02:25:24,820
So I picked psychological horror games that were like Silent Hill.

3229
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:27,820
So you're doing Team Games That Will Never Be On The Wii U

3230
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:29,820
and Team Games That Will Never Be On The Wii U.

3231
02:25:29,820 --> 02:25:32,820
Act F, you trusted Jamie to follow the script on this one?

3232
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:33,820
You fool!

3233
02:25:33,820 --> 02:25:34,820
All right.

3234
02:25:34,820 --> 02:25:35,820
Well, Zappi...

3235
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:36,820
It's almost Ferret versus Propel.

3236
02:25:36,820 --> 02:25:37,820
I mean, God.

3237
02:25:37,820 --> 02:25:39,820
I knew she wasn't going to go Silent Hill on that one.

3238
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:40,820
I know it.

3239
02:25:40,820 --> 02:25:41,820
All right.

3240
02:25:41,820 --> 02:25:42,820
There it is.

3241
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:44,820
Well, Brad, your knowledge of DarkSakura's inner workings,

3242
02:25:44,820 --> 02:25:48,820
you won by a half point in a slim judge's decision to zero.

3243
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:50,820
So I got to say, Zappi,

3244
02:25:50,820 --> 02:25:52,820
you put in a good effort.

3245
02:25:52,820 --> 02:25:54,820
Everybody give Zappi a round of applause

3246
02:25:54,820 --> 02:25:57,820
and then promptly push him off the stage because he lost.

3247
02:25:57,820 --> 02:25:58,820
Bye, Zappi.

3248
02:25:58,820 --> 02:25:59,820
Thanks for playing, though.

3249
02:25:59,820 --> 02:26:01,820
Brad, you're a winner.

3250
02:26:01,820 --> 02:26:03,820
And for winning Match Game Tonight,

3251
02:26:03,820 --> 02:26:06,820
I'm going to let you plug anything you want.

3252
02:26:06,820 --> 02:26:08,820
And knowing that you host your own podcast,

3253
02:26:08,820 --> 02:26:12,820
I think I know what you might want to plug.

3254
02:26:12,820 --> 02:26:17,820
Oh, of course, Pod Culture, Monday nights, 9 o'clock on VOG.

3255
02:26:17,820 --> 02:26:18,820
There it is.

3256
02:26:18,820 --> 02:26:19,820
Listen to Brad, Pod Culture.

3257
02:26:19,820 --> 02:26:22,820
Apparently, tomorrow's a rerun, but that's all right.

3258
02:26:22,820 --> 02:26:23,820
Favoritism.

3259
02:26:23,820 --> 02:26:24,820
That's all right.

3260
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:27,820
Hey, are you going to be taking any shots

3261
02:26:27,820 --> 02:26:31,820
on next week's episode of Pod Culture?

3262
02:26:31,820 --> 02:26:35,820
Um, yeah, actually, I think we are.

3263
02:26:35,820 --> 02:26:36,820
All right, nice.

3264
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:38,820
Yeah, I think there is alcohol involved on that one.

3265
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:41,820
So, Brad, though, I do have to ask you,

3266
02:26:41,820 --> 02:26:43,820
and I don't remember what the exact name for it is,

3267
02:26:43,820 --> 02:26:45,820
but Dan has discovered a cocktail

3268
02:26:45,820 --> 02:26:47,820
that's basically angry orchard and fireball,

3269
02:26:47,820 --> 02:26:49,820
and he wanted to call it angry balls.

3270
02:26:49,820 --> 02:26:51,820
I think that's what it's called, actually, is angry balls.

3271
02:26:51,820 --> 02:26:53,820
But he wanted to call it flaming orchard.

3272
02:26:53,820 --> 02:26:54,820
Actually, I think it is.

3273
02:26:54,820 --> 02:26:57,820
I think it is angry balls or fiery balls or something.

3274
02:26:57,820 --> 02:26:59,820
Yeah, I think it's angry balls, but...

3275
02:26:59,820 --> 02:27:01,820
Herpes.

3276
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:03,820
Oh, my God, you all are 12.

3277
02:27:03,820 --> 02:27:04,820
It would be good.

3278
02:27:04,820 --> 02:27:05,820
It would be good.

3279
02:27:05,820 --> 02:27:07,820
Angry orchard is good stuff.

3280
02:27:07,820 --> 02:27:09,820
All right, Brad, I'm going to let you go

3281
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:11,820
so we can wrap up the show.

3282
02:27:11,820 --> 02:27:13,820
Brad, take care, my friend.

3283
02:27:13,820 --> 02:27:15,820
Thanks for playing.

3284
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:17,820
All right.

3285
02:27:17,820 --> 02:27:19,820
All right, later.

3286
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:21,820
Hey, let us know what you guys thought of Match Game.

3287
02:27:21,820 --> 02:27:23,820
Should we bring it back in a future week,

3288
02:27:23,820 --> 02:27:25,820
or was that just too much of a hot mess for all you guys?

3289
02:27:25,820 --> 02:27:27,820
Let us know over on Twitter.

3290
02:27:27,820 --> 02:27:29,820
Twitter.com slash O-L-R,

3291
02:27:29,820 --> 02:27:31,820
so we'll see if we do Match Game again in the future.

3292
02:27:31,820 --> 02:27:32,820
That was fun, though.

3293
02:27:32,820 --> 02:27:34,820
There were some funny answers in there.

3294
02:27:34,820 --> 02:27:36,820
I think Alan won, though, which I knew would happen.

3295
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:38,820
I knew Alan would do that.

3296
02:27:38,820 --> 02:27:40,820
I just need to put more subliminals in there

3297
02:27:40,820 --> 02:27:42,820
to get people to do this again.

3298
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:44,820
All right, I'm feeling pretty good.

3299
02:27:44,820 --> 02:27:45,820
We'll see what the listeners think.

3300
02:27:45,820 --> 02:27:47,820
It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

3301
02:27:47,820 --> 02:27:49,820
I was getting a little worried when nobody wanted to play.

3302
02:27:49,820 --> 02:27:51,820
I was like, what good is a game if nobody wants to play?

3303
02:27:51,820 --> 02:27:53,820
But then finally, the chat room got really into it.

3304
02:27:53,820 --> 02:27:55,820
I think just some people were shy

3305
02:27:55,820 --> 02:27:57,820
and didn't want to get on the phone, and I understand.

3306
02:27:57,820 --> 02:27:59,820
Come on, don't we remember Match Game at all, guys?

3307
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:00,820
I know, I know. All right.

3308
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:02,820
Don't you remember how we loved to torture you?

3309
02:28:02,820 --> 02:28:03,820
That's right.

3310
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:08,820
Anyway, let's get back into some of the segments we do here on O-L-R.

3311
02:28:08,820 --> 02:28:11,820
I believe we're going to visit the mailbag this week.

3312
02:28:11,820 --> 02:28:13,820
Yeah, it's kind of sticky.

3313
02:28:13,820 --> 02:28:15,820
All right, so every week you guys send us e-mails.

3314
02:28:15,820 --> 02:28:18,820
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

3315
02:28:18,820 --> 02:28:20,820
and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag

3316
02:28:20,820 --> 02:28:24,820
and picks out some e-mails that she believes are worthy of reading on the show.

3317
02:28:24,820 --> 02:28:27,820
And I don't have your usual music.

3318
02:28:27,820 --> 02:28:28,820
I don't know what happened to it.

3319
02:28:28,820 --> 02:28:29,820
Ooh, play Buffalo again.

3320
02:28:29,820 --> 02:28:31,820
I have this music.

3321
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:33,820
Mail, motherfucker.

3322
02:28:36,820 --> 02:28:38,820
It's Grandpa's music from Hoard House.

3323
02:28:38,820 --> 02:28:39,820
That's what I had ready.

3324
02:28:39,820 --> 02:28:42,820
Well, I'm not reading all of this e-mail because it's long.

3325
02:28:42,820 --> 02:28:43,820
Okay, I think you should replace it.

3326
02:28:43,820 --> 02:28:45,820
You think I should replace it on this show?

3327
02:28:45,820 --> 02:28:46,820
I think you should all shut up.

3328
02:28:46,820 --> 02:28:48,820
Well, someone will freeze that damn mailbag already.

3329
02:28:48,820 --> 02:28:50,820
I don't know. You're going to need to get Grandpa's permission.

3330
02:28:50,820 --> 02:28:51,820
He may not have liked that.

3331
02:28:51,820 --> 02:28:52,820
Greetings, O-L-R.

3332
02:28:52,820 --> 02:28:53,820
He's going to be mad.

3333
02:28:53,820 --> 02:28:56,820
He's like, first you decide there's no more Hoard House,

3334
02:28:56,820 --> 02:28:57,820
and then you steal the fucking music.

3335
02:28:57,820 --> 02:28:58,820
Thanks, Rob.

3336
02:28:58,820 --> 02:29:00,820
Grandpa, you and I should do a show.

3337
02:29:00,820 --> 02:29:02,820
It should just be called Fuck.

3338
02:29:02,820 --> 02:29:04,820
Fuck Rob. That's what he'll want to call it.

3339
02:29:04,820 --> 02:29:05,820
If you do a show, you'll be like,

3340
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:07,820
let's just do a show where we talk shit about Rob every week.

3341
02:29:07,820 --> 02:29:08,820
Okay.

3342
02:29:08,820 --> 02:29:09,820
I thought that was OrangeLoungeRadio.

3343
02:29:09,820 --> 02:29:12,820
This is from RawSteelUT, by the way.

3344
02:29:12,820 --> 02:29:13,820
Greetings, O-L-R.

3345
02:29:13,820 --> 02:29:16,820
I got a couple things on mine, so I'll just shoot them out.

3346
02:29:16,820 --> 02:29:17,820
Eh.

3347
02:29:17,820 --> 02:29:19,820
Regarding reservations, not pre-orders,

3348
02:29:19,820 --> 02:29:23,820
I don't really have a strong opinion one way or another,

3349
02:29:23,820 --> 02:29:26,820
but I've grown a bit more careful in just what I reserve.

3350
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:29,820
It makes no sense to reserve something like Black Ops 3 or Halo 5

3351
02:29:29,820 --> 02:29:32,820
simply because I know there'll be a billion copies of them

3352
02:29:32,820 --> 02:29:34,820
out in stores for two or three years afterwards.

3353
02:29:34,820 --> 02:29:38,820
On the other hand, games that I'm not entirely sure will be that well stocked,

3354
02:29:38,820 --> 02:29:41,820
such as Onichambara Z2, Chaos,

3355
02:29:41,820 --> 02:29:43,820
you bet your ass I'm going to reserve something like that

3356
02:29:43,820 --> 02:29:46,820
simply to make sure I don't have to go trolling for copies on eBay.

3357
02:29:46,820 --> 02:29:49,820
I learned my lesson from missing out on Suikoden 2.

3358
02:29:49,820 --> 02:29:51,820
That's wise.

3359
02:29:51,820 --> 02:29:54,820
Next up, I find myself once more defending Activision

3360
02:29:54,820 --> 02:29:56,820
in the Call of Duty franchise.

3361
02:29:56,820 --> 02:29:57,820
Really?

3362
02:29:57,820 --> 02:29:59,820
Yes, it's an annualized franchise,

3363
02:29:59,820 --> 02:30:01,820
but not only do they have separate developers

3364
02:30:01,820 --> 02:30:03,820
to ensure the games are quality when they come out

3365
02:30:03,820 --> 02:30:05,820
instead of having the entire company rush the game

3366
02:30:05,820 --> 02:30:07,820
out like Ubisoft with Assassin's Creed,

3367
02:30:07,820 --> 02:30:10,820
and they have a clear and steady schedule for their map packs,

3368
02:30:10,820 --> 02:30:13,820
making them one of the few companies that are clear and obvious

3369
02:30:13,820 --> 02:30:15,820
and don't mis-schedule or sacrifice quality

3370
02:30:15,820 --> 02:30:18,820
to make the schedule hide their EA.

3371
02:30:18,820 --> 02:30:20,820
Just want to jump in real quick.

3372
02:30:20,820 --> 02:30:23,820
Doesn't Ubisoft use different in-house studios, though?

3373
02:30:23,820 --> 02:30:26,820
Doesn't one of the Assassin's Creed comes out of Montreal,

3374
02:30:26,820 --> 02:30:28,820
one of the other ones comes out of, I want to say,

3375
02:30:28,820 --> 02:30:30,820
somewhere else in Europe or maybe Vancouver?

3376
02:30:30,820 --> 02:30:32,820
Sorry, I don't follow this closely enough,

3377
02:30:32,820 --> 02:30:36,820
but I thought even Ubisoft rotated them amongst some of the studios,

3378
02:30:36,820 --> 02:30:38,820
even though it's all still Ubisoft.

3379
02:30:38,820 --> 02:30:39,820
Just food for thought.

3380
02:30:39,820 --> 02:30:41,820
And admittedly, I could be wrong.

3381
02:30:41,820 --> 02:30:44,820
Honestly, I think that people just hate Activision slash Call of Duty

3382
02:30:44,820 --> 02:30:48,820
because of the surge of military-themed shooters in recent years

3383
02:30:48,820 --> 02:30:53,820
as lesser companies such as EA imitate COD shamelessly.

3384
02:30:53,820 --> 02:30:55,820
Perhaps it's because of the internet,

3385
02:30:55,820 --> 02:30:57,820
but I don't remember that hatred for Nintendo

3386
02:30:57,820 --> 02:31:00,820
during the platformer boom after Super Mario Bros. got big,

3387
02:31:00,820 --> 02:31:03,820
or for Capcom in the wake of the fighting game boom.

3388
02:31:03,820 --> 02:31:08,820
For some reason, it seems the more mentally deficient among the gaming public

3389
02:31:08,820 --> 02:31:14,820
see fit to place the blame for the shallow imitators at Activision's feet

3390
02:31:14,820 --> 02:31:18,820
rather than at the feet of the pale, soulless imitators themselves.

3391
02:31:18,820 --> 02:31:21,820
Eh, people are kind of fanboy.

3392
02:31:21,820 --> 02:31:24,820
Regarding the same-sex marriage in the latest Fire Emblem,

3393
02:31:24,820 --> 02:31:28,820
while it's a great feature, I worry that it will be done in a pandering way,

3394
02:31:28,820 --> 02:31:32,820
especially if they're just doing it in response to backlash over Tomodachi life.

3395
02:31:32,820 --> 02:31:37,820
Often, I find in popular media that the LGBT characters

3396
02:31:37,820 --> 02:31:40,820
don't forget about the QA, hey,

3397
02:31:40,820 --> 02:31:44,820
usually have their LGBT-ness be a central part of the character

3398
02:31:44,820 --> 02:31:46,820
as opposed to being a small part of a greater whole.

3399
02:31:46,820 --> 02:31:48,820
Further, I'm hoping Nintendo shows discretion

3400
02:31:48,820 --> 02:31:52,820
and doesn't make the whole roster open to marriage regardless of gender.

3401
02:31:52,820 --> 02:31:56,820
Ideally, there would be straight gay and bi characters like people in real life.

3402
02:31:56,820 --> 02:31:58,820
Don't forget the asexual people.

3403
02:31:58,820 --> 02:32:00,820
Just say quilt bag.

3404
02:32:00,820 --> 02:32:01,820
Represent.

3405
02:32:01,820 --> 02:32:02,820
Just say quilt bag.

3406
02:32:02,820 --> 02:32:03,820
Yeah.

3407
02:32:03,820 --> 02:32:08,820
But I'm afraid that the company that usually shies away from sexuality and their games

3408
02:32:08,820 --> 02:32:11,820
and all will just again take the shortcut and make everyone bi.

3409
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:13,820
And the last bit has to do with me.

3410
02:32:13,820 --> 02:32:17,820
Wait, can I, before we get to that part, can I address just something real quick?

3411
02:32:17,820 --> 02:32:21,820
Because I've heard there are some interesting things on the Fire Emblem front this week

3412
02:32:21,820 --> 02:32:24,820
that apparently there are some weird things in the story

3413
02:32:24,820 --> 02:32:30,820
that could involve these weird hallucinations about,

3414
02:32:30,820 --> 02:32:34,820
and I'm not going to try to cite this because I don't want to misrepresent the game,

3415
02:32:34,820 --> 02:32:38,820
but apparently some people are finding some problem things in that storyline.

3416
02:32:38,820 --> 02:32:42,820
It's at the point where I don't really want to just believe what I read on Twitter.

3417
02:32:42,820 --> 02:32:45,820
I would like to just play the game for myself and draw my own conclusions

3418
02:32:45,820 --> 02:32:49,820
if I get around to it, or I'll ask Drew to play it and send me the important parts

3419
02:32:49,820 --> 02:32:51,820
because he loves Fire Emblem.

3420
02:32:51,820 --> 02:32:52,820
On it.

3421
02:32:52,820 --> 02:32:54,820
But yeah, I'm hearing some things.

3422
02:32:54,820 --> 02:32:56,820
It'll be interesting to see what happens in translation, too,

3423
02:32:56,820 --> 02:32:59,820
because I guess it's one thing's happening in Japan. We'll see.

3424
02:32:59,820 --> 02:33:01,820
So I don't know.

3425
02:33:01,820 --> 02:33:05,820
It's raising some red flags, though. That's all I can really say right now.

3426
02:33:05,820 --> 02:33:10,820
The last bit has to do with me having mentioned the hip cock

3427
02:33:10,820 --> 02:33:14,820
in the female character for Mass Effect Andromeda.

3428
02:33:14,820 --> 02:33:19,820
And yeah, I might have gone a little bit ranty on it, but I was really annoyed.

3429
02:33:19,820 --> 02:33:23,820
And guess what? I'm entitled to be annoyed by something that I perceive

3430
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:30,820
as a particularly gendered feature without being compared to some of the people

3431
02:33:30,820 --> 02:33:36,820
who were more exploitative about their position as public feminists.

3432
02:33:36,820 --> 02:33:41,820
And you know what? I don't have to at all exercise any caution if I don't want to

3433
02:33:41,820 --> 02:33:46,820
because I have a voice and I don't have to have anyone tell me how to use my voice.

3434
02:33:46,820 --> 02:33:48,820
The end.

3435
02:33:49,820 --> 02:33:52,820
That being said, I understand your point.

3436
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:55,820
You know, I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's geared toward me

3437
02:33:55,820 --> 02:33:57,820
and I'm not going to go on with that.

3438
02:33:57,820 --> 02:34:09,820
But I do think that the pose itself should have equaled the pose of the male character.

3439
02:34:09,820 --> 02:34:11,820
They should have both been neutral.

3440
02:34:11,820 --> 02:34:15,820
You know, if you're going to portray her in one mode,

3441
02:34:15,820 --> 02:34:19,820
you should also portray him in like some hip thrusting mode. I don't know.

3442
02:34:19,820 --> 02:34:25,820
I'm just saying that that is not how a woman comfortably stands.

3443
02:34:25,820 --> 02:34:27,820
I'm just going to say that.

3444
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:31,820
The hip cock thing, not normal and not good for your back,

3445
02:34:31,820 --> 02:34:35,820
not good for your hips. It's painful.

3446
02:34:35,820 --> 02:34:38,820
I think something to kind of go with that too, you know,

3447
02:34:38,820 --> 02:34:43,820
is that when EA is only going to give you a 10 second taste

3448
02:34:43,820 --> 02:34:47,820
at what this new character you're going to be invested in is going to look like,

3449
02:34:47,820 --> 02:34:50,820
you got to choose those 10 seconds carefully

3450
02:34:50,820 --> 02:34:53,820
because if Dark Saga is going to make a snap opinion like that,

3451
02:34:53,820 --> 02:34:57,820
that's because it's all she's got. She's got nothing but this little...

3452
02:34:57,820 --> 02:34:58,820
I have a picture.

3453
02:34:58,820 --> 02:35:01,820
Yeah, exactly. So I kind of see it from that angle where it's like,

3454
02:35:01,820 --> 02:35:04,820
well, if this is all I've got to analyze, I'm going to analyze it

3455
02:35:04,820 --> 02:35:06,820
and there's nothing to really balance it against.

3456
02:35:06,820 --> 02:35:09,820
But hopefully, I mean, the Mass Effect games have done a good job.

3457
02:35:09,820 --> 02:35:11,820
FemShep's a great character.

3458
02:35:11,820 --> 02:35:16,820
And she doesn't at all like sit and stand like that.

3459
02:35:16,820 --> 02:35:21,820
She basically has the male animations, which I'm actually kind of fine with

3460
02:35:21,820 --> 02:35:24,820
because fuck, you've seen me sit.

3461
02:35:24,820 --> 02:35:27,820
You're certainly not basing your decision on the entire game around this.

3462
02:35:27,820 --> 02:35:29,820
No, hell no. That would be stupid.

3463
02:35:29,820 --> 02:35:34,820
I'm just saying they need to be a little bit more cognizant of their audience.

3464
02:35:34,820 --> 02:35:38,820
You know, you have female gamers and we are looking to you

3465
02:35:38,820 --> 02:35:43,820
to make something that we're going to really, really be able to get into.

3466
02:35:43,820 --> 02:35:47,820
I mean... God.

3467
02:35:47,820 --> 02:35:52,820
That's why I really thought that Dragon Age Inquisition was done so well

3468
02:35:52,820 --> 02:35:56,820
and that's why I had a lot of hope for Andromeda and I still do.

3469
02:35:56,820 --> 02:36:01,820
I just think that if this is the start they're giving, they're off to a bad start.

3470
02:36:01,820 --> 02:36:05,820
Although I have to say, though, that the game, what we've seen of it so far,

3471
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:08,820
looks absolutely gorgeous. I'm looking forward to learning more about it.

3472
02:36:08,820 --> 02:36:11,820
And I'm certainly not going to make a judgment on the whole thing

3473
02:36:11,820 --> 02:36:13,820
based on just what I've seen.

3474
02:36:13,820 --> 02:36:18,820
My judgment was on the picture, not on the game.

3475
02:36:18,820 --> 02:36:24,820
And if you can't recognize that, then I'm wondering when you went from

3476
02:36:24,820 --> 02:36:29,820
thinking me to be the only voice of reason to then having an issue with it.

3477
02:36:29,820 --> 02:36:32,820
And I'm not the only voice of reason, by the way.

3478
02:36:32,820 --> 02:36:36,820
You know why? Because sometimes Sanrio comes out here.

3479
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:39,820
That's right. Sometimes Sanrio has to set us straight.

3480
02:36:39,820 --> 02:36:43,820
Anyway, that's all I got. Keep up the good work.

3481
02:36:43,820 --> 02:36:47,820
Regards, Ralstiel UT, OLR Minister of Unpopular Opinions.

3482
02:36:47,820 --> 02:36:52,820
P.S. Hopefully Doom 4 gets delayed enough that it'll drop the week of OLR Episode 666.

3483
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:57,820
And for the record, Ralstiel UT, most of the time I think you're on point for many things.

3484
02:36:58,820 --> 02:37:00,820
We're all going to disagree on something.

3485
02:37:00,820 --> 02:37:04,820
It's like I think Act F to Super Awesome.

3486
02:37:04,820 --> 02:37:07,820
I'm so happy he listens to the show and gives us that perspective.

3487
02:37:07,820 --> 02:37:11,820
But he's so fucking wrong on this team dog and team cat thing, I'm just saying.

3488
02:37:11,820 --> 02:37:15,820
Remember, cats rule and dogs drool.

3489
02:37:15,820 --> 02:37:21,820
All right. Let's get to the F use of the week on that note.

3490
02:37:27,820 --> 02:37:29,820
All this is bad.

3491
02:37:29,820 --> 02:37:31,820
Here is justice.

3492
02:37:31,820 --> 02:37:33,820
Here is punishment.

3493
02:37:33,820 --> 02:37:35,820
Here.

3494
02:37:35,820 --> 02:37:37,820
This is fucked up.

3495
02:37:40,820 --> 02:37:47,820
So my F use goes to Tea Culture for no longer taking credit card and not fixing their damn credit card machine.

3496
02:37:47,820 --> 02:37:54,820
Because I wanted my taro milk tea today with my egg custard in it because I'm cheating today.

3497
02:37:54,820 --> 02:38:05,820
And no. So instead I'm just going to go to Farrell's and shove my face full of delicious peanuts and coffee flavored ice cream and chocolate ice cream.

3498
02:38:05,820 --> 02:38:09,820
I want ice cream. Fuck hormones, man.

3499
02:38:09,820 --> 02:38:11,820
Just all of it.

3500
02:38:11,820 --> 02:38:16,820
I. Yeah, all of it. I'm except, except, except, except.

3501
02:38:16,820 --> 02:38:20,820
Also another fuck you to the Guinness beer brats that I bought because I thought they were going to be amazing.

3502
02:38:20,820 --> 02:38:25,820
And they just don't microwave very well. So I'm going to make my husband throw me the rest of them.

3503
02:38:25,820 --> 02:38:32,820
And I had something else to be angry about, but fuck it.

3504
02:38:32,820 --> 02:38:35,820
I guess I just craving soda.

3505
02:38:35,820 --> 02:38:39,820
I mean, I don't count the Red Bulls as soda. They drink those still.

3506
02:38:39,820 --> 02:38:42,820
Well, only drink about once a day. Except for today.

3507
02:38:42,820 --> 02:38:46,820
I drank two because I didn't drink one yesterday and I was tired.

3508
02:38:46,820 --> 02:38:49,820
I got a massage today, so that's good. No, but yeah.

3509
02:38:49,820 --> 02:38:57,820
It's so happy that because, you know, not really dieting, I guess, and just not eating fast food instead of eating garbage subway and sandwiches.

3510
02:38:57,820 --> 02:39:06,820
So I've been just eating sandwiches for days, but I guess that's healthier than eating like McDonald's for days and cutting out soda.

3511
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:10,820
And I've been staying under like, you know, like 1600 calories a day.

3512
02:39:10,820 --> 02:39:14,820
So, wow. So that's got to be pretty good, right? Even if it is garbage.

3513
02:39:14,820 --> 02:39:21,820
I mean, my a few of the week goes to the popcorn kernel that just got stuck between my teeth.

3514
02:39:21,820 --> 02:39:25,820
And that's why I had to run out of the room real fast, because that is annoying.

3515
02:39:25,820 --> 02:39:28,820
Oh, my God. It's like emergency flossing now.

3516
02:39:28,820 --> 02:39:33,820
That's not so bad. It's when it gets sucked between your gum.

3517
02:39:33,820 --> 02:39:36,820
I can't get it out. Oh, no, no, no, no.

3518
02:39:36,820 --> 02:39:39,820
Oh, my God. It's the worst. So anyway, that's why I ran out.

3519
02:39:39,820 --> 02:39:41,820
So, Drew, did you get to do your FUs or no?

3520
02:39:41,820 --> 02:39:42,820
Not yet. Go ahead.

3521
02:39:42,820 --> 02:39:46,820
Dude, FU did not be able to make it out down to L.A. for AX.

3522
02:39:46,820 --> 02:39:53,820
I mean, seriously, I had encountered the Cosplay Wrestling Federation, or FANMA, and they were funny as hell.

3523
02:39:53,820 --> 02:39:57,820
And I just can't make it down there to enjoy all that kind of good stuff at AX.

3524
02:39:57,820 --> 02:40:03,820
I wanted to go to AX this year because they had, I don't know, maybe it was an AX.

3525
02:40:04,820 --> 02:40:09,820
I'm thinking of Comic-Con because they're doing a Kung Fury screening.

3526
02:40:09,820 --> 02:40:14,820
Kung Fury screening with an after-party where David Hasselhoff is singing True Survivors.

3527
02:40:14,820 --> 02:40:15,820
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

3528
02:40:15,820 --> 02:40:20,820
I'm just going to maintain my FU to Warner Brothers right now until they fix their shit.

3529
02:40:20,820 --> 02:40:21,820
Fix your shirt, guys.

3530
02:40:21,820 --> 02:40:23,820
Fix it. All right.

3531
02:40:23,820 --> 02:40:28,820
Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line to all of you at 1877 Game Oil R,

3532
02:40:28,820 --> 02:40:30,820
our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

3533
02:40:30,820 --> 02:40:32,820
But first, a couple more quick stories. Loki.

3534
02:40:32,820 --> 02:40:42,820
Yes. So Valve has decided that they're going to no longer refund, I guess, bad trades, trade deals anymore.

3535
02:40:42,820 --> 02:40:47,820
Basically, Steam is not going to return items that you were scammed out of.

3536
02:40:47,820 --> 02:40:53,820
They're saying our community assigns an item of value and is at least partially determined by that item's scarcity.

3537
02:40:53,820 --> 02:41:00,820
If more copies of the item are added to the economy through inventory rollbacks, the value of other instances of the item would be reduced.

3538
02:41:00,820 --> 02:41:10,820
We sympathize with people who fall victim to scams, but we provide enough information on our websites within our trading systems to help users to make good trading decisions.

3539
02:41:10,820 --> 02:41:15,820
All trade scams can be avoided, so don't be scammed.

3540
02:41:15,820 --> 02:41:17,820
Be very careful about who you trade with.

3541
02:41:17,820 --> 02:41:23,820
Yeah, that's why I only trade with friends. I don't trust other people.

3542
02:41:23,820 --> 02:41:25,820
It's your responsibility to read.

3543
02:41:25,820 --> 02:41:28,820
Friends of friends, I will, but that's about it.

3544
02:41:28,820 --> 02:41:40,820
Yeah. Anyhow, one game that might inspire some trading of, I don't know, DLC or costume codes or something, is the potential of an open world Superman game.

3545
02:41:40,820 --> 02:41:52,820
There's a rumor that Warner Brothers Games Montreal, who did Batman Arkham Origins, so remember there was the Arkham Origins game that was kind of the bridge between the two other ones, that was done by another studio.

3546
02:41:52,820 --> 02:42:01,820
So apparently this studio, the rumor is that they're working on a Superman video game, and this is because of a supposedly leaked screenshot, but take it with a grain of salt.

3547
02:42:01,820 --> 02:42:09,820
It supposedly shows Superman in the game where you can select the costume or whatever. It shows whatever skin you can.

3548
02:42:09,820 --> 02:42:19,820
Also, there was a rumor last week that WB Games Montreal was trying to hire 15 positions for an open world action game, which was a new IP project for next generation game platforms.

3549
02:42:19,820 --> 02:42:26,820
Now it would make a lot of sense that, you know, if this is going to be the last open world Batman game, why not follow it up with a Superman game?

3550
02:42:26,820 --> 02:42:39,820
However, an important update was also released to this initial rumor, and that is that Warner Brothers Montreal isn't working on a Superman game, but the heavily rumored Suicide Squad game.

3551
02:42:39,820 --> 02:42:46,820
Which would make sense when you consider there's that movie being worked on right now that obviously they would try to tie into that possibly with a game.

3552
02:42:46,820 --> 02:42:55,820
So that could also explain what's going on here. So it's either a Superman game or a Suicide Squad game. Both would make a lot of sense.

3553
02:42:55,820 --> 02:42:57,820
Does it involve flying through rings?

3554
02:42:58,820 --> 02:43:15,820
Actually, I think that would be a really funny side quest type of thing. I think if they were to find a way to work that into the lore where you fly through rings, but they make it tongue in cheek funny, I think that would be okay. I think that would be hilarious.

3555
02:43:15,820 --> 02:43:20,820
They could make it like Superman on the Atari 2600. You gotta find that phone booth.

3556
02:43:20,820 --> 02:43:21,820
Oh god.

3557
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:23,820
Did you ever play Superman on the 2600?

3558
02:43:23,820 --> 02:43:24,820
Heard of.

3559
02:43:24,820 --> 02:43:26,820
Not that old.

3560
02:43:27,820 --> 02:43:40,820
Alright, so that does it for news tonight. So we're going to open up the Skype line. 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Go ahead and get in on there if you want to comment on anything we've talked about tonight.

3561
02:43:40,820 --> 02:43:49,820
Or perhaps something we haven't yet discussed. I'm not going to keep this open very long because we're already almost to 9 o'clock. So if you want to get in, I would urge you to call in ASAP.

3562
02:43:49,820 --> 02:43:52,820
Meanwhile, I know Loki, you had at least one thing you wanted to talk about here.

3563
02:43:53,820 --> 02:44:05,820
Yeah, so apparently Destiny, you know how they had that Red Bull promotion where they had some codes and stuff? They've already been exploited. Apparently the codes were predictable, and so they had a way to figure out what some of those codes would be.

3564
02:44:05,820 --> 02:44:09,820
And they've already redeemed codes that may be on cans that they haven't purchased yet.

3565
02:44:09,820 --> 02:44:10,820
Predictable!

3566
02:44:10,820 --> 02:44:16,820
So you may get some codes if you purchase some of these cans that aren't redeemable because they've already been redeemed.

3567
02:44:20,820 --> 02:44:21,820
Nice shot Bungie.

3568
02:44:21,820 --> 02:44:25,820
Alright, actually our phones are lighting up, so let's get to it. We're getting several calls tonight.

3569
02:44:25,820 --> 02:44:26,820
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3570
02:44:29,820 --> 02:44:31,820
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? You might be on mute.

3571
02:44:34,820 --> 02:44:36,820
I'm going to check one more time. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3572
02:44:37,820 --> 02:44:38,820
Oh, they hung up.

3573
02:44:38,820 --> 02:44:42,820
The joys of live radio everybody. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

3574
02:44:42,820 --> 02:44:46,820
Hey, you can always test your connection by calling Echo 1-2-3 before giving us a call.

3575
02:44:46,820 --> 02:44:49,820
So let's try another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3576
02:44:49,820 --> 02:44:51,820
It's Ronma. What's up everybody?

3577
02:44:51,820 --> 02:44:53,820
I know your Skype works. How you doing buddy?

3578
02:44:54,820 --> 02:44:56,820
I'm doing good. A little tired, but I'm good.

3579
02:44:56,820 --> 02:45:02,820
Did you go to a con this week? I know you're not an AnimeX skype. Is there another con like the East Coast or something that you did this weekend?

3580
02:45:02,820 --> 02:45:09,820
Uh, no. I just went out and kind of got my party on because it was the 4th of July and then I was walking around all over New York City with a couple of friends today.

3581
02:45:09,820 --> 02:45:12,820
Oh, awesome. Good for you. I hope you had a good 4th.

3582
02:45:12,820 --> 02:45:14,820
I did. How about you?

3583
02:45:14,820 --> 02:45:22,820
Uh, it was a little boring actually. But you know what? I played a shitload of Final Fantasy XIV and just relaxed. I had a really stressful week at work.

3584
02:45:22,820 --> 02:45:29,820
So it was nice to just be able to like, relax. So I'm happy for that. Like, I'm ready to go back tomorrow.

3585
02:45:29,820 --> 02:45:30,820
Gotcha.

3586
02:45:30,820 --> 02:45:32,820
So what's on your mind tonight?

3587
02:45:32,820 --> 02:45:38,820
Um, two things. I just want to know, did Junami show up with the joke book?

3588
02:45:38,820 --> 02:45:43,820
I don't see a book, but he does have an electronic device.

3589
02:45:43,820 --> 02:45:45,820
I'm going all digital this time around.

3590
02:45:45,820 --> 02:45:52,820
I feel like in his 30s, I feel like he's moved into the digital age. He has a digital joke book now that he takes with him.

3591
02:45:52,820 --> 02:45:54,820
Oh, god damn it.

3592
02:45:54,820 --> 02:45:55,820
You're welcome.

3593
02:45:55,820 --> 02:45:57,820
Gigabytes and gigabytes, my friend.

3594
02:45:57,820 --> 02:45:59,820
And it's on a Blackberry.

3595
02:45:59,820 --> 02:46:01,820
Bite your tongue.

3596
02:46:01,820 --> 02:46:03,820
Hey, that's the equivalent of toilet paper, right?

3597
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:06,820
I think he's doing a good job tonight though. It's good to have him back.

3598
02:46:07,820 --> 02:46:10,820
Yes, it is. And one more thing. I'm going to get out of here.

3599
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:15,820
The main reason why I called was to give Al his props on his answer. That was amazeballs.

3600
02:46:15,820 --> 02:46:23,820
You know what? Sadly, he's not in the room to hear. He went back to playing MMOs, but he's probably listening on the headset back in the studio.

3601
02:46:23,820 --> 02:46:27,820
So hopefully he'll hear his shout out there. But he's a hilarious guy.

3602
02:46:27,820 --> 02:46:34,820
You know, he's that guy that'll kind of sit in the party and not really say anything and he won't be like super extroverted.

3603
02:46:34,820 --> 02:46:39,820
But then like when he sees the opportunity for a killer joke, he'll throw it out there and just slay the entire party.

3604
02:46:39,820 --> 02:46:47,820
I actually walked out of my house. That's how funny it was. I stopped what I was doing and I just walked out of my house.

3605
02:46:47,820 --> 02:46:53,820
I'm hoping we get somebody in trouble at work for laughing too hard with that answer. We'll see. We'll see come Monday.

3606
02:46:53,820 --> 02:46:55,820
Lord Jesus.

3607
02:46:55,820 --> 02:46:56,820
Alright.

3608
02:46:56,820 --> 02:46:58,820
You need Jesus.

3609
02:46:58,820 --> 02:47:01,820
For the record, I've amended it from Blackberry to an N-Gage.

3610
02:47:01,820 --> 02:47:06,820
You know what? The N-Gage would have probably done a lot better if Patrick Stewart actually promoted that.

3611
02:47:06,820 --> 02:47:07,820
What?

3612
02:47:07,820 --> 02:47:08,820
N-Gage.

3613
02:47:08,820 --> 02:47:09,820
Aww, dude.

3614
02:47:09,820 --> 02:47:14,820
I see you N-Gage and raise you a Windows powered CE device.

3615
02:47:14,820 --> 02:47:15,820
Shut up.

3616
02:47:15,820 --> 02:47:16,820
You mean the Dreamcast?

3617
02:47:16,820 --> 02:47:18,820
I'm talking about before the Dreamcast.

3618
02:47:18,820 --> 02:47:19,820
Oh.

3619
02:47:19,820 --> 02:47:20,820
Oh my god.

3620
02:47:20,820 --> 02:47:26,820
Rama. Rama. Dude, I had a kin. Your point is invalid. Or maybe it is perfectly valid.

3621
02:47:26,820 --> 02:47:29,820
Alright, Rama. I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, alright?

3622
02:47:29,820 --> 02:47:30,820
Awesome.

3623
02:47:30,820 --> 02:47:31,820
Alright. Take care of my friend.

3624
02:47:31,820 --> 02:47:32,820
Alright. Later.

3625
02:47:32,820 --> 02:47:38,820
Alright. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

3626
02:47:38,820 --> 02:47:43,820
So I could go buy a can of Red Bull and somebody somehow already got that code, huh?

3627
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:44,820
Possibly, yeah.

3628
02:47:44,820 --> 02:47:49,820
Alright. Well, the phones are lighting up back to back tonight so let's get back to it with another call.

3629
02:47:49,820 --> 02:47:51,820
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

3630
02:47:51,820 --> 02:47:52,820
Hey, it's Shane.

3631
02:47:52,820 --> 02:47:54,820
Hi, Shane. How are you?

3632
02:47:54,820 --> 02:47:55,820
I'm fine.

3633
02:47:55,820 --> 02:47:57,820
Excellent. What's on your mind tonight?

3634
02:47:57,820 --> 02:48:01,820
So, I just wanted to quickly talk about Persona 4 Dancing All Night.

3635
02:48:01,820 --> 02:48:05,820
Of course you do. Of course you do. By all means.

3636
02:48:05,820 --> 02:48:07,820
Pandering. Go on ahead.

3637
02:48:07,820 --> 02:48:08,820
Talk away.

3638
02:48:08,820 --> 02:48:12,820
So, of course it's an amazing game. Let's just get that out of the way. However...

3639
02:48:12,820 --> 02:48:17,820
You're also super biased. In the interest of you know ethics and all that, you're super biased.

3640
02:48:17,820 --> 02:48:19,820
Go on.

3641
02:48:19,820 --> 02:48:27,820
Not at all. I may or may not have purchased the Kanji in his swimsuit costume already.

3642
02:48:27,820 --> 02:48:29,820
You would.

3643
02:48:29,820 --> 02:48:37,820
Anyway, so it's a Vita game. It looks beautiful. I think it is not suited for Vita in the least.

3644
02:48:37,820 --> 02:48:40,820
If you're gonna get it, I say play it on PlayStation TV.

3645
02:48:40,820 --> 02:48:42,820
Oh, interesting.

3646
02:48:42,820 --> 02:48:47,820
Because the controls, while functional on Vita, pretty uncomfortable.

3647
02:48:47,820 --> 02:48:50,820
Is it like thumbstick based or something?

3648
02:48:50,820 --> 02:48:59,820
It is. It's the up, left, down, and then the triangle, circle, X, as well as thumbsticks.

3649
02:48:59,820 --> 02:49:04,820
Or you can play with the touch screen, which I just don't find fun at all.

3650
02:49:04,820 --> 02:49:09,820
But, my god, those buttons being so small and the amount of stuff you have to do with them,

3651
02:49:09,820 --> 02:49:13,820
just really uncomfortable unless you have like tiny baby hands.

3652
02:49:13,820 --> 02:49:15,820
Oh, jeebus. That's gonna give me hand cramps.

3653
02:49:15,820 --> 02:49:18,820
After an hour, my hands were dying.

3654
02:49:18,820 --> 02:49:21,820
I was gonna say, maybe it was designed a little more with the Vita 2.0 in mind,

3655
02:49:21,820 --> 02:49:25,820
but the buttons, I feel like, are even smaller on the Vita 2.0, so maybe not.

3656
02:49:25,820 --> 02:49:29,820
Sorry, I'm in a Final Fantasy hunt right now.

3657
02:49:29,820 --> 02:49:38,820
It's a really good game, though, and it is very story heavy, so you do want to know some Japanese for that.

3658
02:49:38,820 --> 02:49:43,820
Or you can play the Free Dancing mode, where you can unlock songs just by regular play.

3659
02:49:43,820 --> 02:49:48,820
It's a lot of fun. It reminds me of a cross between, obviously, Persona,

3660
02:49:48,820 --> 02:49:59,820
maybe a little bit of Dance Summit from PlayStation 2, and, I don't know, sex, because it's so good.

3661
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:02,820
Story in a rhythm game. Okay, I'm geeking out now.

3662
02:50:02,820 --> 02:50:06,820
What is it that makes this game so good? You keep saying it's good, but why?

3663
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:09,820
The music. Oh, the music is so good.

3664
02:50:09,820 --> 02:50:13,820
And watching them dance, I thought it was going to be a stupid concept.

3665
02:50:13,820 --> 02:50:16,820
Nope, works perfect. Abso-freaking-lutely love it.

3666
02:50:16,820 --> 02:50:20,820
I don't know, it's just really good.

3667
02:50:20,820 --> 02:50:25,820
The graphics for a Vita game? A lot better than I thought it would be.

3668
02:50:25,820 --> 02:50:28,820
Was not expecting it to look as good as it does.

3669
02:50:28,820 --> 02:50:33,820
The music, again, it has the Kiriyama Oka doing a remix.

3670
02:50:33,820 --> 02:50:40,820
It's got a lot of other good artists I've never heard of, because I don't really listen to anything Japanese.

3671
02:50:40,820 --> 02:50:48,820
But if you like Persona music, if you like Persona, if you like rhythm games in general, you're going to absolutely love this.

3672
02:50:48,820 --> 02:50:53,820
But now we are getting this in the States, so people can be patient and play the story mode and all that stuff, right?

3673
02:50:53,820 --> 02:50:59,820
Yes, I would actually suggest, I don't know, it's supposed to be this fall, I don't know how far into fall.

3674
02:50:59,820 --> 02:51:00,820
It's supposed to be in October.

3675
02:51:01,820 --> 02:51:05,820
I would pretty much say, just wait.

3676
02:51:05,820 --> 02:51:08,820
Shane, one last question.

3677
02:51:08,820 --> 02:51:15,820
You said you got Kanji in swimsuit, I have to ask out of purely morbid curiosity, does it also include the seaweed instance?

3678
02:51:15,820 --> 02:51:18,820
And if you played Persona 4, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

3679
02:51:18,820 --> 02:51:20,820
Oh yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.

3680
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:29,820
I do not see that as an unlockable costume yet, maybe it's DLC, but I don't see it as one I can unlock yet.

3681
02:51:30,820 --> 02:51:34,820
Now Shane, one more question I have to ask you since we're talking about Vita's.

3682
02:51:34,820 --> 02:51:43,820
You knew about my present because Alan told you before it actually showed up here, so what was your reaction to hearing that I was going to be getting the Heavensward Vita?

3683
02:51:43,820 --> 02:51:48,820
I thought it was really cool that you were getting it. I wasn't going to, like, murder you.

3684
02:51:48,820 --> 02:51:50,820
Not today anyway.

3685
02:51:50,820 --> 02:51:56,820
I already threw away the three copies of the house key I made, so I can't come steal it at night.

3686
02:51:59,820 --> 02:52:04,820
I figure if you were going to murder me, you would have done it at some point in the last decade, because we've known each other far too long.

3687
02:52:04,820 --> 02:52:10,820
Yeah, no that's really cool, I have to come see it sometime. I really like that box though, as I've told you.

3688
02:52:10,820 --> 02:52:12,820
It's okay, I'll just sneak it out and take it to work.

3689
02:52:12,820 --> 02:52:14,820
You will do nothing of the sort.

3690
02:52:14,820 --> 02:52:17,820
Alright, alright Shane, I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, okay?

3691
02:52:17,820 --> 02:52:19,820
That's fine, I've got to go do more hunts.

3692
02:52:19,820 --> 02:52:20,820
Alright, have fun.

3693
02:52:20,820 --> 02:52:21,820
Alright, bye bye.

3694
02:52:21,820 --> 02:52:22,820
Bye.

3695
02:52:22,820 --> 02:52:28,820
Alright, 1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

3696
02:52:28,820 --> 02:52:33,820
And we'll try to squeeze in one more call here. Do we have any other? Oh, god, it's already lighting up.

3697
02:52:33,820 --> 02:52:37,820
You won't play match game, but you're calling to the show. Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3698
02:52:37,820 --> 02:52:40,820
Yo, Rob, it's Genicor from the OKC, how you doing, man?

3699
02:52:40,820 --> 02:52:43,820
It has been a long time since we've heard from you, my friend. How are you?

3700
02:52:43,820 --> 02:52:46,820
You know, just trying to keep that job, you know how that goes.

3701
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:50,820
I know very well how that goes. What's on your mind tonight, my friend?

3702
02:52:50,820 --> 02:53:01,820
Not much, man. I was thinking about getting back into the podcast game, but I don't think there's anything out there that I can really cover that isn't being covered by, like, five or six people that are at YouTube and podcasts and then all this stuff has jumped all over the place.

3703
02:53:01,820 --> 02:53:11,820
You know what? I don't think you should let that stop you. You know, I think if anybody has a passion, they can bring something to the table that other people aren't doing, because it's about you.

3704
02:53:11,820 --> 02:53:21,820
And everybody, I mean, God, that sounds very egotistical. I don't mean, like, I expect that people are subscribing to OLR because it's me, but it's because the opinions, you know, that we share.

3705
02:53:21,820 --> 02:53:30,820
And I think, I think DarkSakura kind of hit on this a little bit ago when she was talking about the email that came in and it's like, you know, I mostly agree with this guy, but this one, I think he's off the mark.

3706
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:35,820
I respect, you know, it's kind of like that's what you say, I respect it, but, you know, we're going to agree to disagree on that.

3707
02:53:35,820 --> 02:53:41,820
And I think, you know, that's the kind of stuff that we all bring to the table is that it's different perspectives and things like that.

3708
02:53:41,820 --> 02:53:49,820
So I don't think, Xenocore, you should ever let the fact that someone else is doing it be the sole thing to kind of stop you.

3709
02:53:49,820 --> 02:54:00,820
It may make it trickier to market your show and to sell your show because, you know, you're going to have to kind of say, well, what is it I'm doing that's going to make people want to check me out as opposed to somebody else?

3710
02:54:00,820 --> 02:54:12,820
But you'll find that. And I think maybe part of it is to just kind of start doing, do a pilot episode, do a test run and just see what happens, analyze it, see what you want to do better, what you like and you didn't like about it.

3711
02:54:12,820 --> 02:54:13,820
Anyway.

3712
02:54:13,820 --> 02:54:20,820
It's not so much that, it's mainly because I'm such an old fart when it comes to games now that, you know, I just think of all these guys as whippersnappers.

3713
02:54:20,820 --> 02:54:27,820
I saw the Nintendo World Championships. I was crying because they were so bad. It was ridiculous. They have no gamer sense. I was embarrassed.

3714
02:54:28,820 --> 02:54:31,820
How do you think we feel here on OLR?

3715
02:54:31,820 --> 02:54:33,820
I hope you feel the same as me.

3716
02:54:33,820 --> 02:54:51,820
I think we do a little bit. We do. But I think that's okay because, you know, our generation, you know, I remember when we were, you know, 15 years old or what have you, when we were younger, it would seem like there were very few people in their 30s and 40s that were into gaming.

3717
02:54:51,820 --> 02:54:59,820
I mean, sure there were some. I'm not going to say there were none. But it seemed like there were very few. There were a lot more people that didn't understand it. Like a lot of our parents didn't really get it.

3718
02:54:59,820 --> 02:55:07,820
But now that that generation has grown up and we are the 30, 40 somethings, I think there's a lot more people now that get it.

3719
02:55:07,820 --> 02:55:23,820
And I think what's funny is that you say that, but yet I feel like there's not enough out there for the older gamer, or I hate to say middle-aged gamer, but you know, just the gamer in their 30s and 40s. The Gen X gamer.

3720
02:55:23,820 --> 02:55:29,820
Yeah, because that balloon fight thing was horrible. It's like, what? Have you never even touched this game before in your life? What's wrong with you people?

3721
02:55:29,820 --> 02:55:31,820
I know, right? These damn kids.

3722
02:55:31,820 --> 02:55:34,820
It's just me getting crotchety telling kids to get off my lawn. I think that's a big problem.

3723
02:55:34,820 --> 02:55:40,820
That's alright. Well maybe that's an angle for your show. Where are you going to tell all the kids to get off your lawn today and why?

3724
02:55:40,820 --> 02:55:42,820
Yeah, Uncle Zeno's lawn.

3725
02:55:42,820 --> 02:55:48,820
There you go! There you go, gaming with Uncle Zeno. And this is why y'all need to be taught some things about balloon fight.

3726
02:55:48,820 --> 02:55:51,820
Alright, awesome show guys. Keep up the good work.

3727
02:55:51,820 --> 02:55:54,820
Thank you so much Zenocore. Best of luck to whatever it is you decide to do.

3728
02:55:54,820 --> 02:55:55,820
Alright, take care.

3729
02:55:55,820 --> 02:55:56,820
Alright, take care. Bye bye.

3730
02:55:57,820 --> 02:56:01,820
Look at that fifth dream in chat. It says, I'd co-host that. There it is. Alright.

3731
02:56:01,820 --> 02:56:04,820
I am going to shut down the Skype line for tonight. I'm so sorry to those who didn't get through.

3732
02:56:04,820 --> 02:56:14,820
Please consider sending us an email. Participate at OrangeLawnsRadio.com or tweet. Twitter.com slash O-L-R or one of the other several different ways that you can interact with our show.

3733
02:56:14,820 --> 02:56:16,820
Any other last minute stories you want to get out there, Loki?

3734
02:56:16,820 --> 02:56:17,820
No.

3735
02:56:17,820 --> 02:56:18,820
We're going to close up shop tonight.

3736
02:56:18,820 --> 02:56:19,820
We can close up shop.

3737
02:56:19,820 --> 02:56:23,820
Shut it down. Shut it down. Hey Drew, good to see you buddy.

3738
02:56:23,820 --> 02:56:24,820
I'll be back.

3739
02:56:24,820 --> 02:56:28,820
I'll be back now that you're in your thirties. Oh my God.

3740
02:56:28,820 --> 02:56:31,820
Isn't that just a kick in the head?

3741
02:56:31,820 --> 02:56:37,820
It is. You were the dumb kid. You know I say that with love. I say that with love.

3742
02:56:37,820 --> 02:56:40,820
Also a lot of truth because I was kind of the dumb kid.

3743
02:56:40,820 --> 02:56:50,820
Well, so was I. You know, I go back to, oh my God, when I was like first doing this show at like 23, 24, whatever, I'm a completely different person than I am now. Completely different.

3744
02:56:50,820 --> 02:56:54,820
We were making jokes about red Oreos and pizza.

3745
02:56:54,820 --> 02:56:57,820
And now red velvet Oreos are a thing.

3746
02:56:57,820 --> 02:57:01,820
It's come full circle. How about that shit?

3747
02:57:01,820 --> 02:57:04,820
Anyhow, Drew, I don't know if you have anything to plug.

3748
02:57:04,820 --> 02:57:06,820
But no pizza Oreos.

3749
02:57:06,820 --> 02:57:07,820
Not yet.

3750
02:57:07,820 --> 02:57:08,820
Would they be pizza Oreos?

3751
02:57:08,820 --> 02:57:11,820
They'd be combos is what they are. Combos are good enough.

3752
02:57:11,820 --> 02:57:15,820
Alright, if you can find them. Jesus, those things are impossible to find.

3753
02:57:16,820 --> 02:57:19,820
Drew, I don't know if you have anything to plug. Everybody's got their own podcast these days.

3754
02:57:19,820 --> 02:57:24,820
I don't know if you have anything you want to plug. But if not, maybe a Twitter or something where people can follow you. Say hi.

3755
02:57:24,820 --> 02:57:27,820
No, I'm just running solo at this point. Mostly off the map.

3756
02:57:27,820 --> 02:57:35,820
But expect me. I'm going to see if I can make my most triumphant return over on the IRC chat again.

3757
02:57:35,820 --> 02:57:36,820
Nice.

3758
02:57:36,820 --> 02:57:41,820
And see if I can be a regular again. So give me my mops so I can go ahead and kick some butts.

3759
02:57:41,820 --> 02:57:47,820
Well, since it's been four years, know that we're in channel VOG.

3760
02:57:47,820 --> 02:57:48,820
I've been there.

3761
02:57:48,820 --> 02:57:49,820
Things have changed a little bit.

3762
02:57:49,820 --> 02:57:51,820
Senile old coot.

3763
02:57:51,820 --> 02:57:55,820
Listen up, bitch. I'm going to take that book and shove it up your ass.

3764
02:57:55,820 --> 02:57:59,820
Alright, come back again sometime. But not too soon. Just kidding.

3765
02:57:59,820 --> 02:58:00,820
Will do.

3766
02:58:00,820 --> 02:58:05,820
Alright, let's see. Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.

3767
02:58:05,820 --> 02:58:09,820
Hey, if you like what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, support independent broadcasting.

3768
02:58:09,820 --> 02:58:14,820
If you thought this show was a hot goddamn mess, and who could blame you after Match Game? No, I'm kidding.

3769
02:58:14,820 --> 02:58:18,820
Just support another show out there. Send another show of your love.

3770
02:58:18,820 --> 02:58:22,820
Because there's a lot of people out there who work very, very hard to create this sort of content.

3771
02:58:22,820 --> 02:58:25,820
So thank you all for supporting us.

3772
02:58:25,820 --> 02:58:29,820
You can leave a nice five star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio if you want.

3773
02:58:29,820 --> 02:58:31,820
Go leave a five star review that said,

3774
02:58:31,820 --> 02:58:34,820
Allen's joke just sold this entire show to me tonight.

3775
02:58:34,820 --> 02:58:35,820
There you go, if you want.

3776
02:58:35,820 --> 02:58:41,820
Alright, but for now, it's time to wrap up and go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.

3777
02:58:41,820 --> 02:58:43,820
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

3778
02:58:43,820 --> 02:58:45,820
You both said hard and butt.

3779
02:58:47,820 --> 02:58:49,820
You're so mature.

3780
02:58:49,820 --> 02:58:51,820
Drew, do you have a final thought tonight?

3781
02:58:51,820 --> 02:58:55,820
Dude, you called me five times in the middle of the show. You have the wrong number, dude.

3782
02:58:55,820 --> 02:59:03,820
My final thought is, now I'm craving combos after I already ate an entire box of Mike and Ikes.

3783
02:59:03,820 --> 02:59:06,820
This is why I'm fat. This is why Mike and Ikes are so good.

3784
02:59:06,820 --> 02:59:08,820
Cowboy Breaker!

3785
02:59:08,820 --> 02:59:11,820
Anyway, last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

3786
02:59:11,820 --> 02:59:15,820
I'm thinking about doing another game jam in a couple weeks.

3787
02:59:15,820 --> 02:59:21,820
But, just to be clear though, it wouldn't be anything beyond a game jam.

3788
02:59:21,820 --> 02:59:27,820
It would be, I'm done after, well, it's a 72 hour game jam, but I only have 10 hours to do it.

3789
02:59:27,820 --> 02:59:29,820
Because of family.

3790
02:59:29,820 --> 02:59:31,820
My gosh.

3791
02:59:33,820 --> 02:59:35,820
Okay, then.

3792
02:59:35,820 --> 02:59:37,820
One member of your family.

3793
02:59:37,820 --> 02:59:39,820
Also, congratulations to my sister who just had her baby yesterday.

3794
02:59:39,820 --> 02:59:43,820
I saw that. Congratulations, you're now an uncle as well as a dad.

3795
02:59:43,820 --> 02:59:45,820
That's great.

3796
02:59:45,820 --> 02:59:51,820
By the way, one of the founders of Burt's Bees, the Burt behind it, died.

3797
02:59:51,820 --> 02:59:53,820
Did he get stunk by a bee?

3798
02:59:53,820 --> 02:59:55,820
No.

3799
02:59:55,820 --> 02:59:57,820
Why would I say that?

3800
02:59:57,820 --> 03:00:01,820
He's just old and lived on a farm with no power.

3801
03:00:01,820 --> 03:00:03,820
No power on a farm?

3802
03:00:03,820 --> 03:00:07,820
Did he perhaps go up into a giant wicker man and go, the bees!

3803
03:00:07,820 --> 03:00:09,820
Not the bees!

3804
03:00:09,820 --> 03:00:11,820
I hate all of you.

3805
03:00:11,820 --> 03:00:13,820
Except Alan. I love Alan.

3806
03:00:13,820 --> 03:00:17,820
And on that note, we'll see you next week. Jamie hates all of you. Good night.

3807
03:00:17,820 --> 03:00:21,820
