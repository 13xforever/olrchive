0	17240	This week, the crowdfunding train rolls on with news of everything from campaigns getting
17240	20080	a physical release to indie hopefuls backing down from their labor of love.
20080	23640	For now, we're bringing you all the details in a game of our very own, and it all starts
23640	30640	right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
30640	34740	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34740	36680	where every gamer has a voice.
36680	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 604, July the 5th of 2015.
45000	49080	Hope you all had a happy July 4th weekend if you're here in the States.
49080	52360	If you are up in Canada, then I hope you all had a great Canada Day.
52360	55280	If you're somewhere else in the world, well, I hope you had a good week.
55280	60220	My name is Rob Roberts here in studio to talk games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle
60220	66480	with my co-host, say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
66480	68000	And is that your final word on the matter?
68000	69000	No.
69000	70000	How are you, Jamie?
70000	71000	I'm okay.
71000	72000	Good, good.
72000	73000	Just okay.
73000	76720	Yeah, I was going to go get milk tea, and their credit card machine's been broken for
76720	81860	three months, and I still haven't fixed it, and I'm like, but I want milk tea.
81860	82980	What place is this?
82980	85020	It's the tea culture place that I go to.
85020	86020	Oh, it must be.
86020	87020	It's like on-
87020	88020	I was like, what kind of place does-
88020	90580	Florin whatever the hell that turns into Twat Avenue.
90580	94780	I was like, what kind of place doesn't get their little credit thing fixed?
94780	95780	It's crazy.
95780	96780	It's a tile.
96780	98780	Fix your tile.
98780	102380	Anyway, I was going to say, you know where I went today.
102380	103940	You always talk about this place here locally.
103940	106780	We're going to talk locally for a minute, so you all deal with this.
106780	109660	But I'm sure you have one of these in your town somewhere.
110140	112940	Alan and I finally went over to the International Market in Rancho Cordova.
112940	113940	We hadn't been there.
113940	115580	I don't think I've ever been there.
115580	116580	Well, okay.
116580	122980	I remember when it was just a little Asian grocery store, but at some point, it absorbed
122980	126740	the Albertsons or whatever it was that used to be next to it, and now it's a mega store
126740	128060	of international stuff.
128060	132140	And I was going to bring green tea Kit Kat to the show because they have the flavored
132140	133860	Kit Kats and stuff, and I was like, nah.
133860	135500	I still visit Oto's as well.
135500	136500	I like candy.
136500	137500	Probably a bad idea.
137500	138500	I don't know.
138540	140900	Matcha Kit Kats, pretty bomb.
140900	143980	They only had green tea and dark chocolate, but still, you don't see the other flavors
143980	144980	in the States ever.
144980	147100	You know what they get at Oto's though?
147100	149620	They have the cookies and cream Oreo soft cookies.
149620	150940	That sounds real good.
150940	151940	Mm-hmm.
151940	152940	Real good.
152940	153940	All right.
153940	154940	Oh, they have matcha Oreos too.
154940	158620	Well, we're talking about food before we talk about video games, so it must be a good time
158620	159620	to introduce us.
159620	160620	Well, Tech Master, Loki.
160620	161620	Hello.
161620	162620	How you doing, Loki?
162620	163620	I'm doing fine.
163620	164620	Have you been to the International Market?
164620	165620	Yeah.
165620	166620	Yeah?
166620	167620	There's some good stuff over there.
167940	168940	All sorts of things.
168940	169940	I don't know.
169940	172460	I guess maybe one of these days I'll load us up on candy and bring it to the show.
172460	176860	What I was trying to find over in the ... They had a Japanese candy aisle, and I was trying
176860	180460	to find some of the stuff that Akuma JP sent us in the care package a while ago.
180460	185180	I did find Hello Kitty marshmallows, and I almost bought those, but I didn't want to
185180	188740	walk up to the checkout and just be like, hi, I just want to buy these Hello Kitty marshmallows
188740	191300	because then I'm kind of creepy.
191300	192300	Let's be real.
192300	194300	You would not be the first.
194300	196100	They don't care.
196100	199780	I would not be the first to only buy Hello Kitty marshmallows at the grocery store?
199780	203900	I did have my Japanese food experience today because I found a place near my house that
203900	205860	does curry rice.
205860	207900	On top of that, they did karaoke curry rice.
207900	208900	Nice.
208900	209900	I was happy.
209900	210900	Nom, nom, nom.
210900	211900	All right.
211900	212900	It's like my ...
212900	213900	Lots of food talk.
213900	215420	Yes, I did say Twat Avenue.
215420	216420	It's what, but ...
216420	222140	Hey, if you want to join us and comment on the show, and Dark Sakura will randomly respond
222140	225860	to you as she just did, you can participate with us live every Sunday night at the Voice
225860	230640	of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the
230640	231640	Bobby Black Wolf show.
231640	238460	If you are listening live, join us and chat, live.vognetwork.com, who Tigerclaw, taking
238460	242100	the opportunity because I brought up Hello Kitty, Tigerclaw bouncing in with the opportunity
242100	244620	to remind us they're going to be making a movie out of Hello Kitty.
244620	247660	I don't know if you saw that news this week, but they are officially making a Hello Kitty
247660	252720	movie, which I guess the distinction is it's probably the first big screen movie because
252720	255700	there's tons of Hello Kitty VHSs and stuff already.
255700	260940	I'm sure there's like mini movies and stuff, but this is like the first big movie, Hello
260940	262220	Kitty's big fucking deal.
262220	267840	If you want to see the best thing that Sanrio ever put out, just watch Turin's Bell, and
267840	269840	then cry.
269840	275420	Cry like you've never cried before because it will make you cry like you're three years
275420	278780	old and someone stepped on your foot and took your lollipop.
278780	283180	On a scale of one to Grave of the Fireflies, how hard am I going to cry?
283180	285580	Probably Grave of the Fireflies.
285580	286580	That's pretty bad.
286580	287740	It's Doug of Flanders level.
287740	288740	Oh, dang.
288740	289740	All right.
289740	292460	Except instead of all the sad, it's also got all of the violence.
292460	293460	All right.
293460	294460	And this is for children.
294460	299020	On a scale of one to the ending of Dancer in the Dark, how wet will my t-shirt be?
299020	300740	You know, I haven't seen Dancer in the Dark.
300740	301740	Okay.
301740	302740	But I know it's really sad.
302740	303740	It's really sad.
303740	309260	So I'm going to say it's as sad as Bjork's last experimental album.
309260	311520	Oh, that's not sad.
311520	312520	That's tragic.
312520	313520	There's a difference.
313520	314520	Tragic.
314520	315520	It's tragic.
315560	316560	Don't cry.
316560	317560	All right.
317560	319800	Speaking of tragic, let's introduce our guests for tonight.
319800	321440	You like that segue?
321440	323040	No, I love this.
323040	327780	This guy has not been on the show in a very, very long time.
327780	330720	He's really old school when it comes to OLR.
330720	333120	And we're really happy to have him back on the show.
333120	337400	Everybody, please give a warm welcome back to Intern Druunami.
337400	338400	He's here tonight.
338400	339400	Hey there, internet.
339400	340400	You miss me?
340400	342440	No, but our aim is improving.
342440	343440	How are you?
343440	344440	How have you been?
344440	345440	Oh, God.
345440	346440	I've been on this show.
346440	348760	You knocked over the soundboard in, what, 2007, 2008?
348760	353200	Yeah, I heard that that one came home to Roos not too long ago.
353200	354200	Yeah.
354200	358600	Well, I think somebody put together like a top 10 OLR moments, and I'm pretty sure that
358600	359600	was in it somewhere.
359600	360600	Oh, Jesus.
360600	364640	You're right there up with the diva fit, Loki singing.
364640	365720	That's all up there.
365720	366720	The tingle bet.
366720	367720	I think we're all in the...
367720	370560	Actually, Loki was not the only one singing that day, too.
370560	372440	I made an ass out of myself then, too.
372440	373440	That's right.
373440	374440	It was a fun episode.
374440	378840	It has been a couple of years, but I figured I'd pop on it.
378840	385280	I just barely missed the birthday show, which is also my birthday show, but life goes on.
385280	387600	We were both born.
387600	390960	When you put both and born together, you get borth.
390960	393960	We were borth on June...
393960	395520	We were brought forth by birth.
395520	396520	We were both...
396520	397520	Somebody call the Game Grumps.
397520	398520	We've got something going here now.
398520	400040	On June 23rd.
400040	401040	What does that even mean?
401040	402040	I don't know.
402040	403040	Was that shade?
403040	404600	Was that shade in my own house?
404600	405600	Just a touch.
405600	409000	Were we borth on June 23rd, both of us?
409000	410000	Indeed.
410000	411000	Indeed.
411000	412000	There you go.
412000	413360	Now, you were mentioning before the show...
413360	414360	Hold on.
414360	415360	Okay.
415360	418340	How old were you when you first came on OLR for the very first time?
418340	419340	You were 17, right?
419340	420340	Oh, yeah.
420340	421340	I was 17.
421340	422340	You were 17.
422340	423340	Episode 29.
423340	424340	Oh, my God.
424340	425340	Okay.
425340	427820	So you were 17 years old, and that's why we used to pick on you.
427820	431160	We call you Intern Drew, because you're a youngin'.
431160	432680	You're a dumb kid, right?
432680	433680	Uh-huh.
433680	435360	And how old did you just turn on your birthday?
435360	436360	30.
436360	437360	Oh, my God.
437360	440000	Now I'm officially in the old folks' home with rest of y'all.
440000	441000	Oh, my God.
441000	442000	Hold on a minute.
442000	443400	No, no, no, no, no.
443400	444880	I'm not in the old folks' home.
444880	450120	I'm one of those crazy old people who's going out skiing and riding roller coasters.
450120	451560	You don't have to hit me with your walker like that.
451560	452560	I can't watch my swingin'.
452560	453560	Hold on.
453560	454560	Hold on.
454560	455560	What?
455560	456560	I say this with the utmost respect.
456560	459200	That dumb ass kid turned 30.
459200	461080	This dumb ass kid turned 30.
461080	462080	Wowie.
462080	464560	I'm just a dumb ass man.
464560	466560	Okay, here we go.
466560	467560	Love it.
467560	468560	Yeah, you're still a kid.
468560	470800	Nah, you're still a kid compared to the rest of us.
470800	472920	Kid or squid now?
472920	473920	Are you a kid or a squid?
473920	474920	You decide.
474920	475920	Uh, wait.
475920	476920	Hold on.
476920	479200	Get this right, or you're leaving.
479200	480200	You will be voting...
480200	481200	Teamcat.net.
481200	482200	Thank you.
482200	483200	All right, thank you.
483200	484200	You even knew the question.
484200	485200	I don't even have the Wii U yet, but Teamcat.
485200	486200	Thank you.
486200	487200	Thank you.
487200	488200	Anybody who's Teamdog, you're not allowed tonight.
489200	490200	That was bullshit that you won.
490200	491200	Get out.
491200	492200	We'll throw you out.
492200	493200	Tuck and roll.
493200	494200	I'm just kidding.
494200	497200	I can see Act Def sitting there at his keyboard fuming.
497200	498200	You're just salty, Rob Roberts.
498200	500200	The salt must flow.
500200	502200	Yes, I am.
502200	504940	Yes, I am salty.
504940	508800	Just dip me in ketchup and feed me to the McDonald's fans.
508800	514240	Speaking of ketchup and food, you did see what I made Friday night as my celebration
514240	516920	of all things American by making Canadian food.
516920	517920	Oh, you made poutine.
518640	519640	I made poutine.
519640	520640	Poutine.
520640	524240	It was your like amalgamation of Canada and 4th of July.
524240	525240	It was your...
525240	527640	And then you know what we had on the 4th of July?
527640	528640	What?
528640	530640	Panda Express!
530640	531640	Cuz murica.
531640	532640	Cuz murica.
532640	533800	Well, let's be real.
533800	534800	That ain't Chinese food.
534800	535800	I know, right?
535800	536800	Oh, don't worry.
536800	539920	There was nothing more murica than me having a burrito for lunch yesterday.
539920	540920	Geez.
540920	541920	That was so fun.
541920	542920	Let's see.
542920	547040	Welcome back to our chat room live.vognetwork.com.
547040	550480	ActDeft in chat says, team dog one, deal with it.
550480	551480	You know what?
551480	553160	I'm gonna give you something to deal with in a minute here.
553160	557800	S2100Matt says, Drew is probably the only 30 year old intern on a gaming podcast.
557800	558920	Is that, is that research?
558920	559920	Is that verifiable?
559920	560920	Can we verify that?
560920	561920	Can we vet that?
561920	562920	Yeah.
562920	563920	Can we vet that?
563920	564920	I wasn't listening to you.
564920	571000	DarkTetsuya in chat says, yeah, last time Drew was on was episode 417, the ninth anniversary.
571000	573240	Hey, I don't update the Wiki for nothing.
573240	574240	Wow.
574240	575240	DarkTetsuya.
575240	576240	Wow.
576240	578240	He's, he's like encyclopedia Britannica of this show.
578240	580080	So you haven't been on the show in about four years.
580080	584640	I'm hoping to make it a little bit more regular, but you know, we never know.
584640	586320	Well, let me, let me level set a bit here.
586320	589380	Cause we do, we do talk about video games here on OLR, believe it or not.
589380	592560	And there's people that, you know, probably never, who is this guy?
592560	594840	Who's this guy you're making jokes with and picking on?
594840	599640	You know, believe it or not, like more people find OLR and actually stick around after they
599640	601260	download an episode or two.
601260	604560	So we have some listeners here that we haven't had, we didn't have four years ago.
604560	607800	So let's reintroduce Drew a little bit to the listeners.
607800	613200	So you're, you're 30 here in the same area where we're at.
613200	614520	What types of video games do you play?
614520	615880	What kind of gamer are you?
615880	620320	Well, primarily these days, well, I've always been a big RPG gamer, um, been dabbling into
620320	623120	final fantasy since, you know, the very start.
623120	629040	So more JRPG stuff, uh, dabbling final fantasy 11 for a while.
629040	632080	Ragnarok online, 14 still play a lot of wow.
632080	636960	Uh, though lately I've been becoming the kind of the stereotypical Atlas nerd real big into
636960	641600	the persona series, but, uh, so you're definitely JRPG.
641600	644280	If you're following Atlas like that, that's usually a sign, right?
644280	645280	Oh yeah.
645280	649260	Edit my seat, waiting for persona five to hit all big tales of fan boy, things like
649260	650260	that.
650260	651720	But, uh, I try to dabble all sorts of stuff.
651720	653800	How many stuffed printies do you own?
653800	655840	Um, just the one actually.
655840	656840	Just one?
656840	657840	Okay.
657840	664200	Uh, you know, collection going, but I, uh, they explode too often, you know, uh, they're
664200	665200	up to what?
665200	666680	Disgaea five just came out in Japan.
666680	667680	Is that here?
667680	668680	I can't remember.
668680	669680	Yeah.
669680	673560	I haven't big that been that big into this, uh, Disgaea series, uh, when my strategy fix
673560	675640	had been mostly into Fire Emblem lately.
675640	676640	Okay.
676640	680000	That game was in the news a lot last week with strategy waifu simulator.
680000	681000	Yeah.
681000	682000	Yeah.
682000	683000	Okay.
683000	687520	Uh, so you're, you're mostly JRPGs, uh, console favorite console that you play on or are you
687520	693320	more PC, Mac, still kind of evenly split between PC and PS three.
693320	697440	I'm trying to get into PS four and, and, uh, is, is getting more games up there.
697440	701800	I'm probably one of the only people alive that still owns a Vita, but you know, persona.
701800	704680	We're going to talk about that in a little bit, actually you're not, and we'll talk about
704680	712120	why in a little bit, but, uh, yeah, just a Mr. RPG still play a few music games, still
712120	717760	hyped up for rock band for, uh, whenever they decide to fully release that.
717760	721600	So kind of waiting for the song list, but you know, some of it's creeping out there.
721600	725380	What do you think about the whole fact that you can use your old library with rock band
725380	726380	four?
726380	727380	I think that's rad.
727380	730600	Well, I'd hate to have all that, uh, TLC be for nothing here.
730600	731800	Well, here's the thing.
731800	736800	It was actually, I would say it was about a good 25% of what factored my decision to
736800	742440	finally buy an Xbox one was the fact that all my rock band songs are on three 60 and
742440	746320	they, they will, if you get Xbox one, you will be able to bring in the three 60s library.
746320	751400	That was part of my decision to get a PS four, come to think of it as like, if they decided
751400	755280	to ignore, you know, completely ignore that I'm like, I'd probably be all torches and
755280	757360	pitch pitch works about it.
757360	763320	Um, let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vog network.com, uh, tech 2030 and
763320	765240	chat says, quote, tales of a fan boy.
765240	766520	I already like them.
766520	767640	There it is.
767640	768640	They like you drew it.
768640	769640	They really like you.
769640	771120	Um, let's see, what do you mean?
771120	774720	Well, we'll get into your gaming weeks a little later, but, uh, let's talk about some of your
774720	775720	very favorite.
775720	779040	I always like to ask what's like your favorite game of all time period.
779040	780040	Oh geez.
780040	785080	Um, I'd have to pander to Jamie and probably see it somewhere close to the guardian legend.
785080	789080	Uh, that's pandering to me too, although tales of the abyss comes close.
789080	790080	Okay.
790080	791920	It is almost in all fashion is a perfect RPG.
791920	792920	All right.
792920	793920	Awesome.
793920	794920	Awesome.
794920	796960	Uh, how did you meet all of us here at OLR?
796960	802600	Oh God, everybody was in the DDR scene over in Roseville and, uh, happened to see you
802600	808400	guys play in DDR one day, uh, went to, uh, went out on vacation in New York, saw this
808400	814160	podcast is like, wait, I know these folks wound up tuning into what was very, very first
814160	816040	episode of OLR.
816040	821560	You, you are part of the circle of 12 you there's, there were 12 people that listened
821560	822880	to the first episode of OLR.
822880	826480	We know dark Tetsuya was one JV Mon was one, and now you're one, I mean, hell I was there
826480	829800	and I wasn't even listening.
829800	830800	You're not listening now.
830800	834360	So you listen, how else did I respond?
834360	837760	She just selected very, she'll be doing her thing.
837760	839280	Like, you know, I'm typing, I'm typing, I'm typing.
839280	843600	And then just, I randomly will say, and then, Oh man, that really, that moment really sucked
843600	844600	in dragon age.
844600	845600	And then she'll perk up.
845600	846600	What are you talking about?
846600	847600	About my dragon age.
847600	848600	What, what, what?
848600	850320	I am not writing fanfiction during the show tonight.
850320	851320	Thank you for the first time.
851320	854040	I'm already three chapters ahead.
854040	857400	She worked at, she worked ahead everybody so she could participate tonight.
857400	858400	Good job.
858400	859400	All right.
859400	860400	Anyway.
860400	861400	Read my fanfic.
861400	862400	Damn it.
862400	863400	All, all, uh, all that joking aside.
863400	864400	So, okay.
864400	866560	So you discovered our show and you were on the other coast.
866560	867560	Just by coincidence.
867560	868560	Yeah.
868560	870400	I just have to be in, in upstate New York on summer vacation.
870400	872640	I was like, I need something to watch here.
872640	874400	I'm bored out of my skull.
874400	875400	Need something to listen to.
875400	876400	I need something to do.
876400	877400	I was like, okay, fine.
877400	881880	Well, I, you know, this, this whole live 360, whatever it is site, sure.
881880	882880	I'll go for it.
882880	883880	Yeah.
883880	884880	Why not?
884880	885880	And a dial up friendly radio.
885880	886880	That's what we used to be.
886880	887880	All right.
887880	890240	Uh, before we move on and get into some more modern, what have you been doing this week
890240	892760	in games and in the gaming news for this week?
892760	893760	One more question.
893760	898040	Since you did mention you were a DDR fan and you, uh, were brought to this show through
898040	902520	all of our mutual love of DDR back in the day, favorite mix and favorite song.
902520	903520	Oh geez.
903520	906280	Don't you pick one only one.
906280	907280	Oh man.
907280	911960	No ties on the record.
911960	916320	Get the Wiki ready to update.
916320	921160	The thing is, I have to say my favorite song is, is my usual warmup song.
921160	923340	It's why it's, it's on every mix these days.
923340	925720	It's always the first song I play just to get warmed up.
925720	929880	Uh, so fifth mix, which I guess is kind of the black sheep of the series.
929880	931840	You don't see too many machines out there of it.
931840	936040	Uh, but that's why, that's why it's a lot of people's favorite abyss DJ Taka abyss.
936040	937040	Okay.
937040	938040	That's a good pic.
938040	941600	Low second goes to summer vacation, but that was a 2DX song.
941600	943440	That was a 2DX song.
943440	944440	That never even made it to DDR.
944440	947080	I think they finally did put it in DDR like way later.
947080	949760	I think it was in like a home version at some point.
949760	951040	So there you go.
951040	952040	All right.
952040	953040	Very cool.
953040	954480	Well, Drew, you feel free to pipe in if you need to on the news.
954480	957320	I know we were talking a little bit about, uh, some of the things we're talking about
957320	958320	tonight.
958320	961640	I know you have some things to say as a PC gamer on some of the things going on lately.
961640	962740	So we'll get into some of that.
962740	963740	Feel free to chime in as necessary.
963740	970300	Uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com zappy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
970300	974060	says over here in French, Canada, we just had poutine fest this weekend.
974060	975700	I love poutine so much.
975700	976700	Why was I not invited?
976700	977700	I know.
977700	978700	Where's our invite zappy?
978700	979700	What's up with that?
979700	980700	Well, you know what?
980700	982340	You know what they had up the hill in Reno?
982340	983940	Cause we almost went to Reno this weekend.
983940	986020	So while they've got poutine fest in Canada, you know what they have in Reno?
986020	987580	Angry I lost all my money fest?
987580	988580	No.
988580	989580	Chicken wing fest.
989580	990580	Right?
990580	991580	Where's my invite?
991580	992580	Jesus.
992580	993580	That's it.
993580	998340	We just need to have like a cooking on the show night and I'll just make poutine.
998340	999340	I love that idea.
999340	1000340	That's a great idea.
1000340	1001340	Uh, let's see.
1001340	1002820	I still have a bag of cheese curds at home.
1002820	1005380	Uh, Ragenator in chat says upstate New York.
1005380	1006380	Cool.
1006380	1007380	I'm from Buffalo.
1007380	1009380	Uh, it was Watertown at the time out in Fort Drum.
1009380	1010860	I have no idea where those places are.
1010860	1012580	I went to Poughkeepsie for like three days.
1012580	1014060	We'll just say Southern Canada.
1014060	1015060	Okay.
1015060	1017060	That's pretty much what it was.
1017060	1018700	It was like 20 miles to the border.
1018700	1020180	Did you go to poutine fest?
1020180	1022540	I wish.
1022540	1023540	Poutine's awesome.
1023540	1024540	All right.
1024540	1028180	Uh, let's get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games that you have
1028180	1029780	been playing this week.
1029780	1030780	Dark soccer.
1030780	1031780	We'll start with you.
1031780	1032780	You had a pretty big week, huh?
1032780	1033780	Kinda.
1033780	1035860	Well, he just fixed my computer today.
1035860	1042180	Um, Dragon Age Inquisition broke my computer kinda and now it's fixed before like my fans
1042180	1044380	would just kick in like blah.
1044380	1048420	So we put in four more fans and doubled my ram and now my computer is like, Oh, I love
1048420	1049540	Dragon Age Inquisition.
1049540	1051020	How quaint.
1051020	1052900	And no problem at all.
1052900	1057660	Um, I actually did log in a little bit for Final Fantasy 14.
1057660	1063380	Um, I'm going to be trying to set at least a night a week to do my progression stuff.
1063380	1066900	Um, and we got a PS4 this week.
1066900	1074080	So Dan's been playing Battlemon and I very, very, very much have decided that the next
1074080	1080300	game that I'm going to get is going to be Puyo Puyo Tetris, but I, um, probably going
1080300	1085100	to have to wait until a couple of weeks before I order it from Playage or something.
1085100	1089540	But I really, really, really, really, really, really, really want Puyo Puyo Tetris because
1089540	1093700	it's fucking Puyo Puyo and Tetris.
1093700	1097940	And then I've been like polling people for other good games and I don't know, cause people
1097940	1101100	keep mentioning genre that I'm not really a big fan of.
1101100	1106380	Like I don't like a lot of first person shooters and I don't like a lot of games that have
1106380	1109820	a lot of crazy ass motion in it cause I will throw up on people.
1109820	1113880	I think, uh, I, I use, you asked this on Twitter, which you're using Twitter again.
1113880	1114880	What is up with that?
1114880	1115880	I know.
1115880	1116880	I just decided to.
1116880	1118720	You got to get, get with the cool kids on Twitter.
1118720	1119720	We're super cool.
1119720	1122780	I was, no, cause I did my hipster thing for a while and didn't want to be on Twitter cause
1122780	1123780	it was too mainstream.
1123780	1124780	Mm hmm.
1124780	1125780	Well, welcome to the mainstream.
1125780	1126780	I was on Tumblr.
1126780	1129820	Do, uh, now Tumblr, Yahoo owns Tumblr.
1129820	1130820	Tell me that ain't mainstream.
1130820	1131820	Yeah.
1131820	1132820	And then I went on Ello.
1132820	1137380	Anyway, uh, I think Flaco Jones had some really good suggestions for you, especially, and
1137380	1141700	I really have to recommend for you in particular velocity two X, I think is a really good pick
1141700	1145140	because you know, we, we joke about our love of the guardian legend, but it's actually
1145140	1146140	not a joke.
1146140	1147140	We really love that game.
1147140	1148140	And velocity two X.
1148140	1152380	The only kind of difference is instead of being, it obviously has the shooter bits,
1152380	1156580	but then instead of being like an RPG over the shoulder type of thing, it's more like
1156580	1158740	a platformer in that part.
1158740	1160640	Otherwise it's, it's very similar.
1160640	1162740	So is that like just online only?
1162740	1163740	Yeah.
1163740	1165300	It's like an online $10 download type of thing.
1165300	1166300	Okay.
1166300	1167300	Yeah.
1167340	1171660	It's like PlayStation four, but I think velocity two X is on like steam and I think it's one
1171660	1172660	of those.
1172660	1173660	It's multi it's all over the place.
1173660	1174660	I have to check that out.
1174660	1175660	Yeah.
1175660	1176660	Yeah.
1176660	1177660	I think you'd like that too.
1177660	1178660	And that's an indie game.
1178660	1180840	So I don't feel bad about whoring it for free here on the show.
1180840	1186240	So well, I've, I've been trying to think of like more actual disc based games to add to
1186240	1187240	the collection.
1187240	1192780	Cause I mean, we only have Batman right now and a few things that were, and I was so angry
1192780	1199820	because PT was sitting there in my library online and I'm like, you bastards, somebody
1199820	1200820	will feed.
1200820	1202740	That's going to be the thing that gets people to hack a PS four.
1202740	1203740	Just wait.
1203740	1204740	Yeah.
1204740	1208500	If it's not already doable to put PT on there somehow, but I, but I think we're pretty much
1208500	1213220	decided it's going to be Puyo Puyo Tetris is the next game we want.
1213220	1214220	So there you go.
1214220	1215220	All right.
1215220	1217260	Well, congratulations on the new PS four.
1217260	1220980	Just if you have PS plus stay on top of that and download your free games cause like velocity
1220980	1222240	was a free game at one point.
1222240	1225920	So Dan's doing it on his account and we're just going to add mine as a secondary.
1225920	1226920	Good.
1226920	1227920	Smart.
1227920	1229440	Um, Dan's is gun star.
1229440	1232960	Mine is dark Sakura, O R. Is there an underscore or anything?
1232960	1233960	Nope.
1233960	1236680	I need to add you if I ever sign into it.
1236680	1238320	Oh, do it for me.
1238320	1239320	Dark soccer.
1239320	1240320	Do it for me.
1240320	1241320	I'll do it for the children.
1241320	1242320	All right.
1242320	1243320	Just, just do it.
1243320	1246400	Don't let your dreams be dreams.
1246400	1247400	I will.
1247400	1248400	Don't dream it.
1248400	1249400	And be it.
1249400	1250400	Let's move on to tech master Loki.
1250400	1251400	How was your gaming week?
1251560	1252560	Um, it was okay.
1252560	1254560	I mostly worked on my game.
1254560	1259680	Um, but I did play a few things, uh, one being, which is, I'm actually playing right now.
1259680	1261560	Portal stories, Mel.
1261560	1269320	It's like a free to, uh, free to download if you have, um, portal to, um, expansion
1269320	1276580	or a fan made game, I guess this is what people do when valve is allergic to the number three
1276580	1277580	type of thing.
1277580	1278580	Yeah.
1278580	1279660	So it's like a side story type thing.
1279980	1283800	It's another test subject that was testing the sleep chambers and of course the sleep
1283800	1285580	chambers didn't work right.
1285580	1291660	And so she's in the future now and it's hilarious because you know, they've got it, all of it's
1291660	1292660	voice acted.
1292660	1296340	They have cave Johnson in there, but you know, another person doing his voice and then they
1296340	1301840	have another, um, personality sphere that's helping me along and it's just got that same
1301840	1305780	type of humor, but the puzzles are really damn hard.
1305780	1307460	So just keep that in mind.
1308180	1311980	It's kind of nice though, as you get to actually see the outside of like, uh, aperture science,
1311980	1312980	which is kind of cool.
1312980	1314420	So you get to wander around through that.
1314420	1318160	Um, but yes, the puzzles are damn hard.
1318160	1319940	So just keep that in mind.
1319940	1326140	Sounds to me like they got Mel from the original second player for co-op mode.
1326140	1327380	Possibly.
1327380	1329980	I don't know what the story is behind that.
1329980	1334840	Um, and then the other thing I played was called the do modern warfare two because my,
1334840	1339880	my old coworkers want to play and so I played just like old times.
1339880	1340880	Yep.
1340880	1343800	And I beat him just like old times.
1343800	1344800	Keep them in their place.
1344800	1345800	Loki.
1345800	1346800	Yeah.
1346800	1348920	So they're like, well, we were having fun until you came make, make them remember why
1348920	1350560	they didn't want to play with you anymore.
1350560	1351560	Exactly.
1351560	1355360	Well, they just have to bring their ringers with them and then, then they actually, I
1355360	1359240	have a hard time keeping up with them because you know, it's wow.
1359240	1360240	Love it.
1360240	1361240	All right.
1361240	1363160	Uh, if that's it for your gaming week, I think that's it.
1363160	1365560	Then, uh, Drew, how about you?
1365560	1366560	How was your game?
1366560	1367720	I've been all over the place.
1367720	1374080	Um, been mostly focused on PC this week was really struggling to enjoy a certain PC game
1374080	1377400	that shall remain nameless for right now.
1377400	1379920	But barring that I switched over to my 3DS.
1379920	1381920	You can, we talked a little bit about this last week.
1381920	1382920	Yeah.
1382920	1384760	A few optimization woes as Arkham Knight.
1384760	1389720	We'll put it like that, um, switched my 3DS for a while, knocked out a little bit of persona
1389720	1391400	queue, a little dungeon diving there.
1391400	1392400	Hold on.
1392400	1393400	Let me back you up.
1393400	1396800	Cause I, I just have to, cause you know, when we were reporting on the, the, uh, Arkham
1396800	1400040	Knight stuff last year, I shouldn't say reporting, but discussing the Arkham Knight stuff last
1400040	1401080	week, cause we don't break news.
1401080	1402640	We just try to fix it.
1402640	1407640	Um, we were talking about the Arkham Knight woes, but to be fair, I haven't played it
1407640	1408640	on PC.
1408640	1409880	I don't think either of my co-hosts have.
1409880	1411120	How bad is it Drew?
1411120	1412120	Oh God.
1412120	1419040	Uh, I can turn V-Sync off and get 25 frames usually.
1419040	1420920	I don't have a modest system.
1420920	1426080	Uh, the minute I turn V-Sync on, five frames per second.
1426080	1428600	So that's the biggest problem is just the frame rate is shit.
1428600	1429600	Yeah.
1429600	1430600	Frame rate is absolute crap.
1430600	1433200	Uh, the game itself is fun.
1433200	1435360	It's just the specs and optimization.
1435360	1436360	It was a shitty port.
1436360	1439200	But it's like one of those old flip books where you flip through the pictures.
1439200	1440200	Exactly.
1440200	1444280	It's like, I'm not, I'm not terribly pissed off about it.
1444280	1448520	I can wait, but I'd rather not have to.
1448520	1451760	But uh, you know, after struggling with that and trying to find things to make it work
1451760	1456360	better, I decided to just grab my 3DS, play a little Persona Q, uh, try and finally finish
1456360	1457480	Fire Emblem Awakening.
1457480	1463800	I keep on getting distracted, uh, got in some MKX even though I kind of suck at it and started
1463800	1469060	playing probably one of the most beautiful games I've ever played in my life, uh, courtesy
1469060	1470060	of Steam.
1470060	1474680	Cause usually it's, uh, otherwise be a, uh, Xbox one exclusive, uh, Ori and the Blind
1474680	1475680	Forest.
1475680	1478000	Oh, I've heard a lot of good things about this game.
1478000	1480680	Uh, Xtifer, uh, my buddy Xtifer is a big fan of this.
1480680	1484600	It is an absolutely beautiful metroidvania.
1484600	1486600	Hmm.
1486600	1490360	And I'm really looking forward to, you know, getting some more abilities there and kind
1490360	1493600	of blast my way through the game and kind of seeing all the scenery.
1493600	1494600	Excellent.
1494600	1496720	All right, well have fun with it.
1496720	1499320	So you're playing that on Steam, not X, oh you don't own Xbox one.
1499320	1502760	I don't own Xbox one, I'm, I'm firmly in the Sony camp at this point.
1502760	1507440	No ill will towards Xbox, I'm just kind of in the little Sony ecosystem right now.
1507440	1510480	It's expensive to have both.
1510480	1511480	Trust me.
1511480	1515680	Cause I just, I just finally got the Xbox one and it's a little, a little expensive.
1515680	1516680	It's expensive.
1516680	1517680	Happy, expensive.
1517680	1518680	Happy.
1518680	1519680	Anyway.
1519680	1520680	Um, Mikey Mueg.
1520680	1523840	Uh, so, okay, here's a funny story.
1523840	1527360	So Drew mentioned a minute ago that he's one of the few like people that like still owns
1527360	1528360	Evita.
1528360	1529360	Right.
1529360	1530360	So here's the thing.
1530360	1534040	Um, I had a birthday, uh, around the same time that OLR did.
1534040	1537000	And um, you know, I don't, I don't expect that I'm going to get a lot of presents or
1537000	1538000	whatever.
1538000	1541440	I'm not usually like big on the whole, like expecting gifts and all that stuff.
1541440	1546880	Uh, but especially with somebody like Alan, uh, we don't oftentimes really know what to
1546880	1547880	get each other.
1547880	1550920	We're at a fortunate enough place in our lives where we want something, we just kind of go
1550920	1551920	get it.
1551920	1553880	And our tastes are like, I'm not saying like we're rich or anything.
1553880	1558120	We don't get to do extravagant things, but for the most part of the things that we need,
1558120	1560080	we kind of are able to take care of.
1560080	1562680	So it makes it very hard to be able to buy presents for each other.
1562680	1568680	In fact, the funny part of that is that, um, the first gift that Alan actually bought
1568680	1573480	for me was a Ness Amiibo because he knew that I was kicking and screaming about that whole
1573480	1577560	GameStop preorder thing was bullshit and I want a Ness Amiibo and I'm just going to preorder
1577560	1579320	one from Japan or whatever.
1579320	1583680	So he actually went onto one of those auction things and paid the money to get me a Ness
1583680	1589300	Amiibo only to find out that I was able to get one on Playasia and I also got a Ness
1589300	1590300	Amiibo.
1590300	1591300	And then Shane got one too.
1591420	1593580	I was getting like three Ness Amiibo.
1593580	1595820	So oops on that.
1595820	1598940	So Alan had to go back to the drawing board and figure out what's he going to get me that
1598940	1600740	I'm definitely not going to buy for myself.
1600740	1609060	So you can imagine my shock when Monday the gift arrived and I opened it up and Alan had
1609060	1613620	bought me because I had made a comment once about, Oh my God, that's so gorgeous.
1613620	1614620	I want that.
1614620	1615620	Oh my God.
1615620	1616620	But that's going to be expensive.
1616900	1625180	You know, uh, Alan bought me the Heavensward PlayStation Vita from Japan imported.
1625180	1630300	So here it is right here and it's one of the 2.0 models and you can see, so it's a little
1630300	1634340	lighter and thinner and uh, if you want to mess around with this just so you can see
1634340	1635340	how it feels.
1635340	1636340	I will fight you for that.
1636340	1641000	No, you will not have the original model, but you can see there on the back, it's got
1641000	1645820	like the Heavensward decorations and then it actually came with a Heavensward theme.
1645820	1649880	So if I actually turned it on here a little bit, you can actually see the little splash
1649880	1651860	screen is the Heavensward, like a little screen.
1651860	1654940	Then when you open it up, it actually plays music from the game.
1660280	1661420	So you know what, Rob?
1661420	1662420	It's rad.
1662420	1663420	Like I'm not even going to lie.
1663420	1664420	This thing is rad.
1664420	1668300	This kind of makes this sort of system cousins because I have the WonderSwan color for Final
1668300	1672500	Fantasy.
1672500	1675220	Our WonderSwan and our PlayStation Vita are distantly related.
1675620	1676620	Yeah, they're distantly related.
1676620	1677620	Yeah.
1677620	1680060	And now I get to loan you a buttload of games for Vita.
1680060	1681060	I'm excited.
1681060	1682060	Well, here's the thing.
1682060	1683140	Okay, but here's the thing, Drew.
1683140	1686780	I already own a PlayStation Vita American.
1686780	1688400	I bought one of the earlier models.
1688400	1690580	So this is not the first one you had.
1690580	1691580	Not the first one.
1691580	1695220	So you might be one of the few people that actually owns a Vita.
1695220	1696660	And you're one of the few people that own two.
1696660	1697660	That owns two.
1697660	1700460	And you're going to lend one to Jamie.
1700460	1702140	And the market just doubled.
1702140	1703700	Thank you, Sony.
1703700	1704700	Here's what I did.
1705180	1706980	I'm actually very proud of myself for figuring out how to do this.
1706980	1707980	I used to...
1707980	1708980	I didn't do it all myself.
1708980	1709980	I used tutorials and stuff.
1709980	1712420	But I actually went online.
1712420	1714600	I registered a Japanese account.
1714600	1718300	And that's a Japanese region or whatever, PlayStation Vita.
1718300	1722380	And I figured out how to redeem the code for Heaven's Word so I could actually get that
1722380	1723900	theme or whatever.
1723900	1724900	So I'm actually very proud of myself.
1724900	1727260	So now that is my Japanese system.
1727260	1728780	And then the other one is my American system.
1728780	1732740	Because you know the Vita is way better supported in Japan than it is here anyway.
1732740	1736540	And I'm looking in the store and I'm like, I want Taiko no Tatujin.
1736540	1737540	They have that for the Vita?
1737540	1738900	I'm like, I'm going to get that.
1738900	1740560	And then there's all sorts of other games as well.
1740560	1743780	So now I just have to get a card that has money on it.
1743780	1746500	So I'll just get one of those from Playasia or whatever.
1746500	1750420	Anyway, Alan wants to say a little something about the Heaven's Word Vita.
1750420	1751660	He's here at the studio.
1751660	1754940	It also comes with a very pretty box that we get to show off.
1754940	1757700	Which I brought into studio.
1757700	1762380	And also, don't expect anything like that for Christmas.
1763140	1768060	It's not that I don't care about Christmas, but it's a different holiday to me.
1768060	1771740	And since we both have summer birthdays, if I'm going to spoil the shit out of you, the
1771740	1773380	birthday is the big one for Christmas.
1773380	1775860	I'll just get you like a Target card or something.
1775860	1778340	At least he's honest.
1778340	1779340	That's all.
1779340	1780340	My favorite.
1780340	1783700	First, he brought the box in to show off on the radio show.
1783700	1786500	Just so y'all know, anyway.
1786500	1789580	But also, here's the other thing I love about it is that Alan told me.
1789580	1795140	He said, you know, a part of that gift, just so you know, is the insane amount of jealousy
1795140	1798060	that Shayna's going to have towards you because I got you that.
1798060	1801340	You know what else I think is funny is that Heaven's Word isn't on Vita.
1801340	1802940	Yeah, right?
1802940	1806140	They have a whole Heaven's Word Vita and Heaven's Word isn't even on Vita.
1806140	1810460	But certainly the PlayStation 4 Remote Play, a lot of people are doing the crafting and
1810460	1813180	gathering on the Vita from PlayStation 4.
1813180	1815980	So that's kind of a little thing.
1815980	1819340	Ladies and gentlemen of the internet, please feel free to use your imaginations on that
1819340	1820340	box.
1820340	1821340	Right?
1821340	1822700	It's just got butts and dicks all over it.
1822700	1823820	No, it does not have butts and dicks.
1823820	1824820	I could take a picture.
1824820	1827300	It can have butts and dicks on it in a few minutes.
1827300	1828940	I don't even want to think about that.
1828940	1829940	Excuse me.
1829940	1830940	I have to leave the room and heave.
1830940	1837140	SSG100Matt in chat over at live.vognetware.com says, no, no, no, Shayna will be like, whatever.
1837140	1840340	No, I think this one actually did get a response out of him.
1840340	1844940	It was more like, I hate you and that type of thing.
1844940	1845940	Act Deaf degrees.
1845940	1847820	I do want Taiko no Tatsujin Vita though.
1847820	1848820	Yeah.
1849300	1851660	I'm like, I don't want that.
1851660	1853140	That'd be awesome.
1853140	1857560	So anyhow, other games that I played besides messing around with the new system.
1857560	1862220	Thank you, Alan, for the new Vita that I said I wanted and didn't actually think I'd get.
1862220	1863620	That's awesome.
1863620	1868540	I was still playing around with the Xbox One a little bit, playing more Forza Horizon 2,
1868540	1873300	which I have to voice something that kind of ticked me off about Horizon 2 as much as
1873300	1874300	I love the game.
1874300	1875940	And it's a solid racer.
1875940	1879060	And having also played Drive Club a little bit this week.
1879060	1880060	Here we go.
1880060	1881060	No, I'm sorry.
1881060	1884660	Forza Horizon 2 is just like probably the best racing game right now.
1884660	1885660	It really is.
1885660	1888420	Until maybe there's a new burnout to try and challenge it or something.
1888420	1892180	I really think Forza Horizon 2 is like the best racing game right now.
1892180	1897420	But here's the thing that ticked me off about it is that, okay, so I'm doing a race and
1897420	1898420	what have you.
1898420	1903220	So I finish up the sequence of races and then suddenly it cuts away to a trailer and I'm
1903220	1906420	like, oh, it's like another one of those in-game cutscenes where it's going to be this
1906420	1909580	whole bad Fast and Furious thing where the guy's going to tell me to go to a new city.
1909580	1913860	And it's like, this island just opened up and we have to go and there's all new races
1913860	1915620	and da-da-da-da-da and all this stuff.
1915620	1919460	It's a fucking ad for their DLC, the Storm Island DLC or whatever.
1919460	1924060	And so at the end of this, just woven right into the gameplay trailer that they do, they're
1924060	1926100	like, press Y now to buy it for $20.
1926100	1933180	And I'm like, as interested as I am in something like that, I will clear the base game.
1933180	1935620	Then I'll buy an expansion thing.
1935620	1937900	I'm not going to buy the expansion until I finish the base game.
1937900	1938900	No, no, no.
1938900	1939900	Buy our shit now.
1939900	1940900	Don't wait.
1940900	1941900	Do it now.
1941900	1944060	No, as, but here, as if that wasn't good enough.
1944060	1945760	So I hit no, thank you.
1945760	1949540	And so it gives me the next mission and programs into the GPS where to go next.
1949540	1950540	I'm like, all right.
1950540	1955080	So I drive and I'm driving to the harbor and I'm like, why is the goal point that I'm driving
1955080	1956900	to the Storm Island Harbor?
1956900	1960660	I get to the harbor and I press X to finish the mission or whatever.
1960660	1967220	And it said, you can deport or you can depart for Storm Island now by spending $19.99.
1967220	1968700	I'm like, really?
1968700	1973300	This fucking game just made it a mission for me to go and like spend the money.
1973300	1976660	And so I, I did what any gamer would do in this day and age.
1976660	1980340	I went on Twitter and I wrote some angry things.
1980340	1981860	But did you throw your controller?
1981860	1983500	No, God, those controls are expensive.
1983500	1985060	Are you fucking kidding me?
1985060	1989940	That's not what we, that's, that's what happened, Drew, that's what happened.
1989940	1991460	We don't, we don't throw controllers anymore.
1991460	1993920	We go on Twitter and say something mean.
1993920	1995400	That's what we do is that's what I did.
1995400	1998660	I went on Twitter and I said something mean, and then I got it out of my system.
1998660	2000020	So there it is.
2000020	2004840	I was just a little irritated, a lot of irritated that Forza Horizon.
2004840	2007100	Outside of that, I still love the game.
2007100	2010680	But seriously, stop shoving that DLC down our throats.
2010680	2012020	It's tacky.
2012020	2016860	Like I get, if you want to put in the menu, a little banner now available, or even if
2016860	2021300	on the little radio station, a DJ comes on and says, Hey, check out the store.
2021300	2022300	There's some new DLC.
2022300	2026060	Like I understand, but like to like go so far as to make it the next mission for me
2026060	2027060	to do.
2027060	2028060	Yeah.
2028060	2029060	That won't be breaking immersion or anything.
2029060	2030060	Hey, there's DLC on the store.
2030060	2031620	Oh my, that was just so tacky.
2031620	2036420	Oh, like an interruption of your mission isn't immersion breaking as it is?
2036420	2037420	Yeah.
2037420	2041200	Weiland in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, I do like storm Island though.
2041200	2042900	It's the only DLC I bought for the game.
2042900	2044780	I'm sure it's amazing.
2044780	2048620	But my whole thing is that I don't want to go and spend more money to extend the game
2048620	2051340	when I have barely scratched the surface of the game to be in with.
2051340	2054060	Like I've still got like a hundred races I got to do in the game.
2054060	2056140	I've got plenty to do without the DLC.
2056140	2057140	That's my whole thing.
2057140	2060740	When I get through all that, will I probably end up getting storm Island?
2060740	2062060	Yeah, probably.
2062060	2067500	So Bobby Black Wolf says, for most people, that storm Island cut scene showed up well
2067500	2071340	after you beat the game because of the timing, but yeah, that sounds like bad timing.
2071340	2072340	That's a good point.
2072340	2075180	I'm probably seeing this where I'm seeing it and a lot of other people are like, what
2075180	2076180	is wrong?
2076180	2077180	Rob?
2077180	2078180	I didn't see anything like that.
2078180	2081360	Well, keep in mind, I just bought an Xbox one, what, two weeks ago.
2081360	2083420	So I'm just experiencing all this for the first time.
2083420	2085500	So it's a little different for me.
2085500	2089660	It's like people that played mass effect three and never had to see that original ending
2089660	2092260	like dark soccer is raising her hand.
2092260	2094300	Original ending angst was never a thing for her.
2094300	2095300	Anyway.
2095300	2096300	Nope.
2096300	2097300	I live a happy, sheltered life.
2097300	2098300	There you go.
2098300	2099300	Uh, let's see.
2099580	2101860	Also I've been playing, of course, a lot of heaven's word.
2101860	2104380	Uh, I just did the Bismarck fight today.
2104380	2109460	That was fun, even though it was a cluster, but, Oh, the soundtrack is so good.
2109460	2115140	Like I know people associate Square Enix with no bully Matsu and with good reason, cause
2115140	2120960	that man does a lot of great, great work and has done just legendary, uh, historical great
2120960	2122760	video game tracks of all time.
2122760	2127440	But I'm telling you, Soken is a real worthy successor over at Square.
2127440	2130220	That man does brilliant work with Final Fantasy 14.
2130220	2131880	That soundtrack is so stinking good.
2131880	2135780	Uh, if you haven't checked it out, uh, check out the final fantasy 14 soundtrack heaven's
2135780	2136780	word and the base game.
2136780	2138560	They're both amazing.
2138560	2142260	And uh, it's, it's not no bully Matsu, although nobody Matsu did like a theme for heaven's
2142260	2143260	word.
2143260	2145740	And, and probably that theme is, is heard in a lot of the others.
2145740	2150480	I really think Soken deserves a big, big, big, a bunch of credit for his work.
2150480	2154160	Maybe it's just the nostalgia talking, but when I think final fantasy MMOs, I still can't
2154160	2156780	get the vanity or March out of my head.
2156780	2157780	You know what?
2157780	2160460	And Final Fantasy 11 was great for what it is too, but you want to talk about like fan
2160460	2166680	service and all this 14 does such a good job of referencing other final fantasy games without
2166680	2168960	necessarily like going over the top with it.
2168960	2173540	Like they actually weave magitech armor, moogles, chocobos, and all that stuff like into the
2173540	2176180	story without it being like crazy.
2176180	2180060	Um, and then like the story in 14 is really good.
2180060	2182940	This expansion has a really good story that's worthy of final fantasy.
2182940	2184340	I'm probably going to need to check it out.
2184340	2188540	I wound up taking a scholar to 50, almost got through the main story, found out that
2188540	2190540	I need to raid all over again.
2190540	2192140	I'm like, I have wow for this.
2192140	2194900	I'm not going to do this again and just up and quit.
2194900	2196300	I'll give it another shot.
2196300	2198460	Hopefully it'll be a little bit more friendly to us.
2198460	2200500	Oh God, I'm a casual now.
2200500	2202140	What am I saying?
2202140	2206860	Well it's interesting because they made a controversial decision where heavens where
2206860	2208620	I want to keep this brief because I want to get into other games.
2208620	2212720	I've talked a lot about how 14 on the show, but they made a controversial decision where
2212720	2218880	unlike wow, all of the expansion content is in heaven's word, including the new jobs.
2218880	2224960	So if you want to go play a machinist or a, uh, uh, astrologian or a dark knight or whatever,
2224960	2228920	you have to go to Ishgard, the new city to unlock it, which is actually, that is what
2228920	2230400	they did in final fantasy 11.
2230400	2232400	So it's not exactly new for square to do that.
2232400	2233760	I remember my paladin quest.
2233760	2234760	Hell yeah.
2234760	2237520	But what is a little weird is that in order to get to Ishgard, you have to completely
2237520	2239940	finish the story of realm reborn.
2239940	2243100	So you will not be able to go to the new stuff until you finish the old stuff.
2243100	2247600	And from a story perspective, like the more I'm playing heaven's word, I get it.
2247600	2252660	The end of the story of realm reborn is very important for what happens in heaven's word,
2252660	2253660	critically important.
2253660	2258260	So from that end I get it, but I can see where it also turned off people that kind of slept
2258260	2262060	on the game for six months that want to get back in and join their friends.
2262060	2266180	It's like, Oh, I'm going to be a step behind another step behind because I have to beat
2266180	2267420	all this stuff first.
2267420	2270580	But you get experience now for doing all of your raids.
2270580	2273100	Yeah, that is, that is kind of the, okay.
2273100	2279180	So at least now what they did do is that all the story content now gives you not only experience
2279180	2281900	so that you'll be a leg up when you get into heaven's word, but it also gives you gear
2281900	2282900	now, I hear.
2282900	2286460	So that way you don't have to go in and do the raids to gear, to gear score up.
2286460	2288500	You'll get it naturally through the story.
2288500	2290860	So at least they lessened the blow a little bit.
2290860	2295820	I'm still trying to work on all the poetics so, cause now it's no longer the soldiery
2295820	2296820	tomes.
2296820	2297820	It's poetics.
2297820	2298820	Yep.
2298820	2299820	And now it's law.
2299820	2303380	This is in heaven's word, but anyway, uh, so that's enough about that.
2303380	2309740	Uh, I also want to briefly mention, so I played clicker heroes this week a lot.
2309740	2312540	In fact, Drew, have you played this game is crack.
2312540	2313540	Yes.
2313540	2314540	It is crap.
2314540	2317380	Like at least 30, 300,000 souls.
2317380	2318380	Do you really?
2318380	2319380	Oh my God.
2319380	2322500	I think I'm only on like my 12th ascension, but still, here's the thing.
2322500	2323500	Here's what's big.
2323500	2324500	Y'all.
2324500	2325500	This is why I bring it up.
2326180	2329100	I played clicker heroes this week.
2329100	2330240	Please don't say you bought rubies.
2330240	2331240	Please don't say about rubies.
2331240	2333540	I spent $10 on rubies.
2333540	2334540	No!
2334540	2337100	Is there no God?
2337100	2341660	I spent money on a free to play game, but this is why I did it.
2341660	2346900	I did it for the sole reason that I felt the developers deserved a little bit of my money
2346900	2350100	because I was going to say, I thought it was because of steam trading cards.
2350100	2351460	No, no, no.
2351460	2354620	I didn't realize that till after the fact that I was like, Ooh, I got a steam trading
2354620	2356460	card out of it.
2356460	2361020	But no, I did it because I felt, you know, with all the hours I've sunk into clicker
2361020	2365020	heroes, even if passively, because I'll run clicker heroes in the background while I'm
2365020	2368900	playing Final Fantasy.
2368900	2372300	I felt that with all the time I've sunk into that, they deserve a little bit of money.
2372300	2376580	So I tossed them $10 and I bought the rubies and bought like the permanent double damage
2376580	2378500	thing or whatever it is they're selling.
2378500	2380260	So there it is.
2380260	2383220	I spent real money on a free to play game, but they deserve it.
2383220	2384220	You sold out.
2384220	2385220	They deserve it.
2385220	2386220	Come on.
2386220	2387540	This isn't candy crush or some shit.
2387540	2389180	It's clicker heroes and they deserve it.
2389180	2390180	Come on.
2390180	2391180	All right.
2391180	2392180	Fair.
2392180	2393180	I'm just giving you a hard time.
2393180	2394180	I know you are.
2394180	2395180	By the way.
2395180	2396180	I do remember another game I played.
2396180	2397180	Hmm.
2397180	2398180	Very solitaire.
2398180	2399180	Oh jeez.
2399180	2400180	When, when my.
2400180	2401180	Our soccer's favorite game of all time.
2401180	2406580	No, I, it was the only thing that I trusted my computer to run until I got it fixed.
2406580	2408100	It could run clicker heroes.
2408100	2409260	I will not play it.
2409260	2410260	I will not.
2410260	2411260	You don't.
2411260	2412260	Don't get sucked in.
2412260	2413260	It plays itself.
2413300	2414300	I won't touch it.
2414300	2415300	All right.
2415300	2416300	Bobby.
2416300	2417300	That's what she said about mass effect.
2417300	2418300	Wants people.
2418300	2419300	All right.
2419300	2420300	Bobby black said mass effect is a good game.
2420300	2424380	Bobby black Wolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, who is this person
2424380	2427140	that person that is hosting a well R it is not sky.
2427140	2431740	Uh, tech 2030 says you can totally hack the game to get rubies by the way.
2431740	2432740	Haha.
2432740	2434860	That's what mean people do.
2434860	2436820	That is what mean people do.
2436820	2437820	I'm looking at low case.
2437820	2438820	I don't know what you mean.
2438820	2439820	Yeah.
2439820	2440820	Right.
2440820	2442300	Uh, I don't have the game to get rubies.
2442340	2444460	Kaijuto says, I've never even heard of that game.
2444460	2445700	It sounds awful.
2445700	2452020	If you played the steam summer game, uh, summers, if you played the steam summer sale game,
2452020	2457820	it's a lot like that only, uh, it actually works and you don't get anything out of it
2457820	2458820	whatsoever.
2458820	2460660	You don't get anything out of it whatsoever.
2460660	2464140	So except I don't know, achievements, steam achievements.
2464140	2465140	That's it.
2465140	2467580	Uh, fifth dreaming on chat says, God damn it.
2467580	2469100	You're making me play clicker heroes now.
2469100	2470240	I'm sorry.
2470280	2472800	I apologize in advance for that.
2472800	2476520	SSG100 Matt says, I'm too afraid to play clicker heroes and with good reason.
2476520	2478040	Let's be real.
2478040	2479240	All right.
2479240	2480480	That's going to do it for our gaming week.
2480480	2485680	Uh, some quick housekeeping, twitter.com slash OLR, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio
2485680	2488520	and google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
2488520	2491200	Um, I want to address one other quick thing here real quick.
2491200	2494400	I wasn't sure if I wanted to like say a lot about this cause it has to do with another
2494400	2499560	show, but um, I just want to make sure I'm, I'm very clear on, on some things here before
2499560	2502240	rumors start and that whole thing.
2502240	2506360	Um, so as some of you all saw on twitter, there was a decision made this week to put
2506360	2511880	my other show, uh, that I cohost with extfer and grandpa on Wednesdays, a horde house on
2511880	2514520	a hiatus for a while.
2514520	2516840	Um, and there's nothing wrong.
2516840	2519640	We didn't all get into like a bust up fight or anything like that.
2519640	2523760	Um, you know, uh, if you've been following horde house, you know that extrovert took
2523760	2528320	a break a couple months ago, uh, because he needed to focus on some things, IRL and so
2528320	2529320	on.
2529360	2533400	Um, I think I kind of, kind of got to a similar point in this last week where I wanted to
2533400	2535080	focus on some different things for a little bit.
2535080	2540520	I have a lot going on that I don't talk about here on OLR because it's none of y'all business.
2540520	2545720	It has nothing to do with video games, um, but it was impacting, you know, what I was
2545720	2547040	doing on weeknights and so forth.
2547040	2553080	So long, long story short, um, I just, I just kind of had to put horde house on hold for
2553080	2556800	a little bit so I could focus on some other things, but you guys all know, I think grandpa
2556800	2560800	is very talented as I do extra for our both very talented folks.
2560800	2564400	Uh, Shane was a great asset to that show for the time he was there as well.
2564400	2568400	Um, but even I got to a point, I think even Shane did where it was like, you know, talking
2568400	2573440	about all these MMOs, like it's, it's hard when there's only one I'm really invested
2573440	2574520	in right now.
2574520	2578280	And I think that's kind of the point I got to is that, you know, I love the world of
2578280	2579280	Warcraft community.
2579280	2580960	Um, there's some great people.
2580960	2583080	I've met some friends for life through that community.
2583080	2585520	I don't care about your game anymore.
2585520	2591420	That's my honest, like, sorry if that really sticks you, but it's like, it's really hard
2591420	2594000	for me to feign this enthusiasm about world of Warcraft.
2594000	2598360	And I felt like we still had a big audience that was kind of holding onto that a little
2598360	2599360	bit.
2599360	2602520	And I kind of feel like every week I'm faking it and letting you down.
2602520	2606040	So that's part of what played into the reason a little bit as well.
2606040	2607040	Anyhow.
2607040	2610500	Uh, grandpa of course, still on star board, power coupling extra for still doing his thing
2610500	2611500	over on Twitch.
2611500	2616300	And, um, you know, Shane comes on this show sometimes, I don't know what projects he'll
2616300	2622180	go into in the future, but I imagine some of us will reform and do another project again
2622180	2626860	at a later date, maybe after the summer and some IRL things calm down a little bit.
2626860	2631820	Uh, so I just wanted to address that and make sure there were no rumors that people were
2631820	2634660	fighting or quitting or whatever.
2634660	2635660	So there it is.
2635660	2640940	There's my very honest answer as to why Horde house ended right there on the table for now.
2640940	2645380	Um, and it may come back, you know, I may just rediscover my love of MMOs.
2645380	2648620	And if grandpa and extra for both in the same boat, then we might say, let's do a Horde
2648620	2649620	house again.
2649620	2653780	But if not, we'll probably say, let's take all this energy creatively that we do and
2653780	2657700	the chemistry that we have between us and, and grandpa riffing on me and extra for talking
2657700	2659260	about nonsensical things and all that.
2659260	2662740	And let's do this other project and we'll probably do that instead.
2662740	2664960	So there it is.
2664960	2665960	It's weird.
2665960	2669540	Cause I, I'm not used to podcasts ending.
2669580	2674300	I don't know what to say about it because this one seems like it's never going to like
2674300	2675300	you better not be.
2675300	2676300	I know.
2676300	2677300	I'm like, no, no, no, no.
2677300	2678300	I'm not.
2678300	2679300	I wouldn't rebel rebel rebel.
2679300	2684420	It's I find to the timing of a Sunday night show is a lot easier on me than a Wednesday
2684420	2689060	night show because with Sunday it's like I've had the whole weekend for RNR to relax and
2689060	2691260	rest up and you know, be ready to do it.
2691260	2693980	Whereas on Wednesday it's like I just got home from work and I got to roll over and
2693980	2694980	do a show.
2694980	2696840	So it's, it's harder.
2696840	2698900	It's much harder to do one on a Wednesday night.
2698940	2699940	All right.
2699940	2701940	So there you go.
2701940	2702940	Let's move on.
2702940	2703940	Let's get into some gaming news.
2703940	2704940	Shall we?
2704940	2707820	Uh, Loki start us off tonight with some video game news.
2707820	2708820	All right.
2708820	2710780	So there's the rumor of course.
2710780	2713940	Um, well we know that Nintendo is working on another system.
2713940	2718980	Um, no, it's going to be out probably soon, maybe next year.
2718980	2722820	The rumor is now that it's supposed to be out in July of 2016.
2722820	2723820	Where's this rumor coming from?
2723820	2729740	Well, it's coming from the report that apparently they've been visiting with, uh, supply chain
2729740	2737460	partners and, um, are looking to submit orders on February or March, 2016.
2737460	2741260	And I think this also comes, if I remember correctly, I think Foxconn won a bid or something
2741260	2743660	for manufacturing the system.
2743660	2750940	And so somehow they've, uh, extrapolated that it's going to be coming out maybe July, 2016.
2750940	2760300	I would hope, just me, that Nintendo reflecting on past, you know, launches and how they've
2760300	2766180	been a clusterfuck as far as, oh, shortages, shortages that they just realize, Hey, you
2766180	2767180	know what?
2767180	2769940	Let's take the extra months and release a holiday.
2769940	2772140	But you know, with a better name, please.
2772140	2774540	Well, NX is not the name.
2774540	2775540	It's not the name.
2775540	2776540	No, no, no, no, no.
2776540	2778180	With a better name than what they had so far.
2778180	2779180	Yeah, yeah.
2779820	2782020	Let's not come up with some stupid, like Wii again.
2782020	2786180	I, well, I, I kind of think, here's the thing.
2786180	2788300	I think Wii really worked for them.
2788300	2794620	I know it was, I know, haha, PP, Wii, Wii, but Wii U, I don't think worked for them because
2794620	2798140	too many people thought, you know, remember when it even, they went on, he went on Jimmy
2798140	2803620	Kimmel or one of those late night shows and yeah, the, the guy thought it was, it's an
2803620	2804620	add on for the Wii, right?
2804620	2805620	And no, no, no.
2805620	2809500	I think that was the real naming problem with Wii U.
2809500	2811100	So yeah, in that regard, yes.
2811100	2812800	Do not call it Wii anything.
2812800	2814300	And I don't think it will.
2814300	2819100	If this is some new initiative, if some of these rumors about that they're going to be
2819100	2823460	combining the DS and the Wii into something.
2823460	2825640	Just call it the Nintendo Entertainment System.
2825640	2827020	Just reboot that shit.
2827020	2828220	I'm all for that.
2828220	2829220	I'd love to see that.
2829220	2831900	I'd love to see Nintendo just like go old school with it.
2831900	2835780	Why not go back to the days where everybody just called the video game system a Nintendo?
2835780	2837420	Why don't you just call it the Nintendo?
2837420	2838700	Didn't we say this?
2838700	2842660	I feel like we had this exact same discussion like 10 years ago when Wii was first coming
2842660	2843660	out.
2843660	2846700	No, this is back when they were doing like the new iPad, but I don't like that idea either
2846700	2851580	because it gets really confusing, especially with the iPad, you know, where it's like the
2851580	2852580	new iPad.
2852580	2853580	Well, come on.
2853580	2854980	Yeah, it's the same with Xbox One.
2854980	2857340	Xbox One was, that's a dumb name.
2857340	2858340	I'm sorry.
2858340	2859340	It doesn't make any sense.
2859340	2860340	It's confusing.
2860340	2861340	Just don't do that.
2861780	2865180	I like the Nintendo Entertainment System because no one's really going to be like, oh, you're
2865180	2866180	talking about NES.
2866180	2868180	Yeah, you're talking about a system from 1984.
2868180	2870180	It's been a long time.
2870180	2874340	It's not like, you know, we just had, you know, whatever it is, an iPad last year.
2874340	2878800	I mean, if you're talking like something that's been, you know, over at least two generations
2878800	2883340	or generations, I mean, you know, granted you have the Xbox and then the Xbox 360, then
2883340	2885460	the Xbox One, that's too soon.
2885460	2887620	You mean you could, I don't know.
2887620	2889660	And I only think they should really just call the Xbox One.
2889660	2893620	I think they should have just called it, I don't know, the new Xbox or something.
2893620	2896780	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, let's just call it the Nintendo One.
2896780	2897780	There it is.
2897780	2900460	Act Deaf referring to the new 3DS.
2900460	2903100	So maybe Nintendo is going to go down that path.
2903100	2904100	Who knows?
2904100	2905100	Please don't.
2905100	2907860	Well, they're not going to call it the new Wii U.
2907860	2909420	Okay, so let's go back.
2909420	2913660	Naming wank aside, because, you know, none of us are going to know until, you know, they
2913660	2917140	come out on stage or their digital event and say it.
2917140	2919540	July 2016, realistic or no?
2919540	2920540	I mean, that would be...
2920540	2921540	I don't think...
2921540	2924540	When was the last time a console released?
2924540	2925740	Not during the holiday period.
2925740	2926740	Well, lots.
2926740	2927740	It's been a very long time.
2927740	2928740	Lots of consoles.
2928740	2929740	3DS launched in March.
2929740	2930740	There's a...
2930740	2931740	Dreamcast.
2931740	2932740	Dreamcast in February.
2932740	2933740	I guess that's a very good point.
2933740	2934740	Nah, I'd say Dreamcast is still holiday period.
2934740	2935740	Not September.
2935740	2936740	September?
2936740	2937740	Yeah.
2937740	2938740	Early September.
2938740	2939740	I'd call it.
2939740	2940740	Yes, that's holiday, unfortunately.
2940740	2941740	Close enough.
2941740	2942740	Yeah.
2942740	2943740	On the bubble.
2943740	2944740	On the bubble.
2944740	2945740	Holiday runs from, like, September to November.
2945740	2947100	If it's after Labor Day, I consider it a holiday.
2947100	2948100	Yeah.
2948100	2949100	July, that's a wishful thing.
2949100	2951420	Holiday is much more of a sad...
2951420	2955940	Any mention of July, I think is probably gonna be the new Namco game of Tails from Someone's
2955940	2956940	Ass.
2956940	2957940	Nothing comes out in July.
2957940	2963220	July is, like, barren, so if they release it, they would get the full attention, I suppose,
2963220	2964620	but I don't know.
2964620	2969540	It seems risky in a way, but if this supply thing you're talking about, you know, if Nintendo's
2969540	2972780	gonna be always forever plagued with these supply issues...
2972780	2974060	They're gonna do it for hype.
2974060	2975660	They're gonna fuckin' do it for hype.
2975660	2981880	It's really goddamn annoying, because seriously, everybody fucking knows it's artificial, okay?
2981880	2983500	There's no fucking...
2983500	2985180	You can't be this dumb at this point.
2985180	2988300	Look, he looks like, we don't know how to manufacture shit.
2988300	2989500	We just started doing this.
2989500	2990500	Please understand.
2990500	2991500	Please understand.
2991500	2992980	Oh, fuck him and his please understand.
2992980	2995140	I don't understand how you can be this dumb.
2995140	2998620	I mean, seriously, they know what they're doing.
2998620	3004300	They play it conservative with this stuff, and I guess they don't want it to be sitting
3004300	3008740	on the shelves because it makes it seem like no one wants it.
3008740	3009740	I'm sorry.
3009740	3010740	It's perception retarded.
3010740	3011740	Please understand.
3011740	3012740	It's all according to plan, then.
3012740	3015380	Then the shortage will be over by the holidays, and they go July.
3015380	3017700	I revise my previous statement.
3017700	3020220	Here's the other thing with that whole thing.
3020220	3026460	I thought, and memory could be, you know, I'm getting old, Drew, I'm getting old, but
3026460	3031020	with the 3DS releasing in April, that was over here, didn't it come out in Japan earlier
3031020	3032020	than we got it?
3032020	3041500	Yeah, 3DS came out holiday, it was like December or November in Japan, and then it came out
3041500	3046580	over here in March, the end of March, yeah, it was the end of March over here because
3046580	3048540	I bought, I'd imported one.
3048540	3052980	And it seems like when we get systems in that time frame, like even the PlayStation 2 was
3052980	3057260	like a, you know, release in the early months of the year, Japan had it for the holiday.
3057260	3061500	So it's usually because we got it second because Japan had it first.
3061500	3066780	But I mean, I don't know, we live in a more global market than we did even 10 years ago.
3066780	3070620	So you know, if somebody wants something from Japan, right now, that new Zelda games for
3070620	3074340	the next system is not for the Wii U.
3074340	3080260	I feel like, and I granted you might say they're full of shit, which is which is a fair retort,
3080260	3083020	but they've come out and said it's not for the next system.
3083020	3084020	Uh huh.
3084020	3085020	Loki.
3085020	3086020	Loki.
3086020	3087020	Two words.
3087020	3088020	Twilight Prince.
3088020	3089020	Yeah, exactly.
3089540	3093820	Oh, it's not for the new system, except it is for the new system, you know, except it's
3093820	3096300	also for the new system.
3096300	3097420	He's left handed on this one.
3097420	3102640	The only thing that I think could shut you down on that, and I think it's worth considering
3102640	3108860	Loki is that we're also talking about now the Wii U's big tie in is the tablet.
3108860	3112260	And so the Zelda game is going to have something to do with the tablet and so forth.
3112260	3117180	So if the NX has a new twist, a new Nintendo-fied twist, we don't know what if we knew what
3117180	3119180	it was, we would be able to talk about it.
3119180	3123440	But whatever that new Nintendo twist is on a new way to play games, can Zelda really
3123440	3128100	be parked into that when it's already for the Wii U's tablet game thing?
3128100	3129100	Do you know what I mean?
3129100	3133900	Yeah, I hope that new twist is fucking beefy ass hardware that can keep up with the modern
3133900	3134900	games.
3134900	3137260	No, I'm not trying to be like ridiculous here.
3137260	3141980	I'm just saying that's definitely going to help them with the whole third party support
3141980	3146820	thing because when you're running the system that's last generation specs, it's going to
3146860	3149780	be hard to get the Fallout 4's and all that shit.
3149780	3154380	So I would appreciate if they had a system that was up to spec with this stuff.
3154380	3159220	I think they should even push it just a little further, which is kind of what the Wii U kind
3159220	3160940	of did that, but it wasn't enough.
3160940	3167820	Yeah, it was a little bit further with the Xbox 360, but unfortunately not, I don't know,
3167820	3172400	even then it couldn't run some of the stuff that was on those systems and it's too bad
3172400	3174260	because they had potential.
3174700	3179100	Well, here's the interesting thing is that if Nintendo can get out that system next year
3179100	3183700	and it's a little beefier than an Xbox One, let's say it's more like an Xbox One and a
3183700	3185140	half, okay?
3185140	3187100	Let's say they get that thing out next year.
3187100	3192060	This isn't going to be like the Wii U was because the Wii U came out like right as the
3192060	3196180	PS4's coming out and right as the Xbox One coming out, I mean there was maybe one year
3196180	3197660	of opportunity.
3197660	3201780	Well now if the typical life cycle happens with these current consoles that are out,
3201780	3203580	we're more mid-cycle right now.
3203580	3207740	We're not even really to the full brunt of the mid-cycle yet with these consoles.
3207740	3211620	And let's be honest- So, I mean, Nintendo would get a really big
3211620	3212620	jump.
3212620	3215860	Yeah, and let's be honest, they haven't really taken advantage of these consoles lately.
3215860	3218340	Look at PlayStation 4's lineup for holidays.
3218340	3219340	It's been crap.
3219340	3220340	They haven't had anything.
3220340	3221340	What lineup?
3221340	3222340	Exactly.
3222340	3225240	They haven't had any first party shit come out of the- ooh, LittleBigPlanet 3.
3225240	3229100	I'm not buying a console because of that, sorry.
3229100	3233100	So many people are buying PlayStation 4's.
3233100	3234100	You bought one!
3234100	3235100	I bought one!
3235100	3236100	He bought one!
3236100	3239960	It's because of the next-gen games, or the current-gen games, the third-party stuff that
3239960	3243580	we're buying it for right now, and we see a lot of potential with stuff coming out.
3243580	3246820	Because every time you hear about games coming out, it's like, oh, it runs better on PlayStation
3246820	3247820	4 than Xbox One.
3247820	3250420	I mean, that was my conscious thinking, oh, and that, and they're giving me a ton of free
3250420	3251420	games.
3251420	3252420	You know, that also helps.
3252420	3253420	Alright.
3253420	3259580	Let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
3259580	3263780	Tech2030 says, wasn't there a report that NX wasn't going to be a rival to PlayStation
3263780	3264900	4 in terms of power?
3264900	3268180	I think that's a dangerous slope for Nintendo to go down, though, when it comes to third
3268180	3269180	parties.
3269180	3273500	If the game does not- something is easily ported from one system to another, that's
3273500	3277420	gonna leave them in a position where they're at right now, I think.
3277420	3282140	Bonds006 says, the new Nintendo system will be powered by loyalist love and fanboy money.
3282140	3286780	Well, they're always gonna have that, so.
3286780	3287780	I just-
3287780	3288780	I'm worried-
3288780	3290300	The Amiibo thing doesn't go full throttle.
3290300	3294500	That's my one fear about this new system, is that Amiibo is gonna go full throttle.
3294500	3299580	I'm worried that this new system actually may not, if they can't get the momentum, you
3299580	3303580	know, they're hoping that this new system's gonna do better, and I hope it does, but what
3303580	3304580	if it doesn't?
3304580	3306060	What if it just doesn't catch on?
3306060	3307060	Then what?
3307060	3308060	Then what?
3308060	3309060	Then where are you at?
3309060	3310060	Then they'll always still have a 3DS.
3310060	3311060	It's like, oh shit, you know.
3311060	3313580	I mean, eh.
3313580	3316460	Let's hope it's not PSP Go.
3316460	3317460	It's not that dumb.
3317460	3320020	It's gotta be better than that idea.
3320020	3322660	Alright, well, you know what?
3322660	3327460	We can- this is all rumors right now, and we can speculate, speculate, speculate, but
3327460	3328660	you know what?
3328660	3332140	It isn't really gonna change whatever's gonna happen next year, or not happen next year,
3332140	3334540	so stay tuned, everybody.
3334540	3339740	Meanwhile, let's move on to what's a game that's supposed to be within the next, you
3339740	3344900	know, 12 months, if what we heard about Nintendo's E3 showing is to be true, that all the games
3344900	3347060	they showed are for the next year.
3347060	3351500	One of those games that was shown, of course, was Metroid Prime Federation Force.
3351500	3359180	And as y'all know, it was not the most well-received game because it bears the Metroid title, yet
3359180	3362020	it was just a very different creative direction for the game.
3362020	3366340	In fact, it went so far as to inspire a Change.org petition that has, I don't know how many thousands
3366340	3369780	of English- angry, angry internet people everywhere signing it.
3369780	3370780	Grr-org.
3370780	3371780	Yeah, exactly.
3371780	3373260	When has Change.org actually changed anything?
3373260	3376620	I mean, have any of those petitions actually done anything?
3377180	3384420	Well, well, Nintendo, Reggie Fils-Aime was talking about, you know, all this stuff with
3384420	3389900	Mashable and talked about the reaction, talking a little bit about that Change.org petition
3389900	3394140	saying, quote, what the fan at home saw was something in the Metroid Prime universe that
3394140	3395780	they weren't expecting.
3395780	3397540	The reaction has been negative.
3397540	3399540	There's no sugar-coating it.
3399540	3404060	This is an example where fans who aren't able to get their hands on the game may be at a
3404060	3406460	bit of a competitive disadvantage.
3406460	3410620	Everyone who has played what we are showing regarding Metroid Prime, they came across
3410620	3411860	really pleased.
3411860	3414580	My ask is that fans trust us.
3414580	3417940	Oh, bullshit damage control, Reg.
3417940	3420660	This is the ultimate please understand.
3420660	3422060	No!
3422060	3426580	If you want to give us something in that series that the fans are going to enjoy, if you're
3426580	3432580	going to put that name on it, you give us something from that that we can identify with
3432580	3433900	and show that.
3433900	3437260	Fans don't say, oh, we had the play testers play that and they were very pleased.
3437260	3438980	No, we want to see that at home.
3438980	3442660	Yeah, but to be fair, reaction at the E3 booth was pretty positive.
3442660	3444980	Then you need to learn how to market the game better then.
3444980	3449060	If that's the problem, if the game's good, but your marketing's not showing that, then
3449060	3452140	you need to rework that.
3452140	3455500	It's so interesting to me because I honestly feel like if they had just called this game
3455500	3458740	Federation Force, this wouldn't even be a thing right now.
3458740	3459740	It wouldn't be a thing.
3459740	3460740	This would not even be a, we would not have a discussion.
3460740	3461740	It wouldn't be a thing.
3461740	3464580	It would, if it was just Federation Force, wouldn't even be a thing.
3464580	3468020	What if they called it F-Zero Federation Force?
3468020	3469620	What if they called it F-Zero Federation Force?
3469620	3472140	I'd be like, yay, Nintendo still acknowledges F-Zero.
3472140	3475340	No, I mean, seriously, this is how ridiculous it is.
3475340	3480900	I mean, it's like, I don't know, like, it's just not the same.
3480900	3484180	Actually, Loki, I'd kind of like to see them do a different game.
3484180	3488100	There's so many characters in F-Zero, like they all had their fucking own theme songs
3488100	3489100	in GX.
3489100	3490460	They didn't like do anything with that.
3490460	3495420	I kind of think F-Zero could have a side game, so sorry your little retort didn't work
3495420	3497540	so well.
3497540	3498540	But I actually, I'd like to see that.
3498540	3500260	I have three words for you, Rob.
3500260	3502660	Star Fox Adventures.
3502660	3505320	Did it have anything to do with being in a ship?
3505320	3506700	It had freaking dinosaurs.
3506700	3507700	There's some people-
3507700	3509180	It wasn't supposed to be a Star Fox game.
3509180	3512740	But there's some people that still stand so hard for that game, even though it's like
3512740	3513740	not-
3513740	3514740	Of course.
3514740	3515740	I mean, there's-
3515740	3518140	It could be a perfectly good game on its own.
3518140	3522380	It maybe shares a couple of characters, but you don't necessarily call that a Star Fox
3522380	3523380	game.
3523380	3527340	I think the problem is, and this is just, you know, again, we would not even be having
3527340	3530500	this discussion right now if it was just called Federation Force, but because they invoke
3530500	3537100	the name Metroid, it's kind of like them standing up there and going, we know y'all love Metroid,
3537100	3541300	and yep, here's a game that doesn't have Samus in it, so why don't you just open up those
3541300	3542300	wounds.
3542300	3543300	We're just gonna pour a little salt in it.
3543300	3544300	Well, I mean, that's fine.
3544300	3548220	They had Halo Reach, and that didn't have Master Chief in it, as far as I'm aware, but
3548220	3550980	I didn't play it, but it's a similar type of thing.
3550980	3555020	It's still in the same universe, but that seemed like a Halo game, whereas this doesn't
3555020	3556820	seem like a Metroid Prime game.
3556820	3557820	But maybe-
3557820	3562380	And maybe that's where we have to suspend disbelief a little bit, because it did show
3562380	3563380	45 seconds.
3563380	3564380	I'm not suspending shit, okay?
3564380	3565380	You know why?
3565380	3566380	Because I'm a consumer.
3566380	3569620	I'm not gonna just trust you and buy it, because you know what?
3569620	3571980	You know who says just trust us about shit?
3571980	3574900	Warner Brothers says just trust us about buying Batman Arkham-
3574900	3575900	Exactly.
3575900	3576900	No, no, it's-
3576900	3582140	No, EA says trust us, Battlefield Hardline's gonna work just fine, it'll be fine, just
3582140	3583260	trust us.
3583260	3584260	Fuck that.
3584260	3588040	I am not trusting anybody until I see a reason to buy this game.
3588040	3589040	I'm not picking it up.
3589040	3593420	Well, that and I don't own the system, so I'm not buying a system to buy this game.
3593420	3597140	I would not be this passionate about it if I didn't love Metroid, I didn't love Nintendo,
3597140	3601340	but Reggie's pretty much giving us the gaming equivalent of open your mouth and close your
3601340	3602340	eyes.
3602340	3604780	You'll get a big surprise.
3604780	3610300	SSJ100Matt says, if it were Mother 3 Federation Force, heaven help them.
3610300	3613580	Kaijuto says, I'm excited about that Metroid game to be honest.
3613580	3617980	Tigerclaw says, I like that Metroid Federation Force takes place in that universe.
3617980	3623180	There are more things about the Metroid universe besides Samus Aran, there are other characters
3623180	3624500	they can expand on.
3624500	3628140	Okay, I'm gonna take that point and run with it for a minute here, because what if this
3628140	3634780	game, in its cutesy chibi style, what if this game is about the animals?
3634780	3640420	What if Nintendo saw all this fucking craziness about save the animals when they do those
3640420	3643500	speeders, what if this game is about the animals?
3643500	3646900	Because they said, oh, people get all worried, this is the animal game.
3646900	3648860	Well, it's better than it being about the baby.
3648860	3654820	Well, they didn't show anything like that, so I'm gonna suspend my disbelief, you know,
3654820	3656380	until I see this.
3656420	3660540	I'm gonna say that with a wink and a nod to Reggie, here's your shovel to get you out
3660540	3665600	of this situation, wink, make it about the animals, wink, then people are gonna have
3665600	3667700	a lot less problem with it, I'm just saying.
3667700	3672540	Give us a kind of touchstone, give us something we can go on to bring us back to the series.
3672540	3677100	I think they're going to, you know, if this is true, what he's saying, that people need
3677100	3682420	to get their hands on it, then they'll take it out to Best Buys across the nation around
3682420	3686300	the time of, I don't know, Gamescom or whenever the hell they want to do it, honestly, around
3686300	3689860	the holidays, and they'll get the game in people's hands.
3689860	3690860	Why take it to Best Buys?
3690860	3694260	Take it to your chum-chum friends at Evil G, you know?
3694260	3695260	I'm sure they'll push your shit.
3695260	3696260	Maybe that's what they'll do, too.
3696260	3698540	Or, how about a downloadable demo, like we used to do?
3698540	3703100	Oh, well, you can play that for 30 seconds, and then that's it, because, you know, fuck
3703100	3705580	you guys, demos are just for one time.
3705580	3709380	We don't want you to get any actual enjoyment out of it for an extended period of time,
3709380	3710620	because you may not buy the game.
3710620	3712020	You might analyze it too hard.
3712020	3715780	If you're that worried about me purchasing your game after playing your demo, I mean,
3715780	3718180	that doesn't make any sense at all.
3718180	3722140	Let me play the demo countless times, so I'm like, damn, I really want this game.
3722140	3723140	I don't know.
3723140	3724140	I'm disappointed.
3724140	3728820	I'm not getting my new 2D Metroid, but I don't want to write this completely off until I
3728820	3729820	get my hands on it.
3729820	3735500	I can just say that when I saw the trailer, I was like, meh, so, but I don't have this
3735500	3738420	like seething rage that Change.org does over this whole thing.
3738420	3742580	If I can put a Metroid game that's done in that same engine that they did Rayman in,
3742580	3743860	the new Rayman games?
3743860	3744860	Yes, please.
3744940	3746620	That's what I want to see.
3746620	3747620	Alright.
3747620	3753700	Hey, speaking of Nintendo criticisms, by the way, Act F says, Loki, you're anti-Nintendoing
3753700	3754980	so hard right now it hurts.
3754980	3756380	I'm not anti-Nintendoing.
3756380	3759780	I'm totally for Nintendo.
3759780	3760780	That's what you don't get.
3760780	3764300	I like Nintendo, I just think they're making stupid decisions.
3764300	3766100	That's why you get really mad when they make bad decisions.
3766100	3767100	Exactly.
3767100	3770700	If we're talking like fucking Majesco- This hurts me more than it hurts you.
3770700	3774460	It's like when you have a close friend that you see do something stupid, and you're like,
3774460	3775620	oh no, bitch.
3775620	3778540	It's like if we were talking like, oh man, I really hate this direction that Madden's
3778540	3781580	going in, I'd be like, I don't fucking care.
3781580	3782580	And that would be intimate.
3782580	3783580	Let it burn.
3783580	3784580	Let it all burn.
3784580	3785580	Exactly.
3785580	3786580	Who cares?
3786580	3787580	We wouldn't be this pissed off if we didn't like Nintendo.
3787580	3789700	I wish more Nintendo fans got that about you, Loki.
3789700	3790700	I really do.
3790700	3791700	It's like, I love Nintendo.
3791700	3792700	Why would I?
3792700	3793700	I'm not mad at them.
3793700	3795100	Like, I want to support this stuff.
3795100	3800620	I want to, you know, buy a good Metroid game, but I'm not buying that game.
3800620	3802020	That's not going to sell me a system.
3802020	3804780	I want something to sell me a system.
3804780	3808100	Dungeon Buster says Loki's all about tough Nintendo love.
3808100	3812420	You know, I think Loki should star in like a version of the video game Bachelor where
3812420	3817980	like, you know, all the games at E3 try to win over Loki's affection and he has roses
3817980	3822280	that he gives out or dollars that he gives out to games.
3822280	3825380	And every week, you know, some poor game is voted off the show.
3825380	3826620	I think that's what I'd like to see.
3826620	3827620	Wouldn't you?
3827620	3828620	Yeah.
3828620	3830900	But at the end of the series, he's just going to go home and play Call of Duty anyway.
3830900	3832660	I don't play Call of Duty that often.
3832660	3833660	Earth Defense Force.
3833660	3836980	I don't play Earth Defense Force either, which is, I don't play much of anything anymore,
3836980	3839860	but no, seriously, you know, I don't play that much Call of Duty.
3839860	3840860	I played it when it came out.
3840860	3842340	I played the story missions.
3842340	3844580	It was about a little bit of the multiplayer.
3844580	3846020	That was about it.
3846020	3850220	Bonds 006 says another Sunday with Nintendo getting no love at OLR.
3850220	3852220	Hey, hey, that is not true.
3852220	3857120	I have a lot of love for Nintendo, but only if you're Team Cat.
3857120	3858700	And I think I made this point clear earlier in the show.
3858700	3862340	Well, I'd love Nintendo, and I seriously want to get like a Wii U for, I would love
3862340	3867700	to get a Wii U for Super Mario Maker, but I don't want to buy it just for Super Mario
3867700	3868700	Maker.
3868700	3870140	Hey, drop that shit down the $99.
3870140	3871140	Okay.
3871140	3873380	No, I'll buy it for just Super Mario Maker.
3873380	3875580	I kind of think something like that's coming.
3875580	3876580	But oh yeah.
3876580	3877580	Yeah.
3877580	3878580	Once that comes in, I'll be like, okay, really?
3878580	3880860	What do you have coming around the corner then?
3880860	3881860	Just don't forget.
3881860	3882860	Don't don't forget.
3882860	3884860	You know, Wii U's been out for like three years now.
3884860	3885900	There's a back catalog.
3885900	3888500	There's there's Mario 3D World, Mario Kart 8.
3888500	3891980	There's a lot of games worthy of your attention, even like Zombie U and shit is still like
3891980	3892980	really good.
3892980	3893980	So.
3893980	3894980	All right.
3894980	3898140	Anyway, speaking of Nintendo, let me just keep piling it on here.
3898140	3902340	But this is stuff that's working around the blogs this week because, you know, Nintendo
3902340	3907420	had to face the investors this week and talking about their E3 conference and how some folks
3907420	3911420	decided to create change.org petitions out of it.
3911420	3914220	Comment from Seguro Miyamoto on this whole thing.
3914220	3919740	Quote, Sony and Microsoft had many announcements of future titles that were not playable.
3919740	3922060	VR lined the floor as a dream exhibit.
3922060	3925220	There were lots of video demos of those titles.
3925220	3929340	And he went on to talk about how the Nintendo had the playable demos and Miyamoto said they
3929340	3930820	got high praise.
3930820	3932460	This is what Nintendo's booth looked like.
3932460	3933940	It was different from other companies.
3933940	3937180	Everyone was smiling, having fun with games.
3937180	3940740	There are years when products are more finished and we can communicate their appeal.
3940740	3942940	This may explain the difference this year.
3942980	3947620	And they also said there are some unannounced third-party collaborations that are still
3947620	3948900	in the works.
3948900	3949900	I don't know.
3949900	3954180	I just, again, and, you know, I try not to be like super harsh for Nintendo.
3954180	3955820	I try to be open-minded.
3955820	3961100	But like, it's a total line of bullshit, this whole thing, where we believe that at E3 we
3961100	3966620	should only be showing the games six to twelve months out or whatever when just last year.
3966620	3967620	Just last.
3967620	3968620	That's why I don't buy the argument.
3968620	3972060	Like, I was fucking there last year when they were showing Mario Maker and Star Fox the
3972180	3976260	first time and some of these other games, like the Miyamoto concept games, that still
3976260	3977260	aren't out.
3977260	3978700	So I'm like, I'm sorry.
3978700	3982780	That's some decision you just arbitrarily made this year on why you're showing what
3982780	3983780	you're showing this year.
3983780	3985660	But Rumble is a last-gen feature.
3985660	3986660	Anyway.
3986660	3987660	Exactly.
3987660	3991740	That's the one thing that gets me going about these Nintendo lines is I do not buy that
3991740	3992740	for a minute.
3992740	3993740	I'm sorry.
3993740	3994740	I'm sorry.
3994740	3998780	Even if that's your whole new philosophy on E3, then that's one you decided on this year.
3998780	3999780	It's not something you've done forever.
3999780	4000780	Exactly.
4000780	4001780	Be just honest.
4002500	4003500	You know what?
4003500	4004500	This year we decided that we're only going to show these games.
4004500	4005500	Yeah.
4005500	4009020	We have other stuff in the, you know, we're working on other things, but this is all we're
4009020	4010020	showing you.
4010020	4011020	All right.
4011020	4015240	Anyhow, that's, that's enough on the Nintendo front right now, especially when half of this
4015240	4016240	is rumor.
4016240	4017580	Let's move on to some other stuff.
4017580	4019580	Dark Sakura.
4019580	4021380	The voice of reason.
4021380	4022380	Usually.
4022380	4024180	She'll give you one reason.
4024180	4033020	Well, there is a new bit of goodies for folks who have donated, well I should say back to
4033020	4036100	the Shenmue 3 Kickstarter.
4036100	4041260	At the $60 level, they'll get a physical copy of the game, which is nice because there are
4041260	4044400	people out here who like physical copies of their damn games.
4044400	4050380	Who have entire rooms of their house dedicated to physical copies of their damn game.
4050380	4057300	So you'll either get it for PS4 or Windows, whichever choice you want.
4057300	4066700	And they also included an apology, excuse me, for their Twitch broadcast and basically
4066700	4068620	just said it didn't work very well.
4068620	4069620	Sorry.
4069620	4071340	I didn't hear about the Twitch broadcast.
4071340	4072340	What went wrong?
4072340	4073340	Did anybody follow that?
4073340	4074340	It just said that it botched.
4074340	4075420	Uh oh.
4075420	4081980	Did it botch like Final Fantasy 14 on the Mac bad or are we talking like, I'm just saying.
4081980	4085960	I didn't say anything and I honestly don't really watch much on Twitch.
4085960	4087140	So I didn't watch it.
4087140	4090540	I didn't even know there was a Twitch broadcast, but they said sorry.
4090540	4095780	So well, a lot of times that's something they'll do to try and raise money for Kickstarters
4095780	4099540	is that the creators will kind of get on Twitch and take their case to the public basically
4099540	4103660	and you know, show some more art or any types of renderings that they put together and so
4103660	4104660	forth.
4104900	4107940	And that was something they were showing with Shenmue, but they must have just had some
4107940	4110060	technical difficulties or something.
4110060	4112180	So let's see.
4112180	4115600	Fifth Dream in chat says the guys on it were kind of goofy and we're trying to be funny
4115600	4119140	instead of trying to hype people to pledge and it kind of flopped.
4119140	4122620	So maybe they said they were sincerely sorry.
4122620	4124260	Get me to host a telethon.
4124260	4126380	I'll raise money.
4126380	4127980	Get Dark Sakura and Loki.
4127980	4130500	If you don't donate to this, you're an idiot.
4130500	4131940	So here's the list of reasons why.
4131940	4132940	Someone gets me a burrito.
4132940	4133940	I'll run a telethon.
4133940	4139580	Let's go to the tote board and see how many tacos are in my tummy.
4139580	4145260	But eight, only eight, I need some more tacos here right now.
4145260	4146740	I'm actually legit hungry.
4146740	4150820	So everything reminds me of tacos.
4150820	4153980	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Twitch is too mainstream for Dark Sakura.
4153980	4156940	You going to go over to hitbox?
4156940	4158340	No.
4158340	4162700	I've broadcasted on Twitch before, but only when I was playing Hot to Full Boyfriend.
4162700	4164180	So maybe I'll do another replay.
4164180	4166700	But then it became too mainstream, so you know.
4166700	4167700	Whatever.
4167700	4174560	So maybe I'll do another replay of the secret Hurtful Boyfriend ending that takes literally
4174560	4175560	three hours to play through.
4175560	4176560	What about the sequel?
4176560	4177980	Aren't they making a sequel?
4177980	4178980	That was the sequel.
4178980	4183920	It was, well not, there were other versions, there were other games that were in the series
4183920	4188060	and like a visual novel and some stuff, but you only need Hot to Full Boyfriend.
4188060	4190620	I thought the developer was making a news.
4190620	4194580	No, they're doing, it's just Hot to Full Boyfriend.
4194580	4199460	It's not even any type of new or anything, it's just Hot to Full Boyfriend.
4199460	4201220	The new Hot to Full Boyfriend.
4201220	4205780	It's just Hot to Full Boyfriend, the same one, which is nothing new.
4205780	4210220	Alright, let's move on to some more stories, Loki.
4210220	4215300	So perfect example of hey, if you're not going to make it, then we'll make it and we'll leave
4215300	4217420	your company and make it anyways.
4217420	4223980	So Comcept has gone back to announce that they're going to be putting out yet another
4223980	4224980	game.
4224980	4230340	This was announced during Anime Expo, it's a game called Red Ash and it is a legendary
4230340	4237180	game with legends and yes, it's headed- Legendary?
4237180	4240600	It's very legend-y, legendary.
4240600	4243980	It's a mega man, it's a legend.
4243980	4249780	Yes so, it's basically Mega Man Legends minus Mega Man.
4249780	4256260	So Red Ash or Re-Dash?
4256260	4262780	It's pretty clever, these Kickstarter titles for games that publishers won't do anymore,
4262780	4265900	they're cracking me up more than anything with the whole blood-stained ritual.
4265900	4271660	Because it's, because people want this shit and they're funding it and they're buying
4271660	4272660	it.
4272660	4277780	Fuck you Capcom, we don't need you anymore and I think that's- hello, maybe you should
4277780	4279520	listen to your audience.
4279520	4282160	If people want the game, they're going to find a way to get it.
4282160	4285700	Why can't you fund a lower budget project or something?
4285700	4291700	I don't understand why people are so- I guess they have shareholders, a lot of good they're
4291700	4293820	doing you.
4293820	4298280	Well here's the thing with this Kickstarter, although this is very exciting and I'm excited
4298280	4304160	to hear about this, I have to admit, I'm very cautious because I find it odd that we're
4304160	4308360	going to Kickstarter for the next project when Mighty No. 9 isn't out.
4308360	4311720	But it's got a release date and it's got a physical disc version that they're going to
4311720	4312720	be pressing.
4312720	4313720	I get it.
4313720	4314720	It's towards the end.
4314720	4317200	And judging from the beta, it's almost done.
4317200	4320600	Yeah and I know there's a beta, so I know people have had their hands on it and so forth,
4320600	4327640	but I don't know, I do find it- and I realize that they work on games like they're starting
4327680	4332600	this cycle, it's kind of like, I don't know, what's a game that's almost out like in stores
4332600	4333600	right now?
4333600	4335260	What's coming out like in September?
4335260	4336260	Yarn Yoshi or something?
4336260	4339360	Yarn, okay, Yoshi's Yarn, well that's already out in Europe, but whatever.
4339360	4343200	Yoshi's Yarn work was probably done in like February, you know, or even sooner than that,
4343200	4344440	probably before the holidays.
4344440	4347640	You know, it just takes a little time to get all the discs printed, get all the, you know,
4347640	4348640	publishing and things done.
4348640	4350720	They go bold though only a few weeks prior to launch.
4350720	4352600	It's not that- they're literally working up to date.
4352600	4353960	But they're starting their next project.
4353960	4354960	Well yeah.
4354960	4357040	There's very few people working on it at the end.
4357040	4360440	The rest, everybody else wants to keep a job, so they're thinking about their next project
4360440	4361440	in advance.
4361440	4366640	So from that end, I get it, but at the same time, just as a consumer on Kickstarter, I
4366640	4370560	feel like, I don't know how I feel about backing your project when I haven't really been able
4370560	4372240	to assess your first project.
4372240	4373240	But I think that this-
4373240	4374240	And if I trust you-
4374240	4378720	It's a little bit different than say, you know, oh, they just finished funding for Mighty
4378720	4383420	Number Nine and like two months later, oh, we're funding another Kickstarter project.
4383420	4389260	It's a little bit different when this is like just coming out in a few months, literally
4389260	4390260	like two months away.
4390260	4391260	Yeah.
4391260	4393260	That's release candidate type stuff.
4393260	4395660	You know, now you've got a new project being Kickstarted.
4395660	4397700	I'm kind of okay with that.
4397700	4401900	It's when you have no- and I understand they have really no track record right now, but
4401900	4407660	it's- people have actually seen it, played it, they know it's good.
4407660	4409460	It's coming out very soon.
4409460	4410460	I mean-
4410460	4413200	I haven't heard a hundred percent positive, I'm just saying.
4413200	4416920	Like there's been some things I've seen- and granted, I can't really judge myself till
4416920	4417920	I play it.
4417920	4418920	I haven't.
4418920	4419920	So, you know, disclaimer, whatever.
4419920	4423380	But I'm seeing some people were like, this isn't really what I was expecting.
4423380	4424380	So-
4424380	4429960	A lot of people are also expecting it to look exactly like the concept art, which is stupid.
4429960	4431660	It never looks exactly like the concept art.
4431660	4433040	That's why it's concept art.
4433040	4437160	Go to our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com.
4437160	4440420	Dungeon Buster says Deep Silver's already on board as a distributor and technically
4440420	4444060	it was supposed to be out a few months ago, actually hitting its estimated release date
4444060	4445460	before more happened.
4445460	4448980	MXC says the build of Mighty No. 983 seemed practically done.
4448980	4452860	I would have preferred that concept waited until it released for this new Kickstarter
4452860	4453860	though.
4453860	4459100	And Bobby Blackwolf says they don't need artists for games they're currently in final bug fix.
4459100	4465180	So this is probably about, you know, starting that next project before the other one is,
4465180	4466180	you know-
4466180	4467860	And I'm all over a new Mega Man Legends game.
4467860	4468860	I know.
4468860	4474500	And there's still a part of me that's very like, I feel like I really want to play Mighty
4474500	4475500	No. 9.
4475500	4476620	Well, I didn't back Mighty No. 9.
4476620	4477620	You know what?
4477620	4478620	I didn't either, actually.
4478620	4479620	Funny enough.
4479620	4480620	But I'll buy it when it comes out.
4480620	4485100	I just, I'm not, you know, I didn't back Bloodstained either.
4485100	4486100	I don't know.
4486100	4489260	The last thing I backed was We Happy Few.
4489260	4491620	I'll check out Mighty No. 9 when it comes out.
4491620	4496100	And then if I like that, I'll buy this other one when it comes out, probably.
4496100	4498780	You know, I'm interested enough in it, but I don't, I don't know.
4498780	4503660	Like does that make me a bad fan because I don't want to run to Kickstarter and pay
4503660	4504660	in advance?
4504660	4507420	Like, I don't think there's also anything wrong with saying, that looks neat, can't
4507420	4508420	wait to play it when it's out.
4508420	4510460	You know, like I don't have to back it.
4510460	4511460	That's all right.
4511460	4512980	It's, there's two sides of the fence here.
4512980	4514700	I'll fully display my own bias.
4514700	4519940	I'm probably at least a hundred bucks or so deep into both of those projects and soon
4519940	4524340	Red Ash, but still and all, you know, if you want to be a little bit more patient about
4524340	4525620	it, just wait till it's out.
4525620	4526620	That's okay too.
4526620	4531380	I mean, there are those that, I guess in this whole crowdfunding world now, the game isn't
4531380	4536620	going to even have a chance if some people don't dive in, but you know, it's, it's just
4536620	4537620	one of those things.
4537620	4538620	Yeah.
4538620	4539620	And I get that.
4539620	4542460	And like, if I don't contribute on the Kickstarter, then I can't complain if it doesn't happen,
4542460	4544500	which I'm willing to accept that.
4544500	4548940	But I was gonna say, you're, you're a high roller on some of these Kickstarters.
4548940	4552020	You say you dropped a hundred bucks on Bloodstained and Mighty No. 9?
4552020	4553020	Yeah.
4553020	4554020	Wow.
4554020	4555900	What, why, why'd you roll big on those?
4555900	4557580	For one, I'm probably...
4557580	4559540	First, you should spend your money however the hell you want.
4559540	4563300	I'm not asking you to justify that, but I'm just saying, what, what drove you to that?
4563300	4564300	Fanboyism.
4564300	4567540	I'll come to you about fanboyism.
4567540	4568540	I love your honesty.
4568540	4569540	I'm like, fine.
4569540	4574540	You know, I am the big, you know, Mega Man fan, and I've not been too pleased with the
4574540	4576300	lack of titles lately.
4576300	4580220	So as soon as I saw that Imafune was on board trying to make something, you know, a spiritual
4580220	4583140	successor, I'm like, okay, fine.
4583140	4584900	I can, I can be okay with this.
4584900	4588580	You know, spiritual successor's down, you know, System Shock 2 going to BioShock.
4588580	4589580	Okay.
4589580	4590580	I liked that.
4590580	4592580	Wasn't exactly the same thing, but it was close.
4592580	4593580	So okay.
4593580	4595800	Creator on board with Mighty No. 9.
4595800	4597180	I have high hopes for this.
4597180	4600260	Let me go ahead and back this, you know, right away.
4600260	4604940	Ditto for, uh, uh, for Iga and, uh, and Bloodstained.
4604940	4611220	What do you think about the whole, um, um, the Mega Man re-release thing?
4611220	4614020	Cause you said, you said that they haven't been showing Mega Man a lot of love, but then
4614020	4617220	we just had this news come out about 1 through 6 HD or whatever.
4617220	4619060	I posted about this a while back.
4619060	4621260	When's that coming out, by the way?
4621260	4622260	I don't know if I caught it.
4622260	4623780	Did anybody in chat catch the release date for that?
4623780	4626920	I would assume it's before Holiday or around Holiday.
4626920	4632700	What if they're trying to piggyback on Mighty No. 9 coming out to try to, like, get some
4632700	4633700	stuff?
4633700	4634700	That's, that's business, bitches.
4634700	4636700	Yeah, I understand that, but I'm just saying.
4636700	4637700	That's what they do.
4637700	4639340	Oh, here's the thing about the Legacy Collection.
4639340	4641180	I, I, I made a post about it.
4641180	4642180	In fact, I think it is.
4642180	4645420	I think it is right around the time of Mighty No. 9's release, and I think it's, you're,
4645420	4646420	you're probably right.
4646420	4647420	That's business, bitches.
4647420	4648420	It is.
4648420	4649420	What is it?
4649420	4652780	Why do they, why do they do those direct-to-video things when, like, Jurassic World is coming
4652780	4653780	out?
4653780	4654780	Oh, mockbusters.
4654780	4655780	Why do they, yeah, the mockbusters.
4655780	4656780	They come out with, like, Dinosaur Planet.
4656780	4658500	Oh yeah, because those companies do that.
4658500	4659620	That's, that's their company.
4659620	4660620	They do that.
4660620	4661620	I mean, it's.
4661620	4662620	That's what they do.
4662620	4663620	Anyway, Drew, sorry.
4663620	4666020	So here's the thing about the Legacy Collection, and I, I, I spoke on this a while back when
4666020	4667460	it was, when it was first announced.
4667460	4674340	I made a couple posts about it, but Capcom kind of puts die-hard Mega Man fan-moi into
4674340	4676260	kind of a catch-22.
4676260	4682140	If I don't buy it, it pretty much means that, oh, the fans aren't, you know, people aren't
4682140	4685900	interested in the Mega Man series anymore, and we don't see any new games.
4685900	4691300	If I do buy it, and other, you know, other fans, if we do buy it, it says, okay, it says
4691300	4696020	to Capcom, oh, they're, they'll go ahead and keep on buying the old shit, and no new games
4696020	4697740	are going to be made in the series.
4697740	4702420	I know they're trying to test the waters, but it does put the fans in a difficult position.
4702420	4706260	That said, I'll buy it anyway, Capcom, take my money.
4706260	4708940	No, no, here's, here's, here's how you have to look at it, actually.
4708940	4713820	Look at it, look at it, you know, a few years back with Konami.
4713820	4718540	Oh, sure, we'll support all your fucking, you know, Bomani stuff, and we'll support
4718540	4723980	your, oh, Rock Revolution, okay, that shit, you know, but we'll keep supporting this stuff
4723980	4727380	because we're hoping that another Dance Dance Revolution game comes out or something, but
4727380	4728380	it never does.
4728380	4732980	So, you can support Mega Man and those old collections all you want.
4732980	4736740	That shit ain't going to fucking come out, regardless if you support it or not.
4736740	4741500	My understanding is that, you know, Digital Eclipse is really making this with, you know,
4741500	4744820	Capcom's blessing or whatever, and, and I think part of the reason why I'm prone to
4744820	4749300	support it is I'm kind of swayed over by Digital Eclipse's argument of that it is more of a
4749300	4754260	criterion collection of games, and, okay, they may have picked a game that, you know,
4754260	4758660	already had this collection or whatever, but I kind of like that idea about, like, if we're
4758660	4765220	going to go back and revisit old shit, like, let's give it a real pristine, you know, release.
4765220	4769060	Let's go back and, you know, update little things and inject some leaderboards into it.
4769060	4772700	This is all I've ever talked about for Virtual Console, right, like, I would love it if all
4772700	4776100	the Virtual Console releases looked kind of like this Mega Man thing is shaping up to
4776100	4777100	be.
4777140	4780220	I don't know, in that regard, I'm kind of won over a little bit.
4780220	4786140	I mean, even that Mega Man collection, you know, it wasn't, it didn't have online leaderboards
4786140	4789820	or any of those, you know, social things that these new systems have or whatever, and I
4789820	4793540	realize these aren't big things and probably aren't winning everybody over, but I just
4793540	4797100	kind of think those are things that are weighing on my decision and I'll probably end up getting
4797100	4798100	it.
4798100	4802980	The thing is, I know I'm not alone here when, you know, I say I'm, I love the older games,
4802980	4806620	I'm sick and tired of seeing them all over again.
4806620	4812340	This is going to be, what, the fourth or fifth time in Virtual Console, anniversary collections,
4812340	4813460	what have you.
4813460	4814460	Give me something new!
4814460	4818140	I am sick of The Wizard of Oz and I wish they would stop screening it in theaters.
4818140	4822140	I am just so goddamn sick of that movie, they don't need to release, The Wizard of Oz on
4822140	4827020	Blu-ray, stop fucking up my Blu-ray section with another goddamn release of The Wizard
4827020	4828020	of Oz.
4828020	4829020	Exactly.
4829020	4835500	All their jolly singing, this isn't what I want to see.
4835500	4837460	Do lollipop men piss you off, Loki?
4837460	4841940	No, you know what, I want to see that fucking crossover, the Avengers fucking, you know,
4841940	4847300	Wizard of Oz shit with the fucking dark ass, you know, tin man, that's the shit I want
4847300	4848300	to see.
4848300	4851820	Let's get some fucking Tim Burton shit out here, fuck Johnny Depp being in it and stuff,
4851820	4858340	I want some dark ass Wizard of Oz, you know, fucking, I want it to be so goddamn dark that
4858340	4863580	Return of Oz seems like fucking ponies and magic and rainbows and shit, you know, that's
4863580	4865100	what I want to see.
4865500	4869220	I want kids to go in there, oh, Wizard of Oz, that sounds awesome, and I want them to
4869220	4874540	come out fucking scared for their goddamn lives, like holy shit, I want them to be fucked
4874540	4875540	up.
4875540	4878980	That was Return of Oz, that queen collected heads in a jar, that's why our generation
4878980	4881140	is fucked up, Loki, that movie.
4881140	4884940	Because people weren't ready for that yet, and then Futurama came out and it was okay.
4884940	4890060	They were giving Farooza bulk like shock therapy, it was like part of the plot of that movie.
4890060	4892060	It was an awesome movie.
4892060	4893300	Have you ever read the books?
4893500	4895860	Actually, yes, they're messed up too.
4895860	4899620	Yeah, but they were, honestly, I thought they were good.
4899620	4903900	That's why I'm saying, they need to take the books and adapt it to fucking darken shit.
4903900	4908460	Well jeez, Rob, you and your ruby shoes just invalidated my entire pissed off argument,
4908460	4910500	that makes it all okay now!
4910500	4914940	Well, actually, in the book, they were silver slippers, I'll have you know.
4914940	4915940	Ewwww.
4915940	4916940	Yes.
4916940	4917940	Ewwww.
4918940	4924260	So they need to remake the whole fucking movie because the slippers were the wrong fucking
4924260	4925260	color.
4925260	4927260	So they need to go back and do it.
4927260	4931540	The whole reason that they did that is because they would show up better on screen.
4931540	4932540	The end.
4932540	4935180	That's not a problem now in this day.
4935180	4940540	I didn't buy no goddamn high definition television for you to tell me it can't show certain colors.
4940540	4942820	Alright, anyhow.
4947940	4952860	Let's move on, shall we?
4952860	4953980	Let's talk about something else.
4953980	4955620	Let's talk about music games.
4955620	4960820	Better yet, Vocaloid games, because who doesn't love Hatsune Miku type of games, you know?
4960820	4962900	I bought Project Diva.
4962900	4963900	Did you?
4963900	4964900	Yep.
4964900	4965900	Actually, those are fun games.
4965900	4970900	I really can't hate on those types of games, because Hatsune Miku, that's a fun series.
4970900	4974620	Well there's another series, this actually isn't a story about Hatsune Miku, but Vocaloid
4974620	4978460	type games are pretty popular over in Japan.
4978460	4980580	Like, you know, they have that growing popularity.
4980580	4985940	They might not be as popular here, but there could be a reason for that.
4985940	4990160	And that is that they can't seem to ever release them here.
4990160	4995320	One game I want to talk about is Tamsoft's IAVT Colorful.
4995320	4999980	It's a rhythm game that's based on first place's Vocaloid Idol.
4999980	5004180	So, and you know what, this trailer has Japanese narration in it, but you can definitely hear
5004180	5018500	the music, so you'll know what I'm talking about here.
5018500	5019920	Like it's so happy.
5019920	5023260	How can you possibly be in a bad mood when you're playing a game like that and hearing
5023260	5024260	music like that?
5024260	5026420	Well, can we work on that title first off?
5026420	5028020	I know, right?
5028020	5029020	That's a winning title for the American market.
5029020	5033260	It might need a different title if it comes over here, but anyway, here's the thing.
5033340	5036580	As cute as that game sounds, you're probably going to have to import it if you ever want
5036580	5037980	to play it.
5037980	5043220	Producer of the game Kenshiro Takaaki said in an interview with Silicon Era, quote, since
5043220	5048400	it's a music title and since music is arguably one of the most protected media types artists
5048400	5053140	have, it just means more doors to knock on and more approvals to get.
5053140	5056300	It's far more difficult than a Senran Kagura title.
5056300	5060860	So in other words, a lot of these, you know, music rights issues and we, you know, covering
5060860	5067900	music games, we know that this is always an issue with trying to get games over here
5067900	5070860	is that the music licensing is always a pain in the ass.
5070860	5075780	And to this day, here we are, what, 14 years later, I say this is why Konami turned a blind
5075780	5078640	eye to the DDR machines being over here.
5078640	5082220	At the end of the day, Konami didn't care because they were, you know, they probably
5082220	5086800	cared about the pirated machines, but the legit sale ones, whatever, they couldn't release
5086800	5092340	those games here because the US music industry wasn't going to license those songs at the
5092340	5094660	same rates that the Japanese industry was.
5094660	5099880	So Konami could build up awareness of the games and release the home versions that did
5099880	5102660	have those, you know, I don't understand what the big deal is anyway.
5102660	5105860	So what, you release something in another country and someone imports it.
5105860	5110360	Who gives a shit if, you know, licensing rights weren't paid over here as well as over there?
5110360	5114360	I mean, it just goes, I think they do give a shit because money, right money.
5114600	5118040	Well, I understand, but like, I just don't understand why they feel that they're entitled
5118040	5121400	to more money because they feel like they're always entitled to more money.
5121400	5125300	Well, I think the music industry is just woefully out of touch with the fact that we are in
5125300	5131580	this global, you know, world now that we're connected because the internet and some would
5131580	5135600	say that's what fucked over the music industry in the late nineties was that Napster broke
5135600	5142740	down that wall real quick of, you know, being able to get stuff in Japan and the, you know,
5142740	5146980	no longer do people have to drop all this extra money to import CDs from other companies.
5146980	5149140	God, I remember I used to buy import CDs.
5149140	5153800	I used to buy import singles to get like that extra rare bonus track and all that stuff.
5153800	5155780	I don't have to do that in the digital age.
5155780	5156780	That's done.
5156780	5159740	I mean, now we're in the world of Spotify and Pandora and Apple music.
5159740	5161660	What have you just started like this?
5161660	5162660	Yeah.
5162660	5167620	So, but I dunno, I kind of feel like in some ways the licensing needs to catch up a little
5167620	5168620	bit too.
5168620	5171820	And if you're gonna license things, it needs to be a global license in this day and age.
5171820	5176060	Like I just don't understand the whole, and I'm sure there's more legal reasons, but I
5176060	5181700	just from a, from a consumer viewpoint of I'll just import the damn thing from Japan,
5181700	5185260	whatever, you know, I, it just feels really out of touch with the global world we live
5185260	5186260	in.
5186260	5190100	Well, the licensing and the, uh, I guess the existing fan base, I mean, that does at least
5190100	5195700	explain why for some odd reason we actually are getting persona for dancing all night.
5195700	5198860	You want to talk about a niche spinoff title?
5198900	5203380	Do you know that I know several people that imported that though, because they can't wait.
5203380	5204900	I almost did.
5204900	5207900	I almost did.
5207900	5208900	I'll wait.
5208900	5209900	I have on pre-order.
5209900	5210900	I'm a bad person.
5210900	5214060	That's the one thing that's kept Shane out of heaven's word for like several hours this
5214060	5217700	weekend is the fact that, oh yeah, I was not lying cause I was playing persona for dancing
5217700	5218700	all night.
5218700	5219700	I'm like, of course you were.
5219700	5220700	Of course you were.
5220700	5221700	Yeah.
5221700	5225700	When I got my PlayStation, um, TV last week, I was like, well, can you guys pick up like
5225700	5227340	a physical gaming video with that?
5227340	5231540	That's all that's on the Vita nowadays is Japanese import games.
5231540	5236220	If that's what you're into, the Vita is your system right there and all sorts of the classics.
5236220	5241700	Hence why my new Vita is Japanese region this time, so I can actually play some new games.
5241700	5244100	There you go.
5244100	5249420	Anyway, uh, that's, I just wanted to bring that up on, you know, we love music games.
5249420	5252740	Uh, anyhow, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
5252740	5254380	Hopefully tacos.
5254940	5262500	Um, well, this one is, uh, I have been reading the speculation for a while on this one, um,
5262500	5267900	and BioWare has this bad habit of putting out surveys that sort of, uh, not really leaks
5267900	5273620	as much as spills out in a torrent of information, everything ever about anything they're going
5273620	5275300	to do.
5275340	5285180	So the survey that was released, um, said that there are ideas out for a $14.99 a DLC
5285180	5287940	for Dragon Age Inquisition related to the story.
5287940	5294820	And it said that this is, uh, supposed to be like the last adventure as well as your
5294820	5295820	next mission.
5295820	5298780	So basically it's the fate of the Inquisition.
5298780	5304980	Um, and the quote on here says that it's going to revolve around, and this is where the quote
5304980	5310660	starts, the one who started it all and facing a great evil before it is too late.
5310660	5313260	So of course, plenty of us are wondering, is it the Wolf Hunt?
5313260	5315080	Is it the Wolf Hunt?
5315080	5320380	Some people think it's going to go in another direction, you know, but we're...
5320380	5326180	But what you didn't know is that BioWare hired special guest author for this DLC, George
5326180	5329180	R.R. Martin, and everyone will be killed.
5329180	5330180	Yay!
5330180	5334620	And then Porky Pig comes out at the end, bleep, bleep, bleep, that's all folks.
5334620	5338900	Anyway, I'll read exactly what was in the, uh, the email thing.
5338900	5343660	It said, uh, having saved the world of Thedas by closing the breach, your next mission will
5343660	5346100	determine the future of the Inquisition.
5346100	5350300	Your mark suddenly glows, erupting with magic connected to the Fade, which makes me instantly
5350300	5352820	think of who I think it is.
5352820	5357560	Assassin's attack in shadow, an invasion of enemies begins, when a race against time to
5357560	5360580	face a great evil before it is too late.
5360580	5365500	In this story-based expansion, playable after the events of Dragon Age Inquisition, you
5365500	5369860	will embark on a last adventure with your team to confront the one who started it all.
5369860	5373180	Part of me also hopes that this is our version of Citadel.
5373180	5374180	Of the Citadel DLC.
5374180	5376100	Took the words right out of my mouth.
5376100	5379500	And then they're traveling through the woods and all of a sudden they come across this
5379500	5385460	crashed spaceship, happens to be the normal guy, and a strange child.
5385460	5389180	From the bullet points, you get to fight a bunch of Qunari.
5389180	5394380	You have brand new areas to go through, you get to go through the Fade, and different
5394380	5397500	optional gameplay modes.
5397500	5401420	More romance scenes, because the Citadel really brought some feels, like remember the Thane
5401420	5402420	thing in the Citadel DLC?
5402420	5403740	That was some, that was some feels.
5403740	5405620	I should go.
5405620	5414340	There's also an add-on pack that has spoils of Avvar, and that came from Jaws of Hakkon,
5414340	5417760	we had the Black Emporium come out.
5417760	5422900	I will tell you this, for anyone looking for folks who are playing the beta, there's
5422900	5429600	no beta stuff out yet, and that's all I can say about it, because NDA, so.
5429600	5432320	Yeah, but if anything was out there it would be all over the internet.
5432320	5436360	Yeah, other people would say so, not me, but I'm just saying, if anyone's looking to beta
5436360	5440480	testers to reveal anything, there's nothing out there yet.
5440480	5442720	No beta releases.
5442720	5444840	Go into the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
5444840	5449320	Fifth Dream says, I got a survey about that DLC, so it's out there.
5449320	5450320	She isn't making it up, folks.
5450320	5451320	It's out there.
5451320	5453600	Yeah, just, there's nothing out there being tested yet, so.
5453600	5459380	What's the one thing you really want to see in this DLC as a big Dragon Age fan, Darzara?
5459380	5464500	I definitely want to see a resolution for the Solas romance, because that was the first
5464500	5471400	one I did, and now I'm all about Cullen, so whatever, but I would like to see a resolution
5471400	5476200	and have that play into what I think is going to happen.
5476200	5477200	Alright.
5477200	5478200	Yeah.
5478200	5481440	Well, in the meantime, we have some things that are coming out a little sooner than this
5481440	5482440	DLC.
5482440	5485680	It's travel around the world and check out some release dates, starting off with the
5485680	5486880	US, Loki.
5486880	5491540	As it previously stated when we were talking about Nintendo releasing the NX in July, there
5491540	5494720	is nothing coming out in July, and that is the case this week.
5494720	5497720	There is nothing coming out this week.
5497720	5498720	Very slow month.
5499040	5502720	It is an incredibly slow month, but it's typical.
5502720	5503720	That's true.
5503720	5507960	Not even, you would think with this holiday weekend we just had, we would have had something
5507960	5508960	a little...
5508960	5509960	Typically, no.
5509960	5510960	Yeah.
5510960	5511960	Alright.
5511960	5514120	Well, traveling on over to Japan to see if the story is a little different there.
5514120	5518120	Checking out the Japanese releases, you know, I gotta say, it's looking a little empty in
5518120	5519120	Japan as well.
5519120	5522760	We don't really have releases on the PlayStation 4 until July 16th.
5522760	5528240	That's when Batman Arkham Knight finally gets its release, but again, that is on July 16th.
5528240	5530800	Xbox One, pretty much the same story.
5530800	5536000	So I'm gonna turn to the Wii U, which also, July 16th is when Yoshi's Woolly World comes
5536000	5537000	out.
5537000	5538760	Otherwise, it's slow over there.
5538760	5543520	Even the Vita, the only thing the Vita has this week is Taiko no Tatujin V version comes
5543520	5546120	out on July 9th.
5546120	5549880	So that is pretty much the lone release there on the Vita for this coming week.
5549880	5555120	And then lastly, on the 3DS, we have a little more on the 3DS this week.
5555120	5563240	For July 9th, we have Chō to Sōchū Atsumare Sakyō no Tūsōshia Tachi comes out from
5563240	5564820	Bandai Namco.
5564820	5570640	And on July 11th, this is kind of a big deal, Yokoi Watch Busters.
5570640	5573400	Is this, are these games, this might be like a spinoff game.
5573400	5580320	I don't think this is actual Yokoi Watch game, but these are like a little spinoff game.
5580320	5582400	Those are available on the 3DS this week.
5582680	5586680	And that might be part of the reason why some other games are staying away, because those
5586680	5590760	games are pretty big over in Japan, and they're going to see if they're going to end up being
5590760	5594840	a big deal here in the coming months when they finally release it here stateside.
5594840	5596800	But otherwise, that's really it for Japanese releases.
5596800	5597800	How about the UK?
5597800	5600840	Um, some things, not really much.
5600840	5607040	On the 7th, Geometry Wars 3 Dimensions, Worms World Party Remastered for PC.
5607040	5609440	And on the 8th, Numa Breath of Life.
5609440	5610440	That's it.
5610480	5615000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
5615000	5616000	Loki.
5616000	5624160	So, apparently, Warner Brothers was well aware of the PC version condition for Arkham Knight
5624160	5626200	when it was released.
5626200	5635520	Basically, they had some anonymous QA testers that, I guess, were part of a report to Kotaku.
5635520	5639320	They were talking about, you know, basically, I will say that it's pretty rich for Warner
5639320	5643080	Brothers to act like they had no idea the game was in such a horrible state.
5643080	5647360	It's been like this for months, and all the problems we see now are the exact same, unchanged
5647360	5649360	almost a year ago.
5649360	5654840	So, that's too bad.
5654840	5659160	How does that make you feel, Drew, as the consumer of Arkham Knight on PC, to know that
5659160	5661760	Warner knew what a hot mess it was?
5661760	5663760	Released it anyway.
5663760	5665520	Grrr.
5665520	5668920	I don't have a rant for this.
5668920	5671720	I'm internalizing it right now, I just don't have a rant for this.
5671720	5676720	It's like, they, I don't know, because I feel like, you know, they're having to eat a lot
5676720	5682200	of money now with all these returns and things, so I just feel like, I don't know, if they
5682200	5687280	knew about it and still released it, it was not a healthy decision.
5687280	5688760	I feel like I'm...
5688760	5692220	Some executive needs to reevaluate if that's the right career for them.
5692220	5696960	It's like I was being mad at Obsidian over KOTOR 2 not being finished before I got pushed
5696960	5698000	out the door.
5698000	5699000	It's kind of like that.
5699000	5703840	They said that only 10% of the testers are devoted to the PC version, and they were saying
5703840	5709760	that the console versions were not nearly as easy to work with as expected, and they
5709760	5719720	were testing primarily at 720p, and they were worried that the spoilers, you know, for Arkham
5719720	5721520	Knight would come out.
5721520	5722520	Interesting.
5722520	5723520	Let's see.
5723520	5728560	Oh, don't worry, by the time it comes out in a playable form, I'll already be spoiled
5728560	5729560	on it.
5729560	5739120	Yeah, so PC testing firms that are used to stress test games on different hardware conditions,
5739120	5742700	but I guess maybe they weren't testing it well enough, I don't know.
5742700	5747600	But it sounds like that they were aware of the situation, and maybe, I don't know, once
5747600	5751940	again, like, if you know it's broken, then why release it?
5751940	5755560	Were these test systems imaginary?
5755560	5759300	Because I know that I've been running a pretty good spec machine myself.
5759300	5762340	I just think that they're just like, ah, fuck it, we're gonna release it and make money
5762340	5764980	off of it, and we'll patch it out later, you know.
5764980	5765980	I don't know.
5765980	5772580	I don't know what they thought, but the problem was, you know, maybe they made this decision
5772580	5775420	prior to knowing that Steam was gonna do the refunds?
5775420	5777840	I don't know.
5777840	5778840	It says bad either way.
5778840	5783200	Wait, let me, quick comment from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster
5783200	5787880	says, gee, delay to fix it or suffer humiliation, be forced to pull it from sale, and then try
5787880	5791580	to fix it while getting criticized after, decisions, decisions.
5791580	5794820	As Joan Hunter-Matt says, they probably evaluated that more people would be pissed that they
5794820	5799320	delayed it again, rather than just release it and fix it later.
5799320	5800960	How do you come up with that?
5800960	5801960	Whatever.
5801960	5802960	Whatever.
5802960	5803960	Anyway.
5803960	5808340	And then there was a little bit of talk about the Harley Quinn DLC missions, or pre-order
5808340	5812720	DLC that came with the game that you really, you add the pre-order of that to get it, otherwise
5812720	5816040	you're gonna miss out on 30 minutes of gameplay.
5816040	5817040	That's how long it was.
5817040	5818040	30 minutes long.
5818040	5819040	30 minutes?
5819040	5820040	30 minutes of gameplay.
5820040	5821040	Oh my god.
5821040	5827440	But hey, I will have you know though, even though the PC version's broken, Batgirl DLC
5827440	5828440	is coming out.
5828440	5833480	So be sure to pre-order that shit, because I'm glad that they're working on that and
5833480	5835720	not fixing the game.
5835720	5843320	Alright, one more story I have for you guys, and a suitable segue into the classic game
5843320	5844400	of the week.
5844400	5847920	The console that never was, the Super Nintendo PlayStation.
5847920	5850740	Yes, that's right, the Super Nintendo PlayStation.
5850740	5853560	You know, I bet a lot of you have probably already seen this on Facebook and other social
5853560	5859120	media, but yeah, this really caught wildfire via Reddit, as some things tend to go viral
5859120	5860920	over there.
5860920	5866800	And this guy on Reddit posted that he had the device, was posting pictures, and I think
5866800	5869840	he even posted a video of what this whole thing was.
5869840	5873720	And basically, you know, it was the whole, my dad worked for Nintendo type of thing,
5873720	5875700	although it was a little more complicated than that.
5875700	5879800	My dad worked for a company, and somebody he used to work with worked at Nintendo, and
5879800	5884040	the dad's company went bankrupt, and the dad found it in a box of junk that he was supposed
5884040	5885040	to throw out.
5885040	5889960	Now, here's the thing, the dude can't find a power cord that works on the system, so
5890000	5892320	he can't, like, just plug it in and play with it.
5892320	5898680	So we don't know what the thing does, or what this mysterious cartridge that's also with
5898680	5899680	it.
5899680	5900680	Yes, I'm sure it'll be-
5900680	5901680	It said something on the cartridge, though.
5901680	5902680	It did.
5902680	5904860	I'm sure it would be impossible to, I don't know, pick up a universal power supply and
5904860	5906400	figure out, you know...
5906400	5909000	Yeah, they're not that difficult to make.
5909000	5914880	Well, a lot of people are saying to be very careful, because this is very valuable hardware,
5914880	5917200	so you don't want to just plug any old power supply into it.
5917200	5918560	Well, doesn't that say what kind of voltage it is?
5918560	5919560	It does.
5920160	5921160	It says 7.6 volts.
5921160	5922160	It says right there-
5922160	5923160	There you go!
5923160	5924160	That's gonna be too hard.
5924160	5928880	Just find a 7.6 volts DC power adapter, plug it in, done.
5928880	5933640	But I can also understand the whole, I don't want to, you know, maybe what's labeled isn't
5933640	5936880	what's really in it, because these are test units.
5936880	5941300	Just saying, you know, I can understand when this thing could be thousands of dollars to
5941300	5944480	a collector, why you might not want it to catch fire.
5944480	5946120	It's not gonna catch fire.
5946720	5947720	10-6-92?
5949400	5953120	Yeah, that's probably around the time frame when they were working on it.
5953120	5954680	I can't read this.
5954680	5955680	Yeah.
5955680	5960440	So, anyhow, let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognet.com.
5960440	5963840	Dungeon Buster says it's been sitting in a box of junk for years, so who knows what condition
5963840	5964840	it's in.
5964840	5967400	Hey, those Super Nintendos, though, they can take a beating.
5967400	5971000	Like they'll turn an awful, awful color, but they work.
5971000	5974040	I think Dan had one that fell down two flights of stairs and it still worked.
5974040	5975440	Oh yeah, my Super Nintendo still works.
5975440	5978000	But I bought Clue at a flea market a while ago.
5978000	5980880	You can actually clean that discoloration off of it, too.
5980880	5981880	Oh, can you?
5981880	5985280	They have like something meant for that, actually, that yellowing.
5985280	5986280	Nice.
5986280	5988400	Yeah, it was pretty hardcore plastic.
5988400	5994080	We remember talking one time about the Game Boy that survived a bomb blast.
5994080	5999280	Oh yeah, because they have it in the museum at the Nintendo store in New York City.
5999280	6000280	Yep.
6000280	6001280	Yeah, yeah.
6001280	6002280	Crazy.
6003160	6009400	That is a good segue, I think, for us to get into the classic game of the week.
6009400	6011640	Dark Soccer is going to boot up her Super Nintendo PlayStation.
6011640	6017080	Just kidding, she doesn't have one, but she does have a Super Nintendo and a PlayStation.
6017080	6018080	Several of each.
6018080	6022560	So smush them together and step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,
6022560	6024820	you kids should be checking out this game this week.
6024820	6025820	Which actually...
6025820	6026820	But don't do drugs.
6026820	6028640	Which actually, I think, comes from one of those systems, doesn't it?
6028640	6029640	Don't do drugs.
6029640	6031220	Yes, don't do drugs.
6031260	6033620	Or if you're, you know, going to do drugs.
6033620	6036460	Do it with people watching you so they can laugh at you.
6036460	6037460	Alright.
6037460	6038460	And then put it on YouTube.
6038460	6039460	Have a doctor's permission slip.
6039460	6040460	Ooh, Oxycontin.
6040460	6042820	I'm kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.
6042820	6049260	Okay, so the game of the week actually is a PlayStation game called LSD.
6049260	6050260	Don't do drugs.
6050260	6051260	Yes, don't do drugs.
6051260	6056860	Also known as LSD Dream Emulator, which was released in Japan in 1998 and it came out
6056860	6062680	on the PlayStation based on a dream journal that one of the staff members at Asmik Ace
6062680	6065380	Entertainment had been keeping for over a decade.
6065380	6066380	His name...
6066380	6074700	Actually, I don't think it's a he because it sounds like a girl name, but Hiroko Nishikawa.
6074700	6079700	Anyway, there were three products that were released about the journal.
6079700	6083860	One of them is a music CD called LSD and Remixes.
6083860	6087660	And Lovely Sweet Dream, both of those were limited.
6087660	6093220	And then the game itself, because it is just so weird, has a kind of a cult following on
6093220	6095420	it.
6095420	6101180	It also has been referenced that it could be sort of like a reference to the drug and
6101180	6105500	the, you know, surreal state of mind that it can put one in.
6105500	6112820	Although there's different phrases that are attributed to it, like in LVS Dream, so in
6112820	6116660	Life the Sensuous Dream, or in Limbo the Silent Dream.
6116660	6122380	There was a fan remake actually in progress since October 2011.
6122380	6125420	There's a public alpha build out of it for Windows.
6125420	6130580	So basically, it's a first person wander type of game.
6130580	6134420	You can use the left and right directional buttons to look around, the up and down is
6134420	6138500	to make you move forward or backwards, the front shoulder buttons turn around, back shoulder
6138500	6141580	is to strafe.
6141580	6143780	And then you can hold the X button to run.
6143780	6147820	You hear your footprint, your footsteps through the whole game too.
6147820	6150220	And it's just depending on whatever type of environment that you're in.
6150220	6153180	And then this kind of odd music in the background.
6153180	6155500	So basically you're in like a dream world.
6155500	6158300	You walk around and explore, you look around.
6158300	6165460	If you bump into walls, you'll go into another dream because you are being linked into it.
6165460	6170740	If you bump into people, animals, or special objects, you'll get an even weirder environment.
6170740	6175340	Silent Stream is up to 10 minutes and then you'll wake up and then you'll be sent back
6175340	6176700	to the menu.
6176700	6181380	If you fall off a cliff or into a hole, you will wake up immediately.
6181380	6186860	And you get a graph that tracks the player's state of mind, whether it's up or down or
6186860	6191460	static or dynamic, depending on the areas that you go through.
6191460	6195460	And different states will affect your future dreams.
6195460	6202860	So there are some different things that will happen over, like you'll get eyes on the walls
6202860	6205380	that will stare at you.
6205380	6211660	You can visit the same place several times, but it will change in different subtle ways.
6211660	6213860	You'll get new items to encounter.
6213860	6219780	You'll get new creatures, including a nymph that flies around, a wild horse running on
6219780	6220780	the prairie.
6220780	6226860	There's a man that fills up an entire room, a pterodactyl, and a face on legs.
6226860	6229300	Moisturize me.
6229300	6230300	What?
6230300	6231300	Yes, I went there.
6231300	6232300	A Doctor Who reference.
6232300	6233300	Fantastic.
6233300	6238100	You'll also meet a man in a gray trench coat who people have called the shadow man or the
6238100	6241620	gray man, and he glides only in one direction.
6241620	6244700	He doesn't have any walking animation.
6244700	6251700	You can walk around him and see his full model, but his head is always slightly bent
6251700	6253020	toward you.
6253020	6256940	If you get too close to him, the screen will flash and he'll disappear.
6256940	6260700	And then it removes your ability to recall the dream.
6260700	6264380	So you can, you know, you get the ability to revisit some of the dreams, but these are
6264380	6265900	the ones that you can't.
6265900	6273180	You also get an abyss demon who lures you to a site that you just can't get to.
6273180	6277420	And then he will appear like, and make you go into a new game.
6277420	6282280	He also will, there's sometimes a giant man in a wall who will headbutt you.
6282280	6288020	So it's just a bunch of weirdness and you can, you know, after about 15 to 30 days of
6288020	6294700	playing, you get the flashback, which is about two to four minutes of going back to some
6294700	6297500	of the previous dreams.
6297500	6298500	The...
6298500	6300580	Kaijuto wants to know, is Freddy in it?
6300580	6301580	No.
6301580	6302580	It's me.
6302980	6303980	You know what this reminds me of?
6303980	6309020	Just looking at footage of this, it looks like a first person version of a game I heard
6309020	6315560	of called Yume Nikki, which is kind of a, I guess, more of a dream or nightmare simulator.
6315560	6316980	But that was like third person type stuff.
6316980	6317980	It's very strange.
6317980	6324220	It looks like one of those fucked up VR demos used to download from a BBS in the 1990s.
6324220	6328180	There's, the music in this game though is really striking for this.
6328220	6336020	It was composed by Osamu Sato, has 500 patterns of background music.
6336020	6344860	And the soundtrack was compiled into the LSD and remixes.
6344860	6350020	And there was also an album called Lucy in the Sky with Dynamites.
6350020	6354860	And yeah, so it's a really freaky game.
6354860	6360740	I actually have played an emulated version of it once and it gave me nightmares.
6360740	6364420	So I probably wouldn't recommend it to too many people.
6364420	6368460	So don't play this game for the first time in Classic Game of the Week history.
6368460	6370300	It was the trench coat guy.
6370300	6371500	It was just the weirdest thing.
6371500	6379060	But I mean, I could make up a dream game, you know, like a literal dream game.
6379060	6383460	The like from weird dreams that I have, because I have weird dreams all the fucking time.
6383460	6386540	And mine would probably be more interesting and better rendered.
6386540	6391060	If I can play Slenderman and still always sleep at night, you can play LSD.
6391060	6395340	You still haven't played that Five Nights at Freddy's that I got you.
6395340	6398820	I still apparently have been given an open challenge to go through at least four nights.
6398820	6399820	Good luck.
6399820	6403380	I made it through two and then died on the third, so whatever.
6403380	6405020	All right.
6405020	6410780	There it is, your Classic Game of the Week LSD Dream Emulator for the PlayStation 1.
6410780	6414500	There's nothing quite like it out there, so check that out.
6414500	6416420	Or don't, because it'll give you horrible nightmares.
6416420	6418220	Hey, we're going to take a quick break.
6418220	6422260	But when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, hey, something very special
6422260	6424180	for you guys tonight.
6424180	6427940	Because Drew is here and we have a blast from the past, I thought, you know what?
6427940	6431860	Let's do a segment that we haven't done in a long time here on OLR.
6431860	6437660	So tonight, the return of Video Game Match Game is coming back.
6437660	6447860	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6447860	6454020	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live with our 604th episode in progress
6454020	6457860	for this July the 5th of 2015.
6457860	6460860	And we're going to get right back into it here, because we've got a busy segment coming
6460860	6461860	up.
6461860	6464300	We're already running a little long, and we're throwing a match game into it.
6464300	6468300	But of course, if you're just joining us live, we have Intern Drew coming back to the
6468300	6471100	show for the first time in four years.
6471100	6472100	You're welcome.
6472100	6473100	You having fun tonight?
6473100	6474500	I didn't ask for you to come.
6474500	6475500	You just showed up.
6475500	6476500	I'm just kidding.
6476500	6482060	A certain somebody walked by a certain someone else's cube at a certain locat and said, hey,
6482060	6483140	you coming to the show?
6483140	6486760	It's always good to see some old school people here in the studio.
6486760	6488820	We like the new school people, too.
6488820	6490580	We like a little bit of both.
6490580	6491580	Just like us, better.
6491580	6492580	Whatever.
6492580	6493580	All right.
6493860	6494860	We're going to get back into it.
6494860	6496500	We've got some rapid fire news coming at you.
6496500	6497500	Loki.
6497500	6505260	So there's a game called Zero Gravity AX that's supposed to be coming to the Wii U, and it's
6505260	6510900	basically an indie version of F-Zero, and it looks pretty amazing.
6510900	6516140	However, unfortunately, as cool as it looks, they decided to take it down, because it's
6516140	6520420	a little too much like F-Zero, like literally the ship that they put in there, that's straight
6520420	6521540	out of F-Zero.
6521540	6525580	So they're retooling it right now.
6525580	6531220	Basically the comment was, we're going to cancel the project due to the big amount of
6531220	6536260	negative feedback in the discussion about the Blue Falcon, and copyright made our decision
6536260	6537260	easy.
6537260	6540340	The footage on the page was an earlier build and a prototype.
6540340	6545860	It never should be in the final game in this form, as written down on the Kickstarter page.
6545860	6551740	However, we have learned that from that, we understand that now that an F-Zero indie
6551740	6555140	remake from a small dev team is not what you guys want.
6555140	6558580	We thank everybody who shared our campaign and who gave us feedback.
6558580	6559700	So they'll probably come back at some point.
6559700	6560700	It looks pretty amazing.
6560700	6566080	It may look like an F-Zero game that was done by an indie team.
6566080	6570180	It's sad that an indie team can pull off something that cool, but Nintendo doesn't want to bother
6570180	6571180	with it.
6571180	6572940	Oh, it's great that an indie team can pull off something that cool.
6572940	6578140	I know, I'm just saying it's sad that Nintendo doesn't want to, but look at the potential
6578140	6579140	of this.
6579140	6580140	It looks amazing.
6580140	6582300	Follow the example of Axiom Verge, for instance.
6582300	6585180	Yeah, Axiom Verge turned out great.
6585180	6587900	I think there's a lot they can still do with that there.
6587900	6593740	I even liked a game like Blur, which kind of was like F-Zero meets Mario Kart, but yet
6593740	6595820	the public really rejected that game.
6595820	6600980	But I thought it was better than people made it out to be, that's for sure.
6600980	6607780	In Australia, they have now banned some more video games, and the reason for this is that
6607780	6616220	they've adopted a new video game classification model to help age-rate digital games on Steam
6616220	6624540	and stuff like that, and based on that, they have refused classification to 220 different
6624540	6625540	games.
6625540	6626540	Geez.
6626540	6634460	And some of the games that are banned are Douchebag Beach Club and Drunk Driver, obviously
6634460	6638980	these go figure games.
6638980	6646220	So apparently this is within a four month times ban that these 220 games have been refused
6646220	6653780	classification, which is apparently four times the amount in the last past decade.
6653780	6660300	What was that game that was on GameCube, the one that had the, it was so bad, and then
6660300	6662980	it turned out there was like an underage girl in it, and it was really really awkward.
6662980	6663980	The guy game!
6663980	6664980	The guy game.
6664980	6665980	Oh, guy game, yep.
6665980	6667980	I'm sure that got banned.
6667980	6672500	Best way to pimp your game in other countries, say it was so hardcore, it got banned in Australia.
6672500	6673780	Banned in Australia.
6673780	6676660	Come play, what was that, Douchebag Beach Club?
6676660	6678020	Douchebag Beach Club.
6678020	6680300	Douchebag Beach Club, banned in Australia.
6680300	6682300	Or Drunk Driver.
6682820	6687340	Oh my god, anyway, well if you want to play something a little more friendly that's not
6687340	6691500	going to be banned in Australia, because it's paint, it's not blood, it's paint, of course
6691500	6694060	I'm talking about Splatoon.
6694060	6698660	And Splatoon, you know, still rolling out some features and updates, you know, obviously
6698660	6701740	we were going back and forth a little bit on the teen cat and dog thing, which was part
6701740	6706380	of the Splatfest that happened on the 4th of July, however before that happened, Tower
6706380	6709940	Control was actually released into ranked mode.
6710180	6715300	Tower Control is maps that have one floating tower in the center, and you're going to hop
6715300	6718420	on it and ride it towards the opponent's base.
6718420	6722660	Holding the tower takes you further into the enemy territory, but of course that's going
6722660	6725660	to leave you a little more vulnerable to getting splatted.
6725660	6730380	So you have to use teamwork, which is interesting because there's no voice chat, but I'm not
6730380	6732420	going to be that guy this week.
6732420	6737380	That is totally a ripoff of, what was it, Harmonics' first person shooter, they had
6737380	6738780	something exactly like that.
6738820	6743580	Well you know what though, it's still variety, I think that's a good thing, I think it's
6743580	6747620	a good thing for Splatoon to keep adding those features and more fun for the game or what
6747620	6748620	have you.
6748620	6754460	And by the way, with all that, the update to version 1.3.0, and some of the changes,
6754460	6757460	for example, when there are more members on one team than the other and the matchmaking
6757460	6762880	process takes too long, members from the same team will be able to battle each other, interesting.
6762880	6767860	Some ability adjustments to Ninja Squid, Stealth Jump, and Ink Resistance up, and yeah, so
6767860	6773820	lots of little things here and there, so check that out.
6773820	6777700	Also in the world of Shovel Knight, Shovel Knight is coming to retail, Shovel Knight
6777700	6782740	will be released on the Wii U, the 3DS, the PlayStation 4, and the Xbox One at retail.
6782740	6787120	The date, October 13th for North America, October 16th in Europe.
6787120	6791460	You will get everything that's been released so far, and there's going to be some other
6791460	6792780	stuff as well.
6792780	6799260	The Specter Knight campaign, the King Knight's campaign, battle mode, and body swap mode,
6799260	6803940	so you can do that, which will allow you to change Shovel Knight into a lady and Shield
6803940	6808380	Knight into a dude, so you can swap genders there, so there you go, and you can swap the
6808380	6810460	rest of the cast if you want.
6810460	6814460	You also get an instruction booklet with the physical copies, so I think there's going
6814460	6819140	to be a lot of people excited there about those Shovel Knight releases, which, speaking
6819140	6824820	of these physical releases, Wii U and 3DS are apparently going to be getting something
6824820	6826620	a little bit special.
6826620	6831760	The Plague of Shadows and, no I'm sorry, those are actually, oops, sorry, misspoke, that's
6831760	6835060	already coming into the game, the Plague of Shadows and the battle mode, you can tell
6835060	6840080	I have not played either of those yet, but apparently something is going to be happening
6840080	6844860	for the Nintendo versions that's similar to the God of War content and the Sony one, or
6844860	6847220	the Battletoads and the Xbox One.
6847220	6852760	So something will be happening there on the Nintendo platforms, but we don't know exactly
6852760	6854600	what it is.
6854600	6856920	Could it be a battle with Ganon?
6856920	6859780	Something where maybe you work with Mario and Luigi?
6859780	6861060	Who knows?
6861060	6862060	It's always Ganon.
6862060	6863060	Amiibo support!
6863060	6864060	Amiibo support?
6864060	6865060	Oh please?
6865060	6866060	Please, please?
6866060	6871060	Dire Sakura, what do you have for us?
6871060	6873980	Well, how many people really like Star Wars?
6873980	6875420	A bunch.
6875420	6881960	So Star Wars Battle, I'm sorry I'm still full of the delicious kettle corn, thanks Rob.
6881960	6887540	Star Wars Battlefront is not going to be doing space battles, there are no space maps, but
6887540	6896700	now also there will not be infantry battles, and there will not, at least on a map that
6896700	6898660	is based on the Death Star.
6898660	6903220	So there's not going to be basically a Death Star map, but they said stay tuned for more
6903220	6906940	details, so whatever, there's no Death Star, I'm not interested.
6906940	6913020	This is looking less and less like Battlefront.
6913020	6921980	And then Tekken, woo hoo Tekken, and you know what makes me happy, Kuma!
6921980	6931940	Basically Tekken 7 has already been doing some teasers, and there have been, I'd probably
6931980	6938540	say a few more different interesting things, but now there was, said that there's going
6938540	6946500	to be a major announcement on July 7th, and I wish, I hope that it's gone.
6946500	6951580	As in the character, gone, because.
6951580	6952700	Because dinosaurs.
6952700	6953700	Because dinosaurs.
6953740	6962460	Well, and also that, and you might, there's been an allusion to Jack coming back as Jack
6962460	6964980	7, so that's kind of cool.
6964980	6965980	Anything's better than P-Jack.
6965980	6972940	Alright, we'll see what becomes of this big Tekken tease soon.
6972940	6977100	In the meantime, we're going to go to our Facebook and Google Plus communities, because
6977100	6980100	you smoosh those words together and you get foogle.
6983700	6991540	It is time for the Foogle Question of the Week, where we ask our fan communities a question
6991540	6993980	and mull over some of your answers.
6993980	6998940	This week we asked about the Red Ash Kickstarter, and we said, you know, Comcept is of course
6998940	7004020	behind the previously successful Mighty No. 9 Kickstarter, and you'll see its legend,
7004020	7007380	so Mega Man legend, wink wink, nudge nudge.
7007380	7008380	What do you think about this Kickstarter?
7008380	7013180	Are you excited, or do you have concerns when Mighty No. 9 has yet to hit shelves?
7013180	7021100	Let's see what y'all thought over on Facebook, where Silent Tom said, I understand developers
7021100	7024460	should always be striving for the next big thing, but I feel they may have jumped the
7024460	7031020	gun on this, not even seeing how the public responded to Mighty No. 9, seems a bit strange.
7031020	7034820	Raginator says, I have no opinion, I never played the Mega Man Legends games, so I have
7034820	7038700	no emotional ties to the series, plus I never Kickstarted anything, and I have no interest
7038700	7040500	to do so now.
7040500	7044620	Andy R. said, the game itself doesn't interest me much, so I think I'll pass, I've generally
7044620	7048500	adopted a wait and see approach to Kickstarter, so if the game ends up coming out and is good,
7048500	7049900	I'll pick it up then.
7049900	7054820	Tech 2030 said, not too hype on Mega Man, so not too interested in this, only Mega Man
7054820	7059660	related remake and successor I'm interested in is the Battle Network series.
7059660	7063540	Interesting, so I don't know if we just didn't hear from enough people this week or what,
7063540	7069060	but Facebook seems pretty, uh, not into it, not feeling it.
7069620	7072660	Interesting, that was a very small sampling than what we usually get though, so we'll
7072660	7075860	see, but let's, let's, let's see if the same was on Google Plus.
7075860	7081500	Over on Google Plus, we had ActDeft who said, I think this is not the first time something
7081500	7085300	like this has happened, granted this is a AAA title and people are still gonna be mad
7085300	7089500	after they fix and re-release the game, but if the game, I'm sorry, that is from last
7089500	7093100	week, what the hell am I doing, I'm starting to read that, I'm like, wait a minute, this
7093100	7098620	is about fixing the game, hold up, sorry, when I went into my notifications on Google
7098620	7103420	Plus, it showed me that post at the top, did nobody answer on Google Plus this week?
7103420	7104540	What's going on?
7104540	7110500	No, we had one answer this week from Redertainment on Google Plus, who said, I have a problem
7110500	7116540	with entities using Kickstarter for multiple projects, shouldn't the success of one project
7116540	7119260	be used to fund other projects?
7119260	7126180	Hmm, so that's a pretty big no, again, that's a smaller sampling than we usually get on
7126180	7129180	the FOOGLE question, I don't know if Facebook just didn't decide to show it to people this
7129180	7136820	week or what, but I'm not feeling it on this one, it seems, so I'd welcome your emails,
7136820	7140780	if you feel differently on this, participate at orangelandrado.com, I think we already
7140780	7146660	discussed that here at length here in studio, so I don't know if we want to revisit it.
7146660	7153020	With that particular comment though, the success of one project, the game is not even out yet,
7153020	7160220	so we're thinking cost of development plus profit hasn't really gone into retail production
7160220	7164220	yet and actually sold some stuff, so they would still need money to fund the development
7164220	7171300	of another game, at least until, this is a fairly new concept for people, or concept
7171300	7177780	I suppose, but still and all, my answer though is not necessarily.
7177780	7185940	Alright, let's move on, and we're going to get to some more news, so that was it for
7185940	7188980	the FOOGLE question of the week, so Loki, what do you have for us?
7188980	7197120	So Mad Catz, they are having some debt problems, and they are basically securing some extra
7197120	7204860	credit or further credit line to allow them to release Rock Band 4, and it's basically
7204860	7213340	going to be, you know, whether they end up defaulting on their debt, it's all depending
7213340	7218260	on how well Rock Band 4 does, which hopefully they'll do well.
7218260	7221480	Hear that, buy Rock Band 4, do it now.
7221480	7225460	Buy Rock Band 4 or you're going to drive this company bankrupt, that's what happened.
7225460	7229060	Mad Catz isn't really, I mean they're mostly peripherals, they tried kind of getting into
7229060	7233500	game development a little bit, and I mean, I guess they are publishing Rock Band 4, but
7233500	7238740	aside from that, I mean they haven't really done a whole ton, so I don't know, and a lot
7238740	7244220	of their bread and butter was those Rock Band peripherals, and it's been a while, so I don't
7244220	7245220	know.
7245220	7247020	Buy extra copies of Rock Band 4.
7247020	7251380	Buy copies for your friends and family members and so forth.
7251380	7255700	Alright, let's get into one more story here before we get to Match Game tonight about
7255700	7257260	Dragon Quest.
7257260	7260660	I'm sure y'all are excited, Drew, you've got to be a Dragon Quest fan, if you like your
7260660	7261660	JRPGs, right?
7261660	7262660	Oh yeah.
7262820	7267420	How much did it piss you off that they did Dragon Quest 7 and 8 versions on the 3DS and
7267420	7270260	they were like, nah, we're not going to release them in America, they're not coming out.
7270260	7271260	I loved 8.
7271260	7272900	I know, 8 was great.
7272900	7274740	Cor, blimey, I loved 8.
7274740	7281060	Anyhow, hey, there is hope, apparently these games may be heading west at some point.
7281060	7287340	This is in speaking at the Japan Expo in Paris, the creator apparently made a little slip
7287340	7292300	up about the games possibly coming out, so getting a little bit localized there, so some
7292340	7298380	tweets talking about 3DS for Dragon Quest 7 and 8 getting localized, I guess the translator
7298380	7303700	got upset when that was announced, so hmm, does look promising, although surprisingly
7303700	7306980	they wouldn't have said anything about that at E3, because that would have made a great
7306980	7308700	little holiday thing.
7308700	7314340	ActDeft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, I want Theatrhythm Dragon Quest in
7314340	7316500	America now.
7316500	7318060	Yes please.
7318060	7325420	All right, well folks, I think it is time to do some matching, and we're going to bring
7325420	7330780	up a segment that we haven't done in a very long time, it's time to play Video Game Match
7330780	7335620	Game.
7335620	7339940	I do this just to play that song, because I love this, the porny match game thing is
7339940	7341460	the best thing ever.
7341460	7346220	All right, so in order to play the game, we're going to need some contestants, so I'm going
7346220	7357980	to say in chat here, if you want to play match game in chat, say, pick me for match
7357980	7359460	game now.
7359460	7363580	Okay, so we're going to find a chatter there in the chatroom to play match game, and then
7363580	7367620	we're going to open up the Skype line here in just a moment for a contestant as well,
7367620	7371780	1877 Game O.L.R., username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, so instead of Team Cat and Team
7371780	7374620	Dog, we have Team Skype and Team Chatter.
7374620	7379900	So if you forgot how match game works, this is how it works, is that we're going to read
7379900	7385440	some phrases, and in those phrases, there will be a blank, and your job as the contestant
7385440	7389380	is to match your hosts here in studio.
7389380	7394300	Now joining us in match game tonight are myself, Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura, who's playing for
7394300	7404100	the Taco Foundation, Loki, who's playing for the Let's Lower the Time It Takes Burger King
7404100	7416100	to Make a Very Simple Order Foundation, Drew, who's playing for the AARP this week because
7416100	7419100	he's 30.
7419100	7424220	And of course, joining us in studio, playing to feed his addiction to Final Fantasy Record
7424220	7430380	Keeper is Alan, Alan is going to be joining us as well, so you have five people here in
7430380	7431960	studio that you can play with.
7431960	7437040	So if you want to call and be a participant on match game, call us now, 1877 Game O.L.R.,
7437040	7439420	our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7439420	7443180	Now somebody needs to put their neck out there and do this because this is going to be very
7443180	7446420	embarrassing if I don't get any stinking contestants for the game tonight.
7446420	7451020	So if you want to be a contestant on Skype, 1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange
7451020	7454080	Lounge Radio, call us right now.
7454080	7458600	Fair warning to people who have not played O.L.R. match game before, this does sometimes
7458600	7461480	devolve into cards against Orange Lounge Radio.
7461480	7462480	Yes, a little bit.
7462480	7463480	Be prepared.
7463480	7464480	Be prepared.
7464480	7465480	Be very prepared.
7465480	7469200	So there's a little bit of a buffer between the time, I should have said that at the start
7469200	7473920	that somebody should call us, there's going to be a little bit of a buffer between when
7473920	7476840	the message gets out there and when we'll actually start getting calls.
7476840	7483960	So again, if you want to play match game, 1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange
7483960	7486020	Lounge Radio.
7486020	7491300	No act deaf, nobody's called yet, so if you want a guaranteed you can get in, you can
7491300	7493820	do that.
7493820	7495660	Are people upset that we're bringing back match game?
7495660	7499260	When we used to do this, it would be like 20 people all calling at once.
7499260	7500260	Just do it.
7500260	7502060	Don't let your dreams be dreams.
7502060	7504840	Just do it.
7504840	7506260	Is that the Shia LaBeouf thing?
7506260	7507260	It is.
7507260	7508260	I thought it was.
7508260	7509660	I didn't know what that was all about.
7509660	7510660	Oh, thank God.
7510660	7511660	We have a call coming in.
7511660	7512660	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7512660	7513660	Who's this?
7514300	7516500	This is Brad from Pod Culture.
7516500	7518260	Brad from Pod Culture?
7518260	7519900	You here to play the match game?
7519900	7520900	Hi, Brad.
7520900	7525740	Hey, well, I'm just forget I've never done one of your damn games with y'all before,
7525740	7526740	so why the hell not?
7526740	7528020	Why the hell not?
7528020	7529740	I am with you there.
7529740	7532420	All right, so let's see.
7532420	7536380	We don't have a lot of people in chat that really want to play this week, so.
7536380	7537540	The hell with all of you.
7537540	7539540	The hell with all of you.
7539540	7540540	So let's see.
7540540	7541540	I'm going to narrow it down.
7541540	7543300	All right, heads or tails?
7543300	7544300	Heads or tails?
7544300	7545300	Cats or dogs?
7545300	7546300	Tails.
7546300	7547300	Tails.
7547300	7550700	All right, you're going to be playing against Zappi tonight.
7550700	7557020	Zappi is going to be your opponent here, so I'm going to make sure send your answers to
7557020	7558020	me.
7558020	7559020	Congrats.
7559020	7562460	You are playing against Brad.
7562460	7563780	Poor Act Deaf got shut out.
7563780	7564780	You beat him.
7564780	7568260	You just beat him by a moment on the phone lines, and there you go.
7568260	7570120	And then Zappi beat him there in the chat room.
7570120	7572240	So it's going to be Zappi versus Brad tonight.
7572240	7574400	All right, finally, we can do this.
7574400	7576160	All right, Brad, you comfortable with the rules?
7576160	7577160	You know how this works?
7577160	7580160	You're going to read a sentence, and there's going to be a blank?
7580160	7581160	Yeah.
7581160	7582200	All right.
7582200	7584800	Now give us a little bit of time.
7584800	7586560	Don't just shout out your answer, Brad.
7586560	7589200	We have to tell you we're ready for your answer.
7589200	7590240	So listen carefully.
7590240	7591240	Here it is.
7591240	7592240	Okay.
7592240	7593240	All right.
7593240	7594240	Question.
7594240	7597280	And then Zappi, you're going to say yours in a private message to me in the chat.
7597280	7603360	So if you guys want to help them out, you can leave your responses over at live.vognetwork.com.
7603360	7605080	All right.
7605080	7606880	So here we go.
7606880	7609500	Question number one.
7609500	7617840	In a dark boardroom in Japan somewhere, executives were astounded at the success of Kickstarters
7617840	7623000	for projects like Bloodstained and Mighty No. 9.
7623000	7625760	That's it, a boardroom executive spoke up.
7625760	7632720	The only way we're going to save this company is for our company, Konami, to run a Kickstarter
7632720	7638720	for blank.
7638720	7640040	Exploding president cat.
7640040	7641040	Hold on.
7641040	7643480	Don't answer until I say we're ready for an answer.
7643480	7647080	What did I just say?
7647080	7649320	Maybe this is why we have to rethink your answer.
7649320	7650320	Yeah.
7650320	7651320	Now you have to come up with a new answer.
7651320	7652320	All right.
7652320	7653320	I'm going to...
7653320	7654320	Wait.
7654320	7655320	I was...
7655880	7658000	So let me read that one more time.
7658000	7664060	The only way we're going to save this company, Konami, is to run a Kickstarter for blank.
7664060	7665060	So who's in?
7665060	7666060	Ding.
7666060	7667060	Ding.
7667060	7668060	Ding.
7668060	7669060	Ding.
7669060	7670060	Ding.
7670060	7671060	Ding.
7671060	7672060	Ding.
7672060	7673060	Ding.
7673060	7674060	Ding.
7674060	7675060	Ding.
7675060	7676060	Ding.
7676060	7677060	Ding.
7677060	7678060	Ding.
7678060	7679060	Ding.
7679060	7680060	Ding.
7680060	7681060	Ding.
7681060	7682060	Ding.
7682060	7683060	Ding.
7683060	7684060	Ding.
7684060	7685060	Ding.
7685800	7686800	All right.
7686800	7687800	Ding.
7687800	7688800	I went with a serious answer.
7688800	7689800	I didn't have time to be funny.
7689800	7690800	I'm still waiting on Zappi.
7690800	7693620	Zappi, you got to send me your answer here.
7693620	7694620	Waiting on Zappi.
7694620	7695620	Need.
7695620	7696620	Zappi!
7696620	7706820	In a dark boardroom in Japan, executives were astounded at the success of Kickstarters for
7706820	7709320	projects like Bloodstained and Mighty No. 9.
7709320	7710320	That's it.
7710320	7711660	A boardroom executive spoke up.
7711660	7714980	The only way we're going to save this company is for our company, Konami, to run a Kickstarter
7714980	7715980	for blank.
7715980	7716980	All right.
7716980	7717980	Zappi's got an answer in.
7717980	7718980	So Brad, here it is.
7718980	7722700	The only way we're going to save this company is for our company, Konami, to run a Kickstarter
7722700	7725700	for?
7725700	7727180	Exploding President Kat.
7727180	7728500	Exploding President Kat.
7728500	7730220	That's his story and he's sticking to it.
7730220	7731220	All right.
7731220	7734260	Zappi says, okay, I'll say Guitar Freaks.
7734260	7735260	All right.
7735260	7736260	Zappi says Guitar Freaks.
7736260	7737260	Let's see.
7737260	7738260	All right.
7738260	7739620	So we've got Guitar Freaks and Exploding President Kat.
7739620	7741900	Let's see if we get any matches here in studio.
7741900	7743600	Loki, what's your answer?
7743600	7751000	My answer is they're going to have to kickstart Thomas Howard's Girl's Butts, a next gen sequel
7751000	7752000	to Rumble Roses.
7752000	7753000	Girl's Butts.
7753000	7754000	Look at that.
7754000	7755000	Girl's Butts.
7755000	7758080	The next gen sequel to Rumble Roses.
7758080	7759080	Not a match.
7759080	7760080	I like that.
7760080	7761080	You invoked Rumble Roses.
7761080	7762080	All right.
7762080	7763080	I'll go next.
7763080	7764340	My answer is, I went serious.
7764340	7768320	I said Suicoden 6 because that's the only way it's going to happen.
7768320	7770840	And somewhere out there, Shane's heart is breaking.
7770840	7771840	Sorry, Shane.
7771840	7772840	All right.
7773080	7774360	Alan, you're up next.
7774360	7779600	The only way we can save this company is to run a Kickstarter for Super Pachinko.
7779600	7782440	Super Pachinko.
7782440	7783440	Not a match.
7783440	7784440	Oh, look at the score.
7784440	7785440	Zero to zero.
7785440	7786440	All right, Drew.
7786440	7787480	Let's see if we get a match with you.
7787480	7791560	The only way we can save this company is to do a Kickstarter for Hookers and Blow for
7791560	7792560	Kojima.
7792560	7794120	Hookers and Blow for Kojima.
7794120	7799300	You got to win that son of a bitch back with Hookers and Blow.
7799300	7800300	Not a match.
7800300	7801300	But a good...
7801300	7802300	That was a good...
7802840	7803840	You're back in.
7803840	7805460	Your 30s are your prime, Drew.
7805460	7806460	All right.
7806460	7807460	Last but not least.
7807460	7808460	Ladies last.
7808460	7809740	You're in O.L.R.
7809740	7811540	Dark Sakura.
7811540	7814420	The only way is to do a Kickstarter for...
7814420	7815420	Silent Hills.
7815420	7817420	Silent Hills.
7817420	7819460	Oh, look.
7819460	7822700	If you'd gone with Fifth Dream's answer, you would have matched.
7822700	7823700	There it is.
7823700	7824700	Silent Hills.
7824700	7825960	Fifth Dream gets a point, but he's not playing.
7825960	7827460	So there it is.
7827460	7830940	Zero to zero is the score.
7830940	7831940	Brad, I'm sorry.
7832100	7833100	He's still not on the board.
7833100	7834100	Zappy, I'm sorry.
7834100	7837100	But you still have three more chances.
7837100	7839140	So here we go with question number two.
7839140	7842580	Now this time, Brad, don't blurt it out until I ask, okay?
7844580	7845580	Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
7845580	7848580	Well, hell, I'll take a shot while you're talking.
7848580	7849580	Okay.
7849580	7850580	Oh, he's taking shots.
7850580	7853580	He had a mouthful of fireballs.
7853580	7854580	What was that?
7854580	7856380	He had a mouthful of fireballs.
7856380	7857580	That's actually accurate.
7857580	7858580	I'm sure that is...
7858580	7861580	Absolutely what I was drinking.
7862220	7863220	Yes, what he's drinking.
7863220	7864220	I love it.
7864220	7865220	All right.
7865220	7866220	Here we go.
7866220	7867220	Question number two.
7867220	7876740	Flash forward, E3 2016, the NX is revealed by Nintendo on stage at E3.
7876740	7877740	They're back on stage.
7877740	7878980	Just roll with me here.
7878980	7884460	Reggie speaks up and says, we really listen to the fans out there this time.
7884500	7893500	And so I'm pleased to announce that the Nintendo NX will be the industry leader in blank.
7893500	7894500	Ding.
7894500	7895500	Ding.
7903500	7904500	Ding.
7904500	7905500	Ding for me as well.
7905500	7906500	Loki, did you ding?
7906500	7907500	Oh, yes.
7907500	7908500	I ding.
7908500	7912500	So once again, we're waiting on Zappi.
7912500	7913500	Oh, there it is.
7913540	7914540	He got his answer in.
7914540	7915540	Wow.
7915540	7916540	That's how it's...
7916540	7917540	Okay.
7917540	7918540	We're just a little rusty in round one.
7918540	7919540	We're getting...
7919540	7921540	This is how LR got their groove back.
7921540	7922540	All right.
7922540	7923540	Here it is.
7923540	7924540	Well, let's see.
7924540	7925540	I hope so.
7925540	7926540	Let's see.
7926540	7928540	We really listen to the fans out there.
7928540	7930620	Nintendo listened to the fans, Brad.
7930620	7938540	And so I'm pleased to announce that the Nintendo NX will be the industry leader in...
7938540	7939540	Cybernetic implants.
7939540	7941540	Screw the controllers.
7941580	7943580	Cybernetic implants.
7943580	7945580	Screw the controllers.
7945580	7947580	It's the $6 million system right there.
7947580	7948580	Cybernetic...
7948580	7950580	That's where Jamie Summers got her name after all.
7950580	7951580	True facts.
7951580	7952580	Cybernetic implants.
7952580	7959580	Zappi said, I'm pleased to announce that the Nintendo NX will be the industry leader in...
7959580	7960580	Tingle.
7960580	7961580	There it is.
7961580	7962580	The answer from Zappi.
7962580	7963580	Tingle.
7963580	7964580	All right.
7964580	7969580	Let's go around the studio and let's see some of the random comments from chat.
7969620	7971620	HalfLife 3 said, Black Wolf.
7971620	7973620	Naked Samus said, Fifth Dream.
7973620	7975620	Ridge Racer said, Akuma JP.
7975620	7977620	Amiibo said, Act Deft.
7977620	7979620	Old Ass Games said, Fifth Dream.
7979620	7980620	Let's see.
7980620	7981620	Let's see how folks did.
7981620	7985620	How come only two of you wanted to play and then you're all participating in chat?
7985620	7987620	I think you're just...
7987620	7991620	Shane just texted me and Shane never goes there.
7991620	7994620	But he just texted me, Vibrators.
7995620	7997620	Are we going to see another Rez release?
7997660	7998660	All right.
7998660	7999660	Let's see.
7999660	8000660	Let's see.
8000660	8001660	Let's go around the room.
8001660	8002660	The industry leader in...
8002660	8003660	Loki?
8003660	8004660	Teledildonics.
8004660	8005660	Teledildonics.
8005660	8013660	So I think that's kind of maybe a half a point for Brad because he did say cybernetic implant
8013660	8016660	and, you know, fuck the controllers.
8016660	8017660	Let's go to the judges.
8017660	8018660	Fuck the controllers.
8018660	8019660	I'll give it.
8019660	8020660	Nah.
8020660	8021660	I'm saying no.
8021660	8023660	Yeah, but you've been outvoted by three other people.
8023660	8025660	No, because Alan's given the X to.
8025700	8026700	Alan's given the X to.
8026700	8027700	Yeah, but three versus two.
8027700	8028700	All right.
8028700	8029700	All right.
8029700	8030700	Three to two decision.
8030700	8033700	We're going to give Brad half point on that one.
8033700	8034700	Congrats, Brad.
8034700	8036700	All right.
8036700	8042700	My answer, the industry leader in holodeck porn.
8042700	8043700	Come on, people.
8043700	8045700	It's always one step closer to the holodeck porn.
8045700	8048700	One step closer to the holodeck porn.
8048700	8051700	All right, Alan, let's see if we get a match.
8051700	8052700	The industry leader in...
8052700	8054700	Fanboy Tears.
8054740	8057740	Not a match, unfortunately.
8057740	8059740	Drew, the Nintendo NX.
8059740	8061740	The industry leader in...
8061740	8062740	Microtransactions.
8062740	8064740	Microtransactions.
8064740	8067740	Jamie's favorite word in the English language.
8067740	8069740	The salt must flow.
8069740	8070740	Not a match.
8070740	8071740	Not a match.
8071740	8075740	It's still half to zero because we deal fractions here.
8075740	8078740	Last but certainly not least, or she'd kick my butt.
8078740	8081740	Dark Sakura, the industry leader in...
8081780	8082780	Silent Hills.
8082780	8083780	Silent Hills.
8083780	8085780	Also, not a match.
8085780	8087780	Well, it is big and it is rather black.
8087780	8088780	All right.
8088780	8089780	There it is.
8089780	8090780	Zappi.
8090780	8093780	Sadly, not a match, Zappi.
8093780	8095780	But you know what, Zappi?
8095780	8098780	Brad's only got a half point.
8098780	8102780	So you could still tie it up or even exceed.
8102780	8104780	It's not hard to get one full point.
8104780	8106780	It's not hard to get one full point.
8106780	8108780	It's not hard to get one full point.
8108820	8110820	Tie it up or even exceed.
8110820	8112820	It's not hard to get one full point.
8112820	8114820	You just have to match something a little closer than Brad did.
8114820	8115820	All right.
8115820	8116820	Let's get to it.
8116820	8117820	Round three.
8117820	8119820	There's only four rounds you guys have to endure.
8119820	8120820	Three.
8120820	8121820	Here it is.
8121820	8122820	Round three.
8122820	8127820	Did you hear about the Super Nintendo PlayStation that was
8127820	8131820	dug out of someone's garbage and posted on Reddit?
8131820	8136820	Little did you know that not only was that system found,
8136820	8141820	but that cartridge contains an ultra rare copy of the Sony
8141820	8146820	created CD-ROM game Super Mario Blank.
8148820	8149820	Ding.
8149820	8150820	Ding.
8150820	8151820	Ding.
8151820	8152820	Ding.
8152820	8157820	Ding.
8157820	8158820	Let's see.
8158820	8160820	One more time.
8160820	8165820	Did you hear about the Super Nintendo PlayStation that was
8165820	8167820	dug out of someone's garbage?
8167820	8169820	Little did you know not only was the system found,
8169820	8172820	but the cartridge contains an ultra rare copy of the Sony
8172820	8177820	created CD-ROM game Super Mario Blank.
8177820	8178820	Zappie's a ding.
8178820	8179820	Brad's a ding.
8179820	8180820	I think we've got dings.
8180820	8181820	Anyone need a dong?
8181820	8182820	All right.
8182820	8184820	Who dinged?
8184820	8185820	Here we go.
8185820	8190820	Brad, an ultra rare copy of the Sony created CD-ROM game
8190820	8193820	Super Mario.
8194820	8196820	Naked oil wrestling.
8196820	8199820	Naked oil wrestling.
8199820	8201820	Someone's into the Turkish wrestling here.
8201820	8203820	Just like the Turkish wrestler in Super...
8203820	8205820	What was that guy in Street Fighter IV?
8205820	8206820	Brad, you mean Hakan.
8206820	8207820	All right.
8207820	8208820	You mean Hakan, don't you?
8208820	8209820	There it is.
8209820	8210820	All right.
8210820	8212820	Well, surely Zappie has a more family friendly answer.
8212820	8216820	Zappie said an ultra rare copy of the Sony created CD-ROM game
8216820	8218820	Super Mario Porn.
8218820	8222820	He just said porn, which is a safe bet here at OLR.
8222820	8224820	When in doubt, just say porn.
8224820	8225820	So there it is.
8225820	8226820	Super Mario Porn.
8226820	8228820	Some comments from our chat room.
8228820	8229820	Let's see.
8229820	8232820	SSJ100Matt says, Super Mario Miss World 96.
8232820	8235820	Black Wolf says, Super Mario Silent Hills.
8235820	8238820	Act Def says, Super Mario Crash Spiral.
8238820	8241820	Dungeon Buster says, Super Mario Uncharted.
8241820	8243820	Orange Right says, Super Mario Orgy.
8243820	8246820	Dungeon Buster says, Super Mario Kill Zone.
8246820	8248820	Zappie said, I was tempted to say hills.
8248820	8249820	So let's see what happens.
8249820	8252820	Super Mario blank.
8252820	8253820	All right.
8253820	8255820	Let's go around the room and see if we've got a match.
8255820	8258820	So we got Turkish oil wrestling and porn.
8258820	8262820	Loki, the unreleased game Super Mario.
8262820	8263820	Bandicoot.
8263820	8264820	Super Mario Bandicoot.
8264820	8266820	It's going for a safe answer.
8266820	8267820	And there it is.
8267820	8268820	All right.
8268820	8269820	All right.
8269820	8270820	Super Mario Bandicoot.
8270820	8272820	Not a match.
8272820	8276820	My answer, an ultra rare copy of the Sony created CD-ROM game
8277820	8280820	Super Mario Cross Night Trap.
8280820	8282820	Because it's a CD-ROM game.
8282820	8283820	Come on.
8283820	8285820	Fuck all of you.
8285820	8286820	Come on.
8286820	8288820	Luigi can investigate a haunted mansion.
8288820	8290820	He can certainly investigate a panty party.
8290820	8291820	Come on, people.
8291820	8292820	Super Mario.
8292820	8293820	That would be a more interesting game.
8293820	8294820	It's a Dana Plato.
8294820	8295820	Exactly.
8295820	8296820	Come on.
8296820	8298820	Who would not play Super Mario Cross Night Trap?
8298820	8299820	All right.
8299820	8300820	Alan.
8300820	8302820	You have to be a zombie now.
8302820	8303820	Alan.
8303820	8305820	Super Mario Cross.
8305820	8307820	Sorry, Super Mario what?
8307820	8308820	Arena Toshinden.
8308820	8310820	Arena Toshinden.
8310820	8315820	A good answer for Sony, but not a match with either of our listeners tonight.
8315820	8317820	It's still half a point to no point.
8317820	8318820	Drew.
8318820	8320820	Super Mario.
8320820	8322820	Featuring Jumping Flash.
8322820	8323820	Featuring Jumping Flash.
8323820	8324820	Who would play the fuck out of that?
8324820	8326820	I would play the fuck out of that too.
8326820	8327820	Good answer.
8327820	8328820	Not a match.
8328820	8331820	Last but not least, Dark Sakura Super Mario.
8331820	8332820	Silent Hills.
8332820	8333820	Silent Hills.
8334820	8337820	You knew it was coming to this point, ladies and gentlemen.
8337820	8340820	I'm surprised that nobody thought I would go there.
8340820	8344820	Some of the chat, Zappy said in chat, I almost said Silent Hills.
8344820	8345820	Well, you lose.
8345820	8346820	You lose.
8346820	8351820	You could have been a half a point ahead of Brad, but no.
8351820	8352820	All right.
8352820	8354820	We had to be unique.
8354820	8355820	We had to be special snowflakes.
8355820	8356820	Here it is, guys.
8356820	8362820	It's the final round, but there's a twist because you notice I've been bringing these old OLR games back.
8362820	8364820	I've been putting a twist.
8364820	8366820	So here's the twist for question four.
8366820	8369820	There's two blanks.
8369820	8371820	This is the wedgie of match game.
8371820	8372820	That's right.
8372820	8374820	There's two blanks in this one.
8374820	8378820	So you have the opportunity to earn two points.
8378820	8384820	This, I mean, if Zappy matches even one person, he could just fuck Brad's game right up.
8384820	8387820	Or Brad could just move this into the stratosphere.
8387820	8388820	So here it is.
8388820	8390820	Two blanks on this last question.
8391820	8393820	Question number four.
8393820	8398820	The last question as I scroll it off my screen.
8398820	8399820	Here we go.
8399820	8400820	Question number four.
8400820	8411820	The first ever Nintendo Splatoon Splatfest was extremely successful as people battled for Team Cat and Team Dog everywhere.
8411820	8414820	It was such a success with kids and teens everywhere.
8414820	8426820	However, in an attempt to win more adults over to Splatoon, Nintendo announced that the next Splatfest will be Team Blank versus Team Blank.
8432820	8443820	In an effort to win more adults over to Splatoon, Nintendo announced that the next Splatfest will be Team Blank versus Team Blank.
8443820	8445820	I'm going to that special hell.
8454820	8455820	All right.
8455820	8457820	I'm going to ding there.
8457820	8458820	Oh, my God.
8458820	8459820	You people in chat are nasty.
8459820	8460820	I can't read this on air.
8460820	8461820	I cannot read this on air.
8461820	8463820	You can't, so.
8463820	8464820	All right.
8464820	8465820	Because we're about to.
8465820	8466820	I'm still waiting on Zappy's answer.
8466820	8467820	Is everybody ding?
8467820	8468820	Yeah, I think so.
8468820	8469820	Does anybody need a dong?
8469820	8471820	Does anyone give a dang?
8471820	8472820	coding.
8472820	8473820	All right.
8473820	8475820	I'm still I'm just waiting on Zappy.
8475820	8476820	But no dong.
8476820	8477820	No dung.
8477820	8478820	Dung is not allowed.
8478820	8481820	All right.
8481820	8482820	All right.
8482820	8483820	Hurry up, Zappy.
8483820	8484820	If you hear my voice.
8484820	8488820	Do it.
8488820	8489820	You better get that locked in.
8489820	8490820	All right.
8490820	8492820	He's locked in his answer.
8492820	8494820	Let's do this.
8494820	8497820	The first ever Nintendo Splatoon Splatfest was successful.
8498820	8502820	But in an attempt to win more adults over, Nintendo announced that the next Splatfest
8502820	8506820	will be Team what, Brad?
8506820	8512820	Team Pyramid Head versus Team Peach.
8512820	8515820	Team Pyramid Head versus Team Peach.
8515820	8516820	Okay.
8516820	8517820	I see what he's doing there.
8517820	8519820	He's trying to do the Silent Hill angle there on that answer, isn't he?
8519820	8520820	All right.
8520820	8521820	Let's see if that works for him.
8521820	8528820	Well, Zappy in chat said it will be Team Silent versus Team Hills.
8528820	8529820	He's not.
8529820	8531820	He's not going to let that go this time.
8531820	8533820	Oh, we're just doubling down on this now, aren't we?
8533820	8534820	He's doubling down.
8534820	8537820	He's doubling down to see if that inside joke comes back.
8537820	8538820	All right.
8538820	8542820	Zappy in chat said porn didn't work for me, so I decided against it this time.
8542820	8544820	Some other chat answers.
8544820	8547820	Act F said Republicans versus Democrats.
8547820	8550820	Black Wolf said Silent versus Hills.
8550820	8554820	SS Dream said Bukake versus Cat.
8554820	8555820	Wow.
8555820	8557820	Tiger Claw said Penis versus Vagina.
8557820	8560820	SSJ100Matt said Missionary versus Doggy.
8560820	8563820	And Black Wolf said Ding versus Dong.
8563820	8568820	All right.
8568820	8571820	The next Splatoon Splatfest will be...
8571820	8574820	I don't even see the damn chat.
8574820	8576820	Loki, Team...
8576820	8578820	Team Squid versus Team Kid.
8578820	8583820	Team Squid versus Team Kid, which is what everybody actually thinks it should be.
8583820	8588820	So a very logical answer, not a match.
8588820	8590820	My answer, Team...
8590820	8594820	And by the way, y'all, I went for the old OLR inside joke.
8594820	8597820	There's going to be two of you out here who understand this.
8597820	8603820	Team Cylon Occupied Caprica versus Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.
8603820	8604820	Boo this man.
8604820	8606820	That's my answer.
8606820	8608820	All right.
8608820	8611820	I would have accepted Cylons versus Humans, though.
8611820	8612820	Come on, let's be real.
8612820	8613820	All right, Alan.
8613820	8616820	Splatoon Splatfest will be Team...
8616820	8619820	Act F really needed to think more about the Splatoon angle,
8619820	8628820	but my answer is Team Bukake versus Team Cream Pies.
8628820	8631820	And it's all white ink.
8631820	8632820	That's it.
8632820	8633820	Show's canceled.
8633820	8634820	We're done.
8634820	8635820	Too hot for any of you.
8635820	8636820	Shut her down.
8636820	8639820	Banned in Australia.
8639820	8651820	We're earning that explicit tag today.
8651820	8653820	Because it's Splatoon, everybody.
8653820	8654820	Get it?
8654820	8655820	That's why it's funny.
8655820	8656820	Because the game is called Splatoon.
8656820	8658820	He was lucky I wasn't taking the shot.
8658820	8660820	All right, you're out of liquor at this point, Brad.
8660820	8661820	Don't try to fool me.
8661820	8662820	Rob, here's the problem with that.
8662820	8663820	All the ink would only be one color.
8664820	8666820	All right.
8666820	8669820	Not if you get enough Vitamin C in your diet.
8669820	8671820	Drew.
8671820	8673820	Team...
8673820	8675820	If we're going to go for the adult demographic,
8675820	8678820	the age-old debate of Team Tits versus Team Ass.
8678820	8682820	Team Tits versus Team Ass.
8682820	8683820	Tits and Ass.
8683820	8684820	There it is.
8684820	8685820	All right.
8685820	8688820	Last but not least, DarkSakura.
8688820	8689820	What did she pick?
8689820	8690820	Team...
8690820	8692820	Alan Wake.
8693820	8696820	Versus...
8696820	8698820	D.
8698820	8699820	Versus D?
8699820	8700820	D.
8700820	8701820	D?
8701820	8704820	Survival Horror.
8704820	8710820	So DarkSakura just screwed Zappi over by flipping the script
8710820	8712820	and saying Team...
8712820	8713820	What the hell did she say again?
8713820	8714820	Alan Wake.
8714820	8716820	Team Alan Wake versus Team D.
8716820	8721820	D, which was the Saturn Survival Horror psychological.
8721820	8724820	So I picked psychological horror games that were like Silent Hill.
8724820	8727820	So you're doing Team Games That Will Never Be On The Wii U
8727820	8729820	and Team Games That Will Never Be On The Wii U.
8729820	8732820	Act F, you trusted Jamie to follow the script on this one?
8732820	8733820	You fool!
8733820	8734820	All right.
8734820	8735820	Well, Zappi...
8735820	8736820	It's almost Ferret versus Propel.
8736820	8737820	I mean, God.
8737820	8739820	I knew she wasn't going to go Silent Hill on that one.
8739820	8740820	I know it.
8740820	8741820	All right.
8741820	8742820	There it is.
8742820	8744820	Well, Brad, your knowledge of DarkSakura's inner workings,
8744820	8748820	you won by a half point in a slim judge's decision to zero.
8748820	8750820	So I got to say, Zappi,
8750820	8752820	you put in a good effort.
8752820	8754820	Everybody give Zappi a round of applause
8754820	8757820	and then promptly push him off the stage because he lost.
8757820	8758820	Bye, Zappi.
8758820	8759820	Thanks for playing, though.
8759820	8761820	Brad, you're a winner.
8761820	8763820	And for winning Match Game Tonight,
8763820	8766820	I'm going to let you plug anything you want.
8766820	8768820	And knowing that you host your own podcast,
8768820	8772820	I think I know what you might want to plug.
8772820	8777820	Oh, of course, Pod Culture, Monday nights, 9 o'clock on VOG.
8777820	8778820	There it is.
8778820	8779820	Listen to Brad, Pod Culture.
8779820	8782820	Apparently, tomorrow's a rerun, but that's all right.
8782820	8783820	Favoritism.
8783820	8784820	That's all right.
8784820	8787820	Hey, are you going to be taking any shots
8787820	8791820	on next week's episode of Pod Culture?
8791820	8795820	Um, yeah, actually, I think we are.
8795820	8796820	All right, nice.
8796820	8798820	Yeah, I think there is alcohol involved on that one.
8798820	8801820	So, Brad, though, I do have to ask you,
8801820	8803820	and I don't remember what the exact name for it is,
8803820	8805820	but Dan has discovered a cocktail
8805820	8807820	that's basically angry orchard and fireball,
8807820	8809820	and he wanted to call it angry balls.
8809820	8811820	I think that's what it's called, actually, is angry balls.
8811820	8813820	But he wanted to call it flaming orchard.
8813820	8814820	Actually, I think it is.
8814820	8817820	I think it is angry balls or fiery balls or something.
8817820	8819820	Yeah, I think it's angry balls, but...
8819820	8821820	Herpes.
8821820	8823820	Oh, my God, you all are 12.
8823820	8824820	It would be good.
8824820	8825820	It would be good.
8825820	8827820	Angry orchard is good stuff.
8827820	8829820	All right, Brad, I'm going to let you go
8829820	8831820	so we can wrap up the show.
8831820	8833820	Brad, take care, my friend.
8833820	8835820	Thanks for playing.
8836820	8837820	All right.
8837820	8839820	All right, later.
8839820	8841820	Hey, let us know what you guys thought of Match Game.
8841820	8843820	Should we bring it back in a future week,
8843820	8845820	or was that just too much of a hot mess for all you guys?
8845820	8847820	Let us know over on Twitter.
8847820	8849820	Twitter.com slash O-L-R,
8849820	8851820	so we'll see if we do Match Game again in the future.
8851820	8852820	That was fun, though.
8852820	8854820	There were some funny answers in there.
8854820	8856820	I think Alan won, though, which I knew would happen.
8856820	8858820	I knew Alan would do that.
8858820	8860820	I just need to put more subliminals in there
8860820	8862820	to get people to do this again.
8862820	8864820	All right, I'm feeling pretty good.
8864820	8865820	We'll see what the listeners think.
8865820	8867820	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
8867820	8869820	I was getting a little worried when nobody wanted to play.
8869820	8871820	I was like, what good is a game if nobody wants to play?
8871820	8873820	But then finally, the chat room got really into it.
8873820	8875820	I think just some people were shy
8875820	8877820	and didn't want to get on the phone, and I understand.
8877820	8879820	Come on, don't we remember Match Game at all, guys?
8879820	8880820	I know, I know. All right.
8880820	8882820	Don't you remember how we loved to torture you?
8882820	8883820	That's right.
8883820	8888820	Anyway, let's get back into some of the segments we do here on O-L-R.
8888820	8891820	I believe we're going to visit the mailbag this week.
8891820	8893820	Yeah, it's kind of sticky.
8893820	8895820	All right, so every week you guys send us e-mails.
8895820	8898820	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,
8898820	8900820	and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag
8900820	8904820	and picks out some e-mails that she believes are worthy of reading on the show.
8904820	8907820	And I don't have your usual music.
8907820	8908820	I don't know what happened to it.
8908820	8909820	Ooh, play Buffalo again.
8909820	8911820	I have this music.
8911820	8913820	Mail, motherfucker.
8916820	8918820	It's Grandpa's music from Hoard House.
8918820	8919820	That's what I had ready.
8919820	8922820	Well, I'm not reading all of this e-mail because it's long.
8922820	8923820	Okay, I think you should replace it.
8923820	8925820	You think I should replace it on this show?
8925820	8926820	I think you should all shut up.
8926820	8928820	Well, someone will freeze that damn mailbag already.
8928820	8930820	I don't know. You're going to need to get Grandpa's permission.
8930820	8931820	He may not have liked that.
8931820	8932820	Greetings, O-L-R.
8932820	8933820	He's going to be mad.
8933820	8936820	He's like, first you decide there's no more Hoard House,
8936820	8937820	and then you steal the fucking music.
8937820	8938820	Thanks, Rob.
8938820	8940820	Grandpa, you and I should do a show.
8940820	8942820	It should just be called Fuck.
8942820	8944820	Fuck Rob. That's what he'll want to call it.
8944820	8945820	If you do a show, you'll be like,
8945820	8947820	let's just do a show where we talk shit about Rob every week.
8947820	8948820	Okay.
8948820	8949820	I thought that was OrangeLoungeRadio.
8949820	8952820	This is from RawSteelUT, by the way.
8952820	8953820	Greetings, O-L-R.
8953820	8956820	I got a couple things on mine, so I'll just shoot them out.
8956820	8957820	Eh.
8957820	8959820	Regarding reservations, not pre-orders,
8959820	8963820	I don't really have a strong opinion one way or another,
8963820	8966820	but I've grown a bit more careful in just what I reserve.
8966820	8969820	It makes no sense to reserve something like Black Ops 3 or Halo 5
8969820	8972820	simply because I know there'll be a billion copies of them
8972820	8974820	out in stores for two or three years afterwards.
8974820	8978820	On the other hand, games that I'm not entirely sure will be that well stocked,
8978820	8981820	such as Onichambara Z2, Chaos,
8981820	8983820	you bet your ass I'm going to reserve something like that
8983820	8986820	simply to make sure I don't have to go trolling for copies on eBay.
8986820	8989820	I learned my lesson from missing out on Suikoden 2.
8989820	8991820	That's wise.
8991820	8994820	Next up, I find myself once more defending Activision
8994820	8996820	in the Call of Duty franchise.
8996820	8997820	Really?
8997820	8999820	Yes, it's an annualized franchise,
8999820	9001820	but not only do they have separate developers
9001820	9003820	to ensure the games are quality when they come out
9003820	9005820	instead of having the entire company rush the game
9005820	9007820	out like Ubisoft with Assassin's Creed,
9007820	9010820	and they have a clear and steady schedule for their map packs,
9010820	9013820	making them one of the few companies that are clear and obvious
9013820	9015820	and don't mis-schedule or sacrifice quality
9015820	9018820	to make the schedule hide their EA.
9018820	9020820	Just want to jump in real quick.
9020820	9023820	Doesn't Ubisoft use different in-house studios, though?
9023820	9026820	Doesn't one of the Assassin's Creed comes out of Montreal,
9026820	9028820	one of the other ones comes out of, I want to say,
9028820	9030820	somewhere else in Europe or maybe Vancouver?
9030820	9032820	Sorry, I don't follow this closely enough,
9032820	9036820	but I thought even Ubisoft rotated them amongst some of the studios,
9036820	9038820	even though it's all still Ubisoft.
9038820	9039820	Just food for thought.
9039820	9041820	And admittedly, I could be wrong.
9041820	9044820	Honestly, I think that people just hate Activision slash Call of Duty
9044820	9048820	because of the surge of military-themed shooters in recent years
9048820	9053820	as lesser companies such as EA imitate COD shamelessly.
9053820	9055820	Perhaps it's because of the internet,
9055820	9057820	but I don't remember that hatred for Nintendo
9057820	9060820	during the platformer boom after Super Mario Bros. got big,
9060820	9063820	or for Capcom in the wake of the fighting game boom.
9063820	9068820	For some reason, it seems the more mentally deficient among the gaming public
9068820	9074820	see fit to place the blame for the shallow imitators at Activision's feet
9074820	9078820	rather than at the feet of the pale, soulless imitators themselves.
9078820	9081820	Eh, people are kind of fanboy.
9081820	9084820	Regarding the same-sex marriage in the latest Fire Emblem,
9084820	9088820	while it's a great feature, I worry that it will be done in a pandering way,
9088820	9092820	especially if they're just doing it in response to backlash over Tomodachi life.
9092820	9097820	Often, I find in popular media that the LGBT characters
9097820	9100820	don't forget about the QA, hey,
9100820	9104820	usually have their LGBT-ness be a central part of the character
9104820	9106820	as opposed to being a small part of a greater whole.
9106820	9108820	Further, I'm hoping Nintendo shows discretion
9108820	9112820	and doesn't make the whole roster open to marriage regardless of gender.
9112820	9116820	Ideally, there would be straight gay and bi characters like people in real life.
9116820	9118820	Don't forget the asexual people.
9118820	9120820	Just say quilt bag.
9120820	9121820	Represent.
9121820	9122820	Just say quilt bag.
9122820	9123820	Yeah.
9123820	9128820	But I'm afraid that the company that usually shies away from sexuality and their games
9128820	9131820	and all will just again take the shortcut and make everyone bi.
9131820	9133820	And the last bit has to do with me.
9133820	9137820	Wait, can I, before we get to that part, can I address just something real quick?
9137820	9141820	Because I've heard there are some interesting things on the Fire Emblem front this week
9141820	9144820	that apparently there are some weird things in the story
9144820	9150820	that could involve these weird hallucinations about,
9150820	9154820	and I'm not going to try to cite this because I don't want to misrepresent the game,
9154820	9158820	but apparently some people are finding some problem things in that storyline.
9158820	9162820	It's at the point where I don't really want to just believe what I read on Twitter.
9162820	9165820	I would like to just play the game for myself and draw my own conclusions
9165820	9169820	if I get around to it, or I'll ask Drew to play it and send me the important parts
9169820	9171820	because he loves Fire Emblem.
9171820	9172820	On it.
9172820	9174820	But yeah, I'm hearing some things.
9174820	9176820	It'll be interesting to see what happens in translation, too,
9176820	9179820	because I guess it's one thing's happening in Japan. We'll see.
9179820	9181820	So I don't know.
9181820	9185820	It's raising some red flags, though. That's all I can really say right now.
9185820	9190820	The last bit has to do with me having mentioned the hip cock
9190820	9194820	in the female character for Mass Effect Andromeda.
9194820	9199820	And yeah, I might have gone a little bit ranty on it, but I was really annoyed.
9199820	9203820	And guess what? I'm entitled to be annoyed by something that I perceive
9203820	9210820	as a particularly gendered feature without being compared to some of the people
9210820	9216820	who were more exploitative about their position as public feminists.
9216820	9221820	And you know what? I don't have to at all exercise any caution if I don't want to
9221820	9226820	because I have a voice and I don't have to have anyone tell me how to use my voice.
9226820	9228820	The end.
9229820	9232820	That being said, I understand your point.
9232820	9235820	You know, I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's geared toward me
9235820	9237820	and I'm not going to go on with that.
9237820	9249820	But I do think that the pose itself should have equaled the pose of the male character.
9249820	9251820	They should have both been neutral.
9251820	9255820	You know, if you're going to portray her in one mode,
9255820	9259820	you should also portray him in like some hip thrusting mode. I don't know.
9259820	9265820	I'm just saying that that is not how a woman comfortably stands.
9265820	9267820	I'm just going to say that.
9267820	9271820	The hip cock thing, not normal and not good for your back,
9271820	9275820	not good for your hips. It's painful.
9275820	9278820	I think something to kind of go with that too, you know,
9278820	9283820	is that when EA is only going to give you a 10 second taste
9283820	9287820	at what this new character you're going to be invested in is going to look like,
9287820	9290820	you got to choose those 10 seconds carefully
9290820	9293820	because if Dark Saga is going to make a snap opinion like that,
9293820	9297820	that's because it's all she's got. She's got nothing but this little...
9297820	9298820	I have a picture.
9298820	9301820	Yeah, exactly. So I kind of see it from that angle where it's like,
9301820	9304820	well, if this is all I've got to analyze, I'm going to analyze it
9304820	9306820	and there's nothing to really balance it against.
9306820	9309820	But hopefully, I mean, the Mass Effect games have done a good job.
9309820	9311820	FemShep's a great character.
9311820	9316820	And she doesn't at all like sit and stand like that.
9316820	9321820	She basically has the male animations, which I'm actually kind of fine with
9321820	9324820	because fuck, you've seen me sit.
9324820	9327820	You're certainly not basing your decision on the entire game around this.
9327820	9329820	No, hell no. That would be stupid.
9329820	9334820	I'm just saying they need to be a little bit more cognizant of their audience.
9334820	9338820	You know, you have female gamers and we are looking to you
9338820	9343820	to make something that we're going to really, really be able to get into.
9343820	9347820	I mean... God.
9347820	9352820	That's why I really thought that Dragon Age Inquisition was done so well
9352820	9356820	and that's why I had a lot of hope for Andromeda and I still do.
9356820	9361820	I just think that if this is the start they're giving, they're off to a bad start.
9361820	9365820	Although I have to say, though, that the game, what we've seen of it so far,
9365820	9368820	looks absolutely gorgeous. I'm looking forward to learning more about it.
9368820	9371820	And I'm certainly not going to make a judgment on the whole thing
9371820	9373820	based on just what I've seen.
9373820	9378820	My judgment was on the picture, not on the game.
9378820	9384820	And if you can't recognize that, then I'm wondering when you went from
9384820	9389820	thinking me to be the only voice of reason to then having an issue with it.
9389820	9392820	And I'm not the only voice of reason, by the way.
9392820	9396820	You know why? Because sometimes Sanrio comes out here.
9396820	9399820	That's right. Sometimes Sanrio has to set us straight.
9399820	9403820	Anyway, that's all I got. Keep up the good work.
9403820	9407820	Regards, Ralstiel UT, OLR Minister of Unpopular Opinions.
9407820	9412820	P.S. Hopefully Doom 4 gets delayed enough that it'll drop the week of OLR Episode 666.
9412820	9417820	And for the record, Ralstiel UT, most of the time I think you're on point for many things.
9418820	9420820	We're all going to disagree on something.
9420820	9424820	It's like I think Act F to Super Awesome.
9424820	9427820	I'm so happy he listens to the show and gives us that perspective.
9427820	9431820	But he's so fucking wrong on this team dog and team cat thing, I'm just saying.
9431820	9435820	Remember, cats rule and dogs drool.
9435820	9441820	All right. Let's get to the F use of the week on that note.
9447820	9449820	All this is bad.
9449820	9451820	Here is justice.
9451820	9453820	Here is punishment.
9453820	9455820	Here.
9455820	9457820	This is fucked up.
9460820	9467820	So my F use goes to Tea Culture for no longer taking credit card and not fixing their damn credit card machine.
9467820	9474820	Because I wanted my taro milk tea today with my egg custard in it because I'm cheating today.
9474820	9485820	And no. So instead I'm just going to go to Farrell's and shove my face full of delicious peanuts and coffee flavored ice cream and chocolate ice cream.
9485820	9489820	I want ice cream. Fuck hormones, man.
9489820	9491820	Just all of it.
9491820	9496820	I. Yeah, all of it. I'm except, except, except, except.
9496820	9500820	Also another fuck you to the Guinness beer brats that I bought because I thought they were going to be amazing.
9500820	9505820	And they just don't microwave very well. So I'm going to make my husband throw me the rest of them.
9505820	9512820	And I had something else to be angry about, but fuck it.
9512820	9515820	I guess I just craving soda.
9515820	9519820	I mean, I don't count the Red Bulls as soda. They drink those still.
9519820	9522820	Well, only drink about once a day. Except for today.
9522820	9526820	I drank two because I didn't drink one yesterday and I was tired.
9526820	9529820	I got a massage today, so that's good. No, but yeah.
9529820	9537820	It's so happy that because, you know, not really dieting, I guess, and just not eating fast food instead of eating garbage subway and sandwiches.
9537820	9546820	So I've been just eating sandwiches for days, but I guess that's healthier than eating like McDonald's for days and cutting out soda.
9546820	9550820	And I've been staying under like, you know, like 1600 calories a day.
9550820	9554820	So, wow. So that's got to be pretty good, right? Even if it is garbage.
9554820	9561820	I mean, my a few of the week goes to the popcorn kernel that just got stuck between my teeth.
9561820	9565820	And that's why I had to run out of the room real fast, because that is annoying.
9565820	9568820	Oh, my God. It's like emergency flossing now.
9568820	9573820	That's not so bad. It's when it gets sucked between your gum.
9573820	9576820	I can't get it out. Oh, no, no, no, no.
9576820	9579820	Oh, my God. It's the worst. So anyway, that's why I ran out.
9579820	9581820	So, Drew, did you get to do your FUs or no?
9581820	9582820	Not yet. Go ahead.
9582820	9586820	Dude, FU did not be able to make it out down to L.A. for AX.
9586820	9593820	I mean, seriously, I had encountered the Cosplay Wrestling Federation, or FANMA, and they were funny as hell.
9593820	9597820	And I just can't make it down there to enjoy all that kind of good stuff at AX.
9597820	9603820	I wanted to go to AX this year because they had, I don't know, maybe it was an AX.
9604820	9609820	I'm thinking of Comic-Con because they're doing a Kung Fury screening.
9609820	9614820	Kung Fury screening with an after-party where David Hasselhoff is singing True Survivors.
9614820	9615820	Oh, my God. That's amazing.
9615820	9620820	I'm just going to maintain my FU to Warner Brothers right now until they fix their shit.
9620820	9621820	Fix your shirt, guys.
9621820	9623820	Fix it. All right.
9623820	9628820	Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line to all of you at 1877 Game Oil R,
9628820	9630820	our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9630820	9632820	But first, a couple more quick stories. Loki.
9632820	9642820	Yes. So Valve has decided that they're going to no longer refund, I guess, bad trades, trade deals anymore.
9642820	9647820	Basically, Steam is not going to return items that you were scammed out of.
9647820	9653820	They're saying our community assigns an item of value and is at least partially determined by that item's scarcity.
9653820	9660820	If more copies of the item are added to the economy through inventory rollbacks, the value of other instances of the item would be reduced.
9660820	9670820	We sympathize with people who fall victim to scams, but we provide enough information on our websites within our trading systems to help users to make good trading decisions.
9670820	9675820	All trade scams can be avoided, so don't be scammed.
9675820	9677820	Be very careful about who you trade with.
9677820	9683820	Yeah, that's why I only trade with friends. I don't trust other people.
9683820	9685820	It's your responsibility to read.
9685820	9688820	Friends of friends, I will, but that's about it.
9688820	9700820	Yeah. Anyhow, one game that might inspire some trading of, I don't know, DLC or costume codes or something, is the potential of an open world Superman game.
9700820	9712820	There's a rumor that Warner Brothers Games Montreal, who did Batman Arkham Origins, so remember there was the Arkham Origins game that was kind of the bridge between the two other ones, that was done by another studio.
9712820	9721820	So apparently this studio, the rumor is that they're working on a Superman video game, and this is because of a supposedly leaked screenshot, but take it with a grain of salt.
9721820	9729820	It supposedly shows Superman in the game where you can select the costume or whatever. It shows whatever skin you can.
9729820	9739820	Also, there was a rumor last week that WB Games Montreal was trying to hire 15 positions for an open world action game, which was a new IP project for next generation game platforms.
9739820	9746820	Now it would make a lot of sense that, you know, if this is going to be the last open world Batman game, why not follow it up with a Superman game?
9746820	9759820	However, an important update was also released to this initial rumor, and that is that Warner Brothers Montreal isn't working on a Superman game, but the heavily rumored Suicide Squad game.
9759820	9766820	Which would make sense when you consider there's that movie being worked on right now that obviously they would try to tie into that possibly with a game.
9766820	9775820	So that could also explain what's going on here. So it's either a Superman game or a Suicide Squad game. Both would make a lot of sense.
9775820	9777820	Does it involve flying through rings?
9778820	9795820	Actually, I think that would be a really funny side quest type of thing. I think if they were to find a way to work that into the lore where you fly through rings, but they make it tongue in cheek funny, I think that would be okay. I think that would be hilarious.
9795820	9800820	They could make it like Superman on the Atari 2600. You gotta find that phone booth.
9800820	9801820	Oh god.
9801820	9803820	Did you ever play Superman on the 2600?
9803820	9804820	Heard of.
9804820	9806820	Not that old.
9807820	9820820	Alright, so that does it for news tonight. So we're going to open up the Skype line. 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Go ahead and get in on there if you want to comment on anything we've talked about tonight.
9820820	9829820	Or perhaps something we haven't yet discussed. I'm not going to keep this open very long because we're already almost to 9 o'clock. So if you want to get in, I would urge you to call in ASAP.
9829820	9832820	Meanwhile, I know Loki, you had at least one thing you wanted to talk about here.
9833820	9845820	Yeah, so apparently Destiny, you know how they had that Red Bull promotion where they had some codes and stuff? They've already been exploited. Apparently the codes were predictable, and so they had a way to figure out what some of those codes would be.
9845820	9849820	And they've already redeemed codes that may be on cans that they haven't purchased yet.
9849820	9850820	Predictable!
9850820	9856820	So you may get some codes if you purchase some of these cans that aren't redeemable because they've already been redeemed.
9860820	9861820	Nice shot Bungie.
9861820	9865820	Alright, actually our phones are lighting up, so let's get to it. We're getting several calls tonight.
9865820	9866820	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9869820	9871820	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? You might be on mute.
9874820	9876820	I'm going to check one more time. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9877820	9878820	Oh, they hung up.
9878820	9882820	The joys of live radio everybody. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
9882820	9886820	Hey, you can always test your connection by calling Echo 1-2-3 before giving us a call.
9886820	9889820	So let's try another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9889820	9891820	It's Ronma. What's up everybody?
9891820	9893820	I know your Skype works. How you doing buddy?
9894820	9896820	I'm doing good. A little tired, but I'm good.
9896820	9902820	Did you go to a con this week? I know you're not an AnimeX skype. Is there another con like the East Coast or something that you did this weekend?
9902820	9909820	Uh, no. I just went out and kind of got my party on because it was the 4th of July and then I was walking around all over New York City with a couple of friends today.
9909820	9912820	Oh, awesome. Good for you. I hope you had a good 4th.
9912820	9914820	I did. How about you?
9914820	9922820	Uh, it was a little boring actually. But you know what? I played a shitload of Final Fantasy XIV and just relaxed. I had a really stressful week at work.
9922820	9929820	So it was nice to just be able to like, relax. So I'm happy for that. Like, I'm ready to go back tomorrow.
9929820	9930820	Gotcha.
9930820	9932820	So what's on your mind tonight?
9932820	9938820	Um, two things. I just want to know, did Junami show up with the joke book?
9938820	9943820	I don't see a book, but he does have an electronic device.
9943820	9945820	I'm going all digital this time around.
9945820	9952820	I feel like in his 30s, I feel like he's moved into the digital age. He has a digital joke book now that he takes with him.
9952820	9954820	Oh, god damn it.
9954820	9955820	You're welcome.
9955820	9957820	Gigabytes and gigabytes, my friend.
9957820	9959820	And it's on a Blackberry.
9959820	9961820	Bite your tongue.
9961820	9963820	Hey, that's the equivalent of toilet paper, right?
9963820	9966820	I think he's doing a good job tonight though. It's good to have him back.
9967820	9970820	Yes, it is. And one more thing. I'm going to get out of here.
9970820	9975820	The main reason why I called was to give Al his props on his answer. That was amazeballs.
9975820	9983820	You know what? Sadly, he's not in the room to hear. He went back to playing MMOs, but he's probably listening on the headset back in the studio.
9983820	9987820	So hopefully he'll hear his shout out there. But he's a hilarious guy.
9987820	9994820	You know, he's that guy that'll kind of sit in the party and not really say anything and he won't be like super extroverted.
9994820	9999820	But then like when he sees the opportunity for a killer joke, he'll throw it out there and just slay the entire party.
9999820	10007820	I actually walked out of my house. That's how funny it was. I stopped what I was doing and I just walked out of my house.
10007820	10013820	I'm hoping we get somebody in trouble at work for laughing too hard with that answer. We'll see. We'll see come Monday.
10013820	10015820	Lord Jesus.
10015820	10016820	Alright.
10016820	10018820	You need Jesus.
10018820	10021820	For the record, I've amended it from Blackberry to an N-Gage.
10021820	10026820	You know what? The N-Gage would have probably done a lot better if Patrick Stewart actually promoted that.
10026820	10027820	What?
10027820	10028820	N-Gage.
10028820	10029820	Aww, dude.
10029820	10034820	I see you N-Gage and raise you a Windows powered CE device.
10034820	10035820	Shut up.
10035820	10036820	You mean the Dreamcast?
10036820	10038820	I'm talking about before the Dreamcast.
10038820	10039820	Oh.
10039820	10040820	Oh my god.
10040820	10046820	Rama. Rama. Dude, I had a kin. Your point is invalid. Or maybe it is perfectly valid.
10046820	10049820	Alright, Rama. I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, alright?
10049820	10050820	Awesome.
10050820	10051820	Alright. Take care of my friend.
10051820	10052820	Alright. Later.
10052820	10058820	Alright. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.
10058820	10063820	So I could go buy a can of Red Bull and somebody somehow already got that code, huh?
10063820	10064820	Possibly, yeah.
10064820	10069820	Alright. Well, the phones are lighting up back to back tonight so let's get back to it with another call.
10069820	10071820	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10071820	10072820	Hey, it's Shane.
10072820	10074820	Hi, Shane. How are you?
10074820	10075820	I'm fine.
10075820	10077820	Excellent. What's on your mind tonight?
10077820	10081820	So, I just wanted to quickly talk about Persona 4 Dancing All Night.
10081820	10085820	Of course you do. Of course you do. By all means.
10085820	10087820	Pandering. Go on ahead.
10087820	10088820	Talk away.
10088820	10092820	So, of course it's an amazing game. Let's just get that out of the way. However...
10092820	10097820	You're also super biased. In the interest of you know ethics and all that, you're super biased.
10097820	10099820	Go on.
10099820	10107820	Not at all. I may or may not have purchased the Kanji in his swimsuit costume already.
10107820	10109820	You would.
10109820	10117820	Anyway, so it's a Vita game. It looks beautiful. I think it is not suited for Vita in the least.
10117820	10120820	If you're gonna get it, I say play it on PlayStation TV.
10120820	10122820	Oh, interesting.
10122820	10127820	Because the controls, while functional on Vita, pretty uncomfortable.
10127820	10130820	Is it like thumbstick based or something?
10130820	10139820	It is. It's the up, left, down, and then the triangle, circle, X, as well as thumbsticks.
10139820	10144820	Or you can play with the touch screen, which I just don't find fun at all.
10144820	10149820	But, my god, those buttons being so small and the amount of stuff you have to do with them,
10149820	10153820	just really uncomfortable unless you have like tiny baby hands.
10153820	10155820	Oh, jeebus. That's gonna give me hand cramps.
10155820	10158820	After an hour, my hands were dying.
10158820	10161820	I was gonna say, maybe it was designed a little more with the Vita 2.0 in mind,
10161820	10165820	but the buttons, I feel like, are even smaller on the Vita 2.0, so maybe not.
10165820	10169820	Sorry, I'm in a Final Fantasy hunt right now.
10169820	10178820	It's a really good game, though, and it is very story heavy, so you do want to know some Japanese for that.
10178820	10183820	Or you can play the Free Dancing mode, where you can unlock songs just by regular play.
10183820	10188820	It's a lot of fun. It reminds me of a cross between, obviously, Persona,
10188820	10199820	maybe a little bit of Dance Summit from PlayStation 2, and, I don't know, sex, because it's so good.
10199820	10202820	Story in a rhythm game. Okay, I'm geeking out now.
10202820	10206820	What is it that makes this game so good? You keep saying it's good, but why?
10206820	10209820	The music. Oh, the music is so good.
10209820	10213820	And watching them dance, I thought it was going to be a stupid concept.
10213820	10216820	Nope, works perfect. Abso-freaking-lutely love it.
10216820	10220820	I don't know, it's just really good.
10220820	10225820	The graphics for a Vita game? A lot better than I thought it would be.
10225820	10228820	Was not expecting it to look as good as it does.
10228820	10233820	The music, again, it has the Kiriyama Oka doing a remix.
10233820	10240820	It's got a lot of other good artists I've never heard of, because I don't really listen to anything Japanese.
10240820	10248820	But if you like Persona music, if you like Persona, if you like rhythm games in general, you're going to absolutely love this.
10248820	10253820	But now we are getting this in the States, so people can be patient and play the story mode and all that stuff, right?
10253820	10259820	Yes, I would actually suggest, I don't know, it's supposed to be this fall, I don't know how far into fall.
10259820	10260820	It's supposed to be in October.
10261820	10265820	I would pretty much say, just wait.
10265820	10268820	Shane, one last question.
10268820	10275820	You said you got Kanji in swimsuit, I have to ask out of purely morbid curiosity, does it also include the seaweed instance?
10275820	10278820	And if you played Persona 4, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
10278820	10280820	Oh yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.
10280820	10289820	I do not see that as an unlockable costume yet, maybe it's DLC, but I don't see it as one I can unlock yet.
10290820	10294820	Now Shane, one more question I have to ask you since we're talking about Vita's.
10294820	10303820	You knew about my present because Alan told you before it actually showed up here, so what was your reaction to hearing that I was going to be getting the Heavensward Vita?
10303820	10308820	I thought it was really cool that you were getting it. I wasn't going to, like, murder you.
10308820	10310820	Not today anyway.
10310820	10316820	I already threw away the three copies of the house key I made, so I can't come steal it at night.
10319820	10324820	I figure if you were going to murder me, you would have done it at some point in the last decade, because we've known each other far too long.
10324820	10330820	Yeah, no that's really cool, I have to come see it sometime. I really like that box though, as I've told you.
10330820	10332820	It's okay, I'll just sneak it out and take it to work.
10332820	10334820	You will do nothing of the sort.
10334820	10337820	Alright, alright Shane, I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, okay?
10337820	10339820	That's fine, I've got to go do more hunts.
10339820	10340820	Alright, have fun.
10340820	10341820	Alright, bye bye.
10341820	10342820	Bye.
10342820	10348820	Alright, 1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
10348820	10353820	And we'll try to squeeze in one more call here. Do we have any other? Oh, god, it's already lighting up.
10353820	10357820	You won't play match game, but you're calling to the show. Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10357820	10360820	Yo, Rob, it's Genicor from the OKC, how you doing, man?
10360820	10363820	It has been a long time since we've heard from you, my friend. How are you?
10363820	10366820	You know, just trying to keep that job, you know how that goes.
10366820	10370820	I know very well how that goes. What's on your mind tonight, my friend?
10370820	10381820	Not much, man. I was thinking about getting back into the podcast game, but I don't think there's anything out there that I can really cover that isn't being covered by, like, five or six people that are at YouTube and podcasts and then all this stuff has jumped all over the place.
10381820	10391820	You know what? I don't think you should let that stop you. You know, I think if anybody has a passion, they can bring something to the table that other people aren't doing, because it's about you.
10391820	10401820	And everybody, I mean, God, that sounds very egotistical. I don't mean, like, I expect that people are subscribing to OLR because it's me, but it's because the opinions, you know, that we share.
10401820	10410820	And I think, I think DarkSakura kind of hit on this a little bit ago when she was talking about the email that came in and it's like, you know, I mostly agree with this guy, but this one, I think he's off the mark.
10410820	10415820	I respect, you know, it's kind of like that's what you say, I respect it, but, you know, we're going to agree to disagree on that.
10415820	10421820	And I think, you know, that's the kind of stuff that we all bring to the table is that it's different perspectives and things like that.
10421820	10429820	So I don't think, Xenocore, you should ever let the fact that someone else is doing it be the sole thing to kind of stop you.
10429820	10440820	It may make it trickier to market your show and to sell your show because, you know, you're going to have to kind of say, well, what is it I'm doing that's going to make people want to check me out as opposed to somebody else?
10440820	10452820	But you'll find that. And I think maybe part of it is to just kind of start doing, do a pilot episode, do a test run and just see what happens, analyze it, see what you want to do better, what you like and you didn't like about it.
10452820	10453820	Anyway.
10453820	10460820	It's not so much that, it's mainly because I'm such an old fart when it comes to games now that, you know, I just think of all these guys as whippersnappers.
10460820	10467820	I saw the Nintendo World Championships. I was crying because they were so bad. It was ridiculous. They have no gamer sense. I was embarrassed.
10468820	10471820	How do you think we feel here on OLR?
10471820	10473820	I hope you feel the same as me.
10473820	10491820	I think we do a little bit. We do. But I think that's okay because, you know, our generation, you know, I remember when we were, you know, 15 years old or what have you, when we were younger, it would seem like there were very few people in their 30s and 40s that were into gaming.
10491820	10499820	I mean, sure there were some. I'm not going to say there were none. But it seemed like there were very few. There were a lot more people that didn't understand it. Like a lot of our parents didn't really get it.
10499820	10507820	But now that that generation has grown up and we are the 30, 40 somethings, I think there's a lot more people now that get it.
10507820	10523820	And I think what's funny is that you say that, but yet I feel like there's not enough out there for the older gamer, or I hate to say middle-aged gamer, but you know, just the gamer in their 30s and 40s. The Gen X gamer.
10523820	10529820	Yeah, because that balloon fight thing was horrible. It's like, what? Have you never even touched this game before in your life? What's wrong with you people?
10529820	10531820	I know, right? These damn kids.
10531820	10534820	It's just me getting crotchety telling kids to get off my lawn. I think that's a big problem.
10534820	10540820	That's alright. Well maybe that's an angle for your show. Where are you going to tell all the kids to get off your lawn today and why?
10540820	10542820	Yeah, Uncle Zeno's lawn.
10542820	10548820	There you go! There you go, gaming with Uncle Zeno. And this is why y'all need to be taught some things about balloon fight.
10548820	10551820	Alright, awesome show guys. Keep up the good work.
10551820	10554820	Thank you so much Zenocore. Best of luck to whatever it is you decide to do.
10554820	10555820	Alright, take care.
10555820	10556820	Alright, take care. Bye bye.
10557820	10561820	Look at that fifth dream in chat. It says, I'd co-host that. There it is. Alright.
10561820	10564820	I am going to shut down the Skype line for tonight. I'm so sorry to those who didn't get through.
10564820	10574820	Please consider sending us an email. Participate at OrangeLawnsRadio.com or tweet. Twitter.com slash O-L-R or one of the other several different ways that you can interact with our show.
10574820	10576820	Any other last minute stories you want to get out there, Loki?
10576820	10577820	No.
10577820	10578820	We're going to close up shop tonight.
10578820	10579820	We can close up shop.
10579820	10583820	Shut it down. Shut it down. Hey Drew, good to see you buddy.
10583820	10584820	I'll be back.
10584820	10588820	I'll be back now that you're in your thirties. Oh my God.
10588820	10591820	Isn't that just a kick in the head?
10591820	10597820	It is. You were the dumb kid. You know I say that with love. I say that with love.
10597820	10600820	Also a lot of truth because I was kind of the dumb kid.
10600820	10610820	Well, so was I. You know, I go back to, oh my God, when I was like first doing this show at like 23, 24, whatever, I'm a completely different person than I am now. Completely different.
10610820	10614820	We were making jokes about red Oreos and pizza.
10614820	10617820	And now red velvet Oreos are a thing.
10617820	10621820	It's come full circle. How about that shit?
10621820	10624820	Anyhow, Drew, I don't know if you have anything to plug.
10624820	10626820	But no pizza Oreos.
10626820	10627820	Not yet.
10627820	10628820	Would they be pizza Oreos?
10628820	10631820	They'd be combos is what they are. Combos are good enough.
10631820	10635820	Alright, if you can find them. Jesus, those things are impossible to find.
10636820	10639820	Drew, I don't know if you have anything to plug. Everybody's got their own podcast these days.
10639820	10644820	I don't know if you have anything you want to plug. But if not, maybe a Twitter or something where people can follow you. Say hi.
10644820	10647820	No, I'm just running solo at this point. Mostly off the map.
10647820	10655820	But expect me. I'm going to see if I can make my most triumphant return over on the IRC chat again.
10655820	10656820	Nice.
10656820	10661820	And see if I can be a regular again. So give me my mops so I can go ahead and kick some butts.
10661820	10667820	Well, since it's been four years, know that we're in channel VOG.
10667820	10668820	I've been there.
10668820	10669820	Things have changed a little bit.
10669820	10671820	Senile old coot.
10671820	10675820	Listen up, bitch. I'm going to take that book and shove it up your ass.
10675820	10679820	Alright, come back again sometime. But not too soon. Just kidding.
10679820	10680820	Will do.
10680820	10685820	Alright, let's see. Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.
10685820	10689820	Hey, if you like what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, support independent broadcasting.
10689820	10694820	If you thought this show was a hot goddamn mess, and who could blame you after Match Game? No, I'm kidding.
10694820	10698820	Just support another show out there. Send another show of your love.
10698820	10702820	Because there's a lot of people out there who work very, very hard to create this sort of content.
10702820	10705820	So thank you all for supporting us.
10705820	10709820	You can leave a nice five star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio if you want.
10709820	10711820	Go leave a five star review that said,
10711820	10714820	Allen's joke just sold this entire show to me tonight.
10714820	10715820	There you go, if you want.
10715820	10721820	Alright, but for now, it's time to wrap up and go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.
10721820	10723820	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
10723820	10725820	You both said hard and butt.
10727820	10729820	You're so mature.
10729820	10731820	Drew, do you have a final thought tonight?
10731820	10735820	Dude, you called me five times in the middle of the show. You have the wrong number, dude.
10735820	10743820	My final thought is, now I'm craving combos after I already ate an entire box of Mike and Ikes.
10743820	10746820	This is why I'm fat. This is why Mike and Ikes are so good.
10746820	10748820	Cowboy Breaker!
10748820	10751820	Anyway, last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10751820	10755820	I'm thinking about doing another game jam in a couple weeks.
10755820	10761820	But, just to be clear though, it wouldn't be anything beyond a game jam.
10761820	10767820	It would be, I'm done after, well, it's a 72 hour game jam, but I only have 10 hours to do it.
10767820	10769820	Because of family.
10769820	10771820	My gosh.
10773820	10775820	Okay, then.
10775820	10777820	One member of your family.
10777820	10779820	Also, congratulations to my sister who just had her baby yesterday.
10779820	10783820	I saw that. Congratulations, you're now an uncle as well as a dad.
10783820	10785820	That's great.
10785820	10791820	By the way, one of the founders of Burt's Bees, the Burt behind it, died.
10791820	10793820	Did he get stunk by a bee?
10793820	10795820	No.
10795820	10797820	Why would I say that?
10797820	10801820	He's just old and lived on a farm with no power.
10801820	10803820	No power on a farm?
10803820	10807820	Did he perhaps go up into a giant wicker man and go, the bees!
10807820	10809820	Not the bees!
10809820	10811820	I hate all of you.
10811820	10813820	Except Alan. I love Alan.
10813820	10817820	And on that note, we'll see you next week. Jamie hates all of you. Good night.
