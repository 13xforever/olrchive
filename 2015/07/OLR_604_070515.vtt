00:00.000 --> 00:17.240
This week, the crowdfunding train rolls on with news of everything from campaigns getting

00:17.240 --> 00:20.080
a physical release to indie hopefuls backing down from their labor of love.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.640
For now, we're bringing you all the details in a game of our very own, and it all starts

00:23.640 --> 00:30.640
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:30.640 --> 00:34.740
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.740 --> 00:36.680
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.680 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio for this episode number 604, July the 5th of 2015.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.080
Hope you all had a happy July 4th weekend if you're here in the States.

00:49.080 --> 00:52.360
If you are up in Canada, then I hope you all had a great Canada Day.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.280
If you're somewhere else in the world, well, I hope you had a good week.

00:55.280 --> 01:00.220
My name is Rob Roberts here in studio to talk games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle

01:00.220 --> 01:06.480
with my co-host, say hello first off to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.000
And is that your final word on the matter?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
No.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
How are you, Jamie?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm okay.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Good, good.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Just okay.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.720
Yeah, I was going to go get milk tea, and their credit card machine's been broken for

01:16.720 --> 01:21.860
three months, and I still haven't fixed it, and I'm like, but I want milk tea.

01:21.860 --> 01:22.980
What place is this?

01:22.980 --> 01:25.020
It's the tea culture place that I go to.

01:25.020 --> 01:26.020
Oh, it must be.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.020
It's like on-

01:27.020 --> 01:28.020
I was like, what kind of place does-

01:28.020 --> 01:30.580
Florin whatever the hell that turns into Twat Avenue.

01:30.580 --> 01:34.780
I was like, what kind of place doesn't get their little credit thing fixed?

01:34.780 --> 01:35.780
It's crazy.

01:35.780 --> 01:36.780
It's a tile.

01:36.780 --> 01:38.780
Fix your tile.

01:38.780 --> 01:42.380
Anyway, I was going to say, you know where I went today.

01:42.380 --> 01:43.940
You always talk about this place here locally.

01:43.940 --> 01:46.780
We're going to talk locally for a minute, so you all deal with this.

01:46.780 --> 01:49.660
But I'm sure you have one of these in your town somewhere.

01:50.140 --> 01:52.940
Alan and I finally went over to the International Market in Rancho Cordova.

01:52.940 --> 01:53.940
We hadn't been there.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.580
I don't think I've ever been there.

01:55.580 --> 01:56.580
Well, okay.

01:56.580 --> 02:02.980
I remember when it was just a little Asian grocery store, but at some point, it absorbed

02:02.980 --> 02:06.740
the Albertsons or whatever it was that used to be next to it, and now it's a mega store

02:06.740 --> 02:08.060
of international stuff.

02:08.060 --> 02:12.140
And I was going to bring green tea Kit Kat to the show because they have the flavored

02:12.140 --> 02:13.860
Kit Kats and stuff, and I was like, nah.

02:13.860 --> 02:15.500
I still visit Oto's as well.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.500
I like candy.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.500
Probably a bad idea.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.500
I don't know.

02:18.540 --> 02:20.900
Matcha Kit Kats, pretty bomb.

02:20.900 --> 02:23.980
They only had green tea and dark chocolate, but still, you don't see the other flavors

02:23.980 --> 02:24.980
in the States ever.

02:24.980 --> 02:27.100
You know what they get at Oto's though?

02:27.100 --> 02:29.620
They have the cookies and cream Oreo soft cookies.

02:29.620 --> 02:30.940
That sounds real good.

02:30.940 --> 02:31.940
Mm-hmm.

02:31.940 --> 02:32.940
Real good.

02:32.940 --> 02:33.940
All right.

02:33.940 --> 02:34.940
Oh, they have matcha Oreos too.

02:34.940 --> 02:38.620
Well, we're talking about food before we talk about video games, so it must be a good time

02:38.620 --> 02:39.620
to introduce us.

02:39.620 --> 02:40.620
Well, Tech Master, Loki.

02:40.620 --> 02:41.620
Hello.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.620
How you doing, Loki?

02:42.620 --> 02:43.620
I'm doing fine.

02:43.620 --> 02:44.620
Have you been to the International Market?

02:44.620 --> 02:45.620
Yeah.

02:45.620 --> 02:46.620
Yeah?

02:46.620 --> 02:47.620
There's some good stuff over there.

02:47.940 --> 02:48.940
All sorts of things.

02:48.940 --> 02:49.940
I don't know.

02:49.940 --> 02:52.460
I guess maybe one of these days I'll load us up on candy and bring it to the show.

02:52.460 --> 02:56.860
What I was trying to find over in the ... They had a Japanese candy aisle, and I was trying

02:56.860 --> 03:00.460
to find some of the stuff that Akuma JP sent us in the care package a while ago.

03:00.460 --> 03:05.180
I did find Hello Kitty marshmallows, and I almost bought those, but I didn't want to

03:05.180 --> 03:08.740
walk up to the checkout and just be like, hi, I just want to buy these Hello Kitty marshmallows

03:08.740 --> 03:11.300
because then I'm kind of creepy.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.300
Let's be real.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.300
You would not be the first.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.100
They don't care.

03:16.100 --> 03:19.780
I would not be the first to only buy Hello Kitty marshmallows at the grocery store?

03:19.780 --> 03:23.900
I did have my Japanese food experience today because I found a place near my house that

03:23.900 --> 03:25.860
does curry rice.

03:25.860 --> 03:27.900
On top of that, they did karaoke curry rice.

03:27.900 --> 03:28.900
Nice.

03:28.900 --> 03:29.900
I was happy.

03:29.900 --> 03:30.900
Nom, nom, nom.

03:30.900 --> 03:31.900
All right.

03:31.900 --> 03:32.900
It's like my ...

03:32.900 --> 03:33.900
Lots of food talk.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.420
Yes, I did say Twat Avenue.

03:35.420 --> 03:36.420
It's what, but ...

03:36.420 --> 03:42.140
Hey, if you want to join us and comment on the show, and Dark Sakura will randomly respond

03:42.140 --> 03:45.860
to you as she just did, you can participate with us live every Sunday night at the Voice

03:45.860 --> 03:50.640
of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the

03:50.640 --> 03:51.640
Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:51.640 --> 03:58.460
If you are listening live, join us and chat, live.vognetwork.com, who Tigerclaw, taking

03:58.460 --> 04:02.100
the opportunity because I brought up Hello Kitty, Tigerclaw bouncing in with the opportunity

04:02.100 --> 04:04.620
to remind us they're going to be making a movie out of Hello Kitty.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.660
I don't know if you saw that news this week, but they are officially making a Hello Kitty

04:07.660 --> 04:12.720
movie, which I guess the distinction is it's probably the first big screen movie because

04:12.720 --> 04:15.700
there's tons of Hello Kitty VHSs and stuff already.

04:15.700 --> 04:20.940
I'm sure there's like mini movies and stuff, but this is like the first big movie, Hello

04:20.940 --> 04:22.220
Kitty's big fucking deal.

04:22.220 --> 04:27.840
If you want to see the best thing that Sanrio ever put out, just watch Turin's Bell, and

04:27.840 --> 04:29.840
then cry.

04:29.840 --> 04:35.420
Cry like you've never cried before because it will make you cry like you're three years

04:35.420 --> 04:38.780
old and someone stepped on your foot and took your lollipop.

04:38.780 --> 04:43.180
On a scale of one to Grave of the Fireflies, how hard am I going to cry?

04:43.180 --> 04:45.580
Probably Grave of the Fireflies.

04:45.580 --> 04:46.580
That's pretty bad.

04:46.580 --> 04:47.740
It's Doug of Flanders level.

04:47.740 --> 04:48.740
Oh, dang.

04:48.740 --> 04:49.740
All right.

04:49.740 --> 04:52.460
Except instead of all the sad, it's also got all of the violence.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.460
All right.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.460
And this is for children.

04:54.460 --> 04:59.020
On a scale of one to the ending of Dancer in the Dark, how wet will my t-shirt be?

04:59.020 --> 05:00.740
You know, I haven't seen Dancer in the Dark.

05:00.740 --> 05:01.740
Okay.

05:01.740 --> 05:02.740
But I know it's really sad.

05:02.740 --> 05:03.740
It's really sad.

05:03.740 --> 05:09.260
So I'm going to say it's as sad as Bjork's last experimental album.

05:09.260 --> 05:11.520
Oh, that's not sad.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.520
That's tragic.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.520
There's a difference.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.520
Tragic.

05:14.520 --> 05:15.520
It's tragic.

05:15.560 --> 05:16.560
Don't cry.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.560
All right.

05:17.560 --> 05:19.800
Speaking of tragic, let's introduce our guests for tonight.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.440
You like that segue?

05:21.440 --> 05:23.040
No, I love this.

05:23.040 --> 05:27.780
This guy has not been on the show in a very, very long time.

05:27.780 --> 05:30.720
He's really old school when it comes to OLR.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.120
And we're really happy to have him back on the show.

05:33.120 --> 05:37.400
Everybody, please give a warm welcome back to Intern Druunami.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
He's here tonight.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.400
Hey there, internet.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.400
You miss me?

05:40.400 --> 05:42.440
No, but our aim is improving.

05:42.440 --> 05:43.440
How are you?

05:43.440 --> 05:44.440
How have you been?

05:44.440 --> 05:45.440
Oh, God.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.440
I've been on this show.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.760
You knocked over the soundboard in, what, 2007, 2008?

05:48.760 --> 05:53.200
Yeah, I heard that that one came home to Roos not too long ago.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.200
Yeah.

05:54.200 --> 05:58.600
Well, I think somebody put together like a top 10 OLR moments, and I'm pretty sure that

05:58.600 --> 05:59.600
was in it somewhere.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.600
Oh, Jesus.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.640
You're right there up with the diva fit, Loki singing.

06:04.640 --> 06:05.720
That's all up there.

06:05.720 --> 06:06.720
The tingle bet.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.720
I think we're all in the...

06:07.720 --> 06:10.560
Actually, Loki was not the only one singing that day, too.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.440
I made an ass out of myself then, too.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.440
That's right.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.440
It was a fun episode.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.840
It has been a couple of years, but I figured I'd pop on it.

06:18.840 --> 06:25.280
I just barely missed the birthday show, which is also my birthday show, but life goes on.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.600
We were both born.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.960
When you put both and born together, you get borth.

06:30.960 --> 06:33.960
We were borth on June...

06:33.960 --> 06:35.520
We were brought forth by birth.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.520
We were both...

06:36.520 --> 06:37.520
Somebody call the Game Grumps.

06:37.520 --> 06:38.520
We've got something going here now.

06:38.520 --> 06:40.040
On June 23rd.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.040
What does that even mean?

06:41.040 --> 06:42.040
I don't know.

06:42.040 --> 06:43.040
Was that shade?

06:43.040 --> 06:44.600
Was that shade in my own house?

06:44.600 --> 06:45.600
Just a touch.

06:45.600 --> 06:49.000
Were we borth on June 23rd, both of us?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Indeed.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Indeed.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
There you go.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.360
Now, you were mentioning before the show...

06:53.360 --> 06:54.360
Hold on.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.360
Okay.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.340
How old were you when you first came on OLR for the very first time?

06:58.340 --> 06:59.340
You were 17, right?

06:59.340 --> 07:00.340
Oh, yeah.

07:00.340 --> 07:01.340
I was 17.

07:01.340 --> 07:02.340
You were 17.

07:02.340 --> 07:03.340
Episode 29.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.340
Oh, my God.

07:04.340 --> 07:05.340
Okay.

07:05.340 --> 07:07.820
So you were 17 years old, and that's why we used to pick on you.

07:07.820 --> 07:11.160
We call you Intern Drew, because you're a youngin'.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.680
You're a dumb kid, right?

07:12.680 --> 07:13.680
Uh-huh.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.360
And how old did you just turn on your birthday?

07:15.360 --> 07:16.360
30.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.360
Oh, my God.

07:17.360 --> 07:20.000
Now I'm officially in the old folks' home with rest of y'all.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
Oh, my God.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Hold on a minute.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.400
No, no, no, no, no.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.880
I'm not in the old folks' home.

07:24.880 --> 07:30.120
I'm one of those crazy old people who's going out skiing and riding roller coasters.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.560
You don't have to hit me with your walker like that.

07:31.560 --> 07:32.560
I can't watch my swingin'.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
Hold on.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.560
Hold on.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.560
What?

07:35.560 --> 07:36.560
I say this with the utmost respect.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.200
That dumb ass kid turned 30.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.080
This dumb ass kid turned 30.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.080
Wowie.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.560
I'm just a dumb ass man.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.560
Okay, here we go.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.560
Love it.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.560
Yeah, you're still a kid.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.800
Nah, you're still a kid compared to the rest of us.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.920
Kid or squid now?

07:52.920 --> 07:53.920
Are you a kid or a squid?

07:53.920 --> 07:54.920
You decide.

07:54.920 --> 07:55.920
Uh, wait.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.920
Hold on.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.200
Get this right, or you're leaving.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.200
You will be voting...

08:00.200 --> 08:01.200
Teamcat.net.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.200
Thank you.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.200
All right, thank you.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.200
You even knew the question.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.200
I don't even have the Wii U yet, but Teamcat.

08:05.200 --> 08:06.200
Thank you.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.200
Thank you.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.200
Anybody who's Teamdog, you're not allowed tonight.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.200
That was bullshit that you won.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.200
Get out.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.200
We'll throw you out.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.200
Tuck and roll.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.200
I'm just kidding.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.200
I can see Act Def sitting there at his keyboard fuming.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.200
You're just salty, Rob Roberts.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.200
The salt must flow.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.200
Yes, I am.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.940
Yes, I am salty.

08:24.940 --> 08:28.800
Just dip me in ketchup and feed me to the McDonald's fans.

08:28.800 --> 08:34.240
Speaking of ketchup and food, you did see what I made Friday night as my celebration

08:34.240 --> 08:36.920
of all things American by making Canadian food.

08:36.920 --> 08:37.920
Oh, you made poutine.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.640
I made poutine.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.640
Poutine.

08:40.640 --> 08:44.240
It was your like amalgamation of Canada and 4th of July.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.240
It was your...

08:45.240 --> 08:47.640
And then you know what we had on the 4th of July?

08:47.640 --> 08:48.640
What?

08:48.640 --> 08:50.640
Panda Express!

08:50.640 --> 08:51.640
Cuz murica.

08:51.640 --> 08:52.640
Cuz murica.

08:52.640 --> 08:53.800
Well, let's be real.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.800
That ain't Chinese food.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.800
I know, right?

08:55.800 --> 08:56.800
Oh, don't worry.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.920
There was nothing more murica than me having a burrito for lunch yesterday.

08:59.920 --> 09:00.920
Geez.

09:00.920 --> 09:01.920
That was so fun.

09:01.920 --> 09:02.920
Let's see.

09:02.920 --> 09:07.040
Welcome back to our chat room live.vognetwork.com.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.480
ActDeft in chat says, team dog one, deal with it.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.480
You know what?

09:11.480 --> 09:13.160
I'm gonna give you something to deal with in a minute here.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.800
S2100Matt says, Drew is probably the only 30 year old intern on a gaming podcast.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.920
Is that, is that research?

09:18.920 --> 09:19.920
Is that verifiable?

09:19.920 --> 09:20.920
Can we verify that?

09:20.920 --> 09:21.920
Can we vet that?

09:21.920 --> 09:22.920
Yeah.

09:22.920 --> 09:23.920
Can we vet that?

09:23.920 --> 09:24.920
I wasn't listening to you.

09:24.920 --> 09:31.000
DarkTetsuya in chat says, yeah, last time Drew was on was episode 417, the ninth anniversary.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.240
Hey, I don't update the Wiki for nothing.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.240
Wow.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.240
DarkTetsuya.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.240
Wow.

09:36.240 --> 09:38.240
He's, he's like encyclopedia Britannica of this show.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.080
So you haven't been on the show in about four years.

09:40.080 --> 09:44.640
I'm hoping to make it a little bit more regular, but you know, we never know.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.320
Well, let me, let me level set a bit here.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.380
Cause we do, we do talk about video games here on OLR, believe it or not.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.560
And there's people that, you know, probably never, who is this guy?

09:52.560 --> 09:54.840
Who's this guy you're making jokes with and picking on?

09:54.840 --> 09:59.640
You know, believe it or not, like more people find OLR and actually stick around after they

09:59.640 --> 10:01.260
download an episode or two.

10:01.260 --> 10:04.560
So we have some listeners here that we haven't had, we didn't have four years ago.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.800
So let's reintroduce Drew a little bit to the listeners.

10:07.800 --> 10:13.200
So you're, you're 30 here in the same area where we're at.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.520
What types of video games do you play?

10:14.520 --> 10:15.880
What kind of gamer are you?

10:15.880 --> 10:20.320
Well, primarily these days, well, I've always been a big RPG gamer, um, been dabbling into

10:20.320 --> 10:23.120
final fantasy since, you know, the very start.

10:23.120 --> 10:29.040
So more JRPG stuff, uh, dabbling final fantasy 11 for a while.

10:29.040 --> 10:32.080
Ragnarok online, 14 still play a lot of wow.

10:32.080 --> 10:36.960
Uh, though lately I've been becoming the kind of the stereotypical Atlas nerd real big into

10:36.960 --> 10:41.600
the persona series, but, uh, so you're definitely JRPG.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.280
If you're following Atlas like that, that's usually a sign, right?

10:44.280 --> 10:45.280
Oh yeah.

10:45.280 --> 10:49.260
Edit my seat, waiting for persona five to hit all big tales of fan boy, things like

10:49.260 --> 10:50.260
that.

10:50.260 --> 10:51.720
But, uh, I try to dabble all sorts of stuff.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.800
How many stuffed printies do you own?

10:53.800 --> 10:55.840
Um, just the one actually.

10:55.840 --> 10:56.840
Just one?

10:56.840 --> 10:57.840
Okay.

10:57.840 --> 11:04.200
Uh, you know, collection going, but I, uh, they explode too often, you know, uh, they're

11:04.200 --> 11:05.200
up to what?

11:05.200 --> 11:06.680
Disgaea five just came out in Japan.

11:06.680 --> 11:07.680
Is that here?

11:07.680 --> 11:08.680
I can't remember.

11:08.680 --> 11:09.680
Yeah.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.560
I haven't big that been that big into this, uh, Disgaea series, uh, when my strategy fix

11:13.560 --> 11:15.640
had been mostly into Fire Emblem lately.

11:15.640 --> 11:16.640
Okay.

11:16.640 --> 11:20.000
That game was in the news a lot last week with strategy waifu simulator.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Yeah.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Yeah.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Okay.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.520
Uh, so you're, you're mostly JRPGs, uh, console favorite console that you play on or are you

11:27.520 --> 11:33.320
more PC, Mac, still kind of evenly split between PC and PS three.

11:33.320 --> 11:37.440
I'm trying to get into PS four and, and, uh, is, is getting more games up there.

11:37.440 --> 11:41.800
I'm probably one of the only people alive that still owns a Vita, but you know, persona.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.680
We're going to talk about that in a little bit, actually you're not, and we'll talk about

11:44.680 --> 11:52.120
why in a little bit, but, uh, yeah, just a Mr. RPG still play a few music games, still

11:52.120 --> 11:57.760
hyped up for rock band for, uh, whenever they decide to fully release that.

11:57.760 --> 12:01.600
So kind of waiting for the song list, but you know, some of it's creeping out there.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.380
What do you think about the whole fact that you can use your old library with rock band

12:05.380 --> 12:06.380
four?

12:06.380 --> 12:07.380
I think that's rad.

12:07.380 --> 12:10.600
Well, I'd hate to have all that, uh, TLC be for nothing here.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.800
Well, here's the thing.

12:11.800 --> 12:16.800
It was actually, I would say it was about a good 25% of what factored my decision to

12:16.800 --> 12:22.440
finally buy an Xbox one was the fact that all my rock band songs are on three 60 and

12:22.440 --> 12:26.320
they, they will, if you get Xbox one, you will be able to bring in the three 60s library.

12:26.320 --> 12:31.400
That was part of my decision to get a PS four, come to think of it as like, if they decided

12:31.400 --> 12:35.280
to ignore, you know, completely ignore that I'm like, I'd probably be all torches and

12:35.280 --> 12:37.360
pitch pitch works about it.

12:37.360 --> 12:43.320
Um, let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vog network.com, uh, tech 2030 and

12:43.320 --> 12:45.240
chat says, quote, tales of a fan boy.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.520
I already like them.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.640
There it is.

12:47.640 --> 12:48.640
They like you drew it.

12:48.640 --> 12:49.640
They really like you.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.120
Um, let's see, what do you mean?

12:51.120 --> 12:54.720
Well, we'll get into your gaming weeks a little later, but, uh, let's talk about some of your

12:54.720 --> 12:55.720
very favorite.

12:55.720 --> 12:59.040
I always like to ask what's like your favorite game of all time period.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.040
Oh geez.

13:00.040 --> 13:05.080
Um, I'd have to pander to Jamie and probably see it somewhere close to the guardian legend.

13:05.080 --> 13:09.080
Uh, that's pandering to me too, although tales of the abyss comes close.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.080
Okay.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.920
It is almost in all fashion is a perfect RPG.

13:11.920 --> 13:12.920
All right.

13:12.920 --> 13:13.920
Awesome.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.920
Awesome.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.960
Uh, how did you meet all of us here at OLR?

13:16.960 --> 13:22.600
Oh God, everybody was in the DDR scene over in Roseville and, uh, happened to see you

13:22.600 --> 13:28.400
guys play in DDR one day, uh, went to, uh, went out on vacation in New York, saw this

13:28.400 --> 13:34.160
podcast is like, wait, I know these folks wound up tuning into what was very, very first

13:34.160 --> 13:36.040
episode of OLR.

13:36.040 --> 13:41.560
You, you are part of the circle of 12 you there's, there were 12 people that listened

13:41.560 --> 13:42.880
to the first episode of OLR.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.480
We know dark Tetsuya was one JV Mon was one, and now you're one, I mean, hell I was there

13:46.480 --> 13:49.800
and I wasn't even listening.

13:49.800 --> 13:50.800
You're not listening now.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.360
So you listen, how else did I respond?

13:54.360 --> 13:57.760
She just selected very, she'll be doing her thing.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.280
Like, you know, I'm typing, I'm typing, I'm typing.

13:59.280 --> 14:03.600
And then just, I randomly will say, and then, Oh man, that really, that moment really sucked

14:03.600 --> 14:04.600
in dragon age.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.600
And then she'll perk up.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.600
What are you talking about?

14:06.600 --> 14:07.600
About my dragon age.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.600
What, what, what?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.320
I am not writing fanfiction during the show tonight.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.320
Thank you for the first time.

14:11.320 --> 14:14.040
I'm already three chapters ahead.

14:14.040 --> 14:17.400
She worked at, she worked ahead everybody so she could participate tonight.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.400
Good job.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
All right.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.400
Anyway.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.400
Read my fanfic.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.400
Damn it.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.400
All, all, uh, all that joking aside.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.400
So, okay.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.560
So you discovered our show and you were on the other coast.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.560
Just by coincidence.

14:27.560 --> 14:28.560
Yeah.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.400
I just have to be in, in upstate New York on summer vacation.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.640
I was like, I need something to watch here.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.400
I'm bored out of my skull.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.400
Need something to listen to.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.400
I need something to do.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.400
I was like, okay, fine.

14:37.400 --> 14:41.880
Well, I, you know, this, this whole live 360, whatever it is site, sure.

14:41.880 --> 14:42.880
I'll go for it.

14:42.880 --> 14:43.880
Yeah.

14:43.880 --> 14:44.880
Why not?

14:44.880 --> 14:45.880
And a dial up friendly radio.

14:45.880 --> 14:46.880
That's what we used to be.

14:46.880 --> 14:47.880
All right.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.240
Uh, before we move on and get into some more modern, what have you been doing this week

14:50.240 --> 14:52.760
in games and in the gaming news for this week?

14:52.760 --> 14:53.760
One more question.

14:53.760 --> 14:58.040
Since you did mention you were a DDR fan and you, uh, were brought to this show through

14:58.040 --> 15:02.520
all of our mutual love of DDR back in the day, favorite mix and favorite song.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.520
Oh geez.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.280
Don't you pick one only one.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.280
Oh man.

15:07.280 --> 15:11.960
No ties on the record.

15:11.960 --> 15:16.320
Get the Wiki ready to update.

15:16.320 --> 15:21.160
The thing is, I have to say my favorite song is, is my usual warmup song.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.340
It's why it's, it's on every mix these days.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.720
It's always the first song I play just to get warmed up.

15:25.720 --> 15:29.880
Uh, so fifth mix, which I guess is kind of the black sheep of the series.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.840
You don't see too many machines out there of it.

15:31.840 --> 15:36.040
Uh, but that's why, that's why it's a lot of people's favorite abyss DJ Taka abyss.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.040
Okay.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.040
That's a good pic.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.600
Low second goes to summer vacation, but that was a 2DX song.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.440
That was a 2DX song.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.440
That never even made it to DDR.

15:44.440 --> 15:47.080
I think they finally did put it in DDR like way later.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.760
I think it was in like a home version at some point.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.040
So there you go.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.040
All right.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.040
Very cool.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.480
Well, Drew, you feel free to pipe in if you need to on the news.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.320
I know we were talking a little bit about, uh, some of the things we're talking about

15:57.320 --> 15:58.320
tonight.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.640
I know you have some things to say as a PC gamer on some of the things going on lately.

16:01.640 --> 16:02.740
So we'll get into some of that.

16:02.740 --> 16:03.740
Feel free to chime in as necessary.

16:03.740 --> 16:10.300
Uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com zappy in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

16:10.300 --> 16:14.060
says over here in French, Canada, we just had poutine fest this weekend.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.700
I love poutine so much.

16:15.700 --> 16:16.700
Why was I not invited?

16:16.700 --> 16:17.700
I know.

16:17.700 --> 16:18.700
Where's our invite zappy?

16:18.700 --> 16:19.700
What's up with that?

16:19.700 --> 16:20.700
Well, you know what?

16:20.700 --> 16:22.340
You know what they had up the hill in Reno?

16:22.340 --> 16:23.940
Cause we almost went to Reno this weekend.

16:23.940 --> 16:26.020
So while they've got poutine fest in Canada, you know what they have in Reno?

16:26.020 --> 16:27.580
Angry I lost all my money fest?

16:27.580 --> 16:28.580
No.

16:28.580 --> 16:29.580
Chicken wing fest.

16:29.580 --> 16:30.580
Right?

16:30.580 --> 16:31.580
Where's my invite?

16:31.580 --> 16:32.580
Jesus.

16:32.580 --> 16:33.580
That's it.

16:33.580 --> 16:38.340
We just need to have like a cooking on the show night and I'll just make poutine.

16:38.340 --> 16:39.340
I love that idea.

16:39.340 --> 16:40.340
That's a great idea.

16:40.340 --> 16:41.340
Uh, let's see.

16:41.340 --> 16:42.820
I still have a bag of cheese curds at home.

16:42.820 --> 16:45.380
Uh, Ragenator in chat says upstate New York.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.380
Cool.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.380
I'm from Buffalo.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.380
Uh, it was Watertown at the time out in Fort Drum.

16:49.380 --> 16:50.860
I have no idea where those places are.

16:50.860 --> 16:52.580
I went to Poughkeepsie for like three days.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.060
We'll just say Southern Canada.

16:54.060 --> 16:55.060
Okay.

16:55.060 --> 16:57.060
That's pretty much what it was.

16:57.060 --> 16:58.700
It was like 20 miles to the border.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.180
Did you go to poutine fest?

17:00.180 --> 17:02.540
I wish.

17:02.540 --> 17:03.540
Poutine's awesome.

17:03.540 --> 17:04.540
All right.

17:04.540 --> 17:08.180
Uh, let's get into how was your gaming week and the types of video games that you have

17:08.180 --> 17:09.780
been playing this week.

17:09.780 --> 17:10.780
Dark soccer.

17:10.780 --> 17:11.780
We'll start with you.

17:11.780 --> 17:12.780
You had a pretty big week, huh?

17:12.780 --> 17:13.780
Kinda.

17:13.780 --> 17:15.860
Well, he just fixed my computer today.

17:15.860 --> 17:22.180
Um, Dragon Age Inquisition broke my computer kinda and now it's fixed before like my fans

17:22.180 --> 17:24.380
would just kick in like blah.

17:24.380 --> 17:28.420
So we put in four more fans and doubled my ram and now my computer is like, Oh, I love

17:28.420 --> 17:29.540
Dragon Age Inquisition.

17:29.540 --> 17:31.020
How quaint.

17:31.020 --> 17:32.900
And no problem at all.

17:32.900 --> 17:37.660
Um, I actually did log in a little bit for Final Fantasy 14.

17:37.660 --> 17:43.380
Um, I'm going to be trying to set at least a night a week to do my progression stuff.

17:43.380 --> 17:46.900
Um, and we got a PS4 this week.

17:46.900 --> 17:54.080
So Dan's been playing Battlemon and I very, very, very much have decided that the next

17:54.080 --> 18:00.300
game that I'm going to get is going to be Puyo Puyo Tetris, but I, um, probably going

18:00.300 --> 18:05.100
to have to wait until a couple of weeks before I order it from Playage or something.

18:05.100 --> 18:09.540
But I really, really, really, really, really, really, really want Puyo Puyo Tetris because

18:09.540 --> 18:13.700
it's fucking Puyo Puyo and Tetris.

18:13.700 --> 18:17.940
And then I've been like polling people for other good games and I don't know, cause people

18:17.940 --> 18:21.100
keep mentioning genre that I'm not really a big fan of.

18:21.100 --> 18:26.380
Like I don't like a lot of first person shooters and I don't like a lot of games that have

18:26.380 --> 18:29.820
a lot of crazy ass motion in it cause I will throw up on people.

18:29.820 --> 18:33.880
I think, uh, I, I use, you asked this on Twitter, which you're using Twitter again.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.880
What is up with that?

18:34.880 --> 18:35.880
I know.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.880
I just decided to.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.720
You got to get, get with the cool kids on Twitter.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.720
We're super cool.

18:39.720 --> 18:42.780
I was, no, cause I did my hipster thing for a while and didn't want to be on Twitter cause

18:42.780 --> 18:43.780
it was too mainstream.

18:43.780 --> 18:44.780
Mm hmm.

18:44.780 --> 18:45.780
Well, welcome to the mainstream.

18:45.780 --> 18:46.780
I was on Tumblr.

18:46.780 --> 18:49.820
Do, uh, now Tumblr, Yahoo owns Tumblr.

18:49.820 --> 18:50.820
Tell me that ain't mainstream.

18:50.820 --> 18:51.820
Yeah.

18:51.820 --> 18:52.820
And then I went on Ello.

18:52.820 --> 18:57.380
Anyway, uh, I think Flaco Jones had some really good suggestions for you, especially, and

18:57.380 --> 19:01.700
I really have to recommend for you in particular velocity two X, I think is a really good pick

19:01.700 --> 19:05.140
because you know, we, we joke about our love of the guardian legend, but it's actually

19:05.140 --> 19:06.140
not a joke.

19:06.140 --> 19:07.140
We really love that game.

19:07.140 --> 19:08.140
And velocity two X.

19:08.140 --> 19:12.380
The only kind of difference is instead of being, it obviously has the shooter bits,

19:12.380 --> 19:16.580
but then instead of being like an RPG over the shoulder type of thing, it's more like

19:16.580 --> 19:18.740
a platformer in that part.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.640
Otherwise it's, it's very similar.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.740
So is that like just online only?

19:22.740 --> 19:23.740
Yeah.

19:23.740 --> 19:25.300
It's like an online $10 download type of thing.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.300
Okay.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.300
Yeah.

19:27.340 --> 19:31.660
It's like PlayStation four, but I think velocity two X is on like steam and I think it's one

19:31.660 --> 19:32.660
of those.

19:32.660 --> 19:33.660
It's multi it's all over the place.

19:33.660 --> 19:34.660
I have to check that out.

19:34.660 --> 19:35.660
Yeah.

19:35.660 --> 19:36.660
Yeah.

19:36.660 --> 19:37.660
I think you'd like that too.

19:37.660 --> 19:38.660
And that's an indie game.

19:38.660 --> 19:40.840
So I don't feel bad about whoring it for free here on the show.

19:40.840 --> 19:46.240
So well, I've, I've been trying to think of like more actual disc based games to add to

19:46.240 --> 19:47.240
the collection.

19:47.240 --> 19:52.780
Cause I mean, we only have Batman right now and a few things that were, and I was so angry

19:52.780 --> 19:59.820
because PT was sitting there in my library online and I'm like, you bastards, somebody

19:59.820 --> 20:00.820
will feed.

20:00.820 --> 20:02.740
That's going to be the thing that gets people to hack a PS four.

20:02.740 --> 20:03.740
Just wait.

20:03.740 --> 20:04.740
Yeah.

20:04.740 --> 20:08.500
If it's not already doable to put PT on there somehow, but I, but I think we're pretty much

20:08.500 --> 20:13.220
decided it's going to be Puyo Puyo Tetris is the next game we want.

20:13.220 --> 20:14.220
So there you go.

20:14.220 --> 20:15.220
All right.

20:15.220 --> 20:17.260
Well, congratulations on the new PS four.

20:17.260 --> 20:20.980
Just if you have PS plus stay on top of that and download your free games cause like velocity

20:20.980 --> 20:22.240
was a free game at one point.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.920
So Dan's doing it on his account and we're just going to add mine as a secondary.

20:25.920 --> 20:26.920
Good.

20:26.920 --> 20:27.920
Smart.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.440
Um, Dan's is gun star.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.960
Mine is dark Sakura, O R. Is there an underscore or anything?

20:32.960 --> 20:33.960
Nope.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.680
I need to add you if I ever sign into it.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.320
Oh, do it for me.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.320
Dark soccer.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.320
Do it for me.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.320
I'll do it for the children.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.320
All right.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.320
Just, just do it.

20:43.320 --> 20:46.400
Don't let your dreams be dreams.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.400
I will.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.400
Don't dream it.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.400
And be it.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.400
Let's move on to tech master Loki.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.400
How was your gaming week?

20:51.560 --> 20:52.560
Um, it was okay.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.560
I mostly worked on my game.

20:54.560 --> 20:59.680
Um, but I did play a few things, uh, one being, which is, I'm actually playing right now.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.560
Portal stories, Mel.

21:01.560 --> 21:09.320
It's like a free to, uh, free to download if you have, um, portal to, um, expansion

21:09.320 --> 21:16.580
or a fan made game, I guess this is what people do when valve is allergic to the number three

21:16.580 --> 21:17.580
type of thing.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.580
Yeah.

21:18.580 --> 21:19.660
So it's like a side story type thing.

21:19.980 --> 21:23.800
It's another test subject that was testing the sleep chambers and of course the sleep

21:23.800 --> 21:25.580
chambers didn't work right.

21:25.580 --> 21:31.660
And so she's in the future now and it's hilarious because you know, they've got it, all of it's

21:31.660 --> 21:32.660
voice acted.

21:32.660 --> 21:36.340
They have cave Johnson in there, but you know, another person doing his voice and then they

21:36.340 --> 21:41.840
have another, um, personality sphere that's helping me along and it's just got that same

21:41.840 --> 21:45.780
type of humor, but the puzzles are really damn hard.

21:45.780 --> 21:47.460
So just keep that in mind.

21:48.180 --> 21:51.980
It's kind of nice though, as you get to actually see the outside of like, uh, aperture science,

21:51.980 --> 21:52.980
which is kind of cool.

21:52.980 --> 21:54.420
So you get to wander around through that.

21:54.420 --> 21:58.160
Um, but yes, the puzzles are damn hard.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.940
So just keep that in mind.

21:59.940 --> 22:06.140
Sounds to me like they got Mel from the original second player for co-op mode.

22:06.140 --> 22:07.380
Possibly.

22:07.380 --> 22:09.980
I don't know what the story is behind that.

22:09.980 --> 22:14.840
Um, and then the other thing I played was called the do modern warfare two because my,

22:14.840 --> 22:19.880
my old coworkers want to play and so I played just like old times.

22:19.880 --> 22:20.880
Yep.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.800
And I beat him just like old times.

22:23.800 --> 22:24.800
Keep them in their place.

22:24.800 --> 22:25.800
Loki.

22:25.800 --> 22:26.800
Yeah.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.920
So they're like, well, we were having fun until you came make, make them remember why

22:28.920 --> 22:30.560
they didn't want to play with you anymore.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.560
Exactly.

22:31.560 --> 22:35.360
Well, they just have to bring their ringers with them and then, then they actually, I

22:35.360 --> 22:39.240
have a hard time keeping up with them because you know, it's wow.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.240
Love it.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.240
All right.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.160
Uh, if that's it for your gaming week, I think that's it.

22:43.160 --> 22:45.560
Then, uh, Drew, how about you?

22:45.560 --> 22:46.560
How was your game?

22:46.560 --> 22:47.720
I've been all over the place.

22:47.720 --> 22:54.080
Um, been mostly focused on PC this week was really struggling to enjoy a certain PC game

22:54.080 --> 22:57.400
that shall remain nameless for right now.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.920
But barring that I switched over to my 3DS.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.920
You can, we talked a little bit about this last week.

23:01.920 --> 23:02.920
Yeah.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.760
A few optimization woes as Arkham Knight.

23:04.760 --> 23:09.720
We'll put it like that, um, switched my 3DS for a while, knocked out a little bit of persona

23:09.720 --> 23:11.400
queue, a little dungeon diving there.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.400
Hold on.

23:12.400 --> 23:13.400
Let me back you up.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.800
Cause I, I just have to, cause you know, when we were reporting on the, the, uh, Arkham

23:16.800 --> 23:20.040
Knight stuff last year, I shouldn't say reporting, but discussing the Arkham Knight stuff last

23:20.040 --> 23:21.080
week, cause we don't break news.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.640
We just try to fix it.

23:22.640 --> 23:27.640
Um, we were talking about the Arkham Knight woes, but to be fair, I haven't played it

23:27.640 --> 23:28.640
on PC.

23:28.640 --> 23:29.880
I don't think either of my co-hosts have.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.120
How bad is it Drew?

23:31.120 --> 23:32.120
Oh God.

23:32.120 --> 23:39.040
Uh, I can turn V-Sync off and get 25 frames usually.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.920
I don't have a modest system.

23:40.920 --> 23:46.080
Uh, the minute I turn V-Sync on, five frames per second.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.600
So that's the biggest problem is just the frame rate is shit.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.600
Yeah.

23:49.600 --> 23:50.600
Frame rate is absolute crap.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.200
Uh, the game itself is fun.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.360
It's just the specs and optimization.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.360
It was a shitty port.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.200
But it's like one of those old flip books where you flip through the pictures.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.200
Exactly.

24:00.200 --> 24:04.280
It's like, I'm not, I'm not terribly pissed off about it.

24:04.280 --> 24:08.520
I can wait, but I'd rather not have to.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.760
But uh, you know, after struggling with that and trying to find things to make it work

24:11.760 --> 24:16.360
better, I decided to just grab my 3DS, play a little Persona Q, uh, try and finally finish

24:16.360 --> 24:17.480
Fire Emblem Awakening.

24:17.480 --> 24:23.800
I keep on getting distracted, uh, got in some MKX even though I kind of suck at it and started

24:23.800 --> 24:29.060
playing probably one of the most beautiful games I've ever played in my life, uh, courtesy

24:29.060 --> 24:30.060
of Steam.

24:30.060 --> 24:34.680
Cause usually it's, uh, otherwise be a, uh, Xbox one exclusive, uh, Ori and the Blind

24:34.680 --> 24:35.680
Forest.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.000
Oh, I've heard a lot of good things about this game.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.680
Uh, Xtifer, uh, my buddy Xtifer is a big fan of this.

24:40.680 --> 24:44.600
It is an absolutely beautiful metroidvania.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
Hmm.

24:46.600 --> 24:50.360
And I'm really looking forward to, you know, getting some more abilities there and kind

24:50.360 --> 24:53.600
of blast my way through the game and kind of seeing all the scenery.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.600
Excellent.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.720
All right, well have fun with it.

24:56.720 --> 24:59.320
So you're playing that on Steam, not X, oh you don't own Xbox one.

24:59.320 --> 25:02.760
I don't own Xbox one, I'm, I'm firmly in the Sony camp at this point.

25:02.760 --> 25:07.440
No ill will towards Xbox, I'm just kind of in the little Sony ecosystem right now.

25:07.440 --> 25:10.480
It's expensive to have both.

25:10.480 --> 25:11.480
Trust me.

25:11.480 --> 25:15.680
Cause I just, I just finally got the Xbox one and it's a little, a little expensive.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.680
It's expensive.

25:16.680 --> 25:17.680
Happy, expensive.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.680
Happy.

25:18.680 --> 25:19.680
Anyway.

25:19.680 --> 25:20.680
Um, Mikey Mueg.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.840
Uh, so, okay, here's a funny story.

25:23.840 --> 25:27.360
So Drew mentioned a minute ago that he's one of the few like people that like still owns

25:27.360 --> 25:28.360
Evita.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.360
Right.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.360
So here's the thing.

25:30.360 --> 25:34.040
Um, I had a birthday, uh, around the same time that OLR did.

25:34.040 --> 25:37.000
And um, you know, I don't, I don't expect that I'm going to get a lot of presents or

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
whatever.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.440
I'm not usually like big on the whole, like expecting gifts and all that stuff.

25:41.440 --> 25:46.880
Uh, but especially with somebody like Alan, uh, we don't oftentimes really know what to

25:46.880 --> 25:47.880
get each other.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.920
We're at a fortunate enough place in our lives where we want something, we just kind of go

25:50.920 --> 25:51.920
get it.

25:51.920 --> 25:53.880
And our tastes are like, I'm not saying like we're rich or anything.

25:53.880 --> 25:58.120
We don't get to do extravagant things, but for the most part of the things that we need,

25:58.120 --> 26:00.080
we kind of are able to take care of.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.680
So it makes it very hard to be able to buy presents for each other.

26:02.680 --> 26:08.680
In fact, the funny part of that is that, um, the first gift that Alan actually bought

26:08.680 --> 26:13.480
for me was a Ness Amiibo because he knew that I was kicking and screaming about that whole

26:13.480 --> 26:17.560
GameStop preorder thing was bullshit and I want a Ness Amiibo and I'm just going to preorder

26:17.560 --> 26:19.320
one from Japan or whatever.

26:19.320 --> 26:23.680
So he actually went onto one of those auction things and paid the money to get me a Ness

26:23.680 --> 26:29.300
Amiibo only to find out that I was able to get one on Playasia and I also got a Ness

26:29.300 --> 26:30.300
Amiibo.

26:30.300 --> 26:31.300
And then Shane got one too.

26:31.420 --> 26:33.580
I was getting like three Ness Amiibo.

26:33.580 --> 26:35.820
So oops on that.

26:35.820 --> 26:38.940
So Alan had to go back to the drawing board and figure out what's he going to get me that

26:38.940 --> 26:40.740
I'm definitely not going to buy for myself.

26:40.740 --> 26:49.060
So you can imagine my shock when Monday the gift arrived and I opened it up and Alan had

26:49.060 --> 26:53.620
bought me because I had made a comment once about, Oh my God, that's so gorgeous.

26:53.620 --> 26:54.620
I want that.

26:54.620 --> 26:55.620
Oh my God.

26:55.620 --> 26:56.620
But that's going to be expensive.

26:56.900 --> 27:05.180
You know, uh, Alan bought me the Heavensward PlayStation Vita from Japan imported.

27:05.180 --> 27:10.300
So here it is right here and it's one of the 2.0 models and you can see, so it's a little

27:10.300 --> 27:14.340
lighter and thinner and uh, if you want to mess around with this just so you can see

27:14.340 --> 27:15.340
how it feels.

27:15.340 --> 27:16.340
I will fight you for that.

27:16.340 --> 27:21.000
No, you will not have the original model, but you can see there on the back, it's got

27:21.000 --> 27:25.820
like the Heavensward decorations and then it actually came with a Heavensward theme.

27:25.820 --> 27:29.880
So if I actually turned it on here a little bit, you can actually see the little splash

27:29.880 --> 27:31.860
screen is the Heavensward, like a little screen.

27:31.860 --> 27:34.940
Then when you open it up, it actually plays music from the game.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.420
So you know what, Rob?

27:41.420 --> 27:42.420
It's rad.

27:42.420 --> 27:43.420
Like I'm not even going to lie.

27:43.420 --> 27:44.420
This thing is rad.

27:44.420 --> 27:48.300
This kind of makes this sort of system cousins because I have the WonderSwan color for Final

27:48.300 --> 27:52.500
Fantasy.

27:52.500 --> 27:55.220
Our WonderSwan and our PlayStation Vita are distantly related.

27:55.620 --> 27:56.620
Yeah, they're distantly related.

27:56.620 --> 27:57.620
Yeah.

27:57.620 --> 28:00.060
And now I get to loan you a buttload of games for Vita.

28:00.060 --> 28:01.060
I'm excited.

28:01.060 --> 28:02.060
Well, here's the thing.

28:02.060 --> 28:03.140
Okay, but here's the thing, Drew.

28:03.140 --> 28:06.780
I already own a PlayStation Vita American.

28:06.780 --> 28:08.400
I bought one of the earlier models.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.580
So this is not the first one you had.

28:10.580 --> 28:11.580
Not the first one.

28:11.580 --> 28:15.220
So you might be one of the few people that actually owns a Vita.

28:15.220 --> 28:16.660
And you're one of the few people that own two.

28:16.660 --> 28:17.660
That owns two.

28:17.660 --> 28:20.460
And you're going to lend one to Jamie.

28:20.460 --> 28:22.140
And the market just doubled.

28:22.140 --> 28:23.700
Thank you, Sony.

28:23.700 --> 28:24.700
Here's what I did.

28:25.180 --> 28:26.980
I'm actually very proud of myself for figuring out how to do this.

28:26.980 --> 28:27.980
I used to...

28:27.980 --> 28:28.980
I didn't do it all myself.

28:28.980 --> 28:29.980
I used tutorials and stuff.

28:29.980 --> 28:32.420
But I actually went online.

28:32.420 --> 28:34.600
I registered a Japanese account.

28:34.600 --> 28:38.300
And that's a Japanese region or whatever, PlayStation Vita.

28:38.300 --> 28:42.380
And I figured out how to redeem the code for Heaven's Word so I could actually get that

28:42.380 --> 28:43.900
theme or whatever.

28:43.900 --> 28:44.900
So I'm actually very proud of myself.

28:44.900 --> 28:47.260
So now that is my Japanese system.

28:47.260 --> 28:48.780
And then the other one is my American system.

28:48.780 --> 28:52.740
Because you know the Vita is way better supported in Japan than it is here anyway.

28:52.740 --> 28:56.540
And I'm looking in the store and I'm like, I want Taiko no Tatujin.

28:56.540 --> 28:57.540
They have that for the Vita?

28:57.540 --> 28:58.900
I'm like, I'm going to get that.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.560
And then there's all sorts of other games as well.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.780
So now I just have to get a card that has money on it.

29:03.780 --> 29:06.500
So I'll just get one of those from Playasia or whatever.

29:06.500 --> 29:10.420
Anyway, Alan wants to say a little something about the Heaven's Word Vita.

29:10.420 --> 29:11.660
He's here at the studio.

29:11.660 --> 29:14.940
It also comes with a very pretty box that we get to show off.

29:14.940 --> 29:17.700
Which I brought into studio.

29:17.700 --> 29:22.380
And also, don't expect anything like that for Christmas.

29:23.140 --> 29:28.060
It's not that I don't care about Christmas, but it's a different holiday to me.

29:28.060 --> 29:31.740
And since we both have summer birthdays, if I'm going to spoil the shit out of you, the

29:31.740 --> 29:33.380
birthday is the big one for Christmas.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.860
I'll just get you like a Target card or something.

29:35.860 --> 29:38.340
At least he's honest.

29:38.340 --> 29:39.340
That's all.

29:39.340 --> 29:40.340
My favorite.

29:40.340 --> 29:43.700
First, he brought the box in to show off on the radio show.

29:43.700 --> 29:46.500
Just so y'all know, anyway.

29:46.500 --> 29:49.580
But also, here's the other thing I love about it is that Alan told me.

29:49.580 --> 29:55.140
He said, you know, a part of that gift, just so you know, is the insane amount of jealousy

29:55.140 --> 29:58.060
that Shayna's going to have towards you because I got you that.

29:58.060 --> 30:01.340
You know what else I think is funny is that Heaven's Word isn't on Vita.

30:01.340 --> 30:02.940
Yeah, right?

30:02.940 --> 30:06.140
They have a whole Heaven's Word Vita and Heaven's Word isn't even on Vita.

30:06.140 --> 30:10.460
But certainly the PlayStation 4 Remote Play, a lot of people are doing the crafting and

30:10.460 --> 30:13.180
gathering on the Vita from PlayStation 4.

30:13.180 --> 30:15.980
So that's kind of a little thing.

30:15.980 --> 30:19.340
Ladies and gentlemen of the internet, please feel free to use your imaginations on that

30:19.340 --> 30:20.340
box.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.340
Right?

30:21.340 --> 30:22.700
It's just got butts and dicks all over it.

30:22.700 --> 30:23.820
No, it does not have butts and dicks.

30:23.820 --> 30:24.820
I could take a picture.

30:24.820 --> 30:27.300
It can have butts and dicks on it in a few minutes.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.940
I don't even want to think about that.

30:28.940 --> 30:29.940
Excuse me.

30:29.940 --> 30:30.940
I have to leave the room and heave.

30:30.940 --> 30:37.140
SSG100Matt in chat over at live.vognetware.com says, no, no, no, Shayna will be like, whatever.

30:37.140 --> 30:40.340
No, I think this one actually did get a response out of him.

30:40.340 --> 30:44.940
It was more like, I hate you and that type of thing.

30:44.940 --> 30:45.940
Act Deaf degrees.

30:45.940 --> 30:47.820
I do want Taiko no Tatsujin Vita though.

30:47.820 --> 30:48.820
Yeah.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.660
I'm like, I don't want that.

30:51.660 --> 30:53.140
That'd be awesome.

30:53.140 --> 30:57.560
So anyhow, other games that I played besides messing around with the new system.

30:57.560 --> 31:02.220
Thank you, Alan, for the new Vita that I said I wanted and didn't actually think I'd get.

31:02.220 --> 31:03.620
That's awesome.

31:03.620 --> 31:08.540
I was still playing around with the Xbox One a little bit, playing more Forza Horizon 2,

31:08.540 --> 31:13.300
which I have to voice something that kind of ticked me off about Horizon 2 as much as

31:13.300 --> 31:14.300
I love the game.

31:14.300 --> 31:15.940
And it's a solid racer.

31:15.940 --> 31:19.060
And having also played Drive Club a little bit this week.

31:19.060 --> 31:20.060
Here we go.

31:20.060 --> 31:21.060
No, I'm sorry.

31:21.060 --> 31:24.660
Forza Horizon 2 is just like probably the best racing game right now.

31:24.660 --> 31:25.660
It really is.

31:25.660 --> 31:28.420
Until maybe there's a new burnout to try and challenge it or something.

31:28.420 --> 31:32.180
I really think Forza Horizon 2 is like the best racing game right now.

31:32.180 --> 31:37.420
But here's the thing that ticked me off about it is that, okay, so I'm doing a race and

31:37.420 --> 31:38.420
what have you.

31:38.420 --> 31:43.220
So I finish up the sequence of races and then suddenly it cuts away to a trailer and I'm

31:43.220 --> 31:46.420
like, oh, it's like another one of those in-game cutscenes where it's going to be this

31:46.420 --> 31:49.580
whole bad Fast and Furious thing where the guy's going to tell me to go to a new city.

31:49.580 --> 31:53.860
And it's like, this island just opened up and we have to go and there's all new races

31:53.860 --> 31:55.620
and da-da-da-da-da and all this stuff.

31:55.620 --> 31:59.460
It's a fucking ad for their DLC, the Storm Island DLC or whatever.

31:59.460 --> 32:04.060
And so at the end of this, just woven right into the gameplay trailer that they do, they're

32:04.060 --> 32:06.100
like, press Y now to buy it for $20.

32:06.100 --> 32:13.180
And I'm like, as interested as I am in something like that, I will clear the base game.

32:13.180 --> 32:15.620
Then I'll buy an expansion thing.

32:15.620 --> 32:17.900
I'm not going to buy the expansion until I finish the base game.

32:17.900 --> 32:18.900
No, no, no.

32:18.900 --> 32:19.900
Buy our shit now.

32:19.900 --> 32:20.900
Don't wait.

32:20.900 --> 32:21.900
Do it now.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.060
No, as, but here, as if that wasn't good enough.

32:24.060 --> 32:25.760
So I hit no, thank you.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.540
And so it gives me the next mission and programs into the GPS where to go next.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.540
I'm like, all right.

32:30.540 --> 32:35.080
So I drive and I'm driving to the harbor and I'm like, why is the goal point that I'm driving

32:35.080 --> 32:36.900
to the Storm Island Harbor?

32:36.900 --> 32:40.660
I get to the harbor and I press X to finish the mission or whatever.

32:40.660 --> 32:47.220
And it said, you can deport or you can depart for Storm Island now by spending $19.99.

32:47.220 --> 32:48.700
I'm like, really?

32:48.700 --> 32:53.300
This fucking game just made it a mission for me to go and like spend the money.

32:53.300 --> 32:56.660
And so I, I did what any gamer would do in this day and age.

32:56.660 --> 33:00.340
I went on Twitter and I wrote some angry things.

33:00.340 --> 33:01.860
But did you throw your controller?

33:01.860 --> 33:03.500
No, God, those controls are expensive.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.060
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:05.060 --> 33:09.940
That's not what we, that's, that's what happened, Drew, that's what happened.

33:09.940 --> 33:11.460
We don't, we don't throw controllers anymore.

33:11.460 --> 33:13.920
We go on Twitter and say something mean.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.400
That's what we do is that's what I did.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.660
I went on Twitter and I said something mean, and then I got it out of my system.

33:18.660 --> 33:20.020
So there it is.

33:20.020 --> 33:24.840
I was just a little irritated, a lot of irritated that Forza Horizon.

33:24.840 --> 33:27.100
Outside of that, I still love the game.

33:27.100 --> 33:30.680
But seriously, stop shoving that DLC down our throats.

33:30.680 --> 33:32.020
It's tacky.

33:32.020 --> 33:36.860
Like I get, if you want to put in the menu, a little banner now available, or even if

33:36.860 --> 33:41.300
on the little radio station, a DJ comes on and says, Hey, check out the store.

33:41.300 --> 33:42.300
There's some new DLC.

33:42.300 --> 33:46.060
Like I understand, but like to like go so far as to make it the next mission for me

33:46.060 --> 33:47.060
to do.

33:47.060 --> 33:48.060
Yeah.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.060
That won't be breaking immersion or anything.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.060
Hey, there's DLC on the store.

33:50.060 --> 33:51.620
Oh my, that was just so tacky.

33:51.620 --> 33:56.420
Oh, like an interruption of your mission isn't immersion breaking as it is?

33:56.420 --> 33:57.420
Yeah.

33:57.420 --> 34:01.200
Weiland in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, I do like storm Island though.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.900
It's the only DLC I bought for the game.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.780
I'm sure it's amazing.

34:04.780 --> 34:08.620
But my whole thing is that I don't want to go and spend more money to extend the game

34:08.620 --> 34:11.340
when I have barely scratched the surface of the game to be in with.

34:11.340 --> 34:14.060
Like I've still got like a hundred races I got to do in the game.

34:14.060 --> 34:16.140
I've got plenty to do without the DLC.

34:16.140 --> 34:17.140
That's my whole thing.

34:17.140 --> 34:20.740
When I get through all that, will I probably end up getting storm Island?

34:20.740 --> 34:22.060
Yeah, probably.

34:22.060 --> 34:27.500
So Bobby Black Wolf says, for most people, that storm Island cut scene showed up well

34:27.500 --> 34:31.340
after you beat the game because of the timing, but yeah, that sounds like bad timing.

34:31.340 --> 34:32.340
That's a good point.

34:32.340 --> 34:35.180
I'm probably seeing this where I'm seeing it and a lot of other people are like, what

34:35.180 --> 34:36.180
is wrong?

34:36.180 --> 34:37.180
Rob?

34:37.180 --> 34:38.180
I didn't see anything like that.

34:38.180 --> 34:41.360
Well, keep in mind, I just bought an Xbox one, what, two weeks ago.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.420
So I'm just experiencing all this for the first time.

34:43.420 --> 34:45.500
So it's a little different for me.

34:45.500 --> 34:49.660
It's like people that played mass effect three and never had to see that original ending

34:49.660 --> 34:52.260
like dark soccer is raising her hand.

34:52.260 --> 34:54.300
Original ending angst was never a thing for her.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.300
Anyway.

34:55.300 --> 34:56.300
Nope.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.300
I live a happy, sheltered life.

34:57.300 --> 34:58.300
There you go.

34:58.300 --> 34:59.300
Uh, let's see.

34:59.580 --> 35:01.860
Also I've been playing, of course, a lot of heaven's word.

35:01.860 --> 35:04.380
Uh, I just did the Bismarck fight today.

35:04.380 --> 35:09.460
That was fun, even though it was a cluster, but, Oh, the soundtrack is so good.

35:09.460 --> 35:15.140
Like I know people associate Square Enix with no bully Matsu and with good reason, cause

35:15.140 --> 35:20.960
that man does a lot of great, great work and has done just legendary, uh, historical great

35:20.960 --> 35:22.760
video game tracks of all time.

35:22.760 --> 35:27.440
But I'm telling you, Soken is a real worthy successor over at Square.

35:27.440 --> 35:30.220
That man does brilliant work with Final Fantasy 14.

35:30.220 --> 35:31.880
That soundtrack is so stinking good.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.780
Uh, if you haven't checked it out, uh, check out the final fantasy 14 soundtrack heaven's

35:35.780 --> 35:36.780
word and the base game.

35:36.780 --> 35:38.560
They're both amazing.

35:38.560 --> 35:42.260
And uh, it's, it's not no bully Matsu, although nobody Matsu did like a theme for heaven's

35:42.260 --> 35:43.260
word.

35:43.260 --> 35:45.740
And, and probably that theme is, is heard in a lot of the others.

35:45.740 --> 35:50.480
I really think Soken deserves a big, big, big, a bunch of credit for his work.

35:50.480 --> 35:54.160
Maybe it's just the nostalgia talking, but when I think final fantasy MMOs, I still can't

35:54.160 --> 35:56.780
get the vanity or March out of my head.

35:56.780 --> 35:57.780
You know what?

35:57.780 --> 36:00.460
And Final Fantasy 11 was great for what it is too, but you want to talk about like fan

36:00.460 --> 36:06.680
service and all this 14 does such a good job of referencing other final fantasy games without

36:06.680 --> 36:08.960
necessarily like going over the top with it.

36:08.960 --> 36:13.540
Like they actually weave magitech armor, moogles, chocobos, and all that stuff like into the

36:13.540 --> 36:16.180
story without it being like crazy.

36:16.180 --> 36:20.060
Um, and then like the story in 14 is really good.

36:20.060 --> 36:22.940
This expansion has a really good story that's worthy of final fantasy.

36:22.940 --> 36:24.340
I'm probably going to need to check it out.

36:24.340 --> 36:28.540
I wound up taking a scholar to 50, almost got through the main story, found out that

36:28.540 --> 36:30.540
I need to raid all over again.

36:30.540 --> 36:32.140
I'm like, I have wow for this.

36:32.140 --> 36:34.900
I'm not going to do this again and just up and quit.

36:34.900 --> 36:36.300
I'll give it another shot.

36:36.300 --> 36:38.460
Hopefully it'll be a little bit more friendly to us.

36:38.460 --> 36:40.500
Oh God, I'm a casual now.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.140
What am I saying?

36:42.140 --> 36:46.860
Well it's interesting because they made a controversial decision where heavens where

36:46.860 --> 36:48.620
I want to keep this brief because I want to get into other games.

36:48.620 --> 36:52.720
I've talked a lot about how 14 on the show, but they made a controversial decision where

36:52.720 --> 36:58.880
unlike wow, all of the expansion content is in heaven's word, including the new jobs.

36:58.880 --> 37:04.960
So if you want to go play a machinist or a, uh, uh, astrologian or a dark knight or whatever,

37:04.960 --> 37:08.920
you have to go to Ishgard, the new city to unlock it, which is actually, that is what

37:08.920 --> 37:10.400
they did in final fantasy 11.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.400
So it's not exactly new for square to do that.

37:12.400 --> 37:13.760
I remember my paladin quest.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.760
Hell yeah.

37:14.760 --> 37:17.520
But what is a little weird is that in order to get to Ishgard, you have to completely

37:17.520 --> 37:19.940
finish the story of realm reborn.

37:19.940 --> 37:23.100
So you will not be able to go to the new stuff until you finish the old stuff.

37:23.100 --> 37:27.600
And from a story perspective, like the more I'm playing heaven's word, I get it.

37:27.600 --> 37:32.660
The end of the story of realm reborn is very important for what happens in heaven's word,

37:32.660 --> 37:33.660
critically important.

37:33.660 --> 37:38.260
So from that end I get it, but I can see where it also turned off people that kind of slept

37:38.260 --> 37:42.060
on the game for six months that want to get back in and join their friends.

37:42.060 --> 37:46.180
It's like, Oh, I'm going to be a step behind another step behind because I have to beat

37:46.180 --> 37:47.420
all this stuff first.

37:47.420 --> 37:50.580
But you get experience now for doing all of your raids.

37:50.580 --> 37:53.100
Yeah, that is, that is kind of the, okay.

37:53.100 --> 37:59.180
So at least now what they did do is that all the story content now gives you not only experience

37:59.180 --> 38:01.900
so that you'll be a leg up when you get into heaven's word, but it also gives you gear

38:01.900 --> 38:02.900
now, I hear.

38:02.900 --> 38:06.460
So that way you don't have to go in and do the raids to gear, to gear score up.

38:06.460 --> 38:08.500
You'll get it naturally through the story.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.860
So at least they lessened the blow a little bit.

38:10.860 --> 38:15.820
I'm still trying to work on all the poetics so, cause now it's no longer the soldiery

38:15.820 --> 38:16.820
tomes.

38:16.820 --> 38:17.820
It's poetics.

38:17.820 --> 38:18.820
Yep.

38:18.820 --> 38:19.820
And now it's law.

38:19.820 --> 38:23.380
This is in heaven's word, but anyway, uh, so that's enough about that.

38:23.380 --> 38:29.740
Uh, I also want to briefly mention, so I played clicker heroes this week a lot.

38:29.740 --> 38:32.540
In fact, Drew, have you played this game is crack.

38:32.540 --> 38:33.540
Yes.

38:33.540 --> 38:34.540
It is crap.

38:34.540 --> 38:37.380
Like at least 30, 300,000 souls.

38:37.380 --> 38:38.380
Do you really?

38:38.380 --> 38:39.380
Oh my God.

38:39.380 --> 38:42.500
I think I'm only on like my 12th ascension, but still, here's the thing.

38:42.500 --> 38:43.500
Here's what's big.

38:43.500 --> 38:44.500
Y'all.

38:44.500 --> 38:45.500
This is why I bring it up.

38:46.180 --> 38:49.100
I played clicker heroes this week.

38:49.100 --> 38:50.240
Please don't say you bought rubies.

38:50.240 --> 38:51.240
Please don't say about rubies.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.540
I spent $10 on rubies.

38:53.540 --> 38:54.540
No!

38:54.540 --> 38:57.100
Is there no God?

38:57.100 --> 39:01.660
I spent money on a free to play game, but this is why I did it.

39:01.660 --> 39:06.900
I did it for the sole reason that I felt the developers deserved a little bit of my money

39:06.900 --> 39:10.100
because I was going to say, I thought it was because of steam trading cards.

39:10.100 --> 39:11.460
No, no, no.

39:11.460 --> 39:14.620
I didn't realize that till after the fact that I was like, Ooh, I got a steam trading

39:14.620 --> 39:16.460
card out of it.

39:16.460 --> 39:21.020
But no, I did it because I felt, you know, with all the hours I've sunk into clicker

39:21.020 --> 39:25.020
heroes, even if passively, because I'll run clicker heroes in the background while I'm

39:25.020 --> 39:28.900
playing Final Fantasy.

39:28.900 --> 39:32.300
I felt that with all the time I've sunk into that, they deserve a little bit of money.

39:32.300 --> 39:36.580
So I tossed them $10 and I bought the rubies and bought like the permanent double damage

39:36.580 --> 39:38.500
thing or whatever it is they're selling.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.260
So there it is.

39:40.260 --> 39:43.220
I spent real money on a free to play game, but they deserve it.

39:43.220 --> 39:44.220
You sold out.

39:44.220 --> 39:45.220
They deserve it.

39:45.220 --> 39:46.220
Come on.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.540
This isn't candy crush or some shit.

39:47.540 --> 39:49.180
It's clicker heroes and they deserve it.

39:49.180 --> 39:50.180
Come on.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.180
All right.

39:51.180 --> 39:52.180
Fair.

39:52.180 --> 39:53.180
I'm just giving you a hard time.

39:53.180 --> 39:54.180
I know you are.

39:54.180 --> 39:55.180
By the way.

39:55.180 --> 39:56.180
I do remember another game I played.

39:56.180 --> 39:57.180
Hmm.

39:57.180 --> 39:58.180
Very solitaire.

39:58.180 --> 39:59.180
Oh jeez.

39:59.180 --> 40:00.180
When, when my.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.180
Our soccer's favorite game of all time.

40:01.180 --> 40:06.580
No, I, it was the only thing that I trusted my computer to run until I got it fixed.

40:06.580 --> 40:08.100
It could run clicker heroes.

40:08.100 --> 40:09.260
I will not play it.

40:09.260 --> 40:10.260
I will not.

40:10.260 --> 40:11.260
You don't.

40:11.260 --> 40:12.260
Don't get sucked in.

40:12.260 --> 40:13.260
It plays itself.

40:13.300 --> 40:14.300
I won't touch it.

40:14.300 --> 40:15.300
All right.

40:15.300 --> 40:16.300
Bobby.

40:16.300 --> 40:17.300
That's what she said about mass effect.

40:17.300 --> 40:18.300
Wants people.

40:18.300 --> 40:19.300
All right.

40:19.300 --> 40:20.300
Bobby black said mass effect is a good game.

40:20.300 --> 40:24.380
Bobby black Wolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, who is this person

40:24.380 --> 40:27.140
that person that is hosting a well R it is not sky.

40:27.140 --> 40:31.740
Uh, tech 2030 says you can totally hack the game to get rubies by the way.

40:31.740 --> 40:32.740
Haha.

40:32.740 --> 40:34.860
That's what mean people do.

40:34.860 --> 40:36.820
That is what mean people do.

40:36.820 --> 40:37.820
I'm looking at low case.

40:37.820 --> 40:38.820
I don't know what you mean.

40:38.820 --> 40:39.820
Yeah.

40:39.820 --> 40:40.820
Right.

40:40.820 --> 40:42.300
Uh, I don't have the game to get rubies.

40:42.340 --> 40:44.460
Kaijuto says, I've never even heard of that game.

40:44.460 --> 40:45.700
It sounds awful.

40:45.700 --> 40:52.020
If you played the steam summer game, uh, summers, if you played the steam summer sale game,

40:52.020 --> 40:57.820
it's a lot like that only, uh, it actually works and you don't get anything out of it

40:57.820 --> 40:58.820
whatsoever.

40:58.820 --> 41:00.660
You don't get anything out of it whatsoever.

41:00.660 --> 41:04.140
So except I don't know, achievements, steam achievements.

41:04.140 --> 41:05.140
That's it.

41:05.140 --> 41:07.580
Uh, fifth dreaming on chat says, God damn it.

41:07.580 --> 41:09.100
You're making me play clicker heroes now.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.240
I'm sorry.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.800
I apologize in advance for that.

41:12.800 --> 41:16.520
SSG100 Matt says, I'm too afraid to play clicker heroes and with good reason.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.040
Let's be real.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.240
All right.

41:19.240 --> 41:20.480
That's going to do it for our gaming week.

41:20.480 --> 41:25.680
Uh, some quick housekeeping, twitter.com slash OLR, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

41:25.680 --> 41:28.520
and google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

41:28.520 --> 41:31.200
Um, I want to address one other quick thing here real quick.

41:31.200 --> 41:34.400
I wasn't sure if I wanted to like say a lot about this cause it has to do with another

41:34.400 --> 41:39.560
show, but um, I just want to make sure I'm, I'm very clear on, on some things here before

41:39.560 --> 41:42.240
rumors start and that whole thing.

41:42.240 --> 41:46.360
Um, so as some of you all saw on twitter, there was a decision made this week to put

41:46.360 --> 41:51.880
my other show, uh, that I cohost with extfer and grandpa on Wednesdays, a horde house on

41:51.880 --> 41:54.520
a hiatus for a while.

41:54.520 --> 41:56.840
Um, and there's nothing wrong.

41:56.840 --> 41:59.640
We didn't all get into like a bust up fight or anything like that.

41:59.640 --> 42:03.760
Um, you know, uh, if you've been following horde house, you know that extrovert took

42:03.760 --> 42:08.320
a break a couple months ago, uh, because he needed to focus on some things, IRL and so

42:08.320 --> 42:09.320
on.

42:09.360 --> 42:13.400
Um, I think I kind of, kind of got to a similar point in this last week where I wanted to

42:13.400 --> 42:15.080
focus on some different things for a little bit.

42:15.080 --> 42:20.520
I have a lot going on that I don't talk about here on OLR because it's none of y'all business.

42:20.520 --> 42:25.720
It has nothing to do with video games, um, but it was impacting, you know, what I was

42:25.720 --> 42:27.040
doing on weeknights and so forth.

42:27.040 --> 42:33.080
So long, long story short, um, I just, I just kind of had to put horde house on hold for

42:33.080 --> 42:36.800
a little bit so I could focus on some other things, but you guys all know, I think grandpa

42:36.800 --> 42:40.800
is very talented as I do extra for our both very talented folks.

42:40.800 --> 42:44.400
Uh, Shane was a great asset to that show for the time he was there as well.

42:44.400 --> 42:48.400
Um, but even I got to a point, I think even Shane did where it was like, you know, talking

42:48.400 --> 42:53.440
about all these MMOs, like it's, it's hard when there's only one I'm really invested

42:53.440 --> 42:54.520
in right now.

42:54.520 --> 42:58.280
And I think that's kind of the point I got to is that, you know, I love the world of

42:58.280 --> 42:59.280
Warcraft community.

42:59.280 --> 43:00.960
Um, there's some great people.

43:00.960 --> 43:03.080
I've met some friends for life through that community.

43:03.080 --> 43:05.520
I don't care about your game anymore.

43:05.520 --> 43:11.420
That's my honest, like, sorry if that really sticks you, but it's like, it's really hard

43:11.420 --> 43:14.000
for me to feign this enthusiasm about world of Warcraft.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.360
And I felt like we still had a big audience that was kind of holding onto that a little

43:18.360 --> 43:19.360
bit.

43:19.360 --> 43:22.520
And I kind of feel like every week I'm faking it and letting you down.

43:22.520 --> 43:26.040
So that's part of what played into the reason a little bit as well.

43:26.040 --> 43:27.040
Anyhow.

43:27.040 --> 43:30.500
Uh, grandpa of course, still on star board, power coupling extra for still doing his thing

43:30.500 --> 43:31.500
over on Twitch.

43:31.500 --> 43:36.300
And, um, you know, Shane comes on this show sometimes, I don't know what projects he'll

43:36.300 --> 43:42.180
go into in the future, but I imagine some of us will reform and do another project again

43:42.180 --> 43:46.860
at a later date, maybe after the summer and some IRL things calm down a little bit.

43:46.860 --> 43:51.820
Uh, so I just wanted to address that and make sure there were no rumors that people were

43:51.820 --> 43:54.660
fighting or quitting or whatever.

43:54.660 --> 43:55.660
So there it is.

43:55.660 --> 44:00.940
There's my very honest answer as to why Horde house ended right there on the table for now.

44:00.940 --> 44:05.380
Um, and it may come back, you know, I may just rediscover my love of MMOs.

44:05.380 --> 44:08.620
And if grandpa and extra for both in the same boat, then we might say, let's do a Horde

44:08.620 --> 44:09.620
house again.

44:09.620 --> 44:13.780
But if not, we'll probably say, let's take all this energy creatively that we do and

44:13.780 --> 44:17.700
the chemistry that we have between us and, and grandpa riffing on me and extra for talking

44:17.700 --> 44:19.260
about nonsensical things and all that.

44:19.260 --> 44:22.740
And let's do this other project and we'll probably do that instead.

44:22.740 --> 44:24.960
So there it is.

44:24.960 --> 44:25.960
It's weird.

44:25.960 --> 44:29.540
Cause I, I'm not used to podcasts ending.

44:29.580 --> 44:34.300
I don't know what to say about it because this one seems like it's never going to like

44:34.300 --> 44:35.300
you better not be.

44:35.300 --> 44:36.300
I know.

44:36.300 --> 44:37.300
I'm like, no, no, no, no.

44:37.300 --> 44:38.300
I'm not.

44:38.300 --> 44:39.300
I wouldn't rebel rebel rebel.

44:39.300 --> 44:44.420
It's I find to the timing of a Sunday night show is a lot easier on me than a Wednesday

44:44.420 --> 44:49.060
night show because with Sunday it's like I've had the whole weekend for RNR to relax and

44:49.060 --> 44:51.260
rest up and you know, be ready to do it.

44:51.260 --> 44:53.980
Whereas on Wednesday it's like I just got home from work and I got to roll over and

44:53.980 --> 44:54.980
do a show.

44:54.980 --> 44:56.840
So it's, it's harder.

44:56.840 --> 44:58.900
It's much harder to do one on a Wednesday night.

44:58.940 --> 44:59.940
All right.

44:59.940 --> 45:01.940
So there you go.

45:01.940 --> 45:02.940
Let's move on.

45:02.940 --> 45:03.940
Let's get into some gaming news.

45:03.940 --> 45:04.940
Shall we?

45:04.940 --> 45:07.820
Uh, Loki start us off tonight with some video game news.

45:07.820 --> 45:08.820
All right.

45:08.820 --> 45:10.780
So there's the rumor of course.

45:10.780 --> 45:13.940
Um, well we know that Nintendo is working on another system.

45:13.940 --> 45:18.980
Um, no, it's going to be out probably soon, maybe next year.

45:18.980 --> 45:22.820
The rumor is now that it's supposed to be out in July of 2016.

45:22.820 --> 45:23.820
Where's this rumor coming from?

45:23.820 --> 45:29.740
Well, it's coming from the report that apparently they've been visiting with, uh, supply chain

45:29.740 --> 45:37.460
partners and, um, are looking to submit orders on February or March, 2016.

45:37.460 --> 45:41.260
And I think this also comes, if I remember correctly, I think Foxconn won a bid or something

45:41.260 --> 45:43.660
for manufacturing the system.

45:43.660 --> 45:50.940
And so somehow they've, uh, extrapolated that it's going to be coming out maybe July, 2016.

45:50.940 --> 46:00.300
I would hope, just me, that Nintendo reflecting on past, you know, launches and how they've

46:00.300 --> 46:06.180
been a clusterfuck as far as, oh, shortages, shortages that they just realize, Hey, you

46:06.180 --> 46:07.180
know what?

46:07.180 --> 46:09.940
Let's take the extra months and release a holiday.

46:09.940 --> 46:12.140
But you know, with a better name, please.

46:12.140 --> 46:14.540
Well, NX is not the name.

46:14.540 --> 46:15.540
It's not the name.

46:15.540 --> 46:16.540
No, no, no, no, no.

46:16.540 --> 46:18.180
With a better name than what they had so far.

46:18.180 --> 46:19.180
Yeah, yeah.

46:19.820 --> 46:22.020
Let's not come up with some stupid, like Wii again.

46:22.020 --> 46:26.180
I, well, I, I kind of think, here's the thing.

46:26.180 --> 46:28.300
I think Wii really worked for them.

46:28.300 --> 46:34.620
I know it was, I know, haha, PP, Wii, Wii, but Wii U, I don't think worked for them because

46:34.620 --> 46:38.140
too many people thought, you know, remember when it even, they went on, he went on Jimmy

46:38.140 --> 46:43.620
Kimmel or one of those late night shows and yeah, the, the guy thought it was, it's an

46:43.620 --> 46:44.620
add on for the Wii, right?

46:44.620 --> 46:45.620
And no, no, no.

46:45.620 --> 46:49.500
I think that was the real naming problem with Wii U.

46:49.500 --> 46:51.100
So yeah, in that regard, yes.

46:51.100 --> 46:52.800
Do not call it Wii anything.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.300
And I don't think it will.

46:54.300 --> 46:59.100
If this is some new initiative, if some of these rumors about that they're going to be

46:59.100 --> 47:03.460
combining the DS and the Wii into something.

47:03.460 --> 47:05.640
Just call it the Nintendo Entertainment System.

47:05.640 --> 47:07.020
Just reboot that shit.

47:07.020 --> 47:08.220
I'm all for that.

47:08.220 --> 47:09.220
I'd love to see that.

47:09.220 --> 47:11.900
I'd love to see Nintendo just like go old school with it.

47:11.900 --> 47:15.780
Why not go back to the days where everybody just called the video game system a Nintendo?

47:15.780 --> 47:17.420
Why don't you just call it the Nintendo?

47:17.420 --> 47:18.700
Didn't we say this?

47:18.700 --> 47:22.660
I feel like we had this exact same discussion like 10 years ago when Wii was first coming

47:22.660 --> 47:23.660
out.

47:23.660 --> 47:26.700
No, this is back when they were doing like the new iPad, but I don't like that idea either

47:26.700 --> 47:31.580
because it gets really confusing, especially with the iPad, you know, where it's like the

47:31.580 --> 47:32.580
new iPad.

47:32.580 --> 47:33.580
Well, come on.

47:33.580 --> 47:34.980
Yeah, it's the same with Xbox One.

47:34.980 --> 47:37.340
Xbox One was, that's a dumb name.

47:37.340 --> 47:38.340
I'm sorry.

47:38.340 --> 47:39.340
It doesn't make any sense.

47:39.340 --> 47:40.340
It's confusing.

47:40.340 --> 47:41.340
Just don't do that.

47:41.780 --> 47:45.180
I like the Nintendo Entertainment System because no one's really going to be like, oh, you're

47:45.180 --> 47:46.180
talking about NES.

47:46.180 --> 47:48.180
Yeah, you're talking about a system from 1984.

47:48.180 --> 47:50.180
It's been a long time.

47:50.180 --> 47:54.340
It's not like, you know, we just had, you know, whatever it is, an iPad last year.

47:54.340 --> 47:58.800
I mean, if you're talking like something that's been, you know, over at least two generations

47:58.800 --> 48:03.340
or generations, I mean, you know, granted you have the Xbox and then the Xbox 360, then

48:03.340 --> 48:05.460
the Xbox One, that's too soon.

48:05.460 --> 48:07.620
You mean you could, I don't know.

48:07.620 --> 48:09.660
And I only think they should really just call the Xbox One.

48:09.660 --> 48:13.620
I think they should have just called it, I don't know, the new Xbox or something.

48:13.620 --> 48:16.780
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, let's just call it the Nintendo One.

48:16.780 --> 48:17.780
There it is.

48:17.780 --> 48:20.460
Act Deaf referring to the new 3DS.

48:20.460 --> 48:23.100
So maybe Nintendo is going to go down that path.

48:23.100 --> 48:24.100
Who knows?

48:24.100 --> 48:25.100
Please don't.

48:25.100 --> 48:27.860
Well, they're not going to call it the new Wii U.

48:27.860 --> 48:29.420
Okay, so let's go back.

48:29.420 --> 48:33.660
Naming wank aside, because, you know, none of us are going to know until, you know, they

48:33.660 --> 48:37.140
come out on stage or their digital event and say it.

48:37.140 --> 48:39.540
July 2016, realistic or no?

48:39.540 --> 48:40.540
I mean, that would be...

48:40.540 --> 48:41.540
I don't think...

48:41.540 --> 48:44.540
When was the last time a console released?

48:44.540 --> 48:45.740
Not during the holiday period.

48:45.740 --> 48:46.740
Well, lots.

48:46.740 --> 48:47.740
It's been a very long time.

48:47.740 --> 48:48.740
Lots of consoles.

48:48.740 --> 48:49.740
3DS launched in March.

48:49.740 --> 48:50.740
There's a...

48:50.740 --> 48:51.740
Dreamcast.

48:51.740 --> 48:52.740
Dreamcast in February.

48:52.740 --> 48:53.740
I guess that's a very good point.

48:53.740 --> 48:54.740
Nah, I'd say Dreamcast is still holiday period.

48:54.740 --> 48:55.740
Not September.

48:55.740 --> 48:56.740
September?

48:56.740 --> 48:57.740
Yeah.

48:57.740 --> 48:58.740
Early September.

48:58.740 --> 48:59.740
I'd call it.

48:59.740 --> 49:00.740
Yes, that's holiday, unfortunately.

49:00.740 --> 49:01.740
Close enough.

49:01.740 --> 49:02.740
Yeah.

49:02.740 --> 49:03.740
On the bubble.

49:03.740 --> 49:04.740
On the bubble.

49:04.740 --> 49:05.740
Holiday runs from, like, September to November.

49:05.740 --> 49:07.100
If it's after Labor Day, I consider it a holiday.

49:07.100 --> 49:08.100
Yeah.

49:08.100 --> 49:09.100
July, that's a wishful thing.

49:09.100 --> 49:11.420
Holiday is much more of a sad...

49:11.420 --> 49:15.940
Any mention of July, I think is probably gonna be the new Namco game of Tails from Someone's

49:15.940 --> 49:16.940
Ass.

49:16.940 --> 49:17.940
Nothing comes out in July.

49:17.940 --> 49:23.220
July is, like, barren, so if they release it, they would get the full attention, I suppose,

49:23.220 --> 49:24.620
but I don't know.

49:24.620 --> 49:29.540
It seems risky in a way, but if this supply thing you're talking about, you know, if Nintendo's

49:29.540 --> 49:32.780
gonna be always forever plagued with these supply issues...

49:32.780 --> 49:34.060
They're gonna do it for hype.

49:34.060 --> 49:35.660
They're gonna fuckin' do it for hype.

49:35.660 --> 49:41.880
It's really goddamn annoying, because seriously, everybody fucking knows it's artificial, okay?

49:41.880 --> 49:43.500
There's no fucking...

49:43.500 --> 49:45.180
You can't be this dumb at this point.

49:45.180 --> 49:48.300
Look, he looks like, we don't know how to manufacture shit.

49:48.300 --> 49:49.500
We just started doing this.

49:49.500 --> 49:50.500
Please understand.

49:50.500 --> 49:51.500
Please understand.

49:51.500 --> 49:52.980
Oh, fuck him and his please understand.

49:52.980 --> 49:55.140
I don't understand how you can be this dumb.

49:55.140 --> 49:58.620
I mean, seriously, they know what they're doing.

49:58.620 --> 50:04.300
They play it conservative with this stuff, and I guess they don't want it to be sitting

50:04.300 --> 50:08.740
on the shelves because it makes it seem like no one wants it.

50:08.740 --> 50:09.740
I'm sorry.

50:09.740 --> 50:10.740
It's perception retarded.

50:10.740 --> 50:11.740
Please understand.

50:11.740 --> 50:12.740
It's all according to plan, then.

50:12.740 --> 50:15.380
Then the shortage will be over by the holidays, and they go July.

50:15.380 --> 50:17.700
I revise my previous statement.

50:17.700 --> 50:20.220
Here's the other thing with that whole thing.

50:20.220 --> 50:26.460
I thought, and memory could be, you know, I'm getting old, Drew, I'm getting old, but

50:26.460 --> 50:31.020
with the 3DS releasing in April, that was over here, didn't it come out in Japan earlier

50:31.020 --> 50:32.020
than we got it?

50:32.020 --> 50:41.500
Yeah, 3DS came out holiday, it was like December or November in Japan, and then it came out

50:41.500 --> 50:46.580
over here in March, the end of March, yeah, it was the end of March over here because

50:46.580 --> 50:48.540
I bought, I'd imported one.

50:48.540 --> 50:52.980
And it seems like when we get systems in that time frame, like even the PlayStation 2 was

50:52.980 --> 50:57.260
like a, you know, release in the early months of the year, Japan had it for the holiday.

50:57.260 --> 51:01.500
So it's usually because we got it second because Japan had it first.

51:01.500 --> 51:06.780
But I mean, I don't know, we live in a more global market than we did even 10 years ago.

51:06.780 --> 51:10.620
So you know, if somebody wants something from Japan, right now, that new Zelda games for

51:10.620 --> 51:14.340
the next system is not for the Wii U.

51:14.340 --> 51:20.260
I feel like, and I granted you might say they're full of shit, which is which is a fair retort,

51:20.260 --> 51:23.020
but they've come out and said it's not for the next system.

51:23.020 --> 51:24.020
Uh huh.

51:24.020 --> 51:25.020
Loki.

51:25.020 --> 51:26.020
Loki.

51:26.020 --> 51:27.020
Two words.

51:27.020 --> 51:28.020
Twilight Prince.

51:28.020 --> 51:29.020
Yeah, exactly.

51:29.540 --> 51:33.820
Oh, it's not for the new system, except it is for the new system, you know, except it's

51:33.820 --> 51:36.300
also for the new system.

51:36.300 --> 51:37.420
He's left handed on this one.

51:37.420 --> 51:42.640
The only thing that I think could shut you down on that, and I think it's worth considering

51:42.640 --> 51:48.860
Loki is that we're also talking about now the Wii U's big tie in is the tablet.

51:48.860 --> 51:52.260
And so the Zelda game is going to have something to do with the tablet and so forth.

51:52.260 --> 51:57.180
So if the NX has a new twist, a new Nintendo-fied twist, we don't know what if we knew what

51:57.180 --> 51:59.180
it was, we would be able to talk about it.

51:59.180 --> 52:03.440
But whatever that new Nintendo twist is on a new way to play games, can Zelda really

52:03.440 --> 52:08.100
be parked into that when it's already for the Wii U's tablet game thing?

52:08.100 --> 52:09.100
Do you know what I mean?

52:09.100 --> 52:13.900
Yeah, I hope that new twist is fucking beefy ass hardware that can keep up with the modern

52:13.900 --> 52:14.900
games.

52:14.900 --> 52:17.260
No, I'm not trying to be like ridiculous here.

52:17.260 --> 52:21.980
I'm just saying that's definitely going to help them with the whole third party support

52:21.980 --> 52:26.820
thing because when you're running the system that's last generation specs, it's going to

52:26.860 --> 52:29.780
be hard to get the Fallout 4's and all that shit.

52:29.780 --> 52:34.380
So I would appreciate if they had a system that was up to spec with this stuff.

52:34.380 --> 52:39.220
I think they should even push it just a little further, which is kind of what the Wii U kind

52:39.220 --> 52:40.940
of did that, but it wasn't enough.

52:40.940 --> 52:47.820
Yeah, it was a little bit further with the Xbox 360, but unfortunately not, I don't know,

52:47.820 --> 52:52.400
even then it couldn't run some of the stuff that was on those systems and it's too bad

52:52.400 --> 52:54.260
because they had potential.

52:54.700 --> 52:59.100
Well, here's the interesting thing is that if Nintendo can get out that system next year

52:59.100 --> 53:03.700
and it's a little beefier than an Xbox One, let's say it's more like an Xbox One and a

53:03.700 --> 53:05.140
half, okay?

53:05.140 --> 53:07.100
Let's say they get that thing out next year.

53:07.100 --> 53:12.060
This isn't going to be like the Wii U was because the Wii U came out like right as the

53:12.060 --> 53:16.180
PS4's coming out and right as the Xbox One coming out, I mean there was maybe one year

53:16.180 --> 53:17.660
of opportunity.

53:17.660 --> 53:21.780
Well now if the typical life cycle happens with these current consoles that are out,

53:21.780 --> 53:23.580
we're more mid-cycle right now.

53:23.580 --> 53:27.740
We're not even really to the full brunt of the mid-cycle yet with these consoles.

53:27.740 --> 53:31.620
And let's be honest- So, I mean, Nintendo would get a really big

53:31.620 --> 53:32.620
jump.

53:32.620 --> 53:35.860
Yeah, and let's be honest, they haven't really taken advantage of these consoles lately.

53:35.860 --> 53:38.340
Look at PlayStation 4's lineup for holidays.

53:38.340 --> 53:39.340
It's been crap.

53:39.340 --> 53:40.340
They haven't had anything.

53:40.340 --> 53:41.340
What lineup?

53:41.340 --> 53:42.340
Exactly.

53:42.340 --> 53:45.240
They haven't had any first party shit come out of the- ooh, LittleBigPlanet 3.

53:45.240 --> 53:49.100
I'm not buying a console because of that, sorry.

53:49.100 --> 53:53.100
So many people are buying PlayStation 4's.

53:53.100 --> 53:54.100
You bought one!

53:54.100 --> 53:55.100
I bought one!

53:55.100 --> 53:56.100
He bought one!

53:56.100 --> 53:59.960
It's because of the next-gen games, or the current-gen games, the third-party stuff that

53:59.960 --> 54:03.580
we're buying it for right now, and we see a lot of potential with stuff coming out.

54:03.580 --> 54:06.820
Because every time you hear about games coming out, it's like, oh, it runs better on PlayStation

54:06.820 --> 54:07.820
4 than Xbox One.

54:07.820 --> 54:10.420
I mean, that was my conscious thinking, oh, and that, and they're giving me a ton of free

54:10.420 --> 54:11.420
games.

54:11.420 --> 54:12.420
You know, that also helps.

54:12.420 --> 54:13.420
Alright.

54:13.420 --> 54:19.580
Let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

54:19.580 --> 54:23.780
Tech2030 says, wasn't there a report that NX wasn't going to be a rival to PlayStation

54:23.780 --> 54:24.900
4 in terms of power?

54:24.900 --> 54:28.180
I think that's a dangerous slope for Nintendo to go down, though, when it comes to third

54:28.180 --> 54:29.180
parties.

54:29.180 --> 54:33.500
If the game does not- something is easily ported from one system to another, that's

54:33.500 --> 54:37.420
gonna leave them in a position where they're at right now, I think.

54:37.420 --> 54:42.140
Bonds006 says, the new Nintendo system will be powered by loyalist love and fanboy money.

54:42.140 --> 54:46.780
Well, they're always gonna have that, so.

54:46.780 --> 54:47.780
I just-

54:47.780 --> 54:48.780
I'm worried-

54:48.780 --> 54:50.300
The Amiibo thing doesn't go full throttle.

54:50.300 --> 54:54.500
That's my one fear about this new system, is that Amiibo is gonna go full throttle.

54:54.500 --> 54:59.580
I'm worried that this new system actually may not, if they can't get the momentum, you

54:59.580 --> 55:03.580
know, they're hoping that this new system's gonna do better, and I hope it does, but what

55:03.580 --> 55:04.580
if it doesn't?

55:04.580 --> 55:06.060
What if it just doesn't catch on?

55:06.060 --> 55:07.060
Then what?

55:07.060 --> 55:08.060
Then what?

55:08.060 --> 55:09.060
Then where are you at?

55:09.060 --> 55:10.060
Then they'll always still have a 3DS.

55:10.060 --> 55:11.060
It's like, oh shit, you know.

55:11.060 --> 55:13.580
I mean, eh.

55:13.580 --> 55:16.460
Let's hope it's not PSP Go.

55:16.460 --> 55:17.460
It's not that dumb.

55:17.460 --> 55:20.020
It's gotta be better than that idea.

55:20.020 --> 55:22.660
Alright, well, you know what?

55:22.660 --> 55:27.460
We can- this is all rumors right now, and we can speculate, speculate, speculate, but

55:27.460 --> 55:28.660
you know what?

55:28.660 --> 55:32.140
It isn't really gonna change whatever's gonna happen next year, or not happen next year,

55:32.140 --> 55:34.540
so stay tuned, everybody.

55:34.540 --> 55:39.740
Meanwhile, let's move on to what's a game that's supposed to be within the next, you

55:39.740 --> 55:44.900
know, 12 months, if what we heard about Nintendo's E3 showing is to be true, that all the games

55:44.900 --> 55:47.060
they showed are for the next year.

55:47.060 --> 55:51.500
One of those games that was shown, of course, was Metroid Prime Federation Force.

55:51.500 --> 55:59.180
And as y'all know, it was not the most well-received game because it bears the Metroid title, yet

55:59.180 --> 56:02.020
it was just a very different creative direction for the game.

56:02.020 --> 56:06.340
In fact, it went so far as to inspire a Change.org petition that has, I don't know how many thousands

56:06.340 --> 56:09.780
of English- angry, angry internet people everywhere signing it.

56:09.780 --> 56:10.780
Grr-org.

56:10.780 --> 56:11.780
Yeah, exactly.

56:11.780 --> 56:13.260
When has Change.org actually changed anything?

56:13.260 --> 56:16.620
I mean, have any of those petitions actually done anything?

56:17.180 --> 56:24.420
Well, well, Nintendo, Reggie Fils-Aime was talking about, you know, all this stuff with

56:24.420 --> 56:29.900
Mashable and talked about the reaction, talking a little bit about that Change.org petition

56:29.900 --> 56:34.140
saying, quote, what the fan at home saw was something in the Metroid Prime universe that

56:34.140 --> 56:35.780
they weren't expecting.

56:35.780 --> 56:37.540
The reaction has been negative.

56:37.540 --> 56:39.540
There's no sugar-coating it.

56:39.540 --> 56:44.060
This is an example where fans who aren't able to get their hands on the game may be at a

56:44.060 --> 56:46.460
bit of a competitive disadvantage.

56:46.460 --> 56:50.620
Everyone who has played what we are showing regarding Metroid Prime, they came across

56:50.620 --> 56:51.860
really pleased.

56:51.860 --> 56:54.580
My ask is that fans trust us.

56:54.580 --> 56:57.940
Oh, bullshit damage control, Reg.

56:57.940 --> 57:00.660
This is the ultimate please understand.

57:00.660 --> 57:02.060
No!

57:02.060 --> 57:06.580
If you want to give us something in that series that the fans are going to enjoy, if you're

57:06.580 --> 57:12.580
going to put that name on it, you give us something from that that we can identify with

57:12.580 --> 57:13.900
and show that.

57:13.900 --> 57:17.260
Fans don't say, oh, we had the play testers play that and they were very pleased.

57:17.260 --> 57:18.980
No, we want to see that at home.

57:18.980 --> 57:22.660
Yeah, but to be fair, reaction at the E3 booth was pretty positive.

57:22.660 --> 57:24.980
Then you need to learn how to market the game better then.

57:24.980 --> 57:29.060
If that's the problem, if the game's good, but your marketing's not showing that, then

57:29.060 --> 57:32.140
you need to rework that.

57:32.140 --> 57:35.500
It's so interesting to me because I honestly feel like if they had just called this game

57:35.500 --> 57:38.740
Federation Force, this wouldn't even be a thing right now.

57:38.740 --> 57:39.740
It wouldn't be a thing.

57:39.740 --> 57:40.740
This would not even be a, we would not have a discussion.

57:40.740 --> 57:41.740
It wouldn't be a thing.

57:41.740 --> 57:44.580
It would, if it was just Federation Force, wouldn't even be a thing.

57:44.580 --> 57:48.020
What if they called it F-Zero Federation Force?

57:48.020 --> 57:49.620
What if they called it F-Zero Federation Force?

57:49.620 --> 57:52.140
I'd be like, yay, Nintendo still acknowledges F-Zero.

57:52.140 --> 57:55.340
No, I mean, seriously, this is how ridiculous it is.

57:55.340 --> 58:00.900
I mean, it's like, I don't know, like, it's just not the same.

58:00.900 --> 58:04.180
Actually, Loki, I'd kind of like to see them do a different game.

58:04.180 --> 58:08.100
There's so many characters in F-Zero, like they all had their fucking own theme songs

58:08.100 --> 58:09.100
in GX.

58:09.100 --> 58:10.460
They didn't like do anything with that.

58:10.460 --> 58:15.420
I kind of think F-Zero could have a side game, so sorry your little retort didn't work

58:15.420 --> 58:17.540
so well.

58:17.540 --> 58:18.540
But I actually, I'd like to see that.

58:18.540 --> 58:20.260
I have three words for you, Rob.

58:20.260 --> 58:22.660
Star Fox Adventures.

58:22.660 --> 58:25.320
Did it have anything to do with being in a ship?

58:25.320 --> 58:26.700
It had freaking dinosaurs.

58:26.700 --> 58:27.700
There's some people-

58:27.700 --> 58:29.180
It wasn't supposed to be a Star Fox game.

58:29.180 --> 58:32.740
But there's some people that still stand so hard for that game, even though it's like

58:32.740 --> 58:33.740
not-

58:33.740 --> 58:34.740
Of course.

58:34.740 --> 58:35.740
I mean, there's-

58:35.740 --> 58:38.140
It could be a perfectly good game on its own.

58:38.140 --> 58:42.380
It maybe shares a couple of characters, but you don't necessarily call that a Star Fox

58:42.380 --> 58:43.380
game.

58:43.380 --> 58:47.340
I think the problem is, and this is just, you know, again, we would not even be having

58:47.340 --> 58:50.500
this discussion right now if it was just called Federation Force, but because they invoke

58:50.500 --> 58:57.100
the name Metroid, it's kind of like them standing up there and going, we know y'all love Metroid,

58:57.100 --> 59:01.300
and yep, here's a game that doesn't have Samus in it, so why don't you just open up those

59:01.300 --> 59:02.300
wounds.

59:02.300 --> 59:03.300
We're just gonna pour a little salt in it.

59:03.300 --> 59:04.300
Well, I mean, that's fine.

59:04.300 --> 59:08.220
They had Halo Reach, and that didn't have Master Chief in it, as far as I'm aware, but

59:08.220 --> 59:10.980
I didn't play it, but it's a similar type of thing.

59:10.980 --> 59:15.020
It's still in the same universe, but that seemed like a Halo game, whereas this doesn't

59:15.020 --> 59:16.820
seem like a Metroid Prime game.

59:16.820 --> 59:17.820
But maybe-

59:17.820 --> 59:22.380
And maybe that's where we have to suspend disbelief a little bit, because it did show

59:22.380 --> 59:23.380
45 seconds.

59:23.380 --> 59:24.380
I'm not suspending shit, okay?

59:24.380 --> 59:25.380
You know why?

59:25.380 --> 59:26.380
Because I'm a consumer.

59:26.380 --> 59:29.620
I'm not gonna just trust you and buy it, because you know what?

59:29.620 --> 59:31.980
You know who says just trust us about shit?

59:31.980 --> 59:34.900
Warner Brothers says just trust us about buying Batman Arkham-

59:34.900 --> 59:35.900
Exactly.

59:35.900 --> 59:36.900
No, no, it's-

59:36.900 --> 59:42.140
No, EA says trust us, Battlefield Hardline's gonna work just fine, it'll be fine, just

59:42.140 --> 59:43.260
trust us.

59:43.260 --> 59:44.260
Fuck that.

59:44.260 --> 59:48.040
I am not trusting anybody until I see a reason to buy this game.

59:48.040 --> 59:49.040
I'm not picking it up.

59:49.040 --> 59:53.420
Well, that and I don't own the system, so I'm not buying a system to buy this game.

59:53.420 --> 59:57.140
I would not be this passionate about it if I didn't love Metroid, I didn't love Nintendo,

59:57.140 --> 01:00:01.340
but Reggie's pretty much giving us the gaming equivalent of open your mouth and close your

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.340
eyes.

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.780
You'll get a big surprise.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:10.300
SSJ100Matt says, if it were Mother 3 Federation Force, heaven help them.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:13.580
Kaijuto says, I'm excited about that Metroid game to be honest.

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.980
Tigerclaw says, I like that Metroid Federation Force takes place in that universe.

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:23.180
There are more things about the Metroid universe besides Samus Aran, there are other characters

01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.500
they can expand on.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:28.140
Okay, I'm gonna take that point and run with it for a minute here, because what if this

01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:34.780
game, in its cutesy chibi style, what if this game is about the animals?

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:40.420
What if Nintendo saw all this fucking craziness about save the animals when they do those

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.500
speeders, what if this game is about the animals?

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.900
Because they said, oh, people get all worried, this is the animal game.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.860
Well, it's better than it being about the baby.

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:54.820
Well, they didn't show anything like that, so I'm gonna suspend my disbelief, you know,

01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:56.380
until I see this.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:00.540
I'm gonna say that with a wink and a nod to Reggie, here's your shovel to get you out

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:05.600
of this situation, wink, make it about the animals, wink, then people are gonna have

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.700
a lot less problem with it, I'm just saying.

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:12.540
Give us a kind of touchstone, give us something we can go on to bring us back to the series.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:17.100
I think they're going to, you know, if this is true, what he's saying, that people need

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:22.420
to get their hands on it, then they'll take it out to Best Buys across the nation around

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:26.300
the time of, I don't know, Gamescom or whenever the hell they want to do it, honestly, around

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:29.860
the holidays, and they'll get the game in people's hands.

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:30.860
Why take it to Best Buys?

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:34.260
Take it to your chum-chum friends at Evil G, you know?

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.260
I'm sure they'll push your shit.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.260
Maybe that's what they'll do, too.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.540
Or, how about a downloadable demo, like we used to do?

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:43.100
Oh, well, you can play that for 30 seconds, and then that's it, because, you know, fuck

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.580
you guys, demos are just for one time.

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:49.380
We don't want you to get any actual enjoyment out of it for an extended period of time,

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.620
because you may not buy the game.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.020
You might analyze it too hard.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:55.780
If you're that worried about me purchasing your game after playing your demo, I mean,

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:58.180
that doesn't make any sense at all.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:02.140
Let me play the demo countless times, so I'm like, damn, I really want this game.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.140
I don't know.

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.140
I'm disappointed.

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:08.820
I'm not getting my new 2D Metroid, but I don't want to write this completely off until I

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:09.820
get my hands on it.

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:15.500
I can just say that when I saw the trailer, I was like, meh, so, but I don't have this

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:18.420
like seething rage that Change.org does over this whole thing.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.580
If I can put a Metroid game that's done in that same engine that they did Rayman in,

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.860
the new Rayman games?

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:24.860
Yes, please.

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:26.620
That's what I want to see.

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:27.620
Alright.

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:33.700
Hey, speaking of Nintendo criticisms, by the way, Act F says, Loki, you're anti-Nintendoing

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.980
so hard right now it hurts.

01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.380
I'm not anti-Nintendoing.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:39.780
I'm totally for Nintendo.

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:40.780
That's what you don't get.

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:44.300
I like Nintendo, I just think they're making stupid decisions.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.100
That's why you get really mad when they make bad decisions.

01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.100
Exactly.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.700
If we're talking like fucking Majesco- This hurts me more than it hurts you.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:54.460
It's like when you have a close friend that you see do something stupid, and you're like,

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:55.620
oh no, bitch.

01:02:55.620 --> 01:02:58.540
It's like if we were talking like, oh man, I really hate this direction that Madden's

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.580
going in, I'd be like, I don't fucking care.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:02.580
And that would be intimate.

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.580
Let it burn.

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:04.580
Let it all burn.

01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:05.580
Exactly.

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:06.580
Who cares?

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.580
We wouldn't be this pissed off if we didn't like Nintendo.

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.700
I wish more Nintendo fans got that about you, Loki.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:10.700
I really do.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:11.700
It's like, I love Nintendo.

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:12.700
Why would I?

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:13.700
I'm not mad at them.

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.100
Like, I want to support this stuff.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:20.620
I want to, you know, buy a good Metroid game, but I'm not buying that game.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.020
That's not going to sell me a system.

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.780
I want something to sell me a system.

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:28.100
Dungeon Buster says Loki's all about tough Nintendo love.

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:32.420
You know, I think Loki should star in like a version of the video game Bachelor where

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:37.980
like, you know, all the games at E3 try to win over Loki's affection and he has roses

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:42.280
that he gives out or dollars that he gives out to games.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.380
And every week, you know, some poor game is voted off the show.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:46.620
I think that's what I'd like to see.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:47.620
Wouldn't you?

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:48.620
Yeah.

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.900
But at the end of the series, he's just going to go home and play Call of Duty anyway.

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.660
I don't play Call of Duty that often.

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:53.660
Earth Defense Force.

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.980
I don't play Earth Defense Force either, which is, I don't play much of anything anymore,

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:59.860
but no, seriously, you know, I don't play that much Call of Duty.

01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:00.860
I played it when it came out.

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:02.340
I played the story missions.

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:04.580
It was about a little bit of the multiplayer.

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:06.020
That was about it.

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:10.220
Bonds 006 says another Sunday with Nintendo getting no love at OLR.

01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:12.220
Hey, hey, that is not true.

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:17.120
I have a lot of love for Nintendo, but only if you're Team Cat.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.700
And I think I made this point clear earlier in the show.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:22.340
Well, I'd love Nintendo, and I seriously want to get like a Wii U for, I would love

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:27.700
to get a Wii U for Super Mario Maker, but I don't want to buy it just for Super Mario

01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.700
Maker.

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.140
Hey, drop that shit down the $99.

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.140
Okay.

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:33.380
No, I'll buy it for just Super Mario Maker.

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:35.580
I kind of think something like that's coming.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.580
But oh yeah.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.580
Yeah.

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.580
Once that comes in, I'll be like, okay, really?

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.860
What do you have coming around the corner then?

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.860
Just don't forget.

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.860
Don't don't forget.

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:44.860
You know, Wii U's been out for like three years now.

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:45.900
There's a back catalog.

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.500
There's there's Mario 3D World, Mario Kart 8.

01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:51.980
There's a lot of games worthy of your attention, even like Zombie U and shit is still like

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.980
really good.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.980
So.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:54.980
All right.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.140
Anyway, speaking of Nintendo, let me just keep piling it on here.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:02.340
But this is stuff that's working around the blogs this week because, you know, Nintendo

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:07.420
had to face the investors this week and talking about their E3 conference and how some folks

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.420
decided to create change.org petitions out of it.

01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.220
Comment from Seguro Miyamoto on this whole thing.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:19.740
Quote, Sony and Microsoft had many announcements of future titles that were not playable.

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:22.060
VR lined the floor as a dream exhibit.

01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:25.220
There were lots of video demos of those titles.

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:29.340
And he went on to talk about how the Nintendo had the playable demos and Miyamoto said they

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.820
got high praise.

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.460
This is what Nintendo's booth looked like.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.940
It was different from other companies.

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:37.180
Everyone was smiling, having fun with games.

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:40.740
There are years when products are more finished and we can communicate their appeal.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.940
This may explain the difference this year.

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:47.620
And they also said there are some unannounced third-party collaborations that are still

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:48.900
in the works.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:49.900
I don't know.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:54.180
I just, again, and, you know, I try not to be like super harsh for Nintendo.

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:55.820
I try to be open-minded.

01:05:55.820 --> 01:06:01.100
But like, it's a total line of bullshit, this whole thing, where we believe that at E3 we

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:06.620
should only be showing the games six to twelve months out or whatever when just last year.

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:07.620
Just last.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.620
That's why I don't buy the argument.

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:12.060
Like, I was fucking there last year when they were showing Mario Maker and Star Fox the

01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:16.260
first time and some of these other games, like the Miyamoto concept games, that still

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.260
aren't out.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.700
So I'm like, I'm sorry.

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:22.780
That's some decision you just arbitrarily made this year on why you're showing what

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:23.780
you're showing this year.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.660
But Rumble is a last-gen feature.

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:26.660
Anyway.

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:27.660
Exactly.

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.740
That's the one thing that gets me going about these Nintendo lines is I do not buy that

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:32.740
for a minute.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.740
I'm sorry.

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.740
I'm sorry.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:38.780
Even if that's your whole new philosophy on E3, then that's one you decided on this year.

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:39.780
It's not something you've done forever.

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:40.780
Exactly.

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:41.780
Be just honest.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:43.500
You know what?

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.500
This year we decided that we're only going to show these games.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.500
Yeah.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.020
We have other stuff in the, you know, we're working on other things, but this is all we're

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.020
showing you.

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:51.020
All right.

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:55.240
Anyhow, that's, that's enough on the Nintendo front right now, especially when half of this

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.240
is rumor.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.580
Let's move on to some other stuff.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.580
Dark Sakura.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.380
The voice of reason.

01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:02.380
Usually.

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.180
She'll give you one reason.

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:13.020
Well, there is a new bit of goodies for folks who have donated, well I should say back to

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:16.100
the Shenmue 3 Kickstarter.

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:21.260
At the $60 level, they'll get a physical copy of the game, which is nice because there are

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:24.400
people out here who like physical copies of their damn games.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:30.380
Who have entire rooms of their house dedicated to physical copies of their damn game.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:37.300
So you'll either get it for PS4 or Windows, whichever choice you want.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:46.700
And they also included an apology, excuse me, for their Twitch broadcast and basically

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.620
just said it didn't work very well.

01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:49.620
Sorry.

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.340
I didn't hear about the Twitch broadcast.

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:52.340
What went wrong?

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.340
Did anybody follow that?

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.340
It just said that it botched.

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.420
Uh oh.

01:07:55.420 --> 01:08:01.980
Did it botch like Final Fantasy 14 on the Mac bad or are we talking like, I'm just saying.

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:05.960
I didn't say anything and I honestly don't really watch much on Twitch.

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.140
So I didn't watch it.

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:10.540
I didn't even know there was a Twitch broadcast, but they said sorry.

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:15.780
So well, a lot of times that's something they'll do to try and raise money for Kickstarters

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:19.540
is that the creators will kind of get on Twitch and take their case to the public basically

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:23.660
and you know, show some more art or any types of renderings that they put together and so

01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:24.660
forth.

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.940
And that was something they were showing with Shenmue, but they must have just had some

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:30.060
technical difficulties or something.

01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:32.180
So let's see.

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:35.600
Fifth Dream in chat says the guys on it were kind of goofy and we're trying to be funny

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.140
instead of trying to hype people to pledge and it kind of flopped.

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.620
So maybe they said they were sincerely sorry.

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.260
Get me to host a telethon.

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:46.380
I'll raise money.

01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.980
Get Dark Sakura and Loki.

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:50.500
If you don't donate to this, you're an idiot.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.940
So here's the list of reasons why.

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:52.940
Someone gets me a burrito.

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:53.940
I'll run a telethon.

01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:59.580
Let's go to the tote board and see how many tacos are in my tummy.

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:05.260
But eight, only eight, I need some more tacos here right now.

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:06.740
I'm actually legit hungry.

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:10.820
So everything reminds me of tacos.

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.980
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Twitch is too mainstream for Dark Sakura.

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:16.940
You going to go over to hitbox?

01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.340
No.

01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:22.700
I've broadcasted on Twitch before, but only when I was playing Hot to Full Boyfriend.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.180
So maybe I'll do another replay.

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.700
But then it became too mainstream, so you know.

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:27.700
Whatever.

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:34.560
So maybe I'll do another replay of the secret Hurtful Boyfriend ending that takes literally

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.560
three hours to play through.

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:36.560
What about the sequel?

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.980
Aren't they making a sequel?

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:38.980
That was the sequel.

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:43.920
It was, well not, there were other versions, there were other games that were in the series

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:48.060
and like a visual novel and some stuff, but you only need Hot to Full Boyfriend.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.620
I thought the developer was making a news.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.580
No, they're doing, it's just Hot to Full Boyfriend.

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:59.460
It's not even any type of new or anything, it's just Hot to Full Boyfriend.

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:01.220
The new Hot to Full Boyfriend.

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:05.780
It's just Hot to Full Boyfriend, the same one, which is nothing new.

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:10.220
Alright, let's move on to some more stories, Loki.

01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:15.300
So perfect example of hey, if you're not going to make it, then we'll make it and we'll leave

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.420
your company and make it anyways.

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:23.980
So Comcept has gone back to announce that they're going to be putting out yet another

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:24.980
game.

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:30.340
This was announced during Anime Expo, it's a game called Red Ash and it is a legendary

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:37.180
game with legends and yes, it's headed- Legendary?

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:40.600
It's very legend-y, legendary.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.980
It's a mega man, it's a legend.

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:49.780
Yes so, it's basically Mega Man Legends minus Mega Man.

01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:56.260
So Red Ash or Re-Dash?

01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:02.780
It's pretty clever, these Kickstarter titles for games that publishers won't do anymore,

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.900
they're cracking me up more than anything with the whole blood-stained ritual.

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:11.660
Because it's, because people want this shit and they're funding it and they're buying

01:11:11.660 --> 01:11:12.660
it.

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:17.780
Fuck you Capcom, we don't need you anymore and I think that's- hello, maybe you should

01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:19.520
listen to your audience.

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.160
If people want the game, they're going to find a way to get it.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.700
Why can't you fund a lower budget project or something?

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:31.700
I don't understand why people are so- I guess they have shareholders, a lot of good they're

01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.820
doing you.

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:38.280
Well here's the thing with this Kickstarter, although this is very exciting and I'm excited

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:44.160
to hear about this, I have to admit, I'm very cautious because I find it odd that we're

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:48.360
going to Kickstarter for the next project when Mighty No. 9 isn't out.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:51.720
But it's got a release date and it's got a physical disc version that they're going to

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.720
be pressing.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.720
I get it.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.720
It's towards the end.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.200
And judging from the beta, it's almost done.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.600
Yeah and I know there's a beta, so I know people have had their hands on it and so forth,

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:07.640
but I don't know, I do find it- and I realize that they work on games like they're starting

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:12.600
this cycle, it's kind of like, I don't know, what's a game that's almost out like in stores

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.600
right now?

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.260
What's coming out like in September?

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:16.260
Yarn Yoshi or something?

01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:19.360
Yarn, okay, Yoshi's Yarn, well that's already out in Europe, but whatever.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:23.200
Yoshi's Yarn work was probably done in like February, you know, or even sooner than that,

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.440
probably before the holidays.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.640
You know, it just takes a little time to get all the discs printed, get all the, you know,

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.640
publishing and things done.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.720
They go bold though only a few weeks prior to launch.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.600
It's not that- they're literally working up to date.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:33.960
But they're starting their next project.

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:34.960
Well yeah.

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.040
There's very few people working on it at the end.

01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:40.440
The rest, everybody else wants to keep a job, so they're thinking about their next project

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.440
in advance.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:46.640
So from that end, I get it, but at the same time, just as a consumer on Kickstarter, I

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:50.560
feel like, I don't know how I feel about backing your project when I haven't really been able

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.240
to assess your first project.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:53.240
But I think that this-

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.240
And if I trust you-

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.720
It's a little bit different than say, you know, oh, they just finished funding for Mighty

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.420
Number Nine and like two months later, oh, we're funding another Kickstarter project.

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:09.260
It's a little bit different when this is like just coming out in a few months, literally

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.260
like two months away.

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:11.260
Yeah.

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:13.260
That's release candidate type stuff.

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.660
You know, now you've got a new project being Kickstarted.

01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.700
I'm kind of okay with that.

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:21.900
It's when you have no- and I understand they have really no track record right now, but

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:27.660
it's- people have actually seen it, played it, they know it's good.

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.460
It's coming out very soon.

01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:30.460
I mean-

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:33.200
I haven't heard a hundred percent positive, I'm just saying.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.920
Like there's been some things I've seen- and granted, I can't really judge myself till

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.920
I play it.

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:38.920
I haven't.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.920
So, you know, disclaimer, whatever.

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:43.380
But I'm seeing some people were like, this isn't really what I was expecting.

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.380
So-

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:49.960
A lot of people are also expecting it to look exactly like the concept art, which is stupid.

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.660
It never looks exactly like the concept art.

01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.040
That's why it's concept art.

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:57.160
Go to our chat room over at live.voggenetwork.com.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:00.420
Dungeon Buster says Deep Silver's already on board as a distributor and technically

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:04.060
it was supposed to be out a few months ago, actually hitting its estimated release date

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:05.460
before more happened.

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:08.980
MXC says the build of Mighty No. 983 seemed practically done.

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:12.860
I would have preferred that concept waited until it released for this new Kickstarter

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.860
though.

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:19.100
And Bobby Blackwolf says they don't need artists for games they're currently in final bug fix.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:25.180
So this is probably about, you know, starting that next project before the other one is,

01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:26.180
you know-

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:27.860
And I'm all over a new Mega Man Legends game.

01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:28.860
I know.

01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:34.500
And there's still a part of me that's very like, I feel like I really want to play Mighty

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:35.500
No. 9.

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.620
Well, I didn't back Mighty No. 9.

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:37.620
You know what?

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:38.620
I didn't either, actually.

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:39.620
Funny enough.

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:40.620
But I'll buy it when it comes out.

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:45.100
I just, I'm not, you know, I didn't back Bloodstained either.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:46.100
I don't know.

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:49.260
The last thing I backed was We Happy Few.

01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:51.620
I'll check out Mighty No. 9 when it comes out.

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:56.100
And then if I like that, I'll buy this other one when it comes out, probably.

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.780
You know, I'm interested enough in it, but I don't, I don't know.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:03.660
Like does that make me a bad fan because I don't want to run to Kickstarter and pay

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:04.660
in advance?

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:07.420
Like, I don't think there's also anything wrong with saying, that looks neat, can't

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.420
wait to play it when it's out.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.460
You know, like I don't have to back it.

01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:11.460
That's all right.

01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:12.980
It's, there's two sides of the fence here.

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.700
I'll fully display my own bias.

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:19.940
I'm probably at least a hundred bucks or so deep into both of those projects and soon

01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:24.340
Red Ash, but still and all, you know, if you want to be a little bit more patient about

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:25.620
it, just wait till it's out.

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:26.620
That's okay too.

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:31.380
I mean, there are those that, I guess in this whole crowdfunding world now, the game isn't

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:36.620
going to even have a chance if some people don't dive in, but you know, it's, it's just

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:37.620
one of those things.

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:38.620
Yeah.

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:39.620
And I get that.

01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:42.460
And like, if I don't contribute on the Kickstarter, then I can't complain if it doesn't happen,

01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.500
which I'm willing to accept that.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:48.940
But I was gonna say, you're, you're a high roller on some of these Kickstarters.

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:52.020
You say you dropped a hundred bucks on Bloodstained and Mighty No. 9?

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:53.020
Yeah.

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:54.020
Wow.

01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:55.900
What, why, why'd you roll big on those?

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:57.580
For one, I'm probably...

01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:59.540
First, you should spend your money however the hell you want.

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:03.300
I'm not asking you to justify that, but I'm just saying, what, what drove you to that?

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.300
Fanboyism.

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:07.540
I'll come to you about fanboyism.

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:08.540
I love your honesty.

01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:09.540
I'm like, fine.

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:14.540
You know, I am the big, you know, Mega Man fan, and I've not been too pleased with the

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:16.300
lack of titles lately.

01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:20.220
So as soon as I saw that Imafune was on board trying to make something, you know, a spiritual

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:23.140
successor, I'm like, okay, fine.

01:16:23.140 --> 01:16:24.900
I can, I can be okay with this.

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:28.580
You know, spiritual successor's down, you know, System Shock 2 going to BioShock.

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:29.580
Okay.

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:30.580
I liked that.

01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:32.580
Wasn't exactly the same thing, but it was close.

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:33.580
So okay.

01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.800
Creator on board with Mighty No. 9.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.180
I have high hopes for this.

01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:40.260
Let me go ahead and back this, you know, right away.

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:44.940
Ditto for, uh, uh, for Iga and, uh, and Bloodstained.

01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:51.220
What do you think about the whole, um, um, the Mega Man re-release thing?

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:54.020
Cause you said, you said that they haven't been showing Mega Man a lot of love, but then

01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:57.220
we just had this news come out about 1 through 6 HD or whatever.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.060
I posted about this a while back.

01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.260
When's that coming out, by the way?

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:02.260
I don't know if I caught it.

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:03.780
Did anybody in chat catch the release date for that?

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.920
I would assume it's before Holiday or around Holiday.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:12.700
What if they're trying to piggyback on Mighty No. 9 coming out to try to, like, get some

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:13.700
stuff?

01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:14.700
That's, that's business, bitches.

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:16.700
Yeah, I understand that, but I'm just saying.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:17.700
That's what they do.

01:17:17.700 --> 01:17:19.340
Oh, here's the thing about the Legacy Collection.

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:21.180
I, I, I made a post about it.

01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.180
In fact, I think it is.

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:25.420
I think it is right around the time of Mighty No. 9's release, and I think it's, you're,

01:17:25.420 --> 01:17:26.420
you're probably right.

01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.420
That's business, bitches.

01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:28.420
It is.

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.420
What is it?

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:32.780
Why do they, why do they do those direct-to-video things when, like, Jurassic World is coming

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:33.780
out?

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:34.780
Oh, mockbusters.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:35.780
Why do they, yeah, the mockbusters.

01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:36.780
They come out with, like, Dinosaur Planet.

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:38.500
Oh yeah, because those companies do that.

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:39.620
That's, that's their company.

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:40.620
They do that.

01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:41.620
I mean, it's.

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:42.620
That's what they do.

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.620
Anyway, Drew, sorry.

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:46.020
So here's the thing about the Legacy Collection, and I, I, I spoke on this a while back when

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:47.460
it was, when it was first announced.

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:54.340
I made a couple posts about it, but Capcom kind of puts die-hard Mega Man fan-moi into

01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:56.260
kind of a catch-22.

01:17:56.260 --> 01:18:02.140
If I don't buy it, it pretty much means that, oh, the fans aren't, you know, people aren't

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:05.900
interested in the Mega Man series anymore, and we don't see any new games.

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:11.300
If I do buy it, and other, you know, other fans, if we do buy it, it says, okay, it says

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:16.020
to Capcom, oh, they're, they'll go ahead and keep on buying the old shit, and no new games

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.740
are going to be made in the series.

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:22.420
I know they're trying to test the waters, but it does put the fans in a difficult position.

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:26.260
That said, I'll buy it anyway, Capcom, take my money.

01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:28.940
No, no, here's, here's, here's how you have to look at it, actually.

01:18:28.940 --> 01:18:33.820
Look at it, look at it, you know, a few years back with Konami.

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:38.540
Oh, sure, we'll support all your fucking, you know, Bomani stuff, and we'll support

01:18:38.540 --> 01:18:43.980
your, oh, Rock Revolution, okay, that shit, you know, but we'll keep supporting this stuff

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:47.380
because we're hoping that another Dance Dance Revolution game comes out or something, but

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:48.380
it never does.

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:52.980
So, you can support Mega Man and those old collections all you want.

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:56.740
That shit ain't going to fucking come out, regardless if you support it or not.

01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:01.500
My understanding is that, you know, Digital Eclipse is really making this with, you know,

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:04.820
Capcom's blessing or whatever, and, and I think part of the reason why I'm prone to

01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:09.300
support it is I'm kind of swayed over by Digital Eclipse's argument of that it is more of a

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:14.260
criterion collection of games, and, okay, they may have picked a game that, you know,

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:18.660
already had this collection or whatever, but I kind of like that idea about, like, if we're

01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:25.220
going to go back and revisit old shit, like, let's give it a real pristine, you know, release.

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:29.060
Let's go back and, you know, update little things and inject some leaderboards into it.

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:32.700
This is all I've ever talked about for Virtual Console, right, like, I would love it if all

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:36.100
the Virtual Console releases looked kind of like this Mega Man thing is shaping up to

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:37.100
be.

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:40.220
I don't know, in that regard, I'm kind of won over a little bit.

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:46.140
I mean, even that Mega Man collection, you know, it wasn't, it didn't have online leaderboards

01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:49.820
or any of those, you know, social things that these new systems have or whatever, and I

01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:53.540
realize these aren't big things and probably aren't winning everybody over, but I just

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:57.100
kind of think those are things that are weighing on my decision and I'll probably end up getting

01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:58.100
it.

01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:02.980
The thing is, I know I'm not alone here when, you know, I say I'm, I love the older games,

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:06.620
I'm sick and tired of seeing them all over again.

01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:12.340
This is going to be, what, the fourth or fifth time in Virtual Console, anniversary collections,

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:13.460
what have you.

01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:14.460
Give me something new!

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:18.140
I am sick of The Wizard of Oz and I wish they would stop screening it in theaters.

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:22.140
I am just so goddamn sick of that movie, they don't need to release, The Wizard of Oz on

01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:27.020
Blu-ray, stop fucking up my Blu-ray section with another goddamn release of The Wizard

01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.020
of Oz.

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:29.020
Exactly.

01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:35.500
All their jolly singing, this isn't what I want to see.

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:37.460
Do lollipop men piss you off, Loki?

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:41.940
No, you know what, I want to see that fucking crossover, the Avengers fucking, you know,

01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:47.300
Wizard of Oz shit with the fucking dark ass, you know, tin man, that's the shit I want

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:48.300
to see.

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.820
Let's get some fucking Tim Burton shit out here, fuck Johnny Depp being in it and stuff,

01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:58.340
I want some dark ass Wizard of Oz, you know, fucking, I want it to be so goddamn dark that

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:03.580
Return of Oz seems like fucking ponies and magic and rainbows and shit, you know, that's

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:05.100
what I want to see.

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:09.220
I want kids to go in there, oh, Wizard of Oz, that sounds awesome, and I want them to

01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:14.540
come out fucking scared for their goddamn lives, like holy shit, I want them to be fucked

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:15.540
up.

01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:18.980
That was Return of Oz, that queen collected heads in a jar, that's why our generation

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:21.140
is fucked up, Loki, that movie.

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:24.940
Because people weren't ready for that yet, and then Futurama came out and it was okay.

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:30.060
They were giving Farooza bulk like shock therapy, it was like part of the plot of that movie.

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:32.060
It was an awesome movie.

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:33.300
Have you ever read the books?

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.860
Actually, yes, they're messed up too.

01:21:35.860 --> 01:21:39.620
Yeah, but they were, honestly, I thought they were good.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:43.900
That's why I'm saying, they need to take the books and adapt it to fucking darken shit.

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:48.460
Well jeez, Rob, you and your ruby shoes just invalidated my entire pissed off argument,

01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:50.500
that makes it all okay now!

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:54.940
Well, actually, in the book, they were silver slippers, I'll have you know.

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:55.940
Ewwww.

01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:56.940
Yes.

01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:57.940
Ewwww.

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:04.260
So they need to remake the whole fucking movie because the slippers were the wrong fucking

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:05.260
color.

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:07.260
So they need to go back and do it.

01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:11.540
The whole reason that they did that is because they would show up better on screen.

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:12.540
The end.

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:15.180
That's not a problem now in this day.

01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:20.540
I didn't buy no goddamn high definition television for you to tell me it can't show certain colors.

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:22.820
Alright, anyhow.

01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:32.860
Let's move on, shall we?

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:33.980
Let's talk about something else.

01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.620
Let's talk about music games.

01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:40.820
Better yet, Vocaloid games, because who doesn't love Hatsune Miku type of games, you know?

01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:42.900
I bought Project Diva.

01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:43.900
Did you?

01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.900
Yep.

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.900
Actually, those are fun games.

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:50.900
I really can't hate on those types of games, because Hatsune Miku, that's a fun series.

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:54.620
Well there's another series, this actually isn't a story about Hatsune Miku, but Vocaloid

01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:58.460
type games are pretty popular over in Japan.

01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:00.580
Like, you know, they have that growing popularity.

01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:05.940
They might not be as popular here, but there could be a reason for that.

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:10.160
And that is that they can't seem to ever release them here.

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:15.320
One game I want to talk about is Tamsoft's IAVT Colorful.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:19.980
It's a rhythm game that's based on first place's Vocaloid Idol.

01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:24.180
So, and you know what, this trailer has Japanese narration in it, but you can definitely hear

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:38.500
the music, so you'll know what I'm talking about here.

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:39.920
Like it's so happy.

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.260
How can you possibly be in a bad mood when you're playing a game like that and hearing

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.260
music like that?

01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:46.420
Well, can we work on that title first off?

01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:48.020
I know, right?

01:23:48.020 --> 01:23:49.020
That's a winning title for the American market.

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:53.260
It might need a different title if it comes over here, but anyway, here's the thing.

01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:56.580
As cute as that game sounds, you're probably going to have to import it if you ever want

01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:57.980
to play it.

01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:03.220
Producer of the game Kenshiro Takaaki said in an interview with Silicon Era, quote, since

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:08.400
it's a music title and since music is arguably one of the most protected media types artists

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.140
have, it just means more doors to knock on and more approvals to get.

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:16.300
It's far more difficult than a Senran Kagura title.

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:20.860
So in other words, a lot of these, you know, music rights issues and we, you know, covering

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:27.900
music games, we know that this is always an issue with trying to get games over here

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:30.860
is that the music licensing is always a pain in the ass.

01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:35.780
And to this day, here we are, what, 14 years later, I say this is why Konami turned a blind

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:38.640
eye to the DDR machines being over here.

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:42.220
At the end of the day, Konami didn't care because they were, you know, they probably

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:46.800
cared about the pirated machines, but the legit sale ones, whatever, they couldn't release

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:52.340
those games here because the US music industry wasn't going to license those songs at the

01:24:52.340 --> 01:24:54.660
same rates that the Japanese industry was.

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:59.880
So Konami could build up awareness of the games and release the home versions that did

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:02.660
have those, you know, I don't understand what the big deal is anyway.

01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:05.860
So what, you release something in another country and someone imports it.

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:10.360
Who gives a shit if, you know, licensing rights weren't paid over here as well as over there?

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:14.360
I mean, it just goes, I think they do give a shit because money, right money.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:18.040
Well, I understand, but like, I just don't understand why they feel that they're entitled

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:21.400
to more money because they feel like they're always entitled to more money.

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:25.300
Well, I think the music industry is just woefully out of touch with the fact that we are in

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:31.580
this global, you know, world now that we're connected because the internet and some would

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:35.600
say that's what fucked over the music industry in the late nineties was that Napster broke

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:42.740
down that wall real quick of, you know, being able to get stuff in Japan and the, you know,

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:46.980
no longer do people have to drop all this extra money to import CDs from other companies.

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:49.140
God, I remember I used to buy import CDs.

01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:53.800
I used to buy import singles to get like that extra rare bonus track and all that stuff.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.780
I don't have to do that in the digital age.

01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:56.780
That's done.

01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:59.740
I mean, now we're in the world of Spotify and Pandora and Apple music.

01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.660
What have you just started like this?

01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:02.660
Yeah.

01:26:02.660 --> 01:26:07.620
So, but I dunno, I kind of feel like in some ways the licensing needs to catch up a little

01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:08.620
bit too.

01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:11.820
And if you're gonna license things, it needs to be a global license in this day and age.

01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:16.060
Like I just don't understand the whole, and I'm sure there's more legal reasons, but I

01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:21.700
just from a, from a consumer viewpoint of I'll just import the damn thing from Japan,

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:25.260
whatever, you know, I, it just feels really out of touch with the global world we live

01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:26.260
in.

01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:30.100
Well, the licensing and the, uh, I guess the existing fan base, I mean, that does at least

01:26:30.100 --> 01:26:35.700
explain why for some odd reason we actually are getting persona for dancing all night.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.860
You want to talk about a niche spinoff title?

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:43.380
Do you know that I know several people that imported that though, because they can't wait.

01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:44.900
I almost did.

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:47.900
I almost did.

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:48.900
I'll wait.

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:49.900
I have on pre-order.

01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:50.900
I'm a bad person.

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.060
That's the one thing that's kept Shane out of heaven's word for like several hours this

01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:57.700
weekend is the fact that, oh yeah, I was not lying cause I was playing persona for dancing

01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:58.700
all night.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:26:59.700
I'm like, of course you were.

01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:00.700
Of course you were.

01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:01.700
Yeah.

01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:05.700
When I got my PlayStation, um, TV last week, I was like, well, can you guys pick up like

01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.340
a physical gaming video with that?

01:27:07.340 --> 01:27:11.540
That's all that's on the Vita nowadays is Japanese import games.

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:16.220
If that's what you're into, the Vita is your system right there and all sorts of the classics.

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:21.700
Hence why my new Vita is Japanese region this time, so I can actually play some new games.

01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:24.100
There you go.

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:29.420
Anyway, uh, that's, I just wanted to bring that up on, you know, we love music games.

01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:32.740
Uh, anyhow, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.380
Hopefully tacos.

01:27:34.940 --> 01:27:42.500
Um, well, this one is, uh, I have been reading the speculation for a while on this one, um,

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:47.900
and BioWare has this bad habit of putting out surveys that sort of, uh, not really leaks

01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:53.620
as much as spills out in a torrent of information, everything ever about anything they're going

01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.300
to do.

01:27:55.340 --> 01:28:05.180
So the survey that was released, um, said that there are ideas out for a $14.99 a DLC

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:07.940
for Dragon Age Inquisition related to the story.

01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:14.820
And it said that this is, uh, supposed to be like the last adventure as well as your

01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:15.820
next mission.

01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:18.780
So basically it's the fate of the Inquisition.

01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:24.980
Um, and the quote on here says that it's going to revolve around, and this is where the quote

01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:30.660
starts, the one who started it all and facing a great evil before it is too late.

01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:33.260
So of course, plenty of us are wondering, is it the Wolf Hunt?

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.080
Is it the Wolf Hunt?

01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:40.380
Some people think it's going to go in another direction, you know, but we're...

01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:46.180
But what you didn't know is that BioWare hired special guest author for this DLC, George

01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:49.180
R.R. Martin, and everyone will be killed.

01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:50.180
Yay!

01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:54.620
And then Porky Pig comes out at the end, bleep, bleep, bleep, that's all folks.

01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:58.900
Anyway, I'll read exactly what was in the, uh, the email thing.

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:03.660
It said, uh, having saved the world of Thedas by closing the breach, your next mission will

01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:06.100
determine the future of the Inquisition.

01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:10.300
Your mark suddenly glows, erupting with magic connected to the Fade, which makes me instantly

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.820
think of who I think it is.

01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:17.560
Assassin's attack in shadow, an invasion of enemies begins, when a race against time to

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.580
face a great evil before it is too late.

01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:25.500
In this story-based expansion, playable after the events of Dragon Age Inquisition, you

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:29.860
will embark on a last adventure with your team to confront the one who started it all.

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:33.180
Part of me also hopes that this is our version of Citadel.

01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:34.180
Of the Citadel DLC.

01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:36.100
Took the words right out of my mouth.

01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:39.500
And then they're traveling through the woods and all of a sudden they come across this

01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:45.460
crashed spaceship, happens to be the normal guy, and a strange child.

01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:49.180
From the bullet points, you get to fight a bunch of Qunari.

01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:54.380
You have brand new areas to go through, you get to go through the Fade, and different

01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:57.500
optional gameplay modes.

01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:01.420
More romance scenes, because the Citadel really brought some feels, like remember the Thane

01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:02.420
thing in the Citadel DLC?

01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:03.740
That was some, that was some feels.

01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:05.620
I should go.

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:14.340
There's also an add-on pack that has spoils of Avvar, and that came from Jaws of Hakkon,

01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:17.760
we had the Black Emporium come out.

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:22.900
I will tell you this, for anyone looking for folks who are playing the beta, there's

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:29.600
no beta stuff out yet, and that's all I can say about it, because NDA, so.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.320
Yeah, but if anything was out there it would be all over the internet.

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:36.360
Yeah, other people would say so, not me, but I'm just saying, if anyone's looking to beta

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:40.480
testers to reveal anything, there's nothing out there yet.

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.720
No beta releases.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.840
Go into the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:49.320
Fifth Dream says, I got a survey about that DLC, so it's out there.

01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.320
She isn't making it up, folks.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.320
It's out there.

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.600
Yeah, just, there's nothing out there being tested yet, so.

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:59.380
What's the one thing you really want to see in this DLC as a big Dragon Age fan, Darzara?

01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:04.500
I definitely want to see a resolution for the Solas romance, because that was the first

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:11.400
one I did, and now I'm all about Cullen, so whatever, but I would like to see a resolution

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:16.200
and have that play into what I think is going to happen.

01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:17.200
Alright.

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:18.200
Yeah.

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:21.440
Well, in the meantime, we have some things that are coming out a little sooner than this

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:22.440
DLC.

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:25.680
It's travel around the world and check out some release dates, starting off with the

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:26.880
US, Loki.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.540
As it previously stated when we were talking about Nintendo releasing the NX in July, there

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:34.720
is nothing coming out in July, and that is the case this week.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:37.720
There is nothing coming out this week.

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:38.720
Very slow month.

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.720
It is an incredibly slow month, but it's typical.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:43.720
That's true.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:47.960
Not even, you would think with this holiday weekend we just had, we would have had something

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:48.960
a little...

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:49.960
Typically, no.

01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:50.960
Yeah.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:51.960
Alright.

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:54.120
Well, traveling on over to Japan to see if the story is a little different there.

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:58.120
Checking out the Japanese releases, you know, I gotta say, it's looking a little empty in

01:31:58.120 --> 01:31:59.120
Japan as well.

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:02.760
We don't really have releases on the PlayStation 4 until July 16th.

01:32:02.760 --> 01:32:08.240
That's when Batman Arkham Knight finally gets its release, but again, that is on July 16th.

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:10.800
Xbox One, pretty much the same story.

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:16.000
So I'm gonna turn to the Wii U, which also, July 16th is when Yoshi's Woolly World comes

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
out.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.760
Otherwise, it's slow over there.

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:23.520
Even the Vita, the only thing the Vita has this week is Taiko no Tatujin V version comes

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:26.120
out on July 9th.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:29.880
So that is pretty much the lone release there on the Vita for this coming week.

01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:35.120
And then lastly, on the 3DS, we have a little more on the 3DS this week.

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:43.240
For July 9th, we have Chō to Sōchū Atsumare Sakyō no Tūsōshia Tachi comes out from

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:44.820
Bandai Namco.

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:50.640
And on July 11th, this is kind of a big deal, Yokoi Watch Busters.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:53.400
Is this, are these games, this might be like a spinoff game.

01:32:53.400 --> 01:33:00.320
I don't think this is actual Yokoi Watch game, but these are like a little spinoff game.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:02.400
Those are available on the 3DS this week.

01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:06.680
And that might be part of the reason why some other games are staying away, because those

01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:10.760
games are pretty big over in Japan, and they're going to see if they're going to end up being

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:14.840
a big deal here in the coming months when they finally release it here stateside.

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:16.800
But otherwise, that's really it for Japanese releases.

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:17.800
How about the UK?

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:20.840
Um, some things, not really much.

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:27.040
On the 7th, Geometry Wars 3 Dimensions, Worms World Party Remastered for PC.

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:29.440
And on the 8th, Numa Breath of Life.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.440
That's it.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:35.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000
Loki.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:44.160
So, apparently, Warner Brothers was well aware of the PC version condition for Arkham Knight

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.200
when it was released.

01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:55.520
Basically, they had some anonymous QA testers that, I guess, were part of a report to Kotaku.

01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.320
They were talking about, you know, basically, I will say that it's pretty rich for Warner

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:03.080
Brothers to act like they had no idea the game was in such a horrible state.

01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.360
It's been like this for months, and all the problems we see now are the exact same, unchanged

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.360
almost a year ago.

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:14.840
So, that's too bad.

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:19.160
How does that make you feel, Drew, as the consumer of Arkham Knight on PC, to know that

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.760
Warner knew what a hot mess it was?

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.760
Released it anyway.

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.520
Grrr.

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:28.920
I don't have a rant for this.

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.720
I'm internalizing it right now, I just don't have a rant for this.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:36.720
It's like, they, I don't know, because I feel like, you know, they're having to eat a lot

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:42.200
of money now with all these returns and things, so I just feel like, I don't know, if they

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:47.280
knew about it and still released it, it was not a healthy decision.

01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.760
I feel like I'm...

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:52.220
Some executive needs to reevaluate if that's the right career for them.

01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:56.960
It's like I was being mad at Obsidian over KOTOR 2 not being finished before I got pushed

01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.000
out the door.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.000
It's kind of like that.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.840
They said that only 10% of the testers are devoted to the PC version, and they were saying

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:09.760
that the console versions were not nearly as easy to work with as expected, and they

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:19.720
were testing primarily at 720p, and they were worried that the spoilers, you know, for Arkham

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:21.520
Knight would come out.

01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.520
Interesting.

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:23.520
Let's see.

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:28.560
Oh, don't worry, by the time it comes out in a playable form, I'll already be spoiled

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.560
on it.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:39.120
Yeah, so PC testing firms that are used to stress test games on different hardware conditions,

01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:42.700
but I guess maybe they weren't testing it well enough, I don't know.

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:47.600
But it sounds like that they were aware of the situation, and maybe, I don't know, once

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:51.940
again, like, if you know it's broken, then why release it?

01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:55.560
Were these test systems imaginary?

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:59.300
Because I know that I've been running a pretty good spec machine myself.

01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:02.340
I just think that they're just like, ah, fuck it, we're gonna release it and make money

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:04.980
off of it, and we'll patch it out later, you know.

01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:05.980
I don't know.

01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:12.580
I don't know what they thought, but the problem was, you know, maybe they made this decision

01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:15.420
prior to knowing that Steam was gonna do the refunds?

01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:17.840
I don't know.

01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:18.840
It says bad either way.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:23.200
Wait, let me, quick comment from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:27.880
says, gee, delay to fix it or suffer humiliation, be forced to pull it from sale, and then try

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:31.580
to fix it while getting criticized after, decisions, decisions.

01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:34.820
As Joan Hunter-Matt says, they probably evaluated that more people would be pissed that they

01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:39.320
delayed it again, rather than just release it and fix it later.

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:40.960
How do you come up with that?

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:41.960
Whatever.

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:42.960
Whatever.

01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:43.960
Anyway.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:48.340
And then there was a little bit of talk about the Harley Quinn DLC missions, or pre-order

01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:52.720
DLC that came with the game that you really, you add the pre-order of that to get it, otherwise

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:56.040
you're gonna miss out on 30 minutes of gameplay.

01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:57.040
That's how long it was.

01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:58.040
30 minutes long.

01:36:58.040 --> 01:36:59.040
30 minutes?

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.040
30 minutes of gameplay.

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.040
Oh my god.

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:07.440
But hey, I will have you know though, even though the PC version's broken, Batgirl DLC

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.440
is coming out.

01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:13.480
So be sure to pre-order that shit, because I'm glad that they're working on that and

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:15.720
not fixing the game.

01:37:15.720 --> 01:37:23.320
Alright, one more story I have for you guys, and a suitable segue into the classic game

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.400
of the week.

01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:27.920
The console that never was, the Super Nintendo PlayStation.

01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:30.740
Yes, that's right, the Super Nintendo PlayStation.

01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:33.560
You know, I bet a lot of you have probably already seen this on Facebook and other social

01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:39.120
media, but yeah, this really caught wildfire via Reddit, as some things tend to go viral

01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:40.920
over there.

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:46.800
And this guy on Reddit posted that he had the device, was posting pictures, and I think

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:49.840
he even posted a video of what this whole thing was.

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:53.720
And basically, you know, it was the whole, my dad worked for Nintendo type of thing,

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.700
although it was a little more complicated than that.

01:37:55.700 --> 01:37:59.800
My dad worked for a company, and somebody he used to work with worked at Nintendo, and

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:04.040
the dad's company went bankrupt, and the dad found it in a box of junk that he was supposed

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.040
to throw out.

01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:09.960
Now, here's the thing, the dude can't find a power cord that works on the system, so

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.320
he can't, like, just plug it in and play with it.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:18.680
So we don't know what the thing does, or what this mysterious cartridge that's also with

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:19.680
it.

01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:20.680
Yes, I'm sure it'll be-

01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:21.680
It said something on the cartridge, though.

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:22.680
It did.

01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:24.860
I'm sure it would be impossible to, I don't know, pick up a universal power supply and

01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:26.400
figure out, you know...

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.000
Yeah, they're not that difficult to make.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:34.880
Well, a lot of people are saying to be very careful, because this is very valuable hardware,

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.200
so you don't want to just plug any old power supply into it.

01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.560
Well, doesn't that say what kind of voltage it is?

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:39.560
It does.

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.160
It says 7.6 volts.

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:42.160
It says right there-

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.160
There you go!

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:44.160
That's gonna be too hard.

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:48.880
Just find a 7.6 volts DC power adapter, plug it in, done.

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:53.640
But I can also understand the whole, I don't want to, you know, maybe what's labeled isn't

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:56.880
what's really in it, because these are test units.

01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:01.300
Just saying, you know, I can understand when this thing could be thousands of dollars to

01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:04.480
a collector, why you might not want it to catch fire.

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:06.120
It's not gonna catch fire.

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:07.720
10-6-92?

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:13.120
Yeah, that's probably around the time frame when they were working on it.

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.680
I can't read this.

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.680
Yeah.

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:20.440
So, anyhow, let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognet.com.

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.840
Dungeon Buster says it's been sitting in a box of junk for years, so who knows what condition

01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:24.840
it's in.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.400
Hey, those Super Nintendos, though, they can take a beating.

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:31.000
Like they'll turn an awful, awful color, but they work.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.040
I think Dan had one that fell down two flights of stairs and it still worked.

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:35.440
Oh yeah, my Super Nintendo still works.

01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:38.000
But I bought Clue at a flea market a while ago.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.880
You can actually clean that discoloration off of it, too.

01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:41.880
Oh, can you?

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:45.280
They have like something meant for that, actually, that yellowing.

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.280
Nice.

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.400
Yeah, it was pretty hardcore plastic.

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:54.080
We remember talking one time about the Game Boy that survived a bomb blast.

01:39:54.080 --> 01:39:59.280
Oh yeah, because they have it in the museum at the Nintendo store in New York City.

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.280
Yep.

01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.280
Yeah, yeah.

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.280
Crazy.

01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:09.400
That is a good segue, I think, for us to get into the classic game of the week.

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.640
Dark Soccer is going to boot up her Super Nintendo PlayStation.

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:17.080
Just kidding, she doesn't have one, but she does have a Super Nintendo and a PlayStation.

01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:18.080
Several of each.

01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.560
So smush them together and step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:24.820
you kids should be checking out this game this week.

01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:25.820
Which actually...

01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:26.820
But don't do drugs.

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.640
Which actually, I think, comes from one of those systems, doesn't it?

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.640
Don't do drugs.

01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:31.220
Yes, don't do drugs.

01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:33.620
Or if you're, you know, going to do drugs.

01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:36.460
Do it with people watching you so they can laugh at you.

01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:37.460
Alright.

01:40:37.460 --> 01:40:38.460
And then put it on YouTube.

01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:39.460
Have a doctor's permission slip.

01:40:39.460 --> 01:40:40.460
Ooh, Oxycontin.

01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:42.820
I'm kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding, kidding.

01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:49.260
Okay, so the game of the week actually is a PlayStation game called LSD.

01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:50.260
Don't do drugs.

01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:51.260
Yes, don't do drugs.

01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:56.860
Also known as LSD Dream Emulator, which was released in Japan in 1998 and it came out

01:40:56.860 --> 01:41:02.680
on the PlayStation based on a dream journal that one of the staff members at Asmik Ace

01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:05.380
Entertainment had been keeping for over a decade.

01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:06.380
His name...

01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:14.700
Actually, I don't think it's a he because it sounds like a girl name, but Hiroko Nishikawa.

01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:19.700
Anyway, there were three products that were released about the journal.

01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:23.860
One of them is a music CD called LSD and Remixes.

01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:27.660
And Lovely Sweet Dream, both of those were limited.

01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:33.220
And then the game itself, because it is just so weird, has a kind of a cult following on

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:35.420
it.

01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:41.180
It also has been referenced that it could be sort of like a reference to the drug and

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:45.500
the, you know, surreal state of mind that it can put one in.

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:52.820
Although there's different phrases that are attributed to it, like in LVS Dream, so in

01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:56.660
Life the Sensuous Dream, or in Limbo the Silent Dream.

01:41:56.660 --> 01:42:02.380
There was a fan remake actually in progress since October 2011.

01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:05.420
There's a public alpha build out of it for Windows.

01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:10.580
So basically, it's a first person wander type of game.

01:42:10.580 --> 01:42:14.420
You can use the left and right directional buttons to look around, the up and down is

01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:18.500
to make you move forward or backwards, the front shoulder buttons turn around, back shoulder

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:21.580
is to strafe.

01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:23.780
And then you can hold the X button to run.

01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:27.820
You hear your footprint, your footsteps through the whole game too.

01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:30.220
And it's just depending on whatever type of environment that you're in.

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:33.180
And then this kind of odd music in the background.

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.500
So basically you're in like a dream world.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:38.300
You walk around and explore, you look around.

01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:45.460
If you bump into walls, you'll go into another dream because you are being linked into it.

01:42:45.460 --> 01:42:50.740
If you bump into people, animals, or special objects, you'll get an even weirder environment.

01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:55.340
Silent Stream is up to 10 minutes and then you'll wake up and then you'll be sent back

01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:56.700
to the menu.

01:42:56.700 --> 01:43:01.380
If you fall off a cliff or into a hole, you will wake up immediately.

01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:06.860
And you get a graph that tracks the player's state of mind, whether it's up or down or

01:43:06.860 --> 01:43:11.460
static or dynamic, depending on the areas that you go through.

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:15.460
And different states will affect your future dreams.

01:43:15.460 --> 01:43:22.860
So there are some different things that will happen over, like you'll get eyes on the walls

01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:25.380
that will stare at you.

01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:31.660
You can visit the same place several times, but it will change in different subtle ways.

01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:33.860
You'll get new items to encounter.

01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:39.780
You'll get new creatures, including a nymph that flies around, a wild horse running on

01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:40.780
the prairie.

01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:46.860
There's a man that fills up an entire room, a pterodactyl, and a face on legs.

01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:49.300
Moisturize me.

01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:50.300
What?

01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:51.300
Yes, I went there.

01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:52.300
A Doctor Who reference.

01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:53.300
Fantastic.

01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:58.100
You'll also meet a man in a gray trench coat who people have called the shadow man or the

01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:01.620
gray man, and he glides only in one direction.

01:44:01.620 --> 01:44:04.700
He doesn't have any walking animation.

01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:11.700
You can walk around him and see his full model, but his head is always slightly bent

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:13.020
toward you.

01:44:13.020 --> 01:44:16.940
If you get too close to him, the screen will flash and he'll disappear.

01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:20.700
And then it removes your ability to recall the dream.

01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:24.380
So you can, you know, you get the ability to revisit some of the dreams, but these are

01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:25.900
the ones that you can't.

01:44:25.900 --> 01:44:33.180
You also get an abyss demon who lures you to a site that you just can't get to.

01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:37.420
And then he will appear like, and make you go into a new game.

01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:42.280
He also will, there's sometimes a giant man in a wall who will headbutt you.

01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:48.020
So it's just a bunch of weirdness and you can, you know, after about 15 to 30 days of

01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:54.700
playing, you get the flashback, which is about two to four minutes of going back to some

01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:57.500
of the previous dreams.

01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:58.500
The...

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:00.580
Kaijuto wants to know, is Freddy in it?

01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:01.580
No.

01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:02.580
It's me.

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:03.980
You know what this reminds me of?

01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:09.020
Just looking at footage of this, it looks like a first person version of a game I heard

01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:15.560
of called Yume Nikki, which is kind of a, I guess, more of a dream or nightmare simulator.

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:16.980
But that was like third person type stuff.

01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:17.980
It's very strange.

01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:24.220
It looks like one of those fucked up VR demos used to download from a BBS in the 1990s.

01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:28.180
There's, the music in this game though is really striking for this.

01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:36.020
It was composed by Osamu Sato, has 500 patterns of background music.

01:45:36.020 --> 01:45:44.860
And the soundtrack was compiled into the LSD and remixes.

01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:50.020
And there was also an album called Lucy in the Sky with Dynamites.

01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:54.860
And yeah, so it's a really freaky game.

01:45:54.860 --> 01:46:00.740
I actually have played an emulated version of it once and it gave me nightmares.

01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:04.420
So I probably wouldn't recommend it to too many people.

01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:08.460
So don't play this game for the first time in Classic Game of the Week history.

01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:10.300
It was the trench coat guy.

01:46:10.300 --> 01:46:11.500
It was just the weirdest thing.

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:19.060
But I mean, I could make up a dream game, you know, like a literal dream game.

01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:23.460
The like from weird dreams that I have, because I have weird dreams all the fucking time.

01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:26.540
And mine would probably be more interesting and better rendered.

01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:31.060
If I can play Slenderman and still always sleep at night, you can play LSD.

01:46:31.060 --> 01:46:35.340
You still haven't played that Five Nights at Freddy's that I got you.

01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:38.820
I still apparently have been given an open challenge to go through at least four nights.

01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:39.820
Good luck.

01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:43.380
I made it through two and then died on the third, so whatever.

01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:45.020
All right.

01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:50.780
There it is, your Classic Game of the Week LSD Dream Emulator for the PlayStation 1.

01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:54.500
There's nothing quite like it out there, so check that out.

01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:56.420
Or don't, because it'll give you horrible nightmares.

01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:58.220
Hey, we're going to take a quick break.

01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:02.260
But when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, hey, something very special

01:47:02.260 --> 01:47:04.180
for you guys tonight.

01:47:04.180 --> 01:47:07.940
Because Drew is here and we have a blast from the past, I thought, you know what?

01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:11.860
Let's do a segment that we haven't done in a long time here on OLR.

01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:17.660
So tonight, the return of Video Game Match Game is coming back.

01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:27.860
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:34.020
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live with our 604th episode in progress

01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:37.860
for this July the 5th of 2015.

01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.860
And we're going to get right back into it here, because we've got a busy segment coming

01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:41.860
up.

01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:44.300
We're already running a little long, and we're throwing a match game into it.

01:47:44.300 --> 01:47:48.300
But of course, if you're just joining us live, we have Intern Drew coming back to the

01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:51.100
show for the first time in four years.

01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:52.100
You're welcome.

01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:53.100
You having fun tonight?

01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:54.500
I didn't ask for you to come.

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:55.500
You just showed up.

01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:56.500
I'm just kidding.

01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:02.060
A certain somebody walked by a certain someone else's cube at a certain locat and said, hey,

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:03.140
you coming to the show?

01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:06.760
It's always good to see some old school people here in the studio.

01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:08.820
We like the new school people, too.

01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:10.580
We like a little bit of both.

01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:11.580
Just like us, better.

01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:12.580
Whatever.

01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:13.580
All right.

01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:14.860
We're going to get back into it.

01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:16.500
We've got some rapid fire news coming at you.

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:17.500
Loki.

01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:25.260
So there's a game called Zero Gravity AX that's supposed to be coming to the Wii U, and it's

01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:30.900
basically an indie version of F-Zero, and it looks pretty amazing.

01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:36.140
However, unfortunately, as cool as it looks, they decided to take it down, because it's

01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:40.420
a little too much like F-Zero, like literally the ship that they put in there, that's straight

01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:41.540
out of F-Zero.

01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:45.580
So they're retooling it right now.

01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:51.220
Basically the comment was, we're going to cancel the project due to the big amount of

01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:56.260
negative feedback in the discussion about the Blue Falcon, and copyright made our decision

01:48:56.260 --> 01:48:57.260
easy.

01:48:57.260 --> 01:49:00.340
The footage on the page was an earlier build and a prototype.

01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:05.860
It never should be in the final game in this form, as written down on the Kickstarter page.

01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:11.740
However, we have learned that from that, we understand that now that an F-Zero indie

01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:15.140
remake from a small dev team is not what you guys want.

01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:18.580
We thank everybody who shared our campaign and who gave us feedback.

01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:19.700
So they'll probably come back at some point.

01:49:19.700 --> 01:49:20.700
It looks pretty amazing.

01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:26.080
It may look like an F-Zero game that was done by an indie team.

01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:30.180
It's sad that an indie team can pull off something that cool, but Nintendo doesn't want to bother

01:49:30.180 --> 01:49:31.180
with it.

01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:32.940
Oh, it's great that an indie team can pull off something that cool.

01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:38.140
I know, I'm just saying it's sad that Nintendo doesn't want to, but look at the potential

01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:39.140
of this.

01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:40.140
It looks amazing.

01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.300
Follow the example of Axiom Verge, for instance.

01:49:42.300 --> 01:49:45.180
Yeah, Axiom Verge turned out great.

01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:47.900
I think there's a lot they can still do with that there.

01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:53.740
I even liked a game like Blur, which kind of was like F-Zero meets Mario Kart, but yet

01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:55.820
the public really rejected that game.

01:49:55.820 --> 01:50:00.980
But I thought it was better than people made it out to be, that's for sure.

01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:07.780
In Australia, they have now banned some more video games, and the reason for this is that

01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:16.220
they've adopted a new video game classification model to help age-rate digital games on Steam

01:50:16.220 --> 01:50:24.540
and stuff like that, and based on that, they have refused classification to 220 different

01:50:24.540 --> 01:50:25.540
games.

01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:26.540
Geez.

01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:34.460
And some of the games that are banned are Douchebag Beach Club and Drunk Driver, obviously

01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:38.980
these go figure games.

01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:46.220
So apparently this is within a four month times ban that these 220 games have been refused

01:50:46.220 --> 01:50:53.780
classification, which is apparently four times the amount in the last past decade.

01:50:53.780 --> 01:51:00.300
What was that game that was on GameCube, the one that had the, it was so bad, and then

01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:02.980
it turned out there was like an underage girl in it, and it was really really awkward.

01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:03.980
The guy game!

01:51:03.980 --> 01:51:04.980
The guy game.

01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:05.980
Oh, guy game, yep.

01:51:05.980 --> 01:51:07.980
I'm sure that got banned.

01:51:07.980 --> 01:51:12.500
Best way to pimp your game in other countries, say it was so hardcore, it got banned in Australia.

01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:13.780
Banned in Australia.

01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:16.660
Come play, what was that, Douchebag Beach Club?

01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:18.020
Douchebag Beach Club.

01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:20.300
Douchebag Beach Club, banned in Australia.

01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:22.300
Or Drunk Driver.

01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:27.340
Oh my god, anyway, well if you want to play something a little more friendly that's not

01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:31.500
going to be banned in Australia, because it's paint, it's not blood, it's paint, of course

01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:34.060
I'm talking about Splatoon.

01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:38.660
And Splatoon, you know, still rolling out some features and updates, you know, obviously

01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:41.740
we were going back and forth a little bit on the teen cat and dog thing, which was part

01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:46.380
of the Splatfest that happened on the 4th of July, however before that happened, Tower

01:51:46.380 --> 01:51:49.940
Control was actually released into ranked mode.

01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:55.300
Tower Control is maps that have one floating tower in the center, and you're going to hop

01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:58.420
on it and ride it towards the opponent's base.

01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:02.660
Holding the tower takes you further into the enemy territory, but of course that's going

01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:05.660
to leave you a little more vulnerable to getting splatted.

01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:10.380
So you have to use teamwork, which is interesting because there's no voice chat, but I'm not

01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:12.420
going to be that guy this week.

01:52:12.420 --> 01:52:17.380
That is totally a ripoff of, what was it, Harmonics' first person shooter, they had

01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:18.780
something exactly like that.

01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:23.580
Well you know what though, it's still variety, I think that's a good thing, I think it's

01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:27.620
a good thing for Splatoon to keep adding those features and more fun for the game or what

01:52:27.620 --> 01:52:28.620
have you.

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:34.460
And by the way, with all that, the update to version 1.3.0, and some of the changes,

01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:37.460
for example, when there are more members on one team than the other and the matchmaking

01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:42.880
process takes too long, members from the same team will be able to battle each other, interesting.

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:47.860
Some ability adjustments to Ninja Squid, Stealth Jump, and Ink Resistance up, and yeah, so

01:52:47.860 --> 01:52:53.820
lots of little things here and there, so check that out.

01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:57.700
Also in the world of Shovel Knight, Shovel Knight is coming to retail, Shovel Knight

01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:02.740
will be released on the Wii U, the 3DS, the PlayStation 4, and the Xbox One at retail.

01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:07.120
The date, October 13th for North America, October 16th in Europe.

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:11.460
You will get everything that's been released so far, and there's going to be some other

01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:12.780
stuff as well.

01:53:12.780 --> 01:53:19.260
The Specter Knight campaign, the King Knight's campaign, battle mode, and body swap mode,

01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:23.940
so you can do that, which will allow you to change Shovel Knight into a lady and Shield

01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:28.380
Knight into a dude, so you can swap genders there, so there you go, and you can swap the

01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:30.460
rest of the cast if you want.

01:53:30.460 --> 01:53:34.460
You also get an instruction booklet with the physical copies, so I think there's going

01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:39.140
to be a lot of people excited there about those Shovel Knight releases, which, speaking

01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:44.820
of these physical releases, Wii U and 3DS are apparently going to be getting something

01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:46.620
a little bit special.

01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:51.760
The Plague of Shadows and, no I'm sorry, those are actually, oops, sorry, misspoke, that's

01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:55.060
already coming into the game, the Plague of Shadows and the battle mode, you can tell

01:53:55.060 --> 01:54:00.080
I have not played either of those yet, but apparently something is going to be happening

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:04.860
for the Nintendo versions that's similar to the God of War content and the Sony one, or

01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:07.220
the Battletoads and the Xbox One.

01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:12.760
So something will be happening there on the Nintendo platforms, but we don't know exactly

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:14.600
what it is.

01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:16.920
Could it be a battle with Ganon?

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:19.780
Something where maybe you work with Mario and Luigi?

01:54:19.780 --> 01:54:21.060
Who knows?

01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:22.060
It's always Ganon.

01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:23.060
Amiibo support!

01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:24.060
Amiibo support?

01:54:24.060 --> 01:54:25.060
Oh please?

01:54:25.060 --> 01:54:26.060
Please, please?

01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:31.060
Dire Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:33.980
Well, how many people really like Star Wars?

01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:35.420
A bunch.

01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:41.960
So Star Wars Battle, I'm sorry I'm still full of the delicious kettle corn, thanks Rob.

01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:47.540
Star Wars Battlefront is not going to be doing space battles, there are no space maps, but

01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:56.700
now also there will not be infantry battles, and there will not, at least on a map that

01:54:56.700 --> 01:54:58.660
is based on the Death Star.

01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:03.220
So there's not going to be basically a Death Star map, but they said stay tuned for more

01:55:03.220 --> 01:55:06.940
details, so whatever, there's no Death Star, I'm not interested.

01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:13.020
This is looking less and less like Battlefront.

01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:21.980
And then Tekken, woo hoo Tekken, and you know what makes me happy, Kuma!

01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:31.940
Basically Tekken 7 has already been doing some teasers, and there have been, I'd probably

01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:38.540
say a few more different interesting things, but now there was, said that there's going

01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:46.500
to be a major announcement on July 7th, and I wish, I hope that it's gone.

01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:51.580
As in the character, gone, because.

01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:52.700
Because dinosaurs.

01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:53.700
Because dinosaurs.

01:55:53.740 --> 01:56:02.460
Well, and also that, and you might, there's been an allusion to Jack coming back as Jack

01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:04.980
7, so that's kind of cool.

01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:05.980
Anything's better than P-Jack.

01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:12.940
Alright, we'll see what becomes of this big Tekken tease soon.

01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:17.100
In the meantime, we're going to go to our Facebook and Google Plus communities, because

01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:20.100
you smoosh those words together and you get foogle.

01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:31.540
It is time for the Foogle Question of the Week, where we ask our fan communities a question

01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:33.980
and mull over some of your answers.

01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:38.940
This week we asked about the Red Ash Kickstarter, and we said, you know, Comcept is of course

01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:44.020
behind the previously successful Mighty No. 9 Kickstarter, and you'll see its legend,

01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:47.380
so Mega Man legend, wink wink, nudge nudge.

01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:48.380
What do you think about this Kickstarter?

01:56:48.380 --> 01:56:53.180
Are you excited, or do you have concerns when Mighty No. 9 has yet to hit shelves?

01:56:53.180 --> 01:57:01.100
Let's see what y'all thought over on Facebook, where Silent Tom said, I understand developers

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:04.460
should always be striving for the next big thing, but I feel they may have jumped the

01:57:04.460 --> 01:57:11.020
gun on this, not even seeing how the public responded to Mighty No. 9, seems a bit strange.

01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:14.820
Raginator says, I have no opinion, I never played the Mega Man Legends games, so I have

01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:18.700
no emotional ties to the series, plus I never Kickstarted anything, and I have no interest

01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:20.500
to do so now.

01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:24.620
Andy R. said, the game itself doesn't interest me much, so I think I'll pass, I've generally

01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:28.500
adopted a wait and see approach to Kickstarter, so if the game ends up coming out and is good,

01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:29.900
I'll pick it up then.

01:57:29.900 --> 01:57:34.820
Tech 2030 said, not too hype on Mega Man, so not too interested in this, only Mega Man

01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:39.660
related remake and successor I'm interested in is the Battle Network series.

01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:43.540
Interesting, so I don't know if we just didn't hear from enough people this week or what,

01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:49.060
but Facebook seems pretty, uh, not into it, not feeling it.

01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:52.660
Interesting, that was a very small sampling than what we usually get though, so we'll

01:57:52.660 --> 01:57:55.860
see, but let's, let's, let's see if the same was on Google Plus.

01:57:55.860 --> 01:58:01.500
Over on Google Plus, we had ActDeft who said, I think this is not the first time something

01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:05.300
like this has happened, granted this is a AAA title and people are still gonna be mad

01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:09.500
after they fix and re-release the game, but if the game, I'm sorry, that is from last

01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:13.100
week, what the hell am I doing, I'm starting to read that, I'm like, wait a minute, this

01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:18.620
is about fixing the game, hold up, sorry, when I went into my notifications on Google

01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:23.420
Plus, it showed me that post at the top, did nobody answer on Google Plus this week?

01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:24.540
What's going on?

01:58:24.540 --> 01:58:30.500
No, we had one answer this week from Redertainment on Google Plus, who said, I have a problem

01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:36.540
with entities using Kickstarter for multiple projects, shouldn't the success of one project

01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:39.260
be used to fund other projects?

01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:46.180
Hmm, so that's a pretty big no, again, that's a smaller sampling than we usually get on

01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:49.180
the FOOGLE question, I don't know if Facebook just didn't decide to show it to people this

01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:56.820
week or what, but I'm not feeling it on this one, it seems, so I'd welcome your emails,

01:58:56.820 --> 01:59:00.780
if you feel differently on this, participate at orangelandrado.com, I think we already

01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:06.660
discussed that here at length here in studio, so I don't know if we want to revisit it.

01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:13.020
With that particular comment though, the success of one project, the game is not even out yet,

01:59:13.020 --> 01:59:20.220
so we're thinking cost of development plus profit hasn't really gone into retail production

01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:24.220
yet and actually sold some stuff, so they would still need money to fund the development

01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:31.300
of another game, at least until, this is a fairly new concept for people, or concept

01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:37.780
I suppose, but still and all, my answer though is not necessarily.

01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:45.940
Alright, let's move on, and we're going to get to some more news, so that was it for

01:59:45.940 --> 01:59:48.980
the FOOGLE question of the week, so Loki, what do you have for us?

01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:57.120
So Mad Catz, they are having some debt problems, and they are basically securing some extra

01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:04.860
credit or further credit line to allow them to release Rock Band 4, and it's basically

02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:13.340
going to be, you know, whether they end up defaulting on their debt, it's all depending

02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:18.260
on how well Rock Band 4 does, which hopefully they'll do well.

02:00:18.260 --> 02:00:21.480
Hear that, buy Rock Band 4, do it now.

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:25.460
Buy Rock Band 4 or you're going to drive this company bankrupt, that's what happened.

02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:29.060
Mad Catz isn't really, I mean they're mostly peripherals, they tried kind of getting into

02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:33.500
game development a little bit, and I mean, I guess they are publishing Rock Band 4, but

02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:38.740
aside from that, I mean they haven't really done a whole ton, so I don't know, and a lot

02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:44.220
of their bread and butter was those Rock Band peripherals, and it's been a while, so I don't

02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:45.220
know.

02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:47.020
Buy extra copies of Rock Band 4.

02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:51.380
Buy copies for your friends and family members and so forth.

02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:55.700
Alright, let's get into one more story here before we get to Match Game tonight about

02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:57.260
Dragon Quest.

02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:00.660
I'm sure y'all are excited, Drew, you've got to be a Dragon Quest fan, if you like your

02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:01.660
JRPGs, right?

02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:02.660
Oh yeah.

02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:07.420
How much did it piss you off that they did Dragon Quest 7 and 8 versions on the 3DS and

02:01:07.420 --> 02:01:10.260
they were like, nah, we're not going to release them in America, they're not coming out.

02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:11.260
I loved 8.

02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:12.900
I know, 8 was great.

02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:14.740
Cor, blimey, I loved 8.

02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:21.060
Anyhow, hey, there is hope, apparently these games may be heading west at some point.

02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:27.340
This is in speaking at the Japan Expo in Paris, the creator apparently made a little slip

02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:32.300
up about the games possibly coming out, so getting a little bit localized there, so some

02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:38.380
tweets talking about 3DS for Dragon Quest 7 and 8 getting localized, I guess the translator

02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:43.700
got upset when that was announced, so hmm, does look promising, although surprisingly

02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:46.980
they wouldn't have said anything about that at E3, because that would have made a great

02:01:46.980 --> 02:01:48.700
little holiday thing.

02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:54.340
ActDeft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, I want Theatrhythm Dragon Quest in

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:56.500
America now.

02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:58.060
Yes please.

02:01:58.060 --> 02:02:05.420
All right, well folks, I think it is time to do some matching, and we're going to bring

02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:10.780
up a segment that we haven't done in a very long time, it's time to play Video Game Match

02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:15.620
Game.

02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:19.940
I do this just to play that song, because I love this, the porny match game thing is

02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:21.460
the best thing ever.

02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:26.220
All right, so in order to play the game, we're going to need some contestants, so I'm going

02:02:26.220 --> 02:02:37.980
to say in chat here, if you want to play match game in chat, say, pick me for match

02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:39.460
game now.

02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:43.580
Okay, so we're going to find a chatter there in the chatroom to play match game, and then

02:02:43.580 --> 02:02:47.620
we're going to open up the Skype line here in just a moment for a contestant as well,

02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:51.780
1877 Game O.L.R., username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, so instead of Team Cat and Team

02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:54.620
Dog, we have Team Skype and Team Chatter.

02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:59.900
So if you forgot how match game works, this is how it works, is that we're going to read

02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:05.440
some phrases, and in those phrases, there will be a blank, and your job as the contestant

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:09.380
is to match your hosts here in studio.

02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:14.300
Now joining us in match game tonight are myself, Rob Roberts, Dark Sakura, who's playing for

02:03:14.300 --> 02:03:24.100
the Taco Foundation, Loki, who's playing for the Let's Lower the Time It Takes Burger King

02:03:24.100 --> 02:03:36.100
to Make a Very Simple Order Foundation, Drew, who's playing for the AARP this week because

02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:39.100
he's 30.

02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:44.220
And of course, joining us in studio, playing to feed his addiction to Final Fantasy Record

02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:50.380
Keeper is Alan, Alan is going to be joining us as well, so you have five people here in

02:03:50.380 --> 02:03:51.960
studio that you can play with.

02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:57.040
So if you want to call and be a participant on match game, call us now, 1877 Game O.L.R.,

02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:59.420
our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:03.180
Now somebody needs to put their neck out there and do this because this is going to be very

02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:06.420
embarrassing if I don't get any stinking contestants for the game tonight.

02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:11.020
So if you want to be a contestant on Skype, 1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange

02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:14.080
Lounge Radio, call us right now.

02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:18.600
Fair warning to people who have not played O.L.R. match game before, this does sometimes

02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:21.480
devolve into cards against Orange Lounge Radio.

02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:22.480
Yes, a little bit.

02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:23.480
Be prepared.

02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:24.480
Be prepared.

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:25.480
Be very prepared.

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:29.200
So there's a little bit of a buffer between the time, I should have said that at the start

02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:33.920
that somebody should call us, there's going to be a little bit of a buffer between when

02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:36.840
the message gets out there and when we'll actually start getting calls.

02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:43.960
So again, if you want to play match game, 1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange

02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:46.020
Lounge Radio.

02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:51.300
No act deaf, nobody's called yet, so if you want a guaranteed you can get in, you can

02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:53.820
do that.

02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:55.660
Are people upset that we're bringing back match game?

02:04:55.660 --> 02:04:59.260
When we used to do this, it would be like 20 people all calling at once.

02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:00.260
Just do it.

02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:02.060
Don't let your dreams be dreams.

02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:04.840
Just do it.

02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:06.260
Is that the Shia LaBeouf thing?

02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:07.260
It is.

02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:08.260
I thought it was.

02:05:08.260 --> 02:05:09.660
I didn't know what that was all about.

02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:10.660
Oh, thank God.

02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:11.660
We have a call coming in.

02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:12.660
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:13.660
Who's this?

02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:16.500
This is Brad from Pod Culture.

02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:18.260
Brad from Pod Culture?

02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:19.900
You here to play the match game?

02:05:19.900 --> 02:05:20.900
Hi, Brad.

02:05:20.900 --> 02:05:25.740
Hey, well, I'm just forget I've never done one of your damn games with y'all before,

02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:26.740
so why the hell not?

02:05:26.740 --> 02:05:28.020
Why the hell not?

02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:29.740
I am with you there.

02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:32.420
All right, so let's see.

02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:36.380
We don't have a lot of people in chat that really want to play this week, so.

02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:37.540
The hell with all of you.

02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:39.540
The hell with all of you.

02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:40.540
So let's see.

02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:41.540
I'm going to narrow it down.

02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:43.300
All right, heads or tails?

02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:44.300
Heads or tails?

02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:45.300
Cats or dogs?

02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:46.300
Tails.

02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:47.300
Tails.

02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:50.700
All right, you're going to be playing against Zappi tonight.

02:05:50.700 --> 02:05:57.020
Zappi is going to be your opponent here, so I'm going to make sure send your answers to

02:05:57.020 --> 02:05:58.020
me.

02:05:58.020 --> 02:05:59.020
Congrats.

02:05:59.020 --> 02:06:02.460
You are playing against Brad.

02:06:02.460 --> 02:06:03.780
Poor Act Deaf got shut out.

02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:04.780
You beat him.

02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:08.260
You just beat him by a moment on the phone lines, and there you go.

02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:10.120
And then Zappi beat him there in the chat room.

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:12.240
So it's going to be Zappi versus Brad tonight.

02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:14.400
All right, finally, we can do this.

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:16.160
All right, Brad, you comfortable with the rules?

02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:17.160
You know how this works?

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:20.160
You're going to read a sentence, and there's going to be a blank?

02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:21.160
Yeah.

02:06:21.160 --> 02:06:22.200
All right.

02:06:22.200 --> 02:06:24.800
Now give us a little bit of time.

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:26.560
Don't just shout out your answer, Brad.

02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:29.200
We have to tell you we're ready for your answer.

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:30.240
So listen carefully.

02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:31.240
Here it is.

02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:32.240
Okay.

02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.240
All right.

02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:34.240
Question.

02:06:34.240 --> 02:06:37.280
And then Zappi, you're going to say yours in a private message to me in the chat.

02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:43.360
So if you guys want to help them out, you can leave your responses over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.080
All right.

02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:46.880
So here we go.

02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:49.500
Question number one.

02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:57.840
In a dark boardroom in Japan somewhere, executives were astounded at the success of Kickstarters

02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:03.000
for projects like Bloodstained and Mighty No. 9.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.760
That's it, a boardroom executive spoke up.

02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:12.720
The only way we're going to save this company is for our company, Konami, to run a Kickstarter

02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:18.720
for blank.

02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:20.040
Exploding president cat.

02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:21.040
Hold on.

02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:23.480
Don't answer until I say we're ready for an answer.

02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:27.080
What did I just say?

02:07:27.080 --> 02:07:29.320
Maybe this is why we have to rethink your answer.

02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:30.320
Yeah.

02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:31.320
Now you have to come up with a new answer.

02:07:31.320 --> 02:07:32.320
All right.

02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:33.320
I'm going to...

02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:34.320
Wait.

02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:35.320
I was...

02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:38.000
So let me read that one more time.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:44.060
The only way we're going to save this company, Konami, is to run a Kickstarter for blank.

02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:45.060
So who's in?

02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:46.060
Ding.

02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:47.060
Ding.

02:07:47.060 --> 02:07:48.060
Ding.

02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:49.060
Ding.

02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:50.060
Ding.

02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:51.060
Ding.

02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:52.060
Ding.

02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:53.060
Ding.

02:07:53.060 --> 02:07:54.060
Ding.

02:07:54.060 --> 02:07:55.060
Ding.

02:07:55.060 --> 02:07:56.060
Ding.

02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:57.060
Ding.

02:07:57.060 --> 02:07:58.060
Ding.

02:07:58.060 --> 02:07:59.060
Ding.

02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:00.060
Ding.

02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:01.060
Ding.

02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:02.060
Ding.

02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:03.060
Ding.

02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:04.060
Ding.

02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:05.060
Ding.

02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:06.800
All right.

02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:07.800
Ding.

02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:08.800
I went with a serious answer.

02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:09.800
I didn't have time to be funny.

02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:10.800
I'm still waiting on Zappi.

02:08:10.800 --> 02:08:13.620
Zappi, you got to send me your answer here.

02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:14.620
Waiting on Zappi.

02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:15.620
Need.

02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:16.620
Zappi!

02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:26.820
In a dark boardroom in Japan, executives were astounded at the success of Kickstarters for

02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:29.320
projects like Bloodstained and Mighty No. 9.

02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:30.320
That's it.

02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:31.660
A boardroom executive spoke up.

02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:34.980
The only way we're going to save this company is for our company, Konami, to run a Kickstarter

02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:35.980
for blank.

02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:36.980
All right.

02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:37.980
Zappi's got an answer in.

02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:38.980
So Brad, here it is.

02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:42.700
The only way we're going to save this company is for our company, Konami, to run a Kickstarter

02:08:42.700 --> 02:08:45.700
for?

02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:47.180
Exploding President Kat.

02:08:47.180 --> 02:08:48.500
Exploding President Kat.

02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:50.220
That's his story and he's sticking to it.

02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:51.220
All right.

02:08:51.220 --> 02:08:54.260
Zappi says, okay, I'll say Guitar Freaks.

02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:55.260
All right.

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:56.260
Zappi says Guitar Freaks.

02:08:56.260 --> 02:08:57.260
Let's see.

02:08:57.260 --> 02:08:58.260
All right.

02:08:58.260 --> 02:08:59.620
So we've got Guitar Freaks and Exploding President Kat.

02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:01.900
Let's see if we get any matches here in studio.

02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:03.600
Loki, what's your answer?

02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:11.000
My answer is they're going to have to kickstart Thomas Howard's Girl's Butts, a next gen sequel

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
to Rumble Roses.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Girl's Butts.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Look at that.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Girl's Butts.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.080
The next gen sequel to Rumble Roses.

02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:19.080
Not a match.

02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:20.080
I like that.

02:09:20.080 --> 02:09:21.080
You invoked Rumble Roses.

02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:22.080
All right.

02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:23.080
I'll go next.

02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:24.340
My answer is, I went serious.

02:09:24.340 --> 02:09:28.320
I said Suicoden 6 because that's the only way it's going to happen.

02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:30.840
And somewhere out there, Shane's heart is breaking.

02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:31.840
Sorry, Shane.

02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:32.840
All right.

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:34.360
Alan, you're up next.

02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:39.600
The only way we can save this company is to run a Kickstarter for Super Pachinko.

02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:42.440
Super Pachinko.

02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:43.440
Not a match.

02:09:43.440 --> 02:09:44.440
Oh, look at the score.

02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:45.440
Zero to zero.

02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:46.440
All right, Drew.

02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:47.480
Let's see if we get a match with you.

02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:51.560
The only way we can save this company is to do a Kickstarter for Hookers and Blow for

02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:52.560
Kojima.

02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:54.120
Hookers and Blow for Kojima.

02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:59.300
You got to win that son of a bitch back with Hookers and Blow.

02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:00.300
Not a match.

02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:01.300
But a good...

02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:02.300
That was a good...

02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:03.840
You're back in.

02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:05.460
Your 30s are your prime, Drew.

02:10:05.460 --> 02:10:06.460
All right.

02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:07.460
Last but not least.

02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:08.460
Ladies last.

02:10:08.460 --> 02:10:09.740
You're in O.L.R.

02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:11.540
Dark Sakura.

02:10:11.540 --> 02:10:14.420
The only way is to do a Kickstarter for...

02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:15.420
Silent Hills.

02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:17.420
Silent Hills.

02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:19.460
Oh, look.

02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:22.700
If you'd gone with Fifth Dream's answer, you would have matched.

02:10:22.700 --> 02:10:23.700
There it is.

02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:24.700
Silent Hills.

02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:25.960
Fifth Dream gets a point, but he's not playing.

02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:27.460
So there it is.

02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:30.940
Zero to zero is the score.

02:10:30.940 --> 02:10:31.940
Brad, I'm sorry.

02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:33.100
He's still not on the board.

02:10:33.100 --> 02:10:34.100
Zappy, I'm sorry.

02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:37.100
But you still have three more chances.

02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:39.140
So here we go with question number two.

02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:42.580
Now this time, Brad, don't blurt it out until I ask, okay?

02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:45.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:48.580
Well, hell, I'll take a shot while you're talking.

02:10:48.580 --> 02:10:49.580
Okay.

02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:50.580
Oh, he's taking shots.

02:10:50.580 --> 02:10:53.580
He had a mouthful of fireballs.

02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:54.580
What was that?

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:56.380
He had a mouthful of fireballs.

02:10:56.380 --> 02:10:57.580
That's actually accurate.

02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:58.580
I'm sure that is...

02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:01.580
Absolutely what I was drinking.

02:11:02.220 --> 02:11:03.220
Yes, what he's drinking.

02:11:03.220 --> 02:11:04.220
I love it.

02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:05.220
All right.

02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:06.220
Here we go.

02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:07.220
Question number two.

02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:16.740
Flash forward, E3 2016, the NX is revealed by Nintendo on stage at E3.

02:11:16.740 --> 02:11:17.740
They're back on stage.

02:11:17.740 --> 02:11:18.980
Just roll with me here.

02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:24.460
Reggie speaks up and says, we really listen to the fans out there this time.

02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:33.500
And so I'm pleased to announce that the Nintendo NX will be the industry leader in blank.

02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:34.500
Ding.

02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:35.500
Ding.

02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:44.500
Ding.

02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:45.500
Ding for me as well.

02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:46.500
Loki, did you ding?

02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:47.500
Oh, yes.

02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:48.500
I ding.

02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:52.500
So once again, we're waiting on Zappi.

02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:53.500
Oh, there it is.

02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:54.540
He got his answer in.

02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:55.540
Wow.

02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:56.540
That's how it's...

02:11:56.540 --> 02:11:57.540
Okay.

02:11:57.540 --> 02:11:58.540
We're just a little rusty in round one.

02:11:58.540 --> 02:11:59.540
We're getting...

02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:01.540
This is how LR got their groove back.

02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:02.540
All right.

02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:03.540
Here it is.

02:12:03.540 --> 02:12:04.540
Well, let's see.

02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:05.540
I hope so.

02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:06.540
Let's see.

02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:08.540
We really listen to the fans out there.

02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:10.620
Nintendo listened to the fans, Brad.

02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:18.540
And so I'm pleased to announce that the Nintendo NX will be the industry leader in...

02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:19.540
Cybernetic implants.

02:12:19.540 --> 02:12:21.540
Screw the controllers.

02:12:21.580 --> 02:12:23.580
Cybernetic implants.

02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:25.580
Screw the controllers.

02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:27.580
It's the $6 million system right there.

02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:28.580
Cybernetic...

02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:30.580
That's where Jamie Summers got her name after all.

02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:31.580
True facts.

02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:32.580
Cybernetic implants.

02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:39.580
Zappi said, I'm pleased to announce that the Nintendo NX will be the industry leader in...

02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:40.580
Tingle.

02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:41.580
There it is.

02:12:41.580 --> 02:12:42.580
The answer from Zappi.

02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:43.580
Tingle.

02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:44.580
All right.

02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:49.580
Let's go around the studio and let's see some of the random comments from chat.

02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:51.620
HalfLife 3 said, Black Wolf.

02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:53.620
Naked Samus said, Fifth Dream.

02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:55.620
Ridge Racer said, Akuma JP.

02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:57.620
Amiibo said, Act Deft.

02:12:57.620 --> 02:12:59.620
Old Ass Games said, Fifth Dream.

02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:00.620
Let's see.

02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:01.620
Let's see how folks did.

02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:05.620
How come only two of you wanted to play and then you're all participating in chat?

02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:07.620
I think you're just...

02:13:07.620 --> 02:13:11.620
Shane just texted me and Shane never goes there.

02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:14.620
But he just texted me, Vibrators.

02:13:15.620 --> 02:13:17.620
Are we going to see another Rez release?

02:13:17.660 --> 02:13:18.660
All right.

02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:19.660
Let's see.

02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:20.660
Let's see.

02:13:20.660 --> 02:13:21.660
Let's go around the room.

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:22.660
The industry leader in...

02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:23.660
Loki?

02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:24.660
Teledildonics.

02:13:24.660 --> 02:13:25.660
Teledildonics.

02:13:25.660 --> 02:13:33.660
So I think that's kind of maybe a half a point for Brad because he did say cybernetic implant

02:13:33.660 --> 02:13:36.660
and, you know, fuck the controllers.

02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:37.660
Let's go to the judges.

02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:38.660
Fuck the controllers.

02:13:38.660 --> 02:13:39.660
I'll give it.

02:13:39.660 --> 02:13:40.660
Nah.

02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:41.660
I'm saying no.

02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:43.660
Yeah, but you've been outvoted by three other people.

02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:45.660
No, because Alan's given the X to.

02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:46.700
Alan's given the X to.

02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:47.700
Yeah, but three versus two.

02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:48.700
All right.

02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:49.700
All right.

02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:50.700
Three to two decision.

02:13:50.700 --> 02:13:53.700
We're going to give Brad half point on that one.

02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:54.700
Congrats, Brad.

02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:56.700
All right.

02:13:56.700 --> 02:14:02.700
My answer, the industry leader in holodeck porn.

02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:03.700
Come on, people.

02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:05.700
It's always one step closer to the holodeck porn.

02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:08.700
One step closer to the holodeck porn.

02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:11.700
All right, Alan, let's see if we get a match.

02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:12.700
The industry leader in...

02:14:12.700 --> 02:14:14.700
Fanboy Tears.

02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:17.740
Not a match, unfortunately.

02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:19.740
Drew, the Nintendo NX.

02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:21.740
The industry leader in...

02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:22.740
Microtransactions.

02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:24.740
Microtransactions.

02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:27.740
Jamie's favorite word in the English language.

02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:29.740
The salt must flow.

02:14:29.740 --> 02:14:30.740
Not a match.

02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:31.740
Not a match.

02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:35.740
It's still half to zero because we deal fractions here.

02:14:35.740 --> 02:14:38.740
Last but certainly not least, or she'd kick my butt.

02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:41.740
Dark Sakura, the industry leader in...

02:14:41.780 --> 02:14:42.780
Silent Hills.

02:14:42.780 --> 02:14:43.780
Silent Hills.

02:14:43.780 --> 02:14:45.780
Also, not a match.

02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:47.780
Well, it is big and it is rather black.

02:14:47.780 --> 02:14:48.780
All right.

02:14:48.780 --> 02:14:49.780
There it is.

02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:50.780
Zappi.

02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:53.780
Sadly, not a match, Zappi.

02:14:53.780 --> 02:14:55.780
But you know what, Zappi?

02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:58.780
Brad's only got a half point.

02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:02.780
So you could still tie it up or even exceed.

02:15:02.780 --> 02:15:04.780
It's not hard to get one full point.

02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:06.780
It's not hard to get one full point.

02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:08.780
It's not hard to get one full point.

02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:10.820
Tie it up or even exceed.

02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:12.820
It's not hard to get one full point.

02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:14.820
You just have to match something a little closer than Brad did.

02:15:14.820 --> 02:15:15.820
All right.

02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:16.820
Let's get to it.

02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:17.820
Round three.

02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:19.820
There's only four rounds you guys have to endure.

02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:20.820
Three.

02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:21.820
Here it is.

02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:22.820
Round three.

02:15:22.820 --> 02:15:27.820
Did you hear about the Super Nintendo PlayStation that was

02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:31.820
dug out of someone's garbage and posted on Reddit?

02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:36.820
Little did you know that not only was that system found,

02:15:36.820 --> 02:15:41.820
but that cartridge contains an ultra rare copy of the Sony

02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:46.820
created CD-ROM game Super Mario Blank.

02:15:48.820 --> 02:15:49.820
Ding.

02:15:49.820 --> 02:15:50.820
Ding.

02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:51.820
Ding.

02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:52.820
Ding.

02:15:52.820 --> 02:15:57.820
Ding.

02:15:57.820 --> 02:15:58.820
Let's see.

02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:00.820
One more time.

02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:05.820
Did you hear about the Super Nintendo PlayStation that was

02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:07.820
dug out of someone's garbage?

02:16:07.820 --> 02:16:09.820
Little did you know not only was the system found,

02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:12.820
but the cartridge contains an ultra rare copy of the Sony

02:16:12.820 --> 02:16:17.820
created CD-ROM game Super Mario Blank.

02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:18.820
Zappie's a ding.

02:16:18.820 --> 02:16:19.820
Brad's a ding.

02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:20.820
I think we've got dings.

02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:21.820
Anyone need a dong?

02:16:21.820 --> 02:16:22.820
All right.

02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:24.820
Who dinged?

02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:25.820
Here we go.

02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:30.820
Brad, an ultra rare copy of the Sony created CD-ROM game

02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:33.820
Super Mario.

02:16:34.820 --> 02:16:36.820
Naked oil wrestling.

02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:39.820
Naked oil wrestling.

02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:41.820
Someone's into the Turkish wrestling here.

02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:43.820
Just like the Turkish wrestler in Super...

02:16:43.820 --> 02:16:45.820
What was that guy in Street Fighter IV?

02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:46.820
Brad, you mean Hakan.

02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:47.820
All right.

02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:48.820
You mean Hakan, don't you?

02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:49.820
There it is.

02:16:49.820 --> 02:16:50.820
All right.

02:16:50.820 --> 02:16:52.820
Well, surely Zappie has a more family friendly answer.

02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:56.820
Zappie said an ultra rare copy of the Sony created CD-ROM game

02:16:56.820 --> 02:16:58.820
Super Mario Porn.

02:16:58.820 --> 02:17:02.820
He just said porn, which is a safe bet here at OLR.

02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:04.820
When in doubt, just say porn.

02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:05.820
So there it is.

02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:06.820
Super Mario Porn.

02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:08.820
Some comments from our chat room.

02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:09.820
Let's see.

02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:12.820
SSJ100Matt says, Super Mario Miss World 96.

02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:15.820
Black Wolf says, Super Mario Silent Hills.

02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:18.820
Act Def says, Super Mario Crash Spiral.

02:17:18.820 --> 02:17:21.820
Dungeon Buster says, Super Mario Uncharted.

02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:23.820
Orange Right says, Super Mario Orgy.

02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:26.820
Dungeon Buster says, Super Mario Kill Zone.

02:17:26.820 --> 02:17:28.820
Zappie said, I was tempted to say hills.

02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:29.820
So let's see what happens.

02:17:29.820 --> 02:17:32.820
Super Mario blank.

02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:33.820
All right.

02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:35.820
Let's go around the room and see if we've got a match.

02:17:35.820 --> 02:17:38.820
So we got Turkish oil wrestling and porn.

02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:42.820
Loki, the unreleased game Super Mario.

02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:43.820
Bandicoot.

02:17:43.820 --> 02:17:44.820
Super Mario Bandicoot.

02:17:44.820 --> 02:17:46.820
It's going for a safe answer.

02:17:46.820 --> 02:17:47.820
And there it is.

02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:48.820
All right.

02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:49.820
All right.

02:17:49.820 --> 02:17:50.820
Super Mario Bandicoot.

02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:52.820
Not a match.

02:17:52.820 --> 02:17:56.820
My answer, an ultra rare copy of the Sony created CD-ROM game

02:17:57.820 --> 02:18:00.820
Super Mario Cross Night Trap.

02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:02.820
Because it's a CD-ROM game.

02:18:02.820 --> 02:18:03.820
Come on.

02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:05.820
Fuck all of you.

02:18:05.820 --> 02:18:06.820
Come on.

02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:08.820
Luigi can investigate a haunted mansion.

02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:10.820
He can certainly investigate a panty party.

02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:11.820
Come on, people.

02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:12.820
Super Mario.

02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:13.820
That would be a more interesting game.

02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:14.820
It's a Dana Plato.

02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:15.820
Exactly.

02:18:15.820 --> 02:18:16.820
Come on.

02:18:16.820 --> 02:18:18.820
Who would not play Super Mario Cross Night Trap?

02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:19.820
All right.

02:18:19.820 --> 02:18:20.820
Alan.

02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:22.820
You have to be a zombie now.

02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:23.820
Alan.

02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:25.820
Super Mario Cross.

02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:27.820
Sorry, Super Mario what?

02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:28.820
Arena Toshinden.

02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:30.820
Arena Toshinden.

02:18:30.820 --> 02:18:35.820
A good answer for Sony, but not a match with either of our listeners tonight.

02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:37.820
It's still half a point to no point.

02:18:37.820 --> 02:18:38.820
Drew.

02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:40.820
Super Mario.

02:18:40.820 --> 02:18:42.820
Featuring Jumping Flash.

02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:43.820
Featuring Jumping Flash.

02:18:43.820 --> 02:18:44.820
Who would play the fuck out of that?

02:18:44.820 --> 02:18:46.820
I would play the fuck out of that too.

02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:47.820
Good answer.

02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:48.820
Not a match.

02:18:48.820 --> 02:18:51.820
Last but not least, Dark Sakura Super Mario.

02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:52.820
Silent Hills.

02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:53.820
Silent Hills.

02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:57.820
You knew it was coming to this point, ladies and gentlemen.

02:18:57.820 --> 02:19:00.820
I'm surprised that nobody thought I would go there.

02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:04.820
Some of the chat, Zappy said in chat, I almost said Silent Hills.

02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:05.820
Well, you lose.

02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:06.820
You lose.

02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:11.820
You could have been a half a point ahead of Brad, but no.

02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:12.820
All right.

02:19:12.820 --> 02:19:14.820
We had to be unique.

02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:15.820
We had to be special snowflakes.

02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:16.820
Here it is, guys.

02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:22.820
It's the final round, but there's a twist because you notice I've been bringing these old OLR games back.

02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:24.820
I've been putting a twist.

02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:26.820
So here's the twist for question four.

02:19:26.820 --> 02:19:29.820
There's two blanks.

02:19:29.820 --> 02:19:31.820
This is the wedgie of match game.

02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:32.820
That's right.

02:19:32.820 --> 02:19:34.820
There's two blanks in this one.

02:19:34.820 --> 02:19:38.820
So you have the opportunity to earn two points.

02:19:38.820 --> 02:19:44.820
This, I mean, if Zappy matches even one person, he could just fuck Brad's game right up.

02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:47.820
Or Brad could just move this into the stratosphere.

02:19:47.820 --> 02:19:48.820
So here it is.

02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:50.820
Two blanks on this last question.

02:19:51.820 --> 02:19:53.820
Question number four.

02:19:53.820 --> 02:19:58.820
The last question as I scroll it off my screen.

02:19:58.820 --> 02:19:59.820
Here we go.

02:19:59.820 --> 02:20:00.820
Question number four.

02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:11.820
The first ever Nintendo Splatoon Splatfest was extremely successful as people battled for Team Cat and Team Dog everywhere.

02:20:11.820 --> 02:20:14.820
It was such a success with kids and teens everywhere.

02:20:14.820 --> 02:20:26.820
However, in an attempt to win more adults over to Splatoon, Nintendo announced that the next Splatfest will be Team Blank versus Team Blank.

02:20:32.820 --> 02:20:43.820
In an effort to win more adults over to Splatoon, Nintendo announced that the next Splatfest will be Team Blank versus Team Blank.

02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:45.820
I'm going to that special hell.

02:20:54.820 --> 02:20:55.820
All right.

02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:57.820
I'm going to ding there.

02:20:57.820 --> 02:20:58.820
Oh, my God.

02:20:58.820 --> 02:20:59.820
You people in chat are nasty.

02:20:59.820 --> 02:21:00.820
I can't read this on air.

02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:01.820
I cannot read this on air.

02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:03.820
You can't, so.

02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:04.820
All right.

02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:05.820
Because we're about to.

02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:06.820
I'm still waiting on Zappy's answer.

02:21:06.820 --> 02:21:07.820
Is everybody ding?

02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:08.820
Yeah, I think so.

02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:09.820
Does anybody need a dong?

02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:11.820
Does anyone give a dang?

02:21:11.820 --> 02:21:12.820
coding.

02:21:12.820 --> 02:21:13.820
All right.

02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:15.820
I'm still I'm just waiting on Zappy.

02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:16.820
But no dong.

02:21:16.820 --> 02:21:17.820
No dung.

02:21:17.820 --> 02:21:18.820
Dung is not allowed.

02:21:18.820 --> 02:21:21.820
All right.

02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:22.820
All right.

02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:23.820
Hurry up, Zappy.

02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:24.820
If you hear my voice.

02:21:24.820 --> 02:21:28.820
Do it.

02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:29.820
You better get that locked in.

02:21:29.820 --> 02:21:30.820
All right.

02:21:30.820 --> 02:21:32.820
He's locked in his answer.

02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:34.820
Let's do this.

02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:37.820
The first ever Nintendo Splatoon Splatfest was successful.

02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:42.820
But in an attempt to win more adults over, Nintendo announced that the next Splatfest

02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:46.820
will be Team what, Brad?

02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:52.820
Team Pyramid Head versus Team Peach.

02:21:52.820 --> 02:21:55.820
Team Pyramid Head versus Team Peach.

02:21:55.820 --> 02:21:56.820
Okay.

02:21:56.820 --> 02:21:57.820
I see what he's doing there.

02:21:57.820 --> 02:21:59.820
He's trying to do the Silent Hill angle there on that answer, isn't he?

02:21:59.820 --> 02:22:00.820
All right.

02:22:00.820 --> 02:22:01.820
Let's see if that works for him.

02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:08.820
Well, Zappy in chat said it will be Team Silent versus Team Hills.

02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:09.820
He's not.

02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:11.820
He's not going to let that go this time.

02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:13.820
Oh, we're just doubling down on this now, aren't we?

02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:14.820
He's doubling down.

02:22:14.820 --> 02:22:17.820
He's doubling down to see if that inside joke comes back.

02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:18.820
All right.

02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:22.820
Zappy in chat said porn didn't work for me, so I decided against it this time.

02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:24.820
Some other chat answers.

02:22:24.820 --> 02:22:27.820
Act F said Republicans versus Democrats.

02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:30.820
Black Wolf said Silent versus Hills.

02:22:30.820 --> 02:22:34.820
SS Dream said Bukake versus Cat.

02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:35.820
Wow.

02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:37.820
Tiger Claw said Penis versus Vagina.

02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:40.820
SSJ100Matt said Missionary versus Doggy.

02:22:40.820 --> 02:22:43.820
And Black Wolf said Ding versus Dong.

02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:48.820
All right.

02:22:48.820 --> 02:22:51.820
The next Splatoon Splatfest will be...

02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:54.820
I don't even see the damn chat.

02:22:54.820 --> 02:22:56.820
Loki, Team...

02:22:56.820 --> 02:22:58.820
Team Squid versus Team Kid.

02:22:58.820 --> 02:23:03.820
Team Squid versus Team Kid, which is what everybody actually thinks it should be.

02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:08.820
So a very logical answer, not a match.

02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:10.820
My answer, Team...

02:23:10.820 --> 02:23:14.820
And by the way, y'all, I went for the old OLR inside joke.

02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:17.820
There's going to be two of you out here who understand this.

02:23:17.820 --> 02:23:23.820
Team Cylon Occupied Caprica versus Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.

02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:24.820
Boo this man.

02:23:24.820 --> 02:23:26.820
That's my answer.

02:23:26.820 --> 02:23:28.820
All right.

02:23:28.820 --> 02:23:31.820
I would have accepted Cylons versus Humans, though.

02:23:31.820 --> 02:23:32.820
Come on, let's be real.

02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:33.820
All right, Alan.

02:23:33.820 --> 02:23:36.820
Splatoon Splatfest will be Team...

02:23:36.820 --> 02:23:39.820
Act F really needed to think more about the Splatoon angle,

02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:48.820
but my answer is Team Bukake versus Team Cream Pies.

02:23:48.820 --> 02:23:51.820
And it's all white ink.

02:23:51.820 --> 02:23:52.820
That's it.

02:23:52.820 --> 02:23:53.820
Show's canceled.

02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:54.820
We're done.

02:23:54.820 --> 02:23:55.820
Too hot for any of you.

02:23:55.820 --> 02:23:56.820
Shut her down.

02:23:56.820 --> 02:23:59.820
Banned in Australia.

02:23:59.820 --> 02:24:11.820
We're earning that explicit tag today.

02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:13.820
Because it's Splatoon, everybody.

02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:14.820
Get it?

02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:15.820
That's why it's funny.

02:24:15.820 --> 02:24:16.820
Because the game is called Splatoon.

02:24:16.820 --> 02:24:18.820
He was lucky I wasn't taking the shot.

02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:20.820
All right, you're out of liquor at this point, Brad.

02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:21.820
Don't try to fool me.

02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:22.820
Rob, here's the problem with that.

02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:23.820
All the ink would only be one color.

02:24:24.820 --> 02:24:26.820
All right.

02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:29.820
Not if you get enough Vitamin C in your diet.

02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:31.820
Drew.

02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:33.820
Team...

02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:35.820
If we're going to go for the adult demographic,

02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:38.820
the age-old debate of Team Tits versus Team Ass.

02:24:38.820 --> 02:24:42.820
Team Tits versus Team Ass.

02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:43.820
Tits and Ass.

02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:44.820
There it is.

02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:45.820
All right.

02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:48.820
Last but not least, DarkSakura.

02:24:48.820 --> 02:24:49.820
What did she pick?

02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:50.820
Team...

02:24:50.820 --> 02:24:52.820
Alan Wake.

02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:56.820
Versus...

02:24:56.820 --> 02:24:58.820
D.

02:24:58.820 --> 02:24:59.820
Versus D?

02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:00.820
D.

02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:01.820
D?

02:25:01.820 --> 02:25:04.820
Survival Horror.

02:25:04.820 --> 02:25:10.820
So DarkSakura just screwed Zappi over by flipping the script

02:25:10.820 --> 02:25:12.820
and saying Team...

02:25:12.820 --> 02:25:13.820
What the hell did she say again?

02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:14.820
Alan Wake.

02:25:14.820 --> 02:25:16.820
Team Alan Wake versus Team D.

02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:21.820
D, which was the Saturn Survival Horror psychological.

02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:24.820
So I picked psychological horror games that were like Silent Hill.

02:25:24.820 --> 02:25:27.820
So you're doing Team Games That Will Never Be On The Wii U

02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:29.820
and Team Games That Will Never Be On The Wii U.

02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:32.820
Act F, you trusted Jamie to follow the script on this one?

02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:33.820
You fool!

02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:34.820
All right.

02:25:34.820 --> 02:25:35.820
Well, Zappi...

02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:36.820
It's almost Ferret versus Propel.

02:25:36.820 --> 02:25:37.820
I mean, God.

02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:39.820
I knew she wasn't going to go Silent Hill on that one.

02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:40.820
I know it.

02:25:40.820 --> 02:25:41.820
All right.

02:25:41.820 --> 02:25:42.820
There it is.

02:25:42.820 --> 02:25:44.820
Well, Brad, your knowledge of DarkSakura's inner workings,

02:25:44.820 --> 02:25:48.820
you won by a half point in a slim judge's decision to zero.

02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:50.820
So I got to say, Zappi,

02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:52.820
you put in a good effort.

02:25:52.820 --> 02:25:54.820
Everybody give Zappi a round of applause

02:25:54.820 --> 02:25:57.820
and then promptly push him off the stage because he lost.

02:25:57.820 --> 02:25:58.820
Bye, Zappi.

02:25:58.820 --> 02:25:59.820
Thanks for playing, though.

02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:01.820
Brad, you're a winner.

02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:03.820
And for winning Match Game Tonight,

02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:06.820
I'm going to let you plug anything you want.

02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:08.820
And knowing that you host your own podcast,

02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:12.820
I think I know what you might want to plug.

02:26:12.820 --> 02:26:17.820
Oh, of course, Pod Culture, Monday nights, 9 o'clock on VOG.

02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:18.820
There it is.

02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:19.820
Listen to Brad, Pod Culture.

02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:22.820
Apparently, tomorrow's a rerun, but that's all right.

02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:23.820
Favoritism.

02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:24.820
That's all right.

02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:27.820
Hey, are you going to be taking any shots

02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:31.820
on next week's episode of Pod Culture?

02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:35.820
Um, yeah, actually, I think we are.

02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:36.820
All right, nice.

02:26:36.820 --> 02:26:38.820
Yeah, I think there is alcohol involved on that one.

02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:41.820
So, Brad, though, I do have to ask you,

02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:43.820
and I don't remember what the exact name for it is,

02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:45.820
but Dan has discovered a cocktail

02:26:45.820 --> 02:26:47.820
that's basically angry orchard and fireball,

02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:49.820
and he wanted to call it angry balls.

02:26:49.820 --> 02:26:51.820
I think that's what it's called, actually, is angry balls.

02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:53.820
But he wanted to call it flaming orchard.

02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:54.820
Actually, I think it is.

02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:57.820
I think it is angry balls or fiery balls or something.

02:26:57.820 --> 02:26:59.820
Yeah, I think it's angry balls, but...

02:26:59.820 --> 02:27:01.820
Herpes.

02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:03.820
Oh, my God, you all are 12.

02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:04.820
It would be good.

02:27:04.820 --> 02:27:05.820
It would be good.

02:27:05.820 --> 02:27:07.820
Angry orchard is good stuff.

02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:09.820
All right, Brad, I'm going to let you go

02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:11.820
so we can wrap up the show.

02:27:11.820 --> 02:27:13.820
Brad, take care, my friend.

02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:15.820
Thanks for playing.

02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:17.820
All right.

02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:19.820
All right, later.

02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:21.820
Hey, let us know what you guys thought of Match Game.

02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:23.820
Should we bring it back in a future week,

02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:25.820
or was that just too much of a hot mess for all you guys?

02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:27.820
Let us know over on Twitter.

02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:29.820
Twitter.com slash O-L-R,

02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:31.820
so we'll see if we do Match Game again in the future.

02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:32.820
That was fun, though.

02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:34.820
There were some funny answers in there.

02:27:34.820 --> 02:27:36.820
I think Alan won, though, which I knew would happen.

02:27:36.820 --> 02:27:38.820
I knew Alan would do that.

02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:40.820
I just need to put more subliminals in there

02:27:40.820 --> 02:27:42.820
to get people to do this again.

02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:44.820
All right, I'm feeling pretty good.

02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:45.820
We'll see what the listeners think.

02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:47.820
It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:27:47.820 --> 02:27:49.820
I was getting a little worried when nobody wanted to play.

02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:51.820
I was like, what good is a game if nobody wants to play?

02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:53.820
But then finally, the chat room got really into it.

02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:55.820
I think just some people were shy

02:27:55.820 --> 02:27:57.820
and didn't want to get on the phone, and I understand.

02:27:57.820 --> 02:27:59.820
Come on, don't we remember Match Game at all, guys?

02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:00.820
I know, I know. All right.

02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:02.820
Don't you remember how we loved to torture you?

02:28:02.820 --> 02:28:03.820
That's right.

02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:08.820
Anyway, let's get back into some of the segments we do here on O-L-R.

02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:11.820
I believe we're going to visit the mailbag this week.

02:28:11.820 --> 02:28:13.820
Yeah, it's kind of sticky.

02:28:13.820 --> 02:28:15.820
All right, so every week you guys send us e-mails.

02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:18.820
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com,

02:28:18.820 --> 02:28:20.820
and DarkSakura dives into the mailbag

02:28:20.820 --> 02:28:24.820
and picks out some e-mails that she believes are worthy of reading on the show.

02:28:24.820 --> 02:28:27.820
And I don't have your usual music.

02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:28.820
I don't know what happened to it.

02:28:28.820 --> 02:28:29.820
Ooh, play Buffalo again.

02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:31.820
I have this music.

02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:33.820
Mail, motherfucker.

02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:38.820
It's Grandpa's music from Hoard House.

02:28:38.820 --> 02:28:39.820
That's what I had ready.

02:28:39.820 --> 02:28:42.820
Well, I'm not reading all of this e-mail because it's long.

02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:43.820
Okay, I think you should replace it.

02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:45.820
You think I should replace it on this show?

02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:46.820
I think you should all shut up.

02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:48.820
Well, someone will freeze that damn mailbag already.

02:28:48.820 --> 02:28:50.820
I don't know. You're going to need to get Grandpa's permission.

02:28:50.820 --> 02:28:51.820
He may not have liked that.

02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:52.820
Greetings, O-L-R.

02:28:52.820 --> 02:28:53.820
He's going to be mad.

02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:56.820
He's like, first you decide there's no more Hoard House,

02:28:56.820 --> 02:28:57.820
and then you steal the fucking music.

02:28:57.820 --> 02:28:58.820
Thanks, Rob.

02:28:58.820 --> 02:29:00.820
Grandpa, you and I should do a show.

02:29:00.820 --> 02:29:02.820
It should just be called Fuck.

02:29:02.820 --> 02:29:04.820
Fuck Rob. That's what he'll want to call it.

02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:05.820
If you do a show, you'll be like,

02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:07.820
let's just do a show where we talk shit about Rob every week.

02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:08.820
Okay.

02:29:08.820 --> 02:29:09.820
I thought that was OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:12.820
This is from RawSteelUT, by the way.

02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:13.820
Greetings, O-L-R.

02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:16.820
I got a couple things on mine, so I'll just shoot them out.

02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:17.820
Eh.

02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:19.820
Regarding reservations, not pre-orders,

02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:23.820
I don't really have a strong opinion one way or another,

02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:26.820
but I've grown a bit more careful in just what I reserve.

02:29:26.820 --> 02:29:29.820
It makes no sense to reserve something like Black Ops 3 or Halo 5

02:29:29.820 --> 02:29:32.820
simply because I know there'll be a billion copies of them

02:29:32.820 --> 02:29:34.820
out in stores for two or three years afterwards.

02:29:34.820 --> 02:29:38.820
On the other hand, games that I'm not entirely sure will be that well stocked,

02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:41.820
such as Onichambara Z2, Chaos,

02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:43.820
you bet your ass I'm going to reserve something like that

02:29:43.820 --> 02:29:46.820
simply to make sure I don't have to go trolling for copies on eBay.

02:29:46.820 --> 02:29:49.820
I learned my lesson from missing out on Suikoden 2.

02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:51.820
That's wise.

02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:54.820
Next up, I find myself once more defending Activision

02:29:54.820 --> 02:29:56.820
in the Call of Duty franchise.

02:29:56.820 --> 02:29:57.820
Really?

02:29:57.820 --> 02:29:59.820
Yes, it's an annualized franchise,

02:29:59.820 --> 02:30:01.820
but not only do they have separate developers

02:30:01.820 --> 02:30:03.820
to ensure the games are quality when they come out

02:30:03.820 --> 02:30:05.820
instead of having the entire company rush the game

02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:07.820
out like Ubisoft with Assassin's Creed,

02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:10.820
and they have a clear and steady schedule for their map packs,

02:30:10.820 --> 02:30:13.820
making them one of the few companies that are clear and obvious

02:30:13.820 --> 02:30:15.820
and don't mis-schedule or sacrifice quality

02:30:15.820 --> 02:30:18.820
to make the schedule hide their EA.

02:30:18.820 --> 02:30:20.820
Just want to jump in real quick.

02:30:20.820 --> 02:30:23.820
Doesn't Ubisoft use different in-house studios, though?

02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:26.820
Doesn't one of the Assassin's Creed comes out of Montreal,

02:30:26.820 --> 02:30:28.820
one of the other ones comes out of, I want to say,

02:30:28.820 --> 02:30:30.820
somewhere else in Europe or maybe Vancouver?

02:30:30.820 --> 02:30:32.820
Sorry, I don't follow this closely enough,

02:30:32.820 --> 02:30:36.820
but I thought even Ubisoft rotated them amongst some of the studios,

02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:38.820
even though it's all still Ubisoft.

02:30:38.820 --> 02:30:39.820
Just food for thought.

02:30:39.820 --> 02:30:41.820
And admittedly, I could be wrong.

02:30:41.820 --> 02:30:44.820
Honestly, I think that people just hate Activision slash Call of Duty

02:30:44.820 --> 02:30:48.820
because of the surge of military-themed shooters in recent years

02:30:48.820 --> 02:30:53.820
as lesser companies such as EA imitate COD shamelessly.

02:30:53.820 --> 02:30:55.820
Perhaps it's because of the internet,

02:30:55.820 --> 02:30:57.820
but I don't remember that hatred for Nintendo

02:30:57.820 --> 02:31:00.820
during the platformer boom after Super Mario Bros. got big,

02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:03.820
or for Capcom in the wake of the fighting game boom.

02:31:03.820 --> 02:31:08.820
For some reason, it seems the more mentally deficient among the gaming public

02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:14.820
see fit to place the blame for the shallow imitators at Activision's feet

02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:18.820
rather than at the feet of the pale, soulless imitators themselves.

02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:21.820
Eh, people are kind of fanboy.

02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:24.820
Regarding the same-sex marriage in the latest Fire Emblem,

02:31:24.820 --> 02:31:28.820
while it's a great feature, I worry that it will be done in a pandering way,

02:31:28.820 --> 02:31:32.820
especially if they're just doing it in response to backlash over Tomodachi life.

02:31:32.820 --> 02:31:37.820
Often, I find in popular media that the LGBT characters

02:31:37.820 --> 02:31:40.820
don't forget about the QA, hey,

02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:44.820
usually have their LGBT-ness be a central part of the character

02:31:44.820 --> 02:31:46.820
as opposed to being a small part of a greater whole.

02:31:46.820 --> 02:31:48.820
Further, I'm hoping Nintendo shows discretion

02:31:48.820 --> 02:31:52.820
and doesn't make the whole roster open to marriage regardless of gender.

02:31:52.820 --> 02:31:56.820
Ideally, there would be straight gay and bi characters like people in real life.

02:31:56.820 --> 02:31:58.820
Don't forget the asexual people.

02:31:58.820 --> 02:32:00.820
Just say quilt bag.

02:32:00.820 --> 02:32:01.820
Represent.

02:32:01.820 --> 02:32:02.820
Just say quilt bag.

02:32:02.820 --> 02:32:03.820
Yeah.

02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:08.820
But I'm afraid that the company that usually shies away from sexuality and their games

02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:11.820
and all will just again take the shortcut and make everyone bi.

02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:13.820
And the last bit has to do with me.

02:32:13.820 --> 02:32:17.820
Wait, can I, before we get to that part, can I address just something real quick?

02:32:17.820 --> 02:32:21.820
Because I've heard there are some interesting things on the Fire Emblem front this week

02:32:21.820 --> 02:32:24.820
that apparently there are some weird things in the story

02:32:24.820 --> 02:32:30.820
that could involve these weird hallucinations about,

02:32:30.820 --> 02:32:34.820
and I'm not going to try to cite this because I don't want to misrepresent the game,

02:32:34.820 --> 02:32:38.820
but apparently some people are finding some problem things in that storyline.

02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:42.820
It's at the point where I don't really want to just believe what I read on Twitter.

02:32:42.820 --> 02:32:45.820
I would like to just play the game for myself and draw my own conclusions

02:32:45.820 --> 02:32:49.820
if I get around to it, or I'll ask Drew to play it and send me the important parts

02:32:49.820 --> 02:32:51.820
because he loves Fire Emblem.

02:32:51.820 --> 02:32:52.820
On it.

02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:54.820
But yeah, I'm hearing some things.

02:32:54.820 --> 02:32:56.820
It'll be interesting to see what happens in translation, too,

02:32:56.820 --> 02:32:59.820
because I guess it's one thing's happening in Japan. We'll see.

02:32:59.820 --> 02:33:01.820
So I don't know.

02:33:01.820 --> 02:33:05.820
It's raising some red flags, though. That's all I can really say right now.

02:33:05.820 --> 02:33:10.820
The last bit has to do with me having mentioned the hip cock

02:33:10.820 --> 02:33:14.820
in the female character for Mass Effect Andromeda.

02:33:14.820 --> 02:33:19.820
And yeah, I might have gone a little bit ranty on it, but I was really annoyed.

02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:23.820
And guess what? I'm entitled to be annoyed by something that I perceive

02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:30.820
as a particularly gendered feature without being compared to some of the people

02:33:30.820 --> 02:33:36.820
who were more exploitative about their position as public feminists.

02:33:36.820 --> 02:33:41.820
And you know what? I don't have to at all exercise any caution if I don't want to

02:33:41.820 --> 02:33:46.820
because I have a voice and I don't have to have anyone tell me how to use my voice.

02:33:46.820 --> 02:33:48.820
The end.

02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:52.820
That being said, I understand your point.

02:33:52.820 --> 02:33:55.820
You know, I'm not going to read the whole thing because it's geared toward me

02:33:55.820 --> 02:33:57.820
and I'm not going to go on with that.

02:33:57.820 --> 02:34:09.820
But I do think that the pose itself should have equaled the pose of the male character.

02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:11.820
They should have both been neutral.

02:34:11.820 --> 02:34:15.820
You know, if you're going to portray her in one mode,

02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:19.820
you should also portray him in like some hip thrusting mode. I don't know.

02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:25.820
I'm just saying that that is not how a woman comfortably stands.

02:34:25.820 --> 02:34:27.820
I'm just going to say that.

02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:31.820
The hip cock thing, not normal and not good for your back,

02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:35.820
not good for your hips. It's painful.

02:34:35.820 --> 02:34:38.820
I think something to kind of go with that too, you know,

02:34:38.820 --> 02:34:43.820
is that when EA is only going to give you a 10 second taste

02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:47.820
at what this new character you're going to be invested in is going to look like,

02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:50.820
you got to choose those 10 seconds carefully

02:34:50.820 --> 02:34:53.820
because if Dark Saga is going to make a snap opinion like that,

02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:57.820
that's because it's all she's got. She's got nothing but this little...

02:34:57.820 --> 02:34:58.820
I have a picture.

02:34:58.820 --> 02:35:01.820
Yeah, exactly. So I kind of see it from that angle where it's like,

02:35:01.820 --> 02:35:04.820
well, if this is all I've got to analyze, I'm going to analyze it

02:35:04.820 --> 02:35:06.820
and there's nothing to really balance it against.

02:35:06.820 --> 02:35:09.820
But hopefully, I mean, the Mass Effect games have done a good job.

02:35:09.820 --> 02:35:11.820
FemShep's a great character.

02:35:11.820 --> 02:35:16.820
And she doesn't at all like sit and stand like that.

02:35:16.820 --> 02:35:21.820
She basically has the male animations, which I'm actually kind of fine with

02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:24.820
because fuck, you've seen me sit.

02:35:24.820 --> 02:35:27.820
You're certainly not basing your decision on the entire game around this.

02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:29.820
No, hell no. That would be stupid.

02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:34.820
I'm just saying they need to be a little bit more cognizant of their audience.

02:35:34.820 --> 02:35:38.820
You know, you have female gamers and we are looking to you

02:35:38.820 --> 02:35:43.820
to make something that we're going to really, really be able to get into.

02:35:43.820 --> 02:35:47.820
I mean... God.

02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:52.820
That's why I really thought that Dragon Age Inquisition was done so well

02:35:52.820 --> 02:35:56.820
and that's why I had a lot of hope for Andromeda and I still do.

02:35:56.820 --> 02:36:01.820
I just think that if this is the start they're giving, they're off to a bad start.

02:36:01.820 --> 02:36:05.820
Although I have to say, though, that the game, what we've seen of it so far,

02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:08.820
looks absolutely gorgeous. I'm looking forward to learning more about it.

02:36:08.820 --> 02:36:11.820
And I'm certainly not going to make a judgment on the whole thing

02:36:11.820 --> 02:36:13.820
based on just what I've seen.

02:36:13.820 --> 02:36:18.820
My judgment was on the picture, not on the game.

02:36:18.820 --> 02:36:24.820
And if you can't recognize that, then I'm wondering when you went from

02:36:24.820 --> 02:36:29.820
thinking me to be the only voice of reason to then having an issue with it.

02:36:29.820 --> 02:36:32.820
And I'm not the only voice of reason, by the way.

02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:36.820
You know why? Because sometimes Sanrio comes out here.

02:36:36.820 --> 02:36:39.820
That's right. Sometimes Sanrio has to set us straight.

02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:43.820
Anyway, that's all I got. Keep up the good work.

02:36:43.820 --> 02:36:47.820
Regards, Ralstiel UT, OLR Minister of Unpopular Opinions.

02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:52.820
P.S. Hopefully Doom 4 gets delayed enough that it'll drop the week of OLR Episode 666.

02:36:52.820 --> 02:36:57.820
And for the record, Ralstiel UT, most of the time I think you're on point for many things.

02:36:58.820 --> 02:37:00.820
We're all going to disagree on something.

02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:04.820
It's like I think Act F to Super Awesome.

02:37:04.820 --> 02:37:07.820
I'm so happy he listens to the show and gives us that perspective.

02:37:07.820 --> 02:37:11.820
But he's so fucking wrong on this team dog and team cat thing, I'm just saying.

02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:15.820
Remember, cats rule and dogs drool.

02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:21.820
All right. Let's get to the F use of the week on that note.

02:37:27.820 --> 02:37:29.820
All this is bad.

02:37:29.820 --> 02:37:31.820
Here is justice.

02:37:31.820 --> 02:37:33.820
Here is punishment.

02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:35.820
Here.

02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:37.820
This is fucked up.

02:37:40.820 --> 02:37:47.820
So my F use goes to Tea Culture for no longer taking credit card and not fixing their damn credit card machine.

02:37:47.820 --> 02:37:54.820
Because I wanted my taro milk tea today with my egg custard in it because I'm cheating today.

02:37:54.820 --> 02:38:05.820
And no. So instead I'm just going to go to Farrell's and shove my face full of delicious peanuts and coffee flavored ice cream and chocolate ice cream.

02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:09.820
I want ice cream. Fuck hormones, man.

02:38:09.820 --> 02:38:11.820
Just all of it.

02:38:11.820 --> 02:38:16.820
I. Yeah, all of it. I'm except, except, except, except.

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:20.820
Also another fuck you to the Guinness beer brats that I bought because I thought they were going to be amazing.

02:38:20.820 --> 02:38:25.820
And they just don't microwave very well. So I'm going to make my husband throw me the rest of them.

02:38:25.820 --> 02:38:32.820
And I had something else to be angry about, but fuck it.

02:38:32.820 --> 02:38:35.820
I guess I just craving soda.

02:38:35.820 --> 02:38:39.820
I mean, I don't count the Red Bulls as soda. They drink those still.

02:38:39.820 --> 02:38:42.820
Well, only drink about once a day. Except for today.

02:38:42.820 --> 02:38:46.820
I drank two because I didn't drink one yesterday and I was tired.

02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:49.820
I got a massage today, so that's good. No, but yeah.

02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:57.820
It's so happy that because, you know, not really dieting, I guess, and just not eating fast food instead of eating garbage subway and sandwiches.

02:38:57.820 --> 02:39:06.820
So I've been just eating sandwiches for days, but I guess that's healthier than eating like McDonald's for days and cutting out soda.

02:39:06.820 --> 02:39:10.820
And I've been staying under like, you know, like 1600 calories a day.

02:39:10.820 --> 02:39:14.820
So, wow. So that's got to be pretty good, right? Even if it is garbage.

02:39:14.820 --> 02:39:21.820
I mean, my a few of the week goes to the popcorn kernel that just got stuck between my teeth.

02:39:21.820 --> 02:39:25.820
And that's why I had to run out of the room real fast, because that is annoying.

02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:28.820
Oh, my God. It's like emergency flossing now.

02:39:28.820 --> 02:39:33.820
That's not so bad. It's when it gets sucked between your gum.

02:39:33.820 --> 02:39:36.820
I can't get it out. Oh, no, no, no, no.

02:39:36.820 --> 02:39:39.820
Oh, my God. It's the worst. So anyway, that's why I ran out.

02:39:39.820 --> 02:39:41.820
So, Drew, did you get to do your FUs or no?

02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:42.820
Not yet. Go ahead.

02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:46.820
Dude, FU did not be able to make it out down to L.A. for AX.

02:39:46.820 --> 02:39:53.820
I mean, seriously, I had encountered the Cosplay Wrestling Federation, or FANMA, and they were funny as hell.

02:39:53.820 --> 02:39:57.820
And I just can't make it down there to enjoy all that kind of good stuff at AX.

02:39:57.820 --> 02:40:03.820
I wanted to go to AX this year because they had, I don't know, maybe it was an AX.

02:40:04.820 --> 02:40:09.820
I'm thinking of Comic-Con because they're doing a Kung Fury screening.

02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:14.820
Kung Fury screening with an after-party where David Hasselhoff is singing True Survivors.

02:40:14.820 --> 02:40:15.820
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

02:40:15.820 --> 02:40:20.820
I'm just going to maintain my FU to Warner Brothers right now until they fix their shit.

02:40:20.820 --> 02:40:21.820
Fix your shirt, guys.

02:40:21.820 --> 02:40:23.820
Fix it. All right.

02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:28.820
Just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to open up the Skype line to all of you at 1877 Game Oil R,

02:40:28.820 --> 02:40:30.820
our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:40:30.820 --> 02:40:32.820
But first, a couple more quick stories. Loki.

02:40:32.820 --> 02:40:42.820
Yes. So Valve has decided that they're going to no longer refund, I guess, bad trades, trade deals anymore.

02:40:42.820 --> 02:40:47.820
Basically, Steam is not going to return items that you were scammed out of.

02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:53.820
They're saying our community assigns an item of value and is at least partially determined by that item's scarcity.

02:40:53.820 --> 02:41:00.820
If more copies of the item are added to the economy through inventory rollbacks, the value of other instances of the item would be reduced.

02:41:00.820 --> 02:41:10.820
We sympathize with people who fall victim to scams, but we provide enough information on our websites within our trading systems to help users to make good trading decisions.

02:41:10.820 --> 02:41:15.820
All trade scams can be avoided, so don't be scammed.

02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:17.820
Be very careful about who you trade with.

02:41:17.820 --> 02:41:23.820
Yeah, that's why I only trade with friends. I don't trust other people.

02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:25.820
It's your responsibility to read.

02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:28.820
Friends of friends, I will, but that's about it.

02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:40.820
Yeah. Anyhow, one game that might inspire some trading of, I don't know, DLC or costume codes or something, is the potential of an open world Superman game.

02:41:40.820 --> 02:41:52.820
There's a rumor that Warner Brothers Games Montreal, who did Batman Arkham Origins, so remember there was the Arkham Origins game that was kind of the bridge between the two other ones, that was done by another studio.

02:41:52.820 --> 02:42:01.820
So apparently this studio, the rumor is that they're working on a Superman video game, and this is because of a supposedly leaked screenshot, but take it with a grain of salt.

02:42:01.820 --> 02:42:09.820
It supposedly shows Superman in the game where you can select the costume or whatever. It shows whatever skin you can.

02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:19.820
Also, there was a rumor last week that WB Games Montreal was trying to hire 15 positions for an open world action game, which was a new IP project for next generation game platforms.

02:42:19.820 --> 02:42:26.820
Now it would make a lot of sense that, you know, if this is going to be the last open world Batman game, why not follow it up with a Superman game?

02:42:26.820 --> 02:42:39.820
However, an important update was also released to this initial rumor, and that is that Warner Brothers Montreal isn't working on a Superman game, but the heavily rumored Suicide Squad game.

02:42:39.820 --> 02:42:46.820
Which would make sense when you consider there's that movie being worked on right now that obviously they would try to tie into that possibly with a game.

02:42:46.820 --> 02:42:55.820
So that could also explain what's going on here. So it's either a Superman game or a Suicide Squad game. Both would make a lot of sense.

02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:57.820
Does it involve flying through rings?

02:42:58.820 --> 02:43:15.820
Actually, I think that would be a really funny side quest type of thing. I think if they were to find a way to work that into the lore where you fly through rings, but they make it tongue in cheek funny, I think that would be okay. I think that would be hilarious.

02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:20.820
They could make it like Superman on the Atari 2600. You gotta find that phone booth.

02:43:20.820 --> 02:43:21.820
Oh god.

02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:23.820
Did you ever play Superman on the 2600?

02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:24.820
Heard of.

02:43:24.820 --> 02:43:26.820
Not that old.

02:43:27.820 --> 02:43:40.820
Alright, so that does it for news tonight. So we're going to open up the Skype line. 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Go ahead and get in on there if you want to comment on anything we've talked about tonight.

02:43:40.820 --> 02:43:49.820
Or perhaps something we haven't yet discussed. I'm not going to keep this open very long because we're already almost to 9 o'clock. So if you want to get in, I would urge you to call in ASAP.

02:43:49.820 --> 02:43:52.820
Meanwhile, I know Loki, you had at least one thing you wanted to talk about here.

02:43:53.820 --> 02:44:05.820
Yeah, so apparently Destiny, you know how they had that Red Bull promotion where they had some codes and stuff? They've already been exploited. Apparently the codes were predictable, and so they had a way to figure out what some of those codes would be.

02:44:05.820 --> 02:44:09.820
And they've already redeemed codes that may be on cans that they haven't purchased yet.

02:44:09.820 --> 02:44:10.820
Predictable!

02:44:10.820 --> 02:44:16.820
So you may get some codes if you purchase some of these cans that aren't redeemable because they've already been redeemed.

02:44:20.820 --> 02:44:21.820
Nice shot Bungie.

02:44:21.820 --> 02:44:25.820
Alright, actually our phones are lighting up, so let's get to it. We're getting several calls tonight.

02:44:25.820 --> 02:44:26.820
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:31.820
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? You might be on mute.

02:44:34.820 --> 02:44:36.820
I'm going to check one more time. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:38.820
Oh, they hung up.

02:44:38.820 --> 02:44:42.820
The joys of live radio everybody. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

02:44:42.820 --> 02:44:46.820
Hey, you can always test your connection by calling Echo 1-2-3 before giving us a call.

02:44:46.820 --> 02:44:49.820
So let's try another call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:44:49.820 --> 02:44:51.820
It's Ronma. What's up everybody?

02:44:51.820 --> 02:44:53.820
I know your Skype works. How you doing buddy?

02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:56.820
I'm doing good. A little tired, but I'm good.

02:44:56.820 --> 02:45:02.820
Did you go to a con this week? I know you're not an AnimeX skype. Is there another con like the East Coast or something that you did this weekend?

02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:09.820
Uh, no. I just went out and kind of got my party on because it was the 4th of July and then I was walking around all over New York City with a couple of friends today.

02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:12.820
Oh, awesome. Good for you. I hope you had a good 4th.

02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:14.820
I did. How about you?

02:45:14.820 --> 02:45:22.820
Uh, it was a little boring actually. But you know what? I played a shitload of Final Fantasy XIV and just relaxed. I had a really stressful week at work.

02:45:22.820 --> 02:45:29.820
So it was nice to just be able to like, relax. So I'm happy for that. Like, I'm ready to go back tomorrow.

02:45:29.820 --> 02:45:30.820
Gotcha.

02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:32.820
So what's on your mind tonight?

02:45:32.820 --> 02:45:38.820
Um, two things. I just want to know, did Junami show up with the joke book?

02:45:38.820 --> 02:45:43.820
I don't see a book, but he does have an electronic device.

02:45:43.820 --> 02:45:45.820
I'm going all digital this time around.

02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:52.820
I feel like in his 30s, I feel like he's moved into the digital age. He has a digital joke book now that he takes with him.

02:45:52.820 --> 02:45:54.820
Oh, god damn it.

02:45:54.820 --> 02:45:55.820
You're welcome.

02:45:55.820 --> 02:45:57.820
Gigabytes and gigabytes, my friend.

02:45:57.820 --> 02:45:59.820
And it's on a Blackberry.

02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:01.820
Bite your tongue.

02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:03.820
Hey, that's the equivalent of toilet paper, right?

02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:06.820
I think he's doing a good job tonight though. It's good to have him back.

02:46:07.820 --> 02:46:10.820
Yes, it is. And one more thing. I'm going to get out of here.

02:46:10.820 --> 02:46:15.820
The main reason why I called was to give Al his props on his answer. That was amazeballs.

02:46:15.820 --> 02:46:23.820
You know what? Sadly, he's not in the room to hear. He went back to playing MMOs, but he's probably listening on the headset back in the studio.

02:46:23.820 --> 02:46:27.820
So hopefully he'll hear his shout out there. But he's a hilarious guy.

02:46:27.820 --> 02:46:34.820
You know, he's that guy that'll kind of sit in the party and not really say anything and he won't be like super extroverted.

02:46:34.820 --> 02:46:39.820
But then like when he sees the opportunity for a killer joke, he'll throw it out there and just slay the entire party.

02:46:39.820 --> 02:46:47.820
I actually walked out of my house. That's how funny it was. I stopped what I was doing and I just walked out of my house.

02:46:47.820 --> 02:46:53.820
I'm hoping we get somebody in trouble at work for laughing too hard with that answer. We'll see. We'll see come Monday.

02:46:53.820 --> 02:46:55.820
Lord Jesus.

02:46:55.820 --> 02:46:56.820
Alright.

02:46:56.820 --> 02:46:58.820
You need Jesus.

02:46:58.820 --> 02:47:01.820
For the record, I've amended it from Blackberry to an N-Gage.

02:47:01.820 --> 02:47:06.820
You know what? The N-Gage would have probably done a lot better if Patrick Stewart actually promoted that.

02:47:06.820 --> 02:47:07.820
What?

02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:08.820
N-Gage.

02:47:08.820 --> 02:47:09.820
Aww, dude.

02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:14.820
I see you N-Gage and raise you a Windows powered CE device.

02:47:14.820 --> 02:47:15.820
Shut up.

02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:16.820
You mean the Dreamcast?

02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:18.820
I'm talking about before the Dreamcast.

02:47:18.820 --> 02:47:19.820
Oh.

02:47:19.820 --> 02:47:20.820
Oh my god.

02:47:20.820 --> 02:47:26.820
Rama. Rama. Dude, I had a kin. Your point is invalid. Or maybe it is perfectly valid.

02:47:26.820 --> 02:47:29.820
Alright, Rama. I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, alright?

02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:30.820
Awesome.

02:47:30.820 --> 02:47:31.820
Alright. Take care of my friend.

02:47:31.820 --> 02:47:32.820
Alright. Later.

02:47:32.820 --> 02:47:38.820
Alright. 1-877-GAME-OLR. Our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call.

02:47:38.820 --> 02:47:43.820
So I could go buy a can of Red Bull and somebody somehow already got that code, huh?

02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:44.820
Possibly, yeah.

02:47:44.820 --> 02:47:49.820
Alright. Well, the phones are lighting up back to back tonight so let's get back to it with another call.

02:47:49.820 --> 02:47:51.820
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:52.820
Hey, it's Shane.

02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:54.820
Hi, Shane. How are you?

02:47:54.820 --> 02:47:55.820
I'm fine.

02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:57.820
Excellent. What's on your mind tonight?

02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:01.820
So, I just wanted to quickly talk about Persona 4 Dancing All Night.

02:48:01.820 --> 02:48:05.820
Of course you do. Of course you do. By all means.

02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:07.820
Pandering. Go on ahead.

02:48:07.820 --> 02:48:08.820
Talk away.

02:48:08.820 --> 02:48:12.820
So, of course it's an amazing game. Let's just get that out of the way. However...

02:48:12.820 --> 02:48:17.820
You're also super biased. In the interest of you know ethics and all that, you're super biased.

02:48:17.820 --> 02:48:19.820
Go on.

02:48:19.820 --> 02:48:27.820
Not at all. I may or may not have purchased the Kanji in his swimsuit costume already.

02:48:27.820 --> 02:48:29.820
You would.

02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:37.820
Anyway, so it's a Vita game. It looks beautiful. I think it is not suited for Vita in the least.

02:48:37.820 --> 02:48:40.820
If you're gonna get it, I say play it on PlayStation TV.

02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:42.820
Oh, interesting.

02:48:42.820 --> 02:48:47.820
Because the controls, while functional on Vita, pretty uncomfortable.

02:48:47.820 --> 02:48:50.820
Is it like thumbstick based or something?

02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:59.820
It is. It's the up, left, down, and then the triangle, circle, X, as well as thumbsticks.

02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:04.820
Or you can play with the touch screen, which I just don't find fun at all.

02:49:04.820 --> 02:49:09.820
But, my god, those buttons being so small and the amount of stuff you have to do with them,

02:49:09.820 --> 02:49:13.820
just really uncomfortable unless you have like tiny baby hands.

02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:15.820
Oh, jeebus. That's gonna give me hand cramps.

02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:18.820
After an hour, my hands were dying.

02:49:18.820 --> 02:49:21.820
I was gonna say, maybe it was designed a little more with the Vita 2.0 in mind,

02:49:21.820 --> 02:49:25.820
but the buttons, I feel like, are even smaller on the Vita 2.0, so maybe not.

02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:29.820
Sorry, I'm in a Final Fantasy hunt right now.

02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:38.820
It's a really good game, though, and it is very story heavy, so you do want to know some Japanese for that.

02:49:38.820 --> 02:49:43.820
Or you can play the Free Dancing mode, where you can unlock songs just by regular play.

02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:48.820
It's a lot of fun. It reminds me of a cross between, obviously, Persona,

02:49:48.820 --> 02:49:59.820
maybe a little bit of Dance Summit from PlayStation 2, and, I don't know, sex, because it's so good.

02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:02.820
Story in a rhythm game. Okay, I'm geeking out now.

02:50:02.820 --> 02:50:06.820
What is it that makes this game so good? You keep saying it's good, but why?

02:50:06.820 --> 02:50:09.820
The music. Oh, the music is so good.

02:50:09.820 --> 02:50:13.820
And watching them dance, I thought it was going to be a stupid concept.

02:50:13.820 --> 02:50:16.820
Nope, works perfect. Abso-freaking-lutely love it.

02:50:16.820 --> 02:50:20.820
I don't know, it's just really good.

02:50:20.820 --> 02:50:25.820
The graphics for a Vita game? A lot better than I thought it would be.

02:50:25.820 --> 02:50:28.820
Was not expecting it to look as good as it does.

02:50:28.820 --> 02:50:33.820
The music, again, it has the Kiriyama Oka doing a remix.

02:50:33.820 --> 02:50:40.820
It's got a lot of other good artists I've never heard of, because I don't really listen to anything Japanese.

02:50:40.820 --> 02:50:48.820
But if you like Persona music, if you like Persona, if you like rhythm games in general, you're going to absolutely love this.

02:50:48.820 --> 02:50:53.820
But now we are getting this in the States, so people can be patient and play the story mode and all that stuff, right?

02:50:53.820 --> 02:50:59.820
Yes, I would actually suggest, I don't know, it's supposed to be this fall, I don't know how far into fall.

02:50:59.820 --> 02:51:00.820
It's supposed to be in October.

02:51:01.820 --> 02:51:05.820
I would pretty much say, just wait.

02:51:05.820 --> 02:51:08.820
Shane, one last question.

02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:15.820
You said you got Kanji in swimsuit, I have to ask out of purely morbid curiosity, does it also include the seaweed instance?

02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:18.820
And if you played Persona 4, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

02:51:18.820 --> 02:51:20.820
Oh yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.

02:51:20.820 --> 02:51:29.820
I do not see that as an unlockable costume yet, maybe it's DLC, but I don't see it as one I can unlock yet.

02:51:30.820 --> 02:51:34.820
Now Shane, one more question I have to ask you since we're talking about Vita's.

02:51:34.820 --> 02:51:43.820
You knew about my present because Alan told you before it actually showed up here, so what was your reaction to hearing that I was going to be getting the Heavensward Vita?

02:51:43.820 --> 02:51:48.820
I thought it was really cool that you were getting it. I wasn't going to, like, murder you.

02:51:48.820 --> 02:51:50.820
Not today anyway.

02:51:50.820 --> 02:51:56.820
I already threw away the three copies of the house key I made, so I can't come steal it at night.

02:51:59.820 --> 02:52:04.820
I figure if you were going to murder me, you would have done it at some point in the last decade, because we've known each other far too long.

02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:10.820
Yeah, no that's really cool, I have to come see it sometime. I really like that box though, as I've told you.

02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:12.820
It's okay, I'll just sneak it out and take it to work.

02:52:12.820 --> 02:52:14.820
You will do nothing of the sort.

02:52:14.820 --> 02:52:17.820
Alright, alright Shane, I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, okay?

02:52:17.820 --> 02:52:19.820
That's fine, I've got to go do more hunts.

02:52:19.820 --> 02:52:20.820
Alright, have fun.

02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:21.820
Alright, bye bye.

02:52:21.820 --> 02:52:22.820
Bye.

02:52:22.820 --> 02:52:28.820
Alright, 1877 Game O.L.R., our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

02:52:28.820 --> 02:52:33.820
And we'll try to squeeze in one more call here. Do we have any other? Oh, god, it's already lighting up.

02:52:33.820 --> 02:52:37.820
You won't play match game, but you're calling to the show. Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:52:37.820 --> 02:52:40.820
Yo, Rob, it's Genicor from the OKC, how you doing, man?

02:52:40.820 --> 02:52:43.820
It has been a long time since we've heard from you, my friend. How are you?

02:52:43.820 --> 02:52:46.820
You know, just trying to keep that job, you know how that goes.

02:52:46.820 --> 02:52:50.820
I know very well how that goes. What's on your mind tonight, my friend?

02:52:50.820 --> 02:53:01.820
Not much, man. I was thinking about getting back into the podcast game, but I don't think there's anything out there that I can really cover that isn't being covered by, like, five or six people that are at YouTube and podcasts and then all this stuff has jumped all over the place.

02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:11.820
You know what? I don't think you should let that stop you. You know, I think if anybody has a passion, they can bring something to the table that other people aren't doing, because it's about you.

02:53:11.820 --> 02:53:21.820
And everybody, I mean, God, that sounds very egotistical. I don't mean, like, I expect that people are subscribing to OLR because it's me, but it's because the opinions, you know, that we share.

02:53:21.820 --> 02:53:30.820
And I think, I think DarkSakura kind of hit on this a little bit ago when she was talking about the email that came in and it's like, you know, I mostly agree with this guy, but this one, I think he's off the mark.

02:53:30.820 --> 02:53:35.820
I respect, you know, it's kind of like that's what you say, I respect it, but, you know, we're going to agree to disagree on that.

02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:41.820
And I think, you know, that's the kind of stuff that we all bring to the table is that it's different perspectives and things like that.

02:53:41.820 --> 02:53:49.820
So I don't think, Xenocore, you should ever let the fact that someone else is doing it be the sole thing to kind of stop you.

02:53:49.820 --> 02:54:00.820
It may make it trickier to market your show and to sell your show because, you know, you're going to have to kind of say, well, what is it I'm doing that's going to make people want to check me out as opposed to somebody else?

02:54:00.820 --> 02:54:12.820
But you'll find that. And I think maybe part of it is to just kind of start doing, do a pilot episode, do a test run and just see what happens, analyze it, see what you want to do better, what you like and you didn't like about it.

02:54:12.820 --> 02:54:13.820
Anyway.

02:54:13.820 --> 02:54:20.820
It's not so much that, it's mainly because I'm such an old fart when it comes to games now that, you know, I just think of all these guys as whippersnappers.

02:54:20.820 --> 02:54:27.820
I saw the Nintendo World Championships. I was crying because they were so bad. It was ridiculous. They have no gamer sense. I was embarrassed.

02:54:28.820 --> 02:54:31.820
How do you think we feel here on OLR?

02:54:31.820 --> 02:54:33.820
I hope you feel the same as me.

02:54:33.820 --> 02:54:51.820
I think we do a little bit. We do. But I think that's okay because, you know, our generation, you know, I remember when we were, you know, 15 years old or what have you, when we were younger, it would seem like there were very few people in their 30s and 40s that were into gaming.

02:54:51.820 --> 02:54:59.820
I mean, sure there were some. I'm not going to say there were none. But it seemed like there were very few. There were a lot more people that didn't understand it. Like a lot of our parents didn't really get it.

02:54:59.820 --> 02:55:07.820
But now that that generation has grown up and we are the 30, 40 somethings, I think there's a lot more people now that get it.

02:55:07.820 --> 02:55:23.820
And I think what's funny is that you say that, but yet I feel like there's not enough out there for the older gamer, or I hate to say middle-aged gamer, but you know, just the gamer in their 30s and 40s. The Gen X gamer.

02:55:23.820 --> 02:55:29.820
Yeah, because that balloon fight thing was horrible. It's like, what? Have you never even touched this game before in your life? What's wrong with you people?

02:55:29.820 --> 02:55:31.820
I know, right? These damn kids.

02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:34.820
It's just me getting crotchety telling kids to get off my lawn. I think that's a big problem.

02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:40.820
That's alright. Well maybe that's an angle for your show. Where are you going to tell all the kids to get off your lawn today and why?

02:55:40.820 --> 02:55:42.820
Yeah, Uncle Zeno's lawn.

02:55:42.820 --> 02:55:48.820
There you go! There you go, gaming with Uncle Zeno. And this is why y'all need to be taught some things about balloon fight.

02:55:48.820 --> 02:55:51.820
Alright, awesome show guys. Keep up the good work.

02:55:51.820 --> 02:55:54.820
Thank you so much Zenocore. Best of luck to whatever it is you decide to do.

02:55:54.820 --> 02:55:55.820
Alright, take care.

02:55:55.820 --> 02:55:56.820
Alright, take care. Bye bye.

02:55:57.820 --> 02:56:01.820
Look at that fifth dream in chat. It says, I'd co-host that. There it is. Alright.

02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:04.820
I am going to shut down the Skype line for tonight. I'm so sorry to those who didn't get through.

02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:14.820
Please consider sending us an email. Participate at OrangeLawnsRadio.com or tweet. Twitter.com slash O-L-R or one of the other several different ways that you can interact with our show.

02:56:14.820 --> 02:56:16.820
Any other last minute stories you want to get out there, Loki?

02:56:16.820 --> 02:56:17.820
No.

02:56:17.820 --> 02:56:18.820
We're going to close up shop tonight.

02:56:18.820 --> 02:56:19.820
We can close up shop.

02:56:19.820 --> 02:56:23.820
Shut it down. Shut it down. Hey Drew, good to see you buddy.

02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:24.820
I'll be back.

02:56:24.820 --> 02:56:28.820
I'll be back now that you're in your thirties. Oh my God.

02:56:28.820 --> 02:56:31.820
Isn't that just a kick in the head?

02:56:31.820 --> 02:56:37.820
It is. You were the dumb kid. You know I say that with love. I say that with love.

02:56:37.820 --> 02:56:40.820
Also a lot of truth because I was kind of the dumb kid.

02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:50.820
Well, so was I. You know, I go back to, oh my God, when I was like first doing this show at like 23, 24, whatever, I'm a completely different person than I am now. Completely different.

02:56:50.820 --> 02:56:54.820
We were making jokes about red Oreos and pizza.

02:56:54.820 --> 02:56:57.820
And now red velvet Oreos are a thing.

02:56:57.820 --> 02:57:01.820
It's come full circle. How about that shit?

02:57:01.820 --> 02:57:04.820
Anyhow, Drew, I don't know if you have anything to plug.

02:57:04.820 --> 02:57:06.820
But no pizza Oreos.

02:57:06.820 --> 02:57:07.820
Not yet.

02:57:07.820 --> 02:57:08.820
Would they be pizza Oreos?

02:57:08.820 --> 02:57:11.820
They'd be combos is what they are. Combos are good enough.

02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:15.820
Alright, if you can find them. Jesus, those things are impossible to find.

02:57:16.820 --> 02:57:19.820
Drew, I don't know if you have anything to plug. Everybody's got their own podcast these days.

02:57:19.820 --> 02:57:24.820
I don't know if you have anything you want to plug. But if not, maybe a Twitter or something where people can follow you. Say hi.

02:57:24.820 --> 02:57:27.820
No, I'm just running solo at this point. Mostly off the map.

02:57:27.820 --> 02:57:35.820
But expect me. I'm going to see if I can make my most triumphant return over on the IRC chat again.

02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:36.820
Nice.

02:57:36.820 --> 02:57:41.820
And see if I can be a regular again. So give me my mops so I can go ahead and kick some butts.

02:57:41.820 --> 02:57:47.820
Well, since it's been four years, know that we're in channel VOG.

02:57:47.820 --> 02:57:48.820
I've been there.

02:57:48.820 --> 02:57:49.820
Things have changed a little bit.

02:57:49.820 --> 02:57:51.820
Senile old coot.

02:57:51.820 --> 02:57:55.820
Listen up, bitch. I'm going to take that book and shove it up your ass.

02:57:55.820 --> 02:57:59.820
Alright, come back again sometime. But not too soon. Just kidding.

02:57:59.820 --> 02:58:00.820
Will do.

02:58:00.820 --> 02:58:05.820
Alright, let's see. Thank you guys so much for downloading our show and checking us out.

02:58:05.820 --> 02:58:09.820
Hey, if you like what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, support independent broadcasting.

02:58:09.820 --> 02:58:14.820
If you thought this show was a hot goddamn mess, and who could blame you after Match Game? No, I'm kidding.

02:58:14.820 --> 02:58:18.820
Just support another show out there. Send another show of your love.

02:58:18.820 --> 02:58:22.820
Because there's a lot of people out there who work very, very hard to create this sort of content.

02:58:22.820 --> 02:58:25.820
So thank you all for supporting us.

02:58:25.820 --> 02:58:29.820
You can leave a nice five star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio if you want.

02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:31.820
Go leave a five star review that said,

02:58:31.820 --> 02:58:34.820
Allen's joke just sold this entire show to me tonight.

02:58:34.820 --> 02:58:35.820
There you go, if you want.

02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:41.820
Alright, but for now, it's time to wrap up and go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.

02:58:41.820 --> 02:58:43.820
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

02:58:43.820 --> 02:58:45.820
You both said hard and butt.

02:58:47.820 --> 02:58:49.820
You're so mature.

02:58:49.820 --> 02:58:51.820
Drew, do you have a final thought tonight?

02:58:51.820 --> 02:58:55.820
Dude, you called me five times in the middle of the show. You have the wrong number, dude.

02:58:55.820 --> 02:59:03.820
My final thought is, now I'm craving combos after I already ate an entire box of Mike and Ikes.

02:59:03.820 --> 02:59:06.820
This is why I'm fat. This is why Mike and Ikes are so good.

02:59:06.820 --> 02:59:08.820
Cowboy Breaker!

02:59:08.820 --> 02:59:11.820
Anyway, last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:59:11.820 --> 02:59:15.820
I'm thinking about doing another game jam in a couple weeks.

02:59:15.820 --> 02:59:21.820
But, just to be clear though, it wouldn't be anything beyond a game jam.

02:59:21.820 --> 02:59:27.820
It would be, I'm done after, well, it's a 72 hour game jam, but I only have 10 hours to do it.

02:59:27.820 --> 02:59:29.820
Because of family.

02:59:29.820 --> 02:59:31.820
My gosh.

02:59:33.820 --> 02:59:35.820
Okay, then.

02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:37.820
One member of your family.

02:59:37.820 --> 02:59:39.820
Also, congratulations to my sister who just had her baby yesterday.

02:59:39.820 --> 02:59:43.820
I saw that. Congratulations, you're now an uncle as well as a dad.

02:59:43.820 --> 02:59:45.820
That's great.

02:59:45.820 --> 02:59:51.820
By the way, one of the founders of Burt's Bees, the Burt behind it, died.

02:59:51.820 --> 02:59:53.820
Did he get stunk by a bee?

02:59:53.820 --> 02:59:55.820
No.

02:59:55.820 --> 02:59:57.820
Why would I say that?

02:59:57.820 --> 03:00:01.820
He's just old and lived on a farm with no power.

03:00:01.820 --> 03:00:03.820
No power on a farm?

03:00:03.820 --> 03:00:07.820
Did he perhaps go up into a giant wicker man and go, the bees!

03:00:07.820 --> 03:00:09.820
Not the bees!

03:00:09.820 --> 03:00:11.820
I hate all of you.

03:00:11.820 --> 03:00:13.820
Except Alan. I love Alan.

03:00:13.820 --> 03:00:17.820
And on that note, we'll see you next week. Jamie hates all of you. Good night.

03:00:17.820 --> 03:00:21.820
