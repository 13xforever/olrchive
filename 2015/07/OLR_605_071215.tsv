7000	27000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie and Loki
27000	38000	Orange Lounge Radio
58000	65000	Satoru Iwata would have been about 24 years old when he programmed this game, Balloon Fight,
65000	72000	and although most people probably wrote it off at the time as a clone of Joust, which, well yeah, did have a lot of similarities,
72000	75000	it did bring some new ideas to the table.
75000	80000	Namely, the balloon trip mode, an endless side scroller, but with Joust-type mechanics.
80000	83000	It was difficult, but it was an awful lot of fun.
83000	98000	And I'm sure every gamer out there at some point has had their hands on a Kirby game,
98000	106000	and Satoru Iwata was a producer on the first game on the original Game Boy as well as the NES version that came shortly after that many people were familiar with.
106000	111000	The ability for Kirby to inhale enemies and copy their abilities in such an adorable way
111000	116000	made him a mascot for years and years until even today.
130000	137000	And of course to think that Mr. Iwata would have been in his mid-thirties, our age, when he was doing programming work on Mother 2,
137000	140000	which of course we all know as Earthbound here in the US.
140000	145000	This game was truly something different. It put away the swords and sorcery of the typical JRPG,
145000	150000	and replaced it with the things that could only be found in a child's imagination.
150000	154000	In 2002, Satoru Iwata took over as the president of Nintendo,
154000	160000	and what makes Mr. Iwata notable as an executive is that he didn't just swoop in from some other financial firm or company,
160000	163000	looking out to make top dollar for the company.
163000	166000	Satoru Iwata worked his way through various elements of game design.
166000	172000	That fun, originality, and things of a child's imagination are things that are better, and for worse,
172000	178000	Nintendo has been known for in the past decade throughout the Wii, the DS, the 3DS, and the Wii U.
178000	182000	As I'm sure many of you are aware before hearing this program tonight,
182000	185000	the gaming industry has lost one of the all-time greats,
185000	191000	as Satoru Iwata passed away this weekend due to a bile duct growth at the all-too-young age of 55.
191000	196000	Tonight we remember and we respect this man's legacy and his contributions to the gaming world,
196000	199000	which can never be forgotten.
199000	206000	It is Orange Launch Radio episode number 605 for this July the 12th of 2015.
206000	211000	I'm Rob Roberts. With me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
211000	212000	Hi.
212000	215000	Hi. And of course, Tech Master Loki here in the house as well.
215000	216000	Hello.
216000	222000	Hello. You know, part of the joy, quotey fingers, of doing live radio is that sometimes
222000	225000	there's news in the world out there that throws you for a loop a little bit,
225000	229000	and you have to plan for the unexpected, as they say.
229000	234000	I seem to recall this show was live, oh golly, it was several years ago at this point,
234000	237000	it was probably about six or seven years ago when the whole, and I apologize,
237000	240000	I don't know off the top of my head, but my head's spinning a little bit tonight,
240000	244000	when the Osama bin Laden news came through that he'd been captured,
244000	247000	and Obama did that whole press conference, that was right in the middle of our show,
247000	251000	and completely unexpected, and you know, live things happen.
251000	255000	So I know all of us here in the studio, as well as those of you in our chat room,
255000	258000	of course, live Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
258000	260000	right after the Bobby Blackwell show, and if you are listening live,
260000	262000	live.vognetwork.com.
262000	266000	I'm sure a lot of us are just reeling from this news, which is just, you know,
266000	269000	it's a surprise in many ways.
269000	272000	I mean, this really came out of nowhere to hear that, you know,
272000	279000	somebody who just was a major part of E3, with the whole Nintendo Direct,
279000	282000	and the whole Muppet thing, you know, all that stuff,
282000	286000	that was just a big part of that, has just passed away.
286000	291000	And obviously, you know, if you start to kind of look back over the past year,
291000	296000	he did miss E3 last year, because he had not been doing so well, he was sick,
296000	300000	and I don't think they said a lot, I think they might have said it was the bile duct at the time,
300000	303000	I don't recall in the moment what all they had or hadn't said about it,
303000	308000	but certainly hadn't been doing well then, we thought he had made a full recovery,
308000	314000	but, you know, unfortunately, clearly, that did not happen.
314000	319000	And it really just, it stings in a very familiar way,
319000	324000	because me personally, I'm really reminded in so many ways of Steve Jobs,
324000	327000	and I know some people might come after me for that comparison,
327000	332000	but I kind of think Steve Jobs was somebody else who was with this company,
332000	335000	that was on this huge upswing, very inventive,
335000	339000	and then, you know, he had the issues with pancreatic cancer,
339000	342000	which is, I mean, those two are neighbors,
342000	344000	and I can tell you, because when I was 29,
344000	347000	and you might remember when I was really sick and I missed the show for like a month,
347000	351000	I was going through issues that had to do with my bile duct and my pancreas,
351000	353000	and that shit is no joke, let me tell you.
354000	358000	And, you know, obviously that, we lost Steve Jobs to that,
358000	361000	and now we've lost another great tech, great, was Satoru Iwata to that,
361000	366000	it's just, I don't know what else to say about fuck cancer, certainly,
366000	373000	and God, I just, it's just really overwhelming in the moment to think about
373000	380000	the fact that, you know, this was a guy who created so many of these games
380000	382000	that we have so many memories around,
382000	386000	and like this show would not exist if it wasn't for some of this man's contributions
386000	389000	to the Nintendo Entertainment System, you know.
389000	392000	Yeah, I'm still reeling, I don't know about you guys, help me out here,
392000	394000	what are you guys thinking and processing right now?
394000	396000	Dark Sakura, how are you doing?
396000	398000	I can't.
398000	401000	Yeah, no, I know, it's a lot to process. Sudden.
401000	407000	Well, that, and I'm also coming from the tail end of personal deaths in my family, so.
407000	408000	Sure.
408000	410000	This is sort of like, I'm overloaded right now.
410000	416000	Oh no, I completely understand, I, yeah, Loki, how are you doing?
416000	419000	I'm fine, I just have a headache from my kids today.
419000	422000	From everything else that goes on in the world, yes, of course.
422000	426000	Yes, I've taken two rounds of ibuprofen and nothing to help me.
426000	429000	Oh no, as I said in the beginning of the show and on Twitter and all that stuff,
429000	433000	you know, the show must go on in light of all this news, we've, you know,
433000	437000	got still many things going on in the industry and so forth in the news.
437000	439000	I will tell you what my doctor told me.
439000	443000	If you've got a headache, take ibuprofen and Tylenol together.
443000	448000	Yeah, I used to have, like, a combo pill thing that was like that,
448000	453000	but see, I can't swallow pills, so the ibuprofen I have, I get this, like, dye-free ibuprofen.
453000	457000	It doesn't really taste like anything, so it's something I can actually chew up and swallow and it works,
457000	461000	because it's a double medicine and not, like, some liquid crap instead of taking, you know,
461000	465000	like, overdosing on children's Tylenol or something like that.
466000	470000	So it's just like, you know, eating chalk, but hey, it works.
470000	476000	But anyways, yeah, the long story short, I used to have one that was a combo with that and caffeine,
476000	479000	but it was some nasty stuff.
479000	481000	Yeah, but caffeine is great.
481000	485000	It's good if you can swallow it, but if you're, like, in my, where I have a terrible gag reflex,
485000	491000	I can't, I cannot, I want to, and it really bothers me, I can't, I cannot swallow pills.
491000	496000	And so, I just, that's the only way around it, is I got to chew and swallow that stuff,
496000	499000	and it's just, that was some nasty, nasty stuff.
499000	501000	But this stuff's not bad, I can deal with it.
501000	503000	Which is the kids.
503000	507000	Let me go to the chat room where obviously a lot of people are discussing, you know, what's,
507000	510000	what's, everybody's kind of reeling from the news and obviously there's a lot of comments in our chat room
510000	512000	over at live.vognetwork.com.
512000	517000	Raginator puts it quite succinctly by saying, fuck cancer in the eye socket, fair enough.
518000	523000	Breakman says, I don't know anyone whose life hasn't been affected directly or indirectly by cancer.
523000	528000	Pow in our chat room says, I see similarities. Innovative people gone too soon.
528000	533000	S2100matt says, like Jobs, he certainly changed the industry for the better.
533000	536000	He really brought about great innovation.
536000	540000	The thing is, Nintendo will carry on his legacy much like Apple did with Jobs.
540000	545000	His contributions will be reaching us for many years. He won't truly ever be gone.
546000	551000	True says, the memory of he and Shiggy printing Wii money will forever be remembered.
551000	556000	Certainly, you know, he's, he's, he's an executive that has many gifable moments out there
556000	558000	through some of those Nintendo directs.
558000	561000	And, you know, he's got his own trademarks, you know.
561000	566000	Who hasn't watched a Nintendo direct and done the whole, please understand, you know, the whole thing that he does, right?
566000	568000	You know, that, that's personality.
568000	574000	Well, yeah, exactly. It was nice to see, like, someone that actually would be that direct with their consumers
574000	576000	and just kind of, you know, they're out there.
576000	585000	I mean, how many presidents of companies do you actually get to see, you know, interact with a consumer on a pretty regular basis?
585000	591000	And speaking of, like, being that person, you know, I'm seeing a lot floating around Twitter right now,
591000	595000	which you can imagine is just, you know, a mess, an understandable mess over, over what's happening.
595000	603000	And one of the things that I was reminded of is that I think it was the year the 3DS first came out
603000	609000	and remember it didn't do so hot its first year and it took until the next year when they got, like, the Mario Kart and, you know, all the big games.
609000	617000	As you recall, the executives took a huge pay cut that year, including, you know, Iwata as the president of Nintendo at the time.
617000	618000	Yeah, he cut his in half.
618000	627000	He cut, they cut their salaries because of those problems, which, you know, you just don't see people doing in this day and age very often at all.
627000	633000	And that was a very kind of, like, I think humanizing thing in a way that, you know, certainly, certainly made them even more personable.
633000	638000	And Pao follows that up in chat saying he was an honest person.
638000	641000	How many presidents of big companies dropped their own salary?
641000	646000	I'm sure, I'm sure there has been others, but it's certainly not something you hear about an awful lot.
646000	653000	Let's see, Dungeon Buster says Iwata was a tough corporate leader who reached out to his fans.
653000	658000	He held the course, fought to keep Nintendo Nintendo, and wasn't afraid to have a little fun at the same time.
658000	669000	You know, Iwata, if I remember right, sorry guys, you know, I just found this out about 45 minutes ago, so I'm having to kind of do a lot of this from memory and off the cusp.
670000	677000	But Iwata, if I remember right, at some point a couple years ago actually took over Nintendo of America.
677000	684000	Because Reggie Fils-Aime is not, like, CEO of Nintendo America, or at least he wasn't at the time.
684000	693000	So I don't remember how the timing all worked out, but I do remember that it was Iwata's decision in many ways to basically bow out of E3 and not do the E3.
693000	699000	I mean, well, they do obviously the booth, but they don't do the E3 conferences anymore, they do the Nintendo Directs.
699000	705000	Which, you know, has led to a lot of this personality stuff we've been seeing out of Nintendo in the past couple years.
705000	710000	You know, that was a big decision that Iwata made when he was overseeing Nintendo of America as well.
710000	719000	SSJ100Matt in chat says he certainly kept fans tuned in with those Iwata Asks web and video updates. Absolutely.
720000	725000	I was going to talk a little bit about Comic-Con at the top of the show tonight, because that was going on this weekend.
725000	727000	We'll address some of that stuff later on, I'm sure.
727000	735000	But I thought we could take a moment here where we would usually do a kick-off topic to just talk about, like, how our lives have been impacted by Nintendo.
735000	740000	And things that Iwata has certainly influenced and touched and so forth.
740000	745000	And I'll start, since I'm not putting Jamie and Matt too much on the spot here.
745000	756000	But for me, for Nintendo, I mean, in some ways, video games and having that to turn to was so crucial, I think, especially in the fourth grade.
756000	765000	And I remember playing games like Balloon Fight and Zelda, which, you know, Iwata had a little bit of influence over still in those games.
765000	773000	Those were such a huge part of my childhood at that time, I just can't even imagine how I would be different if it wasn't for that.
773000	778000	Because I was that kid in the class that other kids would come to for the Nintendo secrets.
778000	784000	And, you know, how do I get to level 8 on the second quest of Legend of Zelda and things like that.
784000	788000	You know, that was something they would come to me for because I had that subscription to Nintendo Power.
788000	792000	You know, I was the game nerd from an even young age, kept in tune to that.
792000	799000	Because I loved the fact that video games kind of allowed you, in some indirect way, to have control of what was on the television.
799000	805000	And it wasn't just I'm watching a cartoon, it is I am being a cartoon, I am the cartoon, especially.
805000	811000	And I remember a very vivid memory I have of that is the first time I ever played Super Mario Brothers 2, specifically.
811000	818000	Because, you remember the graphics in that game, when we were that age and that game first came out, it was like, this is a fucking cartoon.
818000	822000	You know, and I realize, you go back in retrospect, we've had games that are plenty better looking since then.
822000	830000	But, at the time, Mario 2 is like, this is a cartoon. I am an interactive cartoon on the television, this is happening.
830000	837000	And so, you know, I've been following that from when I was like 9 or 10, following Nintendo closely.
837000	845000	And now, here we are, 20 some odd years later, doing this show where we're still talking about video games and being tapped into the game industry.
845000	848000	And all that is still a huge influence on my life.
849000	858000	And maybe there's other people that play into that, certainly, too. I mean, Sony, Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft, great companies as well.
858000	863000	But, you know, Nintendo is still there. Nintendo, from my childhood, is still going.
863000	871000	Atari, not the same company it used to be. Great memories with Atari, but they're not really what they used to be. Sega?
871000	875000	I think you're great memories with Activision, actually, on the Atari.
875000	881000	Well, not too far off, yeah. But, you know, Activision, not the same they used to be.
881000	885000	I mean, Destiny is a long way from Pitfall, let's just put it that way.
885000	889000	And then, you know, Sega was a big part of that same time, again.
889000	894000	And not to belittle the many things that Sega accomplished in that era, but it's not the same company it used to be.
894000	900000	Nintendo, still going after all this time. And not a lot of companies that were around in that time can really say that.
900000	904000	That they're still going strong today. I suppose Activision could, but, you know, it's just so different.
904000	910000	Where, like, Nintendo is like, Nintendo is still Nintendo, you know, for better or for worse.
910000	916000	And, yes, we've been critical of Nintendo on this show before. I'm not going to try to hide that just because of the news today.
916000	928000	But, I've also, and I've said this time and time again, is that when we're critical of something, it's usually because we care so much about it that it really bothers us when we see them making mistakes.
928000	935000	You know, that, like, I love you so much I could just scream. You know, that's how it is with Nintendo a lot of times.
935000	940000	So, anyway, that's for me. I'm getting to that rambling point.
940000	945000	Dark Sakura, what Nintendo memories do you have from growing up?
945000	950000	Well, I actually went and looked up the list because I always remembered the HAL Laboratories logo.
950000	951000	Oh, yeah.
951000	952000	With the puppies, you know.
952000	958000	And I was just looking through the list of HAL Laboratory games and just how many of them I've played.
958000	962000	And some of these were, keep in mind, some of them were ports as well.
962000	966000	So, they were responsible for the port of Joust on the Nintendo.
966000	971000	We had a port of Millipede, Othello, you know.
971000	975000	As far as the other ones, I mean, we had the Adventures of Lolo.
975000	979000	Oh, yeah. I remember that puzzler game, absolutely.
979000	980000	Yeah.
980000	981000	There was, like, three of them.
981000	984000	Kabuki Quantum Fighter.
984000	990000	I was just looking over the list of a bunch of stuff that was on here that were all things that, like, I had when I was a kid.
990000	993000	Still have a bunch of them, actually.
993000	998000	We actually had, of course, all of the Kirby games on the Super Nintendo.
998000	1001000	For Nintendo 64, there was Pokémon Snap.
1001000	1003000	It was at HAL Laboratories.
1003000	1004000	Oh, that's right.
1004000	1006000	Yep. Pokémon Stadium.
1006000	1009000	There was, Super Smash Brothers was HAL Laboratories.
1009000	1010000	Yeah.
1010000	1012000	You know, so we wouldn't have had that without them.
1012000	1019000	By this point, this is where Iwata probably was moving in a little more to the Nintendo, but certainly his influence was still there.
1019000	1021000	This is definitely the company that he ran for a while.
1021000	1023000	He was at HAL Laboratories first.
1023000	1024000	Yeah.
1024000	1026000	So, just all kinds of stuff.
1026000	1034000	And we've heard those stories about where, like, he was high up and, wasn't it the original Smash Brothers where, I remember, was the original or the one on the GameCube or one of them?
1034000	1037000	He fucking jumped in there and started programming so they could meet a deadline.
1037000	1039000	Like, that's who he was.
1039000	1052000	Well, and if I do recall correctly, when the first Pokémon came out, or one of them, anyway, they could only fit, like, one of the regions on the cartridge and he went in and reprogrammed it to where they could fit two regions on there.
1052000	1056000	Yeah, somebody in chat had brought that up and I apologize, I didn't read that comment.
1056000	1059000	But yeah, it was brought up.
1059000	1060000	Oh, yeah.
1060000	1062000	Vogdammit.
1062000	1063000	Love that name in our chatroom.
1063000	1066000	It says, Iwata was the reason Kanto fit into Pokémon Gold and Silver.
1066000	1068000	Yeah, that was Pokémon Gold and Silver, that was it.
1068000	1075000	He also programmed, well, I mean, was behind, I think, one of my favorite ever pinball games, Revenge of the Gator.
1075000	1082000	Oh shit, that was a HAL game. Oh my god, that was like the Game Boy Link game when that came out. Oh my god.
1082000	1091000	Just looking through a few other ones on here, you know, going back a little bit further back into the older days, I mean, we had Kirby, Tilt, and Tumble.
1092000	1103000	And, let's see. And then, of course, there was, before it got turned into Mother 3, there was going to be Mother 64, or Earthbound 64, as it was.
1103000	1105000	So, all kinds of stuff.
1105000	1106000	Yeah.
1106000	1117000	And, on top of that, I mean, we've also got, there's a list of other games, other systems, sorry, that HAL Laboratories provided games for.
1117000	1124000	Like, Commodore 64 games, Mole Attack, Pinball Spectacular, Slalom, Bowling Jupiter Lander.
1124000	1130000	I think I played Slalom, I had no idea that HAL did work with Commodore 64.
1130000	1132000	Le Mans, Money Wars.
1132000	1135000	Oh my god, Le Mans was the first Commodore 64 game I ever owned.
1135000	1136000	Yep.
1136000	1137000	True. Wow.
1137000	1144000	For Cliccovision, Mr. Chin. For MSX, a ton of stuff. Like, the Eggerland games, there were also Famicom Disk games.
1144000	1145000	Huh.
1145000	1156000	The Golf Force games after the anime from the 80s. Inspector Z, Pachi Pro Densetsu, Rollerball, Space Maze Attack.
1156000	1164000	Let's see what else. For MSX2, there were a few other games, and a couple of Windows games, which were mostly the Eggerland games. So, yeah.
1164000	1169000	Looking at chat, because a lot of folks sharing memories in our chat room, and then I'll get over to Loki.
1169000	1176000	Sjoan Hunter Matt says, I have many vivid memories from playing Nintendo. We had a very close friend of the family that passed when I was very young.
1176000	1181000	I have very few memories of him left, but the ones that I do have are of me and him playing Nintendo.
1181000	1186000	Dark Tetsuya said, yeah, my uncle passed away last year, and NES Zelda was the first big game him and I played together.
1186000	1189000	So Nintendo's been a big part of my life ever since then.
1189000	1196000	True says, getting my NES on Christmas Day 25 years ago and playing it with my family is a big memory of mine.
1196000	1198000	Loki?
1198000	1208000	I don't know. I've owned Nintendo consoles ever since the NES, all through the Wii.
1208000	1214000	But, yeah, I remember my first NES was back in 1987, I think.
1214000	1218000	I remember all my friends had one, but I didn't have one yet.
1218000	1222000	So we would always go over to their house and play games and stuff.
1222000	1228000	And then one day, I don't even remember, there was no occasion to it other than just one day,
1228000	1233000	my dad had set it up in my room or something like that, and Zelda was running it on.
1233000	1238000	I was like, oh, sweet! So it was like Zelda, and it was like Bubble Bubble and Breakthrough.
1238000	1242000	It was like three random games. I'm sure they got it used somewhere or something.
1242000	1248000	But that's what they bought it on. Which is funny, because my dad, he says he's not a gamer yet.
1248000	1256000	He had a ColecoVision with like 70-some games, so yeah, that doesn't really jive with what you're saying there.
1256000	1259000	Could just be a collector.
1259000	1263000	No, no. He used to play them too. I mean, come on.
1263000	1269000	So yeah, I've had pretty much everything, except for the Game Boy. I never really got into the Game Boy, I don't know.
1269000	1272000	But I had everything else.
1272000	1279000	I don't know. I mean, as far as actual HAL games, I can't remember. I mean, I remember playing Adventures of Lolo.
1279000	1285000	I just don't remember exactly which games they did that I would have played. I played pretty much everything.
1285000	1293000	I mean, we used to go rent shit all the time. That was what you did. So I probably played a little bit of everything.
1293000	1303000	I don't know. But definitely, yeah. I mean, it probably got me into games a lot more than I was originally.
1303000	1316000	Definitely had the interest of games ever since my childhood, and I'm sure Nintendo only helped with that since I've been playing their games for most of my life.
1316000	1320000	So yeah, I can definitely see they have a big influence.
1321000	1330000	I'm just thumbing through Twitter here, which sometimes a little bit of the whole groupthink and unverified things take over on Twitter a little bit.
1330000	1336000	But some of the things that are jumping out at me that I think are worth repeating. There's a quote here attributed to Iwata.
1336000	1343000	On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer.
1343000	1349000	Which certainly would speak to a lot of the ways that he conducted himself and made decisions.
1349000	1357000	Another user, and I'm not reading who said that. I'm just reading my personal timeline right now, so I don't want to call out people.
1357000	1366000	But I'm seeing these tweets that Satoru Iwata's last public message was an apology to everyone who was let down by Nintendo's E3 digital event.
1366000	1368000	I can't. I can't.
1370000	1378000	Another tweet about the pay cut thing. The fact that his last essentially big game is going to be Mario Maker.
1378000	1385000	He's leaving with Mario Maker. We can create our own games and make our own dreams come true like he did.
1385000	1396000	That's a really powerful footnote there. The fact that Mario Maker, it's like now we created these games and now you're going to create these games.
1396000	1404000	Nintendo. Certainly, the type of gaming that we have in Mario Maker, we've seen that.
1404000	1411000	Not even just a little big planet, but since the Commodore 64 was brought up, we had pinball construction set.
1411000	1423000	Game making has always been some type of category of games, but the fact that it is Nintendo and this type of a franchise that people are going to be able to have a canvas and go crazy with.
1423000	1426000	People in Little Big Planet just want to make Mario games anyways.
1426000	1434000	Isn't that the truth? Isn't that the truth? Because we always have the stories about World 1-1 is the big thing that is made.
1434000	1443000	Anyway, also coming through the wire, we're hearing that Miyamoto, and I don't have this verified yet, but I wouldn't doubt it.
1443000	1451000	Shigeru Miyamoto has been named the temporary president while I assume a long-term plan is figured out.
1451000	1455000	And someone get that guy a checkup because we can't...
1455000	1460000	Put him in a bubble. These people must be protected and treasured.
1460000	1462000	Give that guy some Vitamin C or something.
1462000	1470000	Well, as much as we might be saying this a little bit tongue-in-cheek, Miyamoto's been working very hard already.
1470000	1480000	Because when the Wii U's been struggling a little bit, who did they turn to to come up with ideas on how this gamepad is going to really work with this system?
1480000	1484000	That's all been Miyamoto. So you know that guy's been working overtime as it is.
1485000	1496000	And now the fact that he's going to get called on to essentially run the company for a few months while they figure out what they're going to do, that guy's not going to get any sleep for a while.
1496000	1506000	And I'm sure him and Iwata were very, very close. Again, I'm sure it's not to keep going back to Apple, but it's something that's very fresh in my mind.
1506000	1513000	I know Tim Cook and Steve Jobs were close too, and Steve said as he was passing, I want Tim to take over the company.
1513000	1521000	Yeah, well it sounds to me that I'm sure they probably have had a contingency plan in place. I mean, I'm sure this isn't sudden news for them.
1521000	1526000	They probably knew about it, it just wasn't something that they were sharing with the world.
1528000	1531000	Some other comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1531000	1538000	Pao says, even Hideki Kamiya took a break from fighting trolls on social media and tweeted, in my heart, forever.
1538000	1543000	Which is interesting because we have a story on that. It's coming up a little later in the show.
1543000	1547000	Tigerclaw says, you think Reggie could be promoted to president for Nintendo?
1547000	1550000	DungeonBuster says, as cool as Reggie is, probably not.
1550000	1557000	Yeah, I don't see Reggie taking over the entire Nintendo, especially with Nintendo being a Japanese company.
1557000	1562000	I just kind of think they're going to probably end up promoting from the Japanese end of things.
1562000	1569000	But I wouldn't be surprised at all if Reggie is given more and more responsibilities over the American arm of things, if he wants that.
1569000	1578000	Or there might be some other people too. There's probably some other executives yet to come from this whole thing.
1578000	1581000	So, gosh, I don't even know what else to say.
1582000	1593000	It's surprising, but I'm having this moment of, just candidly, since we are live and I tend to talk as I think when we're live.
1593000	1605000	I'm just having this moment of like, holy shit, we're all getting older because here's the people that created the games we played as kids getting older.
1605000	1613000	And God, Iwata wasn't even really that old. 55 is not old, I'm sorry.
1613000	1620000	He should have been able to retire and travel around the world on a yacht when he was 65.
1620000	1631000	We have stories every month, it seems, about some great who has passed on. It's just a lot to handle.
1632000	1637000	And I'm thinking about, speaking of like, gaming's greats and so forth.
1637000	1644000	You know, next weekend here in California, Dark Soccer and I were talking earlier this week about California Extreme is happening this weekend.
1644000	1649000	Which is a great kind of way to celebrate the arcade, the past, and gaming.
1649000	1654000	And they get, because it's in the Bay Area, they get a lot of people from the Bay that used to be involved.
1654000	1659000	Like, I know they've got, what, the Qbert creator is supposed to be there, some of the pinball dudes, right?
1659000	1668000	A lot of folks are going to be there, but I can't help but think, you know, this news is going to have a big cloud over that in a way, I think.
1668000	1672000	As would be expected, so...
1672000	1678000	Anyway, let's see, going to chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
1678000	1688000	Zappi is saying that the press release says that Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda, who's the general manager of Nintendo and co-creator of Punch Out,
1688000	1693000	so another one that came up from the early days, are actually running the company currently.
1693000	1696000	So it sounds like there's more than one, so that's good.
1696000	1702000	And it's pretty possible that they've already been running the company for a while now.
1702000	1710000	If Iwata hadn't just been in that E3 Direct, I would almost...
1711000	1720000	Again, I think that's where this is different from the Steve Jobs situation, because Steve Jobs, he was out on medical leave for like two years at one point while Tim Cook was running the company.
1720000	1733000	But unfortunately, and I've seen another tweet on my timeline about how does it feel to be a Miyamoto and get that call that's like, this just happened, you know?
1733000	1738000	And I think in some ways, though, they were probably a little more prepared for this than the rest of us were.
1738000	1750000	I mean, there's also the fact that he died yesterday on the 11th, and we're just hearing about it now as it's turning into Monday morning in Japan.
1750000	1755000	So there's time to process news and figure out.
1755000	1764000	So if they had an inkling that something was very, very, very wrong with Iwata and that his bile duct issues were coming back,
1764000	1770000	they have to do what they have to do and set that plan B that's now going into motion right now.
1770000	1776000	So I'm sure they were thinking about this stuff a couple weeks ago, as difficult as it is to talk about.
1776000	1783000	Anyhow, the show goes on. There's a lot going on in the gaming world.
1783000	1787000	I want to make sure we cover the rest of what's going on in gaming news this week.
1787000	1794000	But certainly with that news having broke just an hour before we went live tonight, we have to, have to say something about it.
1794000	1796000	I'm sure there's going to be much more to come in this week.
1796000	1803000	You know, as people rightfully so everywhere will be doing their tributes to Iwata.
1803000	1808000	And I would even fully expect you'll see something from Sony and Microsoft even.
1808000	1813000	I mean, because they're not, I mean, what's the way to phrase this?
1814000	1816000	They're all business friendly people.
1816000	1823000	You see Sony congratulating Microsoft and Microsoft, you know, you see all those tweets and things, you know, there's that friendly business.
1823000	1828000	Nintendo's been around as far as in the gaming industry, been around a lot longer than Sony and Nintendo,
1828000	1834000	and a lot of them have to kind of attribute some of them being in that industry because of Nintendo.
1834000	1840000	We just visited last week a piece of gaming history where Sony and Nintendo were getting into it together at a point, right?
1840000	1842000	It was just dug up out of the trash this week.
1842000	1851000	So anyway, it's going to be, it's going to be a very somber week with a lot of memorial and I just paying tribute, I'm sure.
1851000	1860000	Anyhow, we're going to keep on, we put the show together usually in the afternoons on Sundays about two, three o'clock.
1860000	1862000	We usually know what we're going to be talking about for the day.
1862000	1866000	Just a fun little behind the scenes fact about the time you see the Fugu question of the week go up.
1866000	1871000	That means we're currently positioning, you know, what stories we're going to talk about tonight, what's going to go where.
1871000	1874000	So we're going to move forward with everything that we had planned to talk about tonight.
1874000	1877000	But certainly I'm sure a lot more of you want to talk about this.
1877000	1879000	We will open the Skype line later.
1879000	1882000	1877 Game OLR username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
1882000	1885000	I'm going to continue to read comments throughout chat and so forth.
1885000	1890000	But for now, we will move on with what's going on in the gaming world.
1890000	1892000	We always start off each show with how is your gaming week?
1892000	1895000	So let's talk about the video games that you've been playing this week.
1895000	1899000	Dark Sakura, you told me before the show you've had a pretty, pretty fruitful gaming week, right?
1899000	1905000	Yes. We went to Coin Op last night, which is a classic arcade and bar.
1905000	1906000	I haven't been there yet.
1906000	1908000	It's my second time going. It was pretty fun.
1908000	1912000	Those are making a resurgence all over. It seems like a lot of big towns are getting those.
1912000	1916000	Well, this is the place that used to be Maryland's downtown.
1916000	1919000	So for Sacramento folks, they know where it is.
1919000	1923000	Anyway, one of Dan's friends owns most of the machines there.
1923000	1930000	So he was actually there shopping out the Wizard of Oz pinball table that they have there.
1930000	1938000	I played SVC Chaos, which now I remember why I don't play SVC Chaos because it's not very good of a game.
1938000	1944000	I played Marvel vs. Capcom. Dan was playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
1944000	1949000	I played some Final Fight. I played something else.
1949000	1953000	I actually played Theater of Magic. They have a Theater of Magic there.
1953000	1954000	Oh, get out. I love that table.
1954000	1956000	They have a six-player X-Men.
1956000	1959000	Nice. We need to go on a date.
1959000	1963000	Yay, date. They had a drink there that was amazing.
1963000	1969000	We'll bring Loki. It'll be a triple date if we can get Loki away from everything else.
1969000	1981000	They had a drink there called the 91 Unleaded that's basically coffee, like cold brew coffee, cinnamon, rum, and walnut bitters.
1981000	1984000	It was pretty bitter. It was great. I liked it.
1984000	1990000	Anyway, they also have the shot called the Cold War Kid that's actually pretty good too.
1991000	1999000	And then they had Giant Jenga, which I recorded the last ten minutes of it and I might be convinced to put it up on my Facebook.
1999000	2000000	Wait, what's Giant Jenga?
2000000	2005000	It's basically Jenga made out of big bricks, so it's like, yay tall.
2005000	2006000	But it's on a stand.
2006000	2007000	It's an arcade game?
2007000	2009000	No, no, no, no. It's Jenga.
2009000	2012000	Oh, okay. They just have board games that you can play there too?
2012000	2016000	They have three different sets of Giant Jenga.
2016000	2017000	Oh, okay.
2017000	2019000	And then they were playing Kinect 4 outside.
2019000	2023000	I was confused. I thought like Jenga was like some weird- I'm like, how do people not steal the pieces?
2023000	2025000	So they have like a ladder or something that you go on?
2025000	2032000	No, it doesn't get that high. Like maybe it was like my height and I'm 5'2". And it's on a table.
2032000	2033000	Okay.
2033000	2034000	A little table.
2034000	2035000	Okay.
2035000	2036000	That's like a perfect stand to play.
2036000	2037000	How big are these pieces?
2037000	2038000	Oh, that's not that big.
2038000	2039000	I need to-
2039000	2043000	I was like thinking like the size of his coffee table or something like that.
2043000	2048000	Where can you buy Giant Jenga? Because you know Jenga became a huge inside joke at the last GamerX?
2048000	2049000	Yeah.
2049000	2053000	With some of the other podcast buddies of mine. So I need to find Giant Jenga and bring it to the next one.
2053000	2056000	I think that these were basically just custom-made blocks.
2056000	2057000	Oh, okay. Interesting.
2057000	2062000	Yeah. Because I mean really if you've got the dimensions of regular Jenga blocks, it's not too hard.
2062000	2065000	Times two. Times two.
2065000	2071000	Well, it's funny because YYR in chat says Giant Jenga is literally just Jenga with an eight times mod on the block.
2071000	2072000	Pretty much.
2072000	2074000	Pretty much. That's about accurate.
2074000	2076000	We're just going to scale it to 400 percent.
2076000	2080000	But it was pretty, pretty fun.
2080000	2081000	Nice.
2081000	2090000	And then I've played Final Fantasy XIV because thanks to Shane, we just said fuck it on getting all the tomes for my gear.
2090000	2097000	And we just bought gear because I happened to check my bank and I had like 400,000 gold or gil or whatever.
2097000	2099000	So I'm like shopping trip.
2099000	2102000	And so now I'm back on story progression, which actually is funny.
2102000	2104000	My gear is better than the gear I'm getting through story.
2104000	2105000	Oh, good.
2105000	2108000	It's funny you get like the rainbow robes of casting and everything.
2108000	2110000	It's got goth black.
2110000	2113000	It's like it's kind of like I look like the goth clown girl.
2113000	2115000	It's rainbow on the inside.
2115000	2117000	It's dark like my soul.
2117000	2127000	I've played Dragon Age Inquisition a little bit because for everyone who mods their PC version, update eight borks all the mods.
2127000	2136000	But there is something out there on the DAI modder Tumblr on how to roll back to version seven where all your mods will work.
2136000	2143000	So they're working on going ahead and trying to get the mods working for version eight for when the next DLC comes out.
2143000	2152000	I also am playing Dragon Age Origins again, which I hadn't played it since a long time ago, I think.
2152000	2156000	And this time I'm actually going for one of the playthroughs that I didn't do before.
2156000	2163000	And it's I have lots of mods in there, but I have like this one mod in there and I can't figure out which one it is.
2163000	2166000	But it basically removes all some of the women's hair.
2166000	2171000	And when you get a back view of them, you can see their eyeballs floating in the back of their head.
2171000	2173000	And it's just really creepy.
2173000	2177000	And then some people have like plastic skin looking from one of my mods going wrong.
2177000	2182000	I can't figure out what the hell which mod it is because I tried to do one and then all of a sudden my character didn't have any hair.
2182000	2184000	Clearly the Joan Rivers mod.
2184000	2186000	Yeah.
2186000	2191000	But at any rate, that's what I have been. Oh, yeah.
2191000	2195000	And we got Puyo Puyo Tetris.
2195000	2200000	And I had to re-teach myself how to read very stylized Japanese again.
2200000	2205000	And Dan kept going to this one. He's like, this has got to be versus. It looks like versus.
2205000	2211000	Dan, it says Hitori. That means alone. One person.
2211000	2216000	So we finally figured out how to get like, because you have like a versus computer mode.
2216000	2222000	Like you have you have adventure mode. Then you have versus the versus computer is Hitori mode.
2222000	2229000	And then you've got like two player mode. So it sucks if you're playing the Tetris pieces.
2229000	2231000	You need to bring that over. I want to check it out.
2231000	2237000	Sounds cute. It's pretty fun. It's so funny you're yawning because break man in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2237000	2241000	Did Jamie have time to do anything else this week? Has she had time for sleep?
2241000	2244000	And you've just yawned. Maybe not.
2244000	2249000	I've been really tired anyway just because I've had a lot between work and everything.
2249000	2254000	You know, I actually the sad thing is that I am behind on my writing.
2254000	2259000	So I need to buckle down and spend a couple of lunch breaks on my story.
2259000	2265000	So gotcha. Yeah. All right. Let's move over to Loki. How was your gaming week this week?
2265000	2276000	I worked on my games and I say games because I was working on trying to prototype something so that I could do a game jam this coming weekend.
2276000	2284000	But they ain't going to happen. The reason it's not going to happen is because I can't mentally focus myself long enough with all the you know,
2284000	2288000	trying to dodge kids and stuff for 72 hour game jam that takes place on the weekend.
2288000	2294000	There's no goddamn way I'm going to be able to crank out a game in like 10 hours.
2294000	2302000	That's just not going to happen. So I'm still going to probably work on whatever that prototype was.
2302000	2311000	I mean, it's a neat idea. It's a cross between like Mega Man and Mickey Fighters, if you remember that.
2311000	2322000	So basically it's a 2D shmup game where when you blow up enemies, they kind of crash down out of the sky and then they stick to you.
2322000	2325000	And then when you're firing, they fire their bullets as well.
2325000	2331000	And it just eventually you become this giant mass of bullets and shit that you're fighting other things with.
2331000	2337000	But along with that, you'll be able to kind of like absorb the enemies into like do like charge up a meter to do different special attacks and stuff.
2338000	2345000	So that was kind of what I did. And I've got like, I've got the 2D portion, like the jumping and moving stuff done.
2345000	2350000	I just was trying to finish the rest of it, but you know, whatever.
2350000	2354000	But yeah, I got to go back to work on my game. I was just kind of mixing up a bit.
2354000	2360000	See, the reason why is I was trying to, I would have had more time to work on that prototype, but I was trying to get Unity 5 to work.
2360000	2368000	Unity 5 has this weird bug on my computer for whatever reason that whenever I click on something to change the color of a texture, it crashes.
2368000	2372000	And it pissed me off and I just spent way too long trying to fix that.
2372000	2375000	Alright, so aside from programming stuff, I actually did play games.
2375000	2382000	I played through almost the entire game of Portal Stories MEL and it was pretty good. I like it.
2382000	2396000	It is a little frustrating at the end because the last boss battle that you have to do involves you carrying a Portal turret around and, or the Sentry turrets around and shooting stuff with it.
2396000	2407000	And you know from carrying stuff around in Portal that if you bang stuff against the wall or something like that, it's hard to navigate while holding something in your hand.
2407000	2414000	And with the turrets, if you bang them against something, they fall out of your hands and when they tip over, they die. So it's really frustrating.
2414000	2427000	And so I played through like the boss part three times. I know what I have to do. It's just that navigating around all this shit that's falling on the ground, you know, my turret clips on a chair or something and all of a sudden it's popped out of my hand.
2427000	2432000	Or I set it down and it tips over because there's momentum from something. So it's really annoying.
2433000	2439000	But the game was fun. I recommend checking it out and playing it. It's free if you have Portal 2, so go download it.
2439000	2451000	The other game I played was Ether One and this is a PlayStation 4 and PC game. I think it was free on PlayStation Plus either this month or last month, relatively recently.
2451000	2462000	And it's an interesting storyline. Once again, it's kind of a little bit like, sort of like Portal but not. I guess it's like a first person puzzle game, if that makes sense.
2462000	2473000	And then so you're kind of, the premise is you're this scientist who's kind of in this machine. Think of it like The Matrix or something like that.
2473000	2479000	You sit in this machine, you kind of go into someone else's memories. Maybe like The Cell. Remember that old 90s movie, The Cell?
2479000	2493000	So, like The Cell, and you're going into this woman's memories to try to cure her dementia. And the way you do that is by kind of unlocking memories that she kind of has hidden away.
2493000	2505000	You know, that she is blocked out because of traumatic events. And so you're trying to restore these memories by kind of going through all of her memories and just discovering, you know, secrets about her and stuff like that.
2505000	2513000	And it's really trippy. It's a pretty fun game. A little bit confusing. It's like what to do in some of the puzzles sometimes. There's a lot to retain.
2514000	2524000	But it's kind of cool as you pick up objects and you can kind of storm in your inventory, like this hub world thing. And I know there's going to be some sort of twist into this.
2524000	2537000	The thing that really bugged me though, it's Unreal 4 but the popping is really terrible. Like stuff pops in about 10 feet in front of you. Just like accessory stuff that's on the ground.
2537000	2550000	But that wasn't so bad. I mean, I was able to overlook that. However, there is a really bad save bug. And so my game crashed. My game crashed. And now when I go to reload that save, it doesn't work.
2550000	2562000	However, I've been reading up on it and apparently it could work, but it may take like five minutes to load your save game. So like, I'm like, ah, you know, I was really getting into the game too.
2562000	2572000	And like, see the thing was I finished the second or third level in it and I was like, okay, I want to go back to the second level and I want to make sure I 100% everything. I wanted to get all this like side stuff.
2572000	2583000	And so when I went to go, you know, transport myself there, it crashed. I was like, seriously? Because I was really getting into it and then it just crashed. And it's like, okay, well now you've just soured it for me.
2584000	2594000	But I don't know. I just wish they would test this stuff a little bit more. You would think that this would be something that they would be able to pick up on. But yeah, definitely worth checking out though.
2594000	2600000	Yeah, there is that save bug thing. So just make backups of your saves. Just try to, you know, back yourself up.
2600000	2612000	I try to do that on RPGs anyway, because I'm always afraid I'm going to do like some, some fuck up where I irreversibly can't go back. It's like anytime I start a dungeon or something, I make like a second save. I do that anyway. It's just a weird OCD habit I have.
2613000	2622000	But yeah, definitely if you, if you try that game, cause there are, I guess they're going to patch it, but um, you know, in the meantime, just go check it out. It's free if you have PlayStation plus.
2622000	2629000	So it was literally one of those things. Like I was looking at my library of games like, I don't know what this is. I'm like, I'm just going to play it. I'm just going to see what it is.
2629000	2641000	And then I went into it. I'm like, cause it was funny when my son was watching, I'm like, I'm going to download this. This is the boring lighthouse game. Cause that's what the icon is just of a lighthouse and you click on it and stuff.
2641000	2650000	And I'm like, okay, I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm going to try it out. And I got really into it. I mean, box art can be deceiving. Exactly. Well, back in the day, there's something about that lighthouse.
2650000	2661000	There's some secret about the layouts cause there's a light, you know, how are we going to have a bio shock thing? You know, there's something with the lighthouse here. Is this, is this another realm of bio shock?
2662000	2672000	Another dimension. Some comments from our chat. Akuma JP says, sounds like stalker, the game Tron edition. Dungeon Buster says, whoa, stalker and Tron in the same game. Maybe I should try that.
2672000	2688000	It's, it's really, it's seriously, it's a pretty good game. I would definitely check it out. And it's PlayStation plus. There's really no reason not to. Exactly. It's a little creepy. Like there's like, especially when you're going into the memory stuff, like there's one part cause I think the woman that you're in the memories of kind of knows that you're in there.
2688000	2697000	Is it a scary game or no? It's not scary at all. Okay. It's just like, there's no, is it like psychologically unsettling at all? You know how some scares can be very disturbing?
2697000	2711000	There's nothing violent or anything. It's just a puzzle game. Oh, I think those are the best though. Like, if you can be scary without having to resort to gore, I think that is like, well, yeah, it's not, not like scary.
2711000	2724000	Like it's not supposed to be a horror game or anything. It's, but like there's one part, like the first level you go to is like in a mine and you find out that there's this tragedy where like everybody died and you're kind of trying to figure out why.
2724000	2735000	And, and I, and like I said, I've been kind of skimming a lot cause there's a ton of shit, like all these notes that people leave that you can read. And like, I just, I couldn't come, you know, comprehend all of it.
2736000	2747000	This sounds like something Jamie should be on. I don't know. I feel like this is a Jamie game. Crazy person or something basically is cutting all their, their, um, ventilation pipes and basically flooded it full of something.
2747000	2762000	Jamie, you did that last week. Jamie, you like fucked up things. I think I'm just messing with you, but no, you know, like you like, like the five nights of Freddy's and all those like, you know, kind of psychological scare type of game.
2762000	2772000	But it's like on someone I'll in like Britain or something like that. And it also sounds like the ring a little bit cause didn't the ring again. It there's like someone, it's like some aisle in like Britain or something.
2772000	2786000	I'm not really sure what it is because I don't go at it to make you have stuff. Haven't played yet because I mean apparently Alexander Graham Bell plays a part of it, so I'm not really sure what that's all about, but you know, I don't know.
2786000	2797000	All right. Um, check it out though. It's, it's free. If you have PlayStation Plus, hopefully you're like me, you just download everything or market to download because that's what I do. Um, so definitely worth checking out.
2797000	2802000	All right. Breakman says this game comes with a small bag of LSD. Uh, okay.
2802000	2810000	To register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at vog network.com use the passphrase mother.
2810000	2818000	So my gaming week, I'll keep it short because honestly, pretty much all of my gaming time honestly has been on final fantasy 14 heavens word.
2818000	2825000	I know again 14, but that's how MMOs are, but I really buckled down and pushed myself to finish the story this week.
2825000	2830000	So I got my astrology and all the way to level 60 and finish the story. Like got the credits in the story.
2830000	2842000	Obviously I will not spoil anything. I'm not going to be a jerk. I'm just going to say that I was really, really impressed with some of the cinematics in the final chapter of the game.
2842000	2853000	I don't know how else to say minute, but probably the final chapter of that expansion. I was, I was very impressed. One scene in particular, I'm trying to think how to describe this for people that have seen it, but without being spoilery.
2854000	2863000	I will say it is when you are taking your airship to the new zone for the first time. That's that spoiler free, right?
2863000	2873000	Uh, so that scene, I was like just the art direction in that scene, the way it was presented. I mean, and just an Epic moment in the game.
2873000	2881000	I like it was a jaw hit floor kind of moment. I was like, Holy shit, this game is on fire. And like, it's not, it's not anything I've experienced in an MMO.
2881000	2891000	And I went on a whole little Twitter rant after that. Um, and I was just like, you guys, and I, I do believe this and I know a lot of you think I'm a fan boy for Final Fantasy 14.
2891000	2898000	And well, yeah, I guess I probably am, but I think for good reason, because I really think this is the strongest Final Fantasy game since six. I think it's that good.
2899000	2914000	I mean, I know MMOs are a weird place and it's got the monthly fee and yada yada, but if you can tolerate all that, I think that the story really is just the way it weaves everything in Final Fantasy lore together.
2914000	2926000	Like there's, again, I don't want to spoil, but there's references that throw back to old Final Fantasy games that will like have you like flappy hands, like, you know, like maybe not for Loki, but maybe for me, definitely like,
2926000	2929000	I just, I couldn't get into the Lord 14. That was one of the problems.
2929000	2932000	Well, it wasn't, well, 1.0 was garbage anyway.
2932000	2937000	It wasn't 1.0 was during the beta. I still can't, like it's just too much to follow.
2937000	2947000	I'm not, I'm not going to lie. You have to be able to get up to about level 35 before it starts getting really good. And you know, for, for better or for worse, you know, that is one of the drawbacks.
2947000	2959000	If you can tolerate it that long, um, I think you get rewarded, but I understand, you know, it's still an MMO, which is going to turn some people off at the end of the day, but I just wow the story.
2959000	2964000	To be fair, I couldn't get into the lore in 11 either, but you know, at least it was fun.
2964000	2965000	11 was really hard.
2965000	2975000	Yeah. So, uh, some folks in chat yelling at me, Brakeman says, there's an airship in the game. You've spoiled it for me. And Brakeman says, an airship in a Final Fantasy game? How dare they?
2975000	2977000	And guess what? There's a CID too.
2977000	2979000	And you know what? There's a chocobo.
2982000	2986000	So there's always a CID, there's always a chocobo and there's always an airship.
2986000	2988000	And my favorite people, the little shits.
2990000	2992000	Is that, is that Lalafell translated?
2992000	2996000	No, that's the cabbage people. The, the silfs.
2996000	2997000	Oh, the silfs.
2997000	2998000	As I call them, the little shits.
2998000	3000000	Yes, yes. Love it.
3000000	3002000	And then the desert lizard hobos.
3002000	3009000	Anyway, well you, you're just going to be surprised at how much stuff you're going to be like, that, oh my God, that's a, that's, I saw that in Final Fantasy.
3009000	3013000	You know, there's just a lot of that. Anyway, uh, that's it. I'll stop fangirling and all that.
3013000	3019000	Um, but I will say, uh, it also played a little bit of Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox One.
3019000	3023000	Cause you know, that's kind of been still, still needing to get my use out of that new toy.
3023000	3025000	So I justify that by trying to check in with that once in a while.
3025000	3031000	Um, and that flash sales, what do they call it on Microsoft's deal of the week?
3031000	3034000	I don't know what the hell it's called, but they got a ton of games discounted right now.
3034000	3039000	So I was picking up Ori and the Blind Forest cause I've had that game recommended to me by multiple people.
3039000	3041000	And there was another one I was going to pick up too.
3041000	3042000	Did you get Sunset Overdrive?
3042000	3044000	I don't think that one's on sale.
3044000	3046000	It's by use. I'm sure it's probably cheap by now.
3046000	3049000	Probably. I do want to get it. I do. I do want to get that.
3049000	3054000	But anyway, now that I finally beat Heavensward, cause like seriously, that took a lot of hours.
3054000	3058000	So is there like, is there much of like an end game after that?
3058000	3064000	Well, um, quickly, I will say there are some dungeons still that you run to get better, improved gear.
3064000	3069000	And then they just opened up last week. So about two weeks after the expansion went live,
3069000	3074000	they opened up the first raid called Alexander, which is the raid.
3074000	3079000	Which is also, you might recognize that name from Final Fantasy lore, but they've made it so that,
3079000	3083000	and this isn't really a spoiler cause it's publicly on the Final Fantasy site,
3083000	3087000	but Alexander is basically a giant fucking robot that you go inside.
3087000	3090000	And so that's the raid. So the raid just opened up.
3090000	3093000	So for a lot of the end game people, you have that.
3093000	3096000	If you're not into that, they have the EX Primals is what they call right now.
3096000	3099000	You can fight those, Bismarck and Ravana.
3099000	3107000	And then I think the way Final Fantasy usually patches, you'll probably see 3.1, probably in October.
3107000	3109000	And that'll probably bring more story and more dungeons.
3109000	3111000	What, no Ultima weapon or another weapon?
3111000	3116000	That wasn't, Ultima weapon was 2.0, Loki. Catch up.
3116000	3119000	Ultima weapon's been done. We're done with that.
3119000	3124000	I'm sorry. It's the Ultima weapon. It's supposed to be the strongest thing in the game.
3124000	3128000	I would have thought they would have saved that, you know, or made it more powerful.
3128000	3132000	If you're able to defeat it at the beginning of the game, I mean, like that's kind of lame.
3132000	3136000	By the way, Rob, I need you to fight Ultras with me now.
3136000	3140000	I love that fight. I can. Cause it actually plays the Final Fantasy 6 battle music.
3140000	3142000	Cause I want to do the chicken thing.
3142000	3143000	It's fun.
3143000	3146000	The chicken thing was Gilgamesh, which I've done.
3146000	3148000	But I want to do the, I want to do the Ultras battle now.
3148000	3149000	Cause I can do it.
3149000	3152000	Alright, we got to move on with more show, but yes, certainly.
3152000	3159000	Let's see, going to a chat room. Dungeon Buster says, or sorry, AkumaJP says Ultima is so last gen.
3159000	3162000	YYR says it's all about Ultima 360 now.
3162000	3168000	And then YYR says Sunset Overdrive is on sale on Amazon right now for 40 bucks.
3168000	3170000	Oh no, 30 bucks? 30 bucks?
3170000	3172000	Eh, that's still too expensive.
3172000	3173000	Nah.
3173000	3174000	$19.99.
3174000	3177000	I expect that'll be the normal price soon. Wow, okay. I didn't know that. I'll have to go check that out.
3177000	3178000	I bet it's cheaper used.
3179000	3180000	Alright, we'll see, we'll see.
3180000	3185000	Alright, let's get into the other things that have been going on in gaming this week.
3185000	3186000	Oh, quick housekeeping.
3186000	3191000	I don't have a lot except for the fact that I have booked travel to Dragon Con.
3191000	3194000	And I know Bobby's going to. Travis Donovan.
3194000	3197000	I think Jon from Critical Myth is there this year too.
3197000	3201000	I can't remember who all from the network is 100% confirmed for Dragon Con.
3201000	3205000	I don't have anything to say about panels or anything like that yet.
3205000	3206000	We don't know.
3206000	3209000	But we'll be there and we'll be supporting all of that.
3209000	3214000	So if you're going to be in the Atlanta area Labor Day weekend, come on down to Dragon Con.
3214000	3215000	I love that show.
3215000	3216000	We're going to have a great time.
3216000	3217000	Oh, I can say this.
3217000	3222000	I will be doing my first major cosplay at Dragon Con.
3222000	3223000	I will.
3223000	3226000	I'm going to be doing serious cosplay.
3226000	3229000	Which, you know, I have, I've done like a little bit.
3229000	3233000	Like Ron Malone me a costume one time, but I don't, like that was different.
3233000	3235000	This is like, no, I'm doing this me.
3235000	3238000	It's going to be my costume, except I will say this disclaimer.
3238000	3241000	I am paying a girl locally to do it.
3241000	3245000	She's a, but I think I kind of feel like that's, it's not like I'm going to Party City and buying a costume in a bag.
3245000	3250000	Like, you know, she's a hardworking, independent, seamstress type of thing.
3250000	3252000	She did a lot of the costumes for Rocky Horror.
3252000	3256000	They're between shows right now, so she could use the extra funds.
3256000	3257000	So I was like, okay, hey, come on.
3257000	3258000	I got an idea for you.
3258000	3261000	I really want to do this cosplay, but I'm not, I don't know how to sew.
3261000	3263000	Or if I did, it would look like a damn mess.
3263000	3267000	Well, I appreciate you biting the bullet and dressing up as Tingle this year, so.
3267000	3270000	Maybe, maybe. I didn't say what I'm doing.
3270000	3272000	So maybe, you never know.
3272000	3273000	I don't know.
3273000	3277000	Dark Sakura, is that, am I violating cosplay rules if I, if I pay somebody else to do it?
3277000	3278000	No.
3278000	3279000	Okay, just making sure.
3279000	3280000	I paid somebody else to sew mine.
3280000	3281000	Okay, good.
3281000	3288000	I made, now, however, I made all my props, styled my wig, and made, yeah, I actually did make all my props and style my wig.
3288000	3290000	It's just, I can't sew for beans.
3290000	3291000	Yeah.
3291000	3295000	And the one that I actually sewed from beginning to end, I had Evan helping me.
3295000	3297000	Well, I'm going to take care of the camo pants.
3297000	3299000	Oh, don't want to say too much.
3299000	3300000	I knew it.
3300000	3301000	All right.
3301000	3302000	I knew it.
3302000	3304000	Well, combat Tingle will be very interesting.
3304000	3306000	So would it be that I've contributed to this costume?
3306000	3307000	Yes, you have.
3307000	3308000	Uh-huh.
3308000	3309000	All right.
3309000	3315000	So Fifth Dream in chat says, honestly, if you can't figure it out by the time Dragon Con rolls around, I can't help you.
3315000	3316000	Like, I just can't.
3316000	3318000	Anyway, why, uh, sorry.
3318000	3321000	Fifth Dream in chat says, paying a girl locally to do it.
3321000	3323000	This is prostitution, Rob.
3323000	3325000	Get your mind out of the gutter.
3325000	3326000	It's prostitution.
3326000	3335000	Yeah, prostitution.
3335000	3336000	It's puns.
3336000	3337000	That's why my wife loves me.
3337000	3339000	Only, that's why we all love you, Loki.
3339000	3346000	Maybe not in the same way your wife does, but only you can get us all to laugh on a week that's been kind of difficult.
3346000	3349000	Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.
3349000	3352000	There's been a lot of other stuff going on in the week leading up to the show.
3352000	3357000	I brought up the whole Dragon Con thing because we will not be here live Labor Day weekend.
3357000	3358000	That was the whole reason I brought that up.
3358000	3364000	We will not be here live Labor Day weekend, which is September, fuck, I forgot the day.
3364000	3368000	I think it's like September 8th because it's kind of late in the year this year.
3368000	3370000	Anyway, we won't be here that week.
3370000	3372000	Loki, let's get into some news.
3372000	3380000	Alright, so of course, as everyone is well aware, the PC version of Batman Arkham Knight has been pulled.
3380000	3390000	And Warner Brothers basically apologizing and committing themselves to quality.
3390000	3398000	Basically, they're going back and looking at what they can do better to help make sure that this type of thing doesn't happen again.
3398000	3408000	And they're quoted as saying, again, we would like to apologize to the fans and let you know they were taking full responsibility for releasing a product that did not meet our quality standards.
3408000	3411000	Which is why we suspended sales of the game.
3412000	3421000	As soon as we understood the issues, we can assure you that because of this latest launch, we are modifying the internal review process for all of our games.
3421000	3428000	For those who are waiting for the updated version of the game on PC, please know that we are working on this every day.
3428000	3435000	For the players who are continuing to play Batman Arkham Knight on PC, fixes are continually being made to the game.
3435000	3440000	And we await your final, as we wait for the final updated version.
3440000	3445000	And basically they're saying, you know, this is going to be coming out probably in the fall.
3445000	3457000	With that, our continued focus on getting the right PC fixes in place for the main game has had an impact on the development of all DLC content for the PC version of the game.
3457000	3466000	This means Batman Arkham Knight Batgirl, a matter of family DLC, will not be available on July 14th for those who are currently playing the PC version of the game.
3466000	3473000	We apologize for the delay and only want to make sure that any content we offer is up to the standards that PC players expect.
3473000	3483000	And they're saying Batman Arkham Knight will be available on SteamOS, Linux, and Mac in fall of 2015 as well.
3484000	3490000	Huh. So, do you think at this point anybody's going to care by the time they fix it?
3490000	3503000	You know, I think a lot of people probably won't care, and I'm sure some people still want to play it, but a lot of people by that time, there's going to be a lot of other games that have come out.
3503000	3508000	Maybe we'll just kind of put Batman Arkham Knight on the back burner until a game of the year version comes out.
3508000	3509000	Yeah.
3509000	3510000	I can see that happening.
3510000	3517000	Or, you know, by the time that it comes out, maybe a Steam sale and get that dirt cheap or something.
3517000	3524000	I just think that, and it's fine, you know, so their sales suffer a little bit, it's a good lesson to learn then.
3524000	3530000	Maybe they won't try this shit again, you know, so I'm hoping that it does set a good example.
3530000	3533000	And it sounds like that they're taking the right precautions.
3533000	3536000	They're at least saying stuff like that they're taking the right precautions.
3537000	3544000	So, let's hope that this is something that they actually learned a lesson from, and we don't see a repeat of this in the future.
3544000	3552000	Then again, there are some companies that say this kind of shit all the time, and the next release that comes out is the same old shit again, so we'll see.
3553000	3561000	Alright, we'll see. Are we all going to be quick to forgive WB Games, or do you think PC owners will...
3561000	3566000	Oh, I don't think we should be quick to forgive them. I mean, let them prove themselves.
3566000	3568000	Why should we forgive them for this shit?
3568000	3575000	It's good that they did what they should have been doing, and being responsible and saying, ah, it was crap, we shouldn't have released it, but you did.
3575000	3582000	You chose to release it, you knew the state it was in, you just took a gamble on it, and unfortunately people, you know, didn't like it.
3582000	3584000	And now they have a way to get their money back.
3585000	3587000	Make it worth the wait, right?
3587000	3588000	Exactly.
3588000	3598000	Alright, well, Dragon Quest, you know, Dragon Quest, they're getting those localized versions of 7 and 8, I'm sorry, they're not localized, that's a problem.
3598000	3604000	They're getting the versions of 7 and 8 over in Japan, but they're not being localized over here, at least not yet.
3604000	3607000	And many people are asking for that to happen.
3607000	3613000	Well, that could all hinge on the success of Dragon Quest Heroes.
3614000	3628000	That's right, the executive producer Yumiaki was interviewed this week and mentioned that if sales for Dragon Quest Heroes actually meet expectations, then they will be more confident in releasing more Dragon Quest titles in North America.
3628000	3636000	This is on the heels of when Dragon Quest producer Yuji Horii said that the Nintendo 3DS Dragon Quest titles are coming to France.
3636000	3640000	So, certainly, you know, that means it's being moved to at least another title.
3640000	3645000	Further comments from Yumiaki who says, we want to get them out here, we really do.
3645000	3650000	The Dragon Quest games are very text-heavy, so the time and the cost it takes to localize these and do well is quite something.
3650000	3655000	Business-wise, we have to think quite hard whether we'll make that money back from localizing to North America.
3655000	3661000	It's always been a difficult decision, but the more you tell us, the louder the voices, the more likely we are to do it.
3661000	3667000	Uh-oh, when he says the louder the voices, he's just inviting people to do a change.org petition, people.
3668000	3671000	That's what he wants. Go now.
3671000	3673000	I'm...
3673000	3675000	Well, you alright?
3675000	3679000	No, it's just stupid. I mean, I understand the point, but I've heard this before.
3679000	3686000	Hello, Konami. Let's support your games that come out, even if they weren't that great, because we want more Dance Dance Revolution games out.
3686000	3691000	And in the end, they'll decide whether they want to fucking do it or not, regardless of sales.
3692000	3699000	It could meet its expectations, but, oh, it only met our expectations. It didn't sell great.
3699000	3702000	I mean, it just sold what we thought it would sell.
3702000	3709000	You know what'll end up happening is if they just do something like this, that they'll just make it GameStop exclusive or something like that.
3709000	3716000	And, you know, it just won't come out every, you know, there'll be limited channels you can purchase that at.
3717000	3724000	I don't know. I just don't think that's gonna matter that much. But, hey, you know what? Maybe Heroes is gonna be a good game? Check it out.
3724000	3729000	Yeah, I'll probably still check the game out anyway, because I just like a lot of Dragon Quest games anyway.
3729000	3732000	Well, Heroes is supposed to be a little bit different, though, because it's like...
3732000	3739000	Yeah, I know it's not gonna be like the others, but, you know, neither was Type 0. So, anyway.
3739000	3742000	Now, speaking of Dragon Quest games that are very different.
3742000	3753000	In Famitsu magazine, which obviously is huge over in Japan, Square Enix did a new announcement in Famitsu that there is a new Dragon Quest game coming for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Vita.
3753000	3763000	It's called Dragon Quest Builders. Now, here's the thing. You look at these screenshots of Dragon Quest Builders, that's fucking Minecraft with Dragon Quest characters.
3763000	3770000	So, and it's called Builders. That's all we know. We don't know anything else at this time.
3770000	3778000	It wouldn't be really surprising, though, considering, you know, everybody wants a piece of Minecraft in one way or the other.
3778000	3786000	We're seeing, you know, the LEGO game has the whole EverQuest has gone towards a Minecraft-esque sort of direction.
3786000	3792000	So, I'm not totally surprised to see this. And I don't mind, as long as it's done well.
3792000	3800000	I know, like, I seriously thought, you know, a LEGO game that was basically Minecraft would have been amazing, because everybody's like, you know, oh, Minecraft is basically like a LEGO game.
3800000	3801000	Right.
3801000	3812000	And then I played it, I'm like, wow, this is not very good. So, it's like, I'd rather play Minecraft, actually, now that I had to deal with that.
3813000	3823000	So, I'm curious for more information. That's all we know right now. We don't have a lot on this otherwise, but more as we hear about it.
3823000	3830000	Probably Tokyo Game Show, I'd imagine, is where this is going to be having more information at.
3830000	3842000	We're going to get over to DarkSakura, but I want to just jump in here, because Zappi in chat, kind of following up with something we were talking about earlier with the news of Iwata's passing.
3842000	3855000	I had mentioned, wait to see, because, you know, even Sony and Microsoft will probably do something, and apparently PlayStation account just put a tweet that says, thank you for everything, Mr. Iwata.
3855000	3857000	So, that's on the official PlayStation account there.
3857000	3868000	And that will probably be the first of many, many, many gaming remembrances and so forth to come on throughout the week.
3868000	3873000	So, if we hear more stuff throughout the show, we'll keep you posted.
3873000	3876000	In the meantime, back to the rest of the news from the week. DarkSakura.
3877000	3884000	Well, this is something I've been keeping on top of. While I'm not playing on console, I am very much into Dragon Age Inquisition.
3884000	3894000	And I have, actually my best friend plays on the Xbox 360, which the version is definitely scaled down.
3894000	3904000	But now BioWare has put out a word saying that all future DLC for Dragon Age Inquisition is only going to be on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.
3904000	3911000	There is a save importer that's going to let you bring your stuff over, which I'll be talking about later.
3911000	3922000	But, pretty much, it's just that having to develop four or five different machines and two of them being, you know, ten years old or so.
3922000	3927000	It's just not really worthwhile anymore. The copies haven't sold as well as they had hoped.
3927000	3932000	So, basically, continuing support is only going to be for the current gen systems.
3932000	3939000	Which, honestly, I was actually surprised that they released them on PS3 and Xbox 360.
3939000	3944000	Yeah, I think a lot of us were. But, I mean, it was, I guess, kind of that bridge.
3944000	3951000	You know, last year's, I think this holiday you're going to see really not much on 360 and PlayStation 3.
3951000	3954000	But last year was probably still a bridge year in many ways.
3954000	3959000	But now, bridge is closed. Upgrade or get out.
3959000	3968000	Well, and on top of that, though, just having done almost a side-by-side comparison between the 360 version.
3968000	3973000	And I'll go ahead and say the PC version just because, you know, that's what I've been playing.
3973000	3976000	There's a universe of difference between them.
3977000	3982000	Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to think of other games. Like, even Mass Effect.
3982000	3985000	You know, I played it on the 360 and I was satisfied.
3985000	3988000	But then you see it on the PC and you're just like, damn.
3988000	3990000	Especially with, like, the high def text mode.
3990000	3992000	You take Grand Theft Auto V.
3992000	3993000	Oh, yeah.
3993000	3997000	I mean, Grand Theft Auto V looked great on, you know, PS3 and Xbox 360.
3997000	4000000	But then it looked even better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4000000	4003000	And then even better on PC.
4003000	4004000	Mm-hmm.
4004000	4006000	All right, moving on, Loki.
4006000	4015000	So, kind of going back to the story that we were just talking about as far as Warner Brothers, you know, and maybe reevaluating, you know, the quality of their products before they release them.
4015000	4021000	Hey, haven't heard anything about Mortal Kombat X for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4021000	4025000	Those were supposed to be coming out, I believe, in June.
4025000	4030000	But, yeah, right now they're TBA.
4030000	4033000	So, I guess they need more time.
4033000	4040000	And, you know, basically their comment is we don't have any updates right now that we can provide comments on.
4040000	4043000	So, is it even going to happen at this point?
4043000	4044000	I don't know.
4044000	4046000	Like, who would buy it at this point?
4046000	4052000	It would be such a limited audience, I would think, unless they're going to put, like, the Game of the Year edition out on them or something.
4052000	4055000	But then it's like, God, you've got to pack even more stuff.
4055000	4056000	You're going to have a harder time fitting.
4056000	4057000	It could still be okay.
4057000	4065000	I mean, I don't know. There's still a lot of people that still have Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
4065000	4070000	And maybe have jumped into, you know, the new systems.
4070000	4072000	I mean, you don't want to lose out on the audience.
4072000	4076000	Yeah, I mean, I guess there's a potential audience.
4076000	4082000	You know, we have to remember that even though the people that probably listen to this show and certainly host this show,
4082000	4087000	we tend to be more on that cutting edge where we're adopting a lot of the newer consoles faster.
4087000	4090000	But there's a lot of people out there that are like, I can't get a PS4.
4090000	4095000	Exactly. I don't have an Xbox One or Wii U yet. I mean, so, I don't know.
4095000	4099000	There's still a demand for the previous generation, which is more affordable.
4099000	4102000	Because you could probably get a PS3 for, like, 99 bucks right now, right?
4102000	4104000	Oh, probably even less than that.
4104000	4106000	Yeah, I think that you could.
4106000	4110000	I think, like, you can get a refurb 360 for 100 bucks with a few games to run in.
4110000	4112000	So, it's much, much more reasonable.
4112000	4116000	Anyhow, moving on, a completely different note.
4116000	4121000	Hideki Kamiya, his mouth sometimes gets him into trouble.
4121000	4125000	And, Lord knows, he has a lot of interesting things to say on Twitter.
4125000	4130000	Some consider it to be an honor to be blocked by him on Twitter.
4130000	4132000	Because he blocks a lot of people.
4132000	4138000	If you don't know who I'm talking about, he's the guy with Platinum Games and, you know, making a lot of the moves with Bayonet.
4138000	4141000	Oh, God, Platinum's involved with everything these days, it seems like, right?
4141000	4145000	Didn't they have, like, three things at E3 between, like, Transformers and Star Fox?
4145000	4148000	A Transformers game looks really good.
4148000	4156000	Yeah, right? Well, what's interesting is that he made some interesting tweets this week where somebody had tweeted him asking him,
4156000	4158000	What are your thoughts on Mighty No. 9?
4158000	4163000	And Hideki Kamiya said, It's like an insult to their old home.
4163000	4170000	And somebody followed up with that question, asking, Do you think that because it looks bad or because it looks too similar to Rockman?
4170000	4173000	And he followed up saying, Similar? It's a copy.
4173000	4181000	So, interesting. He's kind of calling out Mighty No. 9 for being so darn similar to Mega Man, which...
4181000	4184000	Because it is! It is!
4184000	4189000	It is kind of the secret. It's the pink elephant in the room. It is...
4189000	4194000	Inafune, moving on, because Capcom would make it, so he made it himself.
4194000	4202000	It's there in the groove. I mean, it's basically, you know, they changed enough of the game to make a Mega Man game without it being Mega Man.
4202000	4209000	And who can blame them? They wanted to make a Mega Man game. Capcom said, Fuck you, we don't want a Mega Man game, so what are you gonna do?
4209000	4213000	I mean, people want it. People were eating that up.
4213000	4223000	But the game you just referenced ended up getting into a little bit of legal issues. Do you think Capcom's just waiting for Mighty No. 9 to release?
4223000	4231000	Well, here's the problem about that, though. See, this would be making the assumption that Capcom was releasing a bunch of Mega Man games by themselves.
4231000	4236000	Well, they have the anniversary thing, whatever it's called.
4236000	4239000	No, no, no. That's just re-releasing shit. That's not the same.
4239000	4247000	It was supposed to be like Naoki going out there and making a new dancing game. Like, he left Konami, which...
4247000	4254000	He could very well be leaving Konami at any point, I mean, considering how Konami's been treating some of their top talent.
4254000	4262000	But, you know, it'd be like him going out there and making another dancing series. It was essentially DDR, but not DDR.
4262000	4274000	And that's what a lot of these guys have done. Inafune, the guy behind the Castlevania Kickstarter stuff, now Red Ash.
4274000	4282000	It's basically all these games that these companies did not want to gamble on that they really wanted to make, and now they're gonna make them.
4282000	4287000	And these companies are gonna lose out on it. So you don't take the gamble, you don't reap the reward.
4287000	4295000	You know, I'm getting a very popcorn.gif vibe from our chat room right now. Dungeon Buster says he's not wrong, and I backed 90 number 9.
4295000	4301000	Let's see. Sjundermat says, I backed it because it looked like such a good copy of Mega Man.
4301000	4305000	Dungeon Buster says, Kamiya has also said that Inafune is just a businessman.
4305000	4308000	ActDef says, Kamiya is a loudmouth and I love it.
4308000	4313000	YYR reminding us Konami had patents all over DDR, both on the software and the hardware.
4313000	4317000	Yes, I'm aware. It's only a few more years before those patents expire too, so.
4317000	4319000	Release the hounds!
4319000	4322000	Yes, a few more years and we'll be making our own dancing games, yes!
4322000	4328000	Fifth Dream in chat says, anyone who didn't think it was a copy is silly. So, interesting.
4328000	4332000	The reaction is, fuck yeah, it's a copy and that's what we want!
4332000	4337000	Tell me, how much of it is a copy? I mean, it's a platform game that you fight, you're a robot that fights robots.
4337000	4343000	I mean, come on. And the gimmick is that you absorb the powers of the robots that you defeat.
4343000	4350000	I mean, come on. That's just a platformer. I mean, there could be other platformers out there that have that same gimmick.
4350000	4361000	To me, it's kind of like, okay, so you know how Wes Craven was really big in the 80s for the slasher films like Nightmare on Elm Street, right?
4361000	4371000	What did he end up being big for like ten years after that? Scream. What was Scream? A parody of 80s slasher films, right?
4371000	4376000	So, I don't know. I know that's a really weird analogy, but that's kind of like what this feels like to me.
4376000	4382000	It's a very self-referential evolution of the game and that's okay.
4383000	4388000	It's just these companies, they just want to let these people go.
4388000	4395000	People that were responsible for big properties that brought them a lot of fame and a lot of attention to their company.
4395000	4403000	If they really just want to throw them aside because they think that they can re-release another game in a series, then this is what's going to happen.
4403000	4408000	You're going to get all these guys saying, well, fuck you. We don't need you as a publisher. We will publish our own shit.
4408000	4413000	And we can. And they will. Or at least they'll find a publisher to publish their own shit.
4413000	4419000	SSG100Matt saying, celebs have made millions parodying themselves. Then we get into Scary Movie.
4419000	4423000	That's where like Lindsay Lohan and what's-his-name Charlie Sheen and all that showed up.
4423000	4433000	Which Popcorn.gif, one of the best ones, is from Scary Movie with Brenda sitting on the couch with her popcorn.
4434000	4440000	Let's see. Fifth Dream reminds us Scream has a TV show now. That's right. Oh my god, I forgot we were to that point.
4440000	4444000	That's what we've gone to. Wes Craven isn't involved, too.
4444000	4448000	But the same thing happened to Nightmare on Elm Street. Freddy's Nightmares.
4448000	4450000	Right, that's right. I forgot about that.
4450000	4453000	And don't forget, in the early 90s there was the Nightmare Cafe.
4453000	4458000	Well then isn't there also like the Glee guy is doing Scream Queens or something like that?
4458000	4461000	Which is another light on... I don't know. I know.
4461000	4465000	That's why I need Critical Myth because they keep track of all those shows.
4465000	4467000	But I don't even know if those shows would be something they even care about.
4467000	4472000	It doesn't matter because Ash vs. the Evil Dead is going to be coming out and it's so amazing.
4472000	4474000	Who cares about anything else?
4474000	4479000	Alright, anyhow, let's move on. We could talk about horror movies and television, but we have more stories.
4479000	4482000	Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates.
4482000	4487000	Well, this is actually something that I found on one of my favorite sites ever, which is Mental Floss.
4487000	4498000	They put out an article saying that there was a couple of experiments that were detailed in psychological science
4498000	4506000	where they walked participants through watching basically a lot of death and dying things that would cause some mental trauma.
4506000	4514000	And then had them play Tetris after completing a task that was supposed to reactivate those memories.
4514000	4521000	And so the people who played Tetris actually reported fewer intrusive memories from the film after that.
4521000	4530000	It's basically a follow up from a 2009 study where they proposed that playing Tetris could reduce PTSD flashbacks.
4530000	4544000	Because basically it uses the same processing center in the brain that brings back and compresses all of those memories into just a flash of memories.
4544000	4552000	So basically the working memory that you use for Tetris is the same that is used to recall traumatic memories.
4552000	4559000	So by playing Tetris you're replacing that space. It's sort of like you're overwriting part of that data.
4560000	4565000	Is it that... I mean, I don't want to... God, this might sound really tacky, so I apologize.
4565000	4570000	But is it kind of back in that whole... Have you ever heard that saying, like, idle hands are the devil's play type of thing?
4570000	4571000	Playground.
4571000	4572000	Yeah, that's it. That's it. Devil's playground?
4572000	4573000	Yes.
4573000	4580000	Is it kind of like that? Because by keeping your brain doing this thing, you're not able to think about that thing.
4580000	4582000	Kind of like that? That's what it seems like.
4582000	4591000	I guess, but also it's like it's actually reducing the capacity that the memory has to bring that up.
4591000	4597000	So after playing that, they've got a new series of memories in the place where those lived.
4597000	4606000	So it's very... I'm curious to see more about that. I'd like to see this actually done with people with PTSD.
4606000	4614000	Which neither of these studies did, but it proposed an approach of the treatment for trauma.
4614000	4620000	Break Man in our chat says, so once again, those evil video games are helping people.
4620000	4625000	So yeah, I like to hear these stories about like that video games, like positive impacts on the brain.
4625000	4632000	I mean, certainly with so many negative things out there to hear about, you know, the positive things is always such a nice break.
4632000	4635000	And like how they can help people, you know.
4635000	4641000	My question is whoever used Music C? I mean, seriously, that would cause me some trauma.
4641000	4648000	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some video games that are coming out in a store near you somewhere in the world.
4648000	4650000	Starting in the US, Loki.
4650000	4654000	Yeah, there's actually some stuff coming out this week unlike last week where there was literally nothing.
4654000	4661000	So this week we've got Godzilla coming out on PlayStation 4 from Bandai Namco Games.
4661000	4665000	Deception 4, The Nightmare Princess on PlayStation 4.
4665000	4673000	Also coming out, we've got EA Sports Rory McGlory PGA Tour.
4673000	4681000	Yes, that's the new sports player PGA Tour game now that Tiger is no longer on the cover.
4681000	4686000	That is coming from EA on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4686000	4694000	Also, the God of War 3 remastered for PlayStation 4. Lots of PlayStation 4 games this week.
4694000	4698000	And that's it.
4698000	4700000	All right, traveling over to Japan.
4700000	4707000	Coming out this week in Japan on the PlayStation 4, Batman Arkham Knight gets its Japanese release on the 16th as well as the God of War 3 remaster.
4707000	4711000	And Godzilla Versus is what they're calling it in Japan for some reason.
4711000	4715000	Just a slight name change, but that comes out in Japan all on the 16th.
4715000	4720000	On the Xbox One, you have Roy McGlory PGA Tour.
4720000	4723000	Oh, I'm sorry, that's a Europe date. That's not on my Japanese list.
4723000	4726000	So there's actually nothing in Japan this week on the Xbox One.
4726000	4730000	Weird that none of those games are getting Xbox One ports, but hmm.
4730000	4735000	On the Wii U this week, Yoshi's Woolly World finally makes its way out to Japan.
4735000	4738000	That is on July the 16th as well.
4738000	4743000	And then looking at the Vita and the 3DS, the Vita has still a few games here.
4743000	4752000	Sweet Clown goes in, Saiji no Okashi no Dokueshi comes out this week as well as a game called iDoll U.
4752000	4758000	I don't know if they're going to make a doll out of you or what that is, but it's called iDoll U.
4758000	4765000	And then lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Dasutsu Adventure Zetsubo Yosai.
4765000	4767000	What are you laughing about over there?
4767000	4770000	I was just thinking maybe it's like Aideru.
4770000	4772000	No, it looks... I don't know if it's...
4772000	4774000	That would be how iDoll would be pronounced.
4774000	4777000	Yeah, no it's i and then like a doll, like a...
4777000	4781000	Yeah, that's what I was thinking about the pronunciation.
4781000	4785000	I don't know if this is based on an anime or what, but I know there's a girl in a kitty suit.
4785000	4787000	Okay, that's all that matters.
4787000	4789000	Yeah, that's all that matters. Must play.
4789000	4790000	Japanese games.
4790000	4792000	It's a must play.
4792000	4796000	Alright, and AkumaJP reminding us that Xbox One is not relevant here.
4797000	4801000	No, and I'm surprised that Microsoft really isn't trying to make a stronger play.
4801000	4808000	Although I thought I heard that they did a changing of the guards over Xbox Japan to try and push that a little bit more.
4808000	4813000	But I guess maybe we'll hear Tokyo Game Show would be a big time for them to make a move if they're going to.
4813000	4814000	We'll see.
4814000	4817000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.
4817000	4819000	And the classic game of the week.
4819000	4821000	Oh, I'm sorry. No, we didn't get to UK dates.
4821000	4822000	We got to do those first.
4822000	4823000	Darzagra.
4824000	4825000	Please.
4825000	4830000	Okay, on the 15th we have The Vanishing of Ethan Carter on PlayStation 4.
4830000	4832000	For Mac and PC we have Luxlinger.
4832000	4838000	And on the 17th, The Deception 4, The Nightmare Princess on the Sony stuff.
4838000	4840000	And that's it.
4840000	4842000	Alright, now we have a couple more stories.
4842000	4844000	And then the classic game of the week. Loki.
4844000	4851000	So there's some more rumored information coming out about the whole treatment of Kojima Productions from Konami.
4851000	4859000	And this time the source is actually the Japanese voice actor for Solid Snake and Big Boss, Akio Atsuka.
4859000	4867000	And basically this was translated from Gemetsu, an article on there.
4867000	4870000	But Kojima Productions was forced to disband.
4870000	4880000	But it appears that the work the team has been putting their utmost effort into is nearly complete.
4880000	4886000	And I'm not exaggerating when I say I expect it will become their greatest masterpiece.
4886000	4887000	I couldn't help it.
4887000	4890000	I just wanted to say, kept you waiting, huh?
4890000	4896000	But even if this is the end, Metal Gear Solid is immortal.
4896000	4904000	So based on that it sounds like that they may have actually wanted, or Kojima might have actually wanted to stay at Konami.
4904000	4908000	But they just were going to disband Kojima Productions for some reason.
4908000	4909000	Huh.
4909000	4912000	Instead of him actually wanting to leave the company.
4912000	4913000	Wow.
4913000	4916000	They must not like money.
4916000	4920000	I don't understand what the hell is going on there, but it's just...
4920000	4925000	Maybe we'll hear something, I don't know if we'll hear something from Kojima after he leaves the company, but I don't know, we'll see.
4925000	4927000	I'm sure we'll see a Kickstarter in no time.
4927000	4928000	Oh, yeah.
4928000	4931000	Tigerclaw says, at least Kojima can work on something original.
4931000	4937000	Dar Tetsuya says, I did check out Ground Zeroes this week. Aside from not being sure where to go, I had some fun with it.
4937000	4939000	So, alright.
4939000	4941000	Well, moving on.
4941000	4945000	I mentioned earlier in the show, Comic-Con was this weekend.
4945000	4950000	And I know a lot of you guys pay attention to a lot of things that come out of Comic-Con.
4950000	4952000	Some of the trailers and things.
4952000	4959000	But I know one big TV show that is having a presence at Comic-Con is Heroes Reborn.
4959000	4964000	Because Heroes was a show on NBC a few years ago, and then it kind of went downhill in Season 2.
4964000	4966000	It never really recovered from the Rider's Strike.
4966000	4971000	Some would argue, though, that Season 4, its last season, was probably as good as its first season.
4971000	4973000	But by then, a lot of people had checked out.
4973000	4980000	Well, like a lot of TV shows seem to be doing these days, God, what else got rebooted?
4980000	4982000	I know The X-Files is coming back.
4982000	4985000	24 came back after a quick hiatus, right?
4985000	4989000	Heroes is coming back in a new show called Heroes Reborn.
4989000	4992000	And why am I bringing this up on OLR, a video game show?
4992000	5000000	Well, because they actually announced this week that Heroes Reborn Gemini will be coming out for consoles, PC, and Mac.
5000000	5003000	And Heroes Reborn Enigma will come out for smartphones and tablets.
5003000	5007000	And these games are based on Heroes Reborn, which will be coming out for NBC.
5007000	5016000	Now, I remember when Heroes was first out, they had a big online presence that tied into comics that they would have online.
5016000	5018000	That would actually tie into the show itself.
5018000	5022000	And you would see characters that show up in the comics first that then would show up in the show. It was kind of interesting.
5022000	5028000	So they're talking about specifically the console, PC, Mac version, the Gemini Heroes Reborn.
5028000	5034000	Expanding on the television story arc, Gemini is a first-person adventure game where players take on the role of Cassandra,
5034000	5039000	a young woman determined to solve the mysteries of her past while discovering her new powers.
5039000	5043000	And then Enigma is going to be a first-person puzzle game that will star Dahlia,
5043000	5047000	who is an evolved human with incredible powers while she's trying to get out of a government facility.
5047000	5053000	So, very interesting. A trailer supposedly came out today during the Heroes Reborn panel.
5053000	5057000	Obviously, with all the news that came out, I got distracted, so I didn't get to see those trailers.
5057000	5063000	But, yeah. Kind of an interesting little tie-in there to a TV show.
5063000	5068000	Anybody looking forward to the Heroes Reborn TV show? I think I'm going to give that a chance.
5068000	5070000	I loved season one of the first show.
5071000	5079000	I tried to go back to Heroes to watch season four or three. I don't even remember which one I ended up quitting in.
5079000	5085000	I think it was three. And I just had a hard time going back into it.
5085000	5087000	Yeah, three was really, really hard to watch.
5087000	5095000	I think I may try again, but yeah. I don't know. I liked Peter Petrelli as a character, aside from him being a little whiny.
5095000	5100000	Like, it had a really good pacing in the first season, but then it just kind of lost it, I guess.
5100000	5104000	Second season went batshit crazy, and there were just characters that were just bad, you know?
5104000	5109000	Like, they never really explained that girl who would cry, and then people would die.
5109000	5110000	Oh, God. She was the worst.
5110000	5114000	Right? Nobody liked her. And then they kind of wrote her off the show, except they didn't, like, I don't know.
5114000	5119000	And then, like, her brother... I don't know. Anyway, I don't want to get into the whole thing.
5119000	5122000	It was frustrating. Let's just say that.
5123000	5124000	Let's say YYR says,
5124000	5128000	It will find a home on my DVR, aside the blacklist in Gotham.
5128000	5129000	There you go.
5129000	5131000	And S. Jonah and Matt saying as well,
5131000	5133000	The Rider's Strike really hurt the show.
5133000	5136000	And then, Kaijuto says,
5136000	5138000	It should be called Heroes Regurgitated.
5138000	5144000	You know, they are... a lot of the season one characters, like, almost too many of them, are supposed to be coming back.
5144000	5146000	So I'm a little worried about that, but we'll see.
5146000	5148000	But none of the interesting ones are, though.
5148000	5150000	Yeah.
5150000	5152000	Is Allie Larder coming back? Please say no.
5152000	5153000	I don't think so.
5153000	5154000	I don't want her coming back.
5154000	5156000	I don't think... Well, I think that was part of the problem with...
5156000	5162000	In the... Originally, the series was supposed to be all new heroes every season.
5162000	5167000	But because people liked the season one group too much, they kind of forced them into the story.
5167000	5169000	They continued on. It just... It didn't really work.
5169000	5171000	I was fine with them continuing on the story.
5171000	5176000	It's just, like, when she had how many clones or, like, she would, like, how many personalities?
5176000	5178000	It's just... It's ridiculous.
5178000	5181000	No, and Brakeman says, I don't think Siler is coming back. I don't think so either.
5181000	5182000	I mean, granted...
5182000	5184000	He's too big of a star now.
5184000	5191000	Yeah, you never know who's secretly signed, but I think the only people they've said are coming back are Hiro, who I think is...
5191000	5193000	That he's fine. For him to come back is good.
5193000	5195000	If Hiro comes back, that means we might get George Takei.
5195000	5197000	Which was the only scenes I ever watched of the show.
5197000	5198000	That's right.
5198000	5202000	But he's dead though in the show.
5202000	5203000	George Takei?
5203000	5205000	Yeah, his character died, remember?
5205000	5206000	Oh, I don't remember that.
5206000	5208000	I only watched the show. I only watched the scenes with Hiro in it.
5208000	5213000	Well, anyway, and then the cop guy is coming back.
5213000	5215000	What about Cheerleaderine?
5215000	5217000	No, I don't think she's coming back.
5217000	5222000	She's too big of a star now, and unfortunately, yeah, the guy that played Matt wasn't...
5222000	5226000	He's been in, like, Big Ass Spider and, like, I think probably a Sharknado movie.
5226000	5231000	The guy who plays Hiro, he's in Hawaii Five-0, I think.
5231000	5233000	I think that's the show he's in now.
5233000	5237000	Brad says, the glasses guy, Mohinder, and the Petreli mom.
5237000	5238000	I don't know.
5238000	5243000	Mohinder's lame. I do like Noah. Yeah, he's pretty awesome.
5243000	5245000	He was pretty much, like, a badass in that.
5245000	5247000	I kinda like... Just don't give him any powers.
5247000	5251000	I liked how he was just, like, this guy with no powers, but it was just, like, it would kick ass.
5251000	5253000	So, I was down with that.
5253000	5257000	Mohinder is just lame. He became, like, that weird, like, lizard guy.
5257000	5258000	Ando.
5258000	5261000	Ando. Yeah, didn't Ando end up getting power or something?
5261000	5262000	Yeah, he did.
5262000	5263000	I think so, yeah.
5263000	5267000	He had the power to, like, basically amplify other people's powers.
5267000	5271000	And then he learned how to use it as, like...
5271000	5273000	You know who I really want to come back?
5273000	5275000	And I know this might come off as distasteful.
5275000	5277000	It's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be respectful.
5277000	5279000	Because I know she had some medical issues lately.
5279000	5281000	But Michelle Nichols was...
5281000	5283000	But she was in the Ally Larter storyline.
5283000	5287000	She was their kid's grandma or something, right?
5287000	5289000	I just remember she was in that storyline.
5290000	5292000	I want to see her, because I want to see her make a full recovery
5292000	5296000	and go back to gracing us with her presence on television again.
5296000	5301000	I probably should sit down and watch it, but I've had no desire to watch any of it
5301000	5303000	because of reasons.
5303000	5304000	I understand.
5304000	5305000	PowInChat says,
5305000	5308000	The cheerleader comes back, but she's now 35 and an alcoholic.
5308000	5310000	She should be cheerleader-ing anyway.
5312000	5314000	Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week.
5314000	5316000	Let's get to a simpler time.
5316000	5319000	When Rider Strikes didn't ruin shows that had great potential.
5321000	5324000	The classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault
5324000	5326000	and find the game that she thinks,
5326000	5332000	Hey, you little brats, play this game this week because of reasons.
5332000	5336000	And I do want to point out, you picked this far earlier today
5336000	5338000	before the other news that came out.
5338000	5341000	So it doesn't tie into that news, but we didn't have time.
5341000	5343000	I don't know why it would tie into that news.
5343000	5345000	Well, we didn't have time to change things.
5345000	5348000	So anyway, Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
5348000	5350000	Dig Dug.
5350000	5353000	Yes, I haven't done Dig Dug before, so I did Dig Dug.
5353000	5355000	This is one of my all-time favorites.
5355000	5357000	That's the best music.
5357000	5362000	Anyway, it came out in 1982 in Japan.
5362000	5366000	It was put up by Namco and it ran on the Namco Galaga hardware,
5366000	5370000	which, outside of Japan, it was published by Atari.
5370000	5374000	So basically, really simple little game,
5374000	5377000	but it has led to a few other kind of big franchises
5377000	5381000	and actually has tie-ins with some other Namco franchises
5381000	5383000	in ways that you might not think.
5383000	5386000	So basically, in Dig Dug, you jump down
5386000	5389000	and you have the Pookas and you have the Fygars.
5389000	5392000	And the Pookas are the round red monsters
5392000	5396000	and the Fygars are the dragons that breathe fire on you.
5396000	5402000	So basically, you go around and you pump them full of air
5402000	5403000	and they explode.
5403000	5406000	I mean, I'm sure we all saw that episode of Robot Chicken, right?
5406000	5413000	Somehow they explode without getting blood and guts everywhere.
5413000	5415000	They're full of hot air, literally.
5415000	5416000	They're full of hot air. That's it.
5416000	5418000	And you can drop rocks on them.
5418000	5422000	I was actually super impressed with this particular playthrough
5422000	5425000	because the guy lures three Pookas over
5425000	5428000	and then drops a rock on all of them, and that's some mad skills.
5429000	5437000	And then the very last enemy basically is going to travel through the dirt
5437000	5441000	and try to get back to the surface and run away.
5441000	5444000	And if he runs away, you don't get the points for it, of course.
5444000	5448000	They turn into what's called ghost eyes as they travel through the dirt.
5448000	5454000	So basically, depending on how you destroy them,
5454000	5459000	you get double points for Fygars if you get them horizontally
5459000	5462000	because they only blow fire horizontally.
5462000	5466000	And then you get even more points by dropping rocks on them.
5466000	5470000	And if they're killed by a rock, they get 1,000 points.
5470000	5473000	And then after that, it's 1,500 and then 2,000.
5473000	5475000	Digging gives you points, too.
5475000	5478000	So you get 10 points for each block that you dig.
5478000	5483000	So you can actually dig out the whole level
5483000	5485000	and get a bajillion points for it.
5485000	5487000	There's an achievement for it on Xbox 360.
5487000	5489000	It was a pain in the ass.
5489000	5490000	Pain in the ass.
5490000	5492000	That was the name of the achievement, Pain in the Ass.
5492000	5495000	I don't think so, but that's what it was called in my heart.
5496000	5501000	By the way, this is like, of all the retro arcade games,
5501000	5504000	this is probably one of my very...
5504000	5507000	I almost don't want to say my very favorite, but I think it might actually be.
5507000	5510000	This is one, if I see it in an arcade,
5510000	5512000	because it still shows up in arcades today.
5512000	5514000	If I see it, I have to play it.
5514000	5518000	And then I'm on it for a good, not to sound cocky,
5518000	5521000	but I can get pretty far in it still on one quarter.
5521000	5525000	I need to get one of those plushie pookas that they put out.
5525000	5527000	Because you live in my cubicle.
5527000	5529000	I have a white Pac-Man ghost, though.
5529000	5531000	I won that out of a vending machine.
5531000	5533000	A crane game.
5533000	5540000	Anyway, if you drop a rock on an enemy at the same time that they explode,
5540000	5544000	there's a glitch in the game that causes all the enemies to disappear,
5544000	5545000	but the game won't progress.
5545000	5547000	You'll just keep digging.
5547000	5550000	So you can't get to the next level, but you can dig.
5550000	5553000	Of course, the way that you resolve the glitch, though,
5553000	5556000	is making a rock drop until there's no rocks left.
5558000	5565000	You also can get a bonus item at the center of the screen that you can collect.
5565000	5569000	So there are different fruits and vegetables, as well as the flagship from Galaxian.
5570000	5572000	So that's pretty cool, too.
5572000	5576000	And you get a bonus from the fruit or vegetable.
5576000	5578000	It's 8,000 from the pineapple.
5578000	5580000	And here's a pro tip.
5580000	5583000	That thing shows up in the center after you drop two rocks.
5583000	5585000	That's what I said.
5585000	5586000	Oh, whoops.
5586000	5588000	Sorry, I was reading chat.
5588000	5590000	Okay.
5590000	5595000	So they're also now, of course, in the original Namco version.
5595000	5603000	The game ends on round 256, which is round 0, that gets you to a kill screen.
5603000	5609000	The Atari version, however, basically bypasses the kill screen.
5609000	5615000	It takes you to...
5615000	5617000	Hold on, I'm trying to find where it is.
5617000	5622000	Yeah, it actually is going to be game over at 256, regardless of what happens,
5622000	5624000	with no official kill screen.
5624000	5630000	The kill screen on the Namco version was a Pooka that was right on top of Dig Dug with no way to kill him.
5630000	5640000	So in 1996, we got the Namco Classics Volume 2 that had Dig Dug arrangement in it, which was two-player Dig Dug.
5640000	5646000	But this one was still mostly not changed, except for adding the two-player aspect.
5647000	5656000	It was re-released again along with regular Dig Dug and ten other Namco games on PS2, Xbox, and GameCube in Namco Museum.
5656000	5665000	In that version, there were balls that were inspired by the Cosmo gang, The Puzzle, that can kill a lot of enemies in a row.
5665000	5671000	And then we've just had all kinds of different versions of it that came out, especially the Dig Dug arrangement.
5671000	5677000	Dig Dug Remix was from Namco Museum Battle Collection that came to iOS.
5677000	5685000	It was like Dig Dug arrangement, but without the multiplayer.
5685000	5693000	In 2005, there was Dig Dug for cell phones and Palm OS that was pretty much like the original,
5693000	5697000	but the levels were based on the NES version of Dig Dug.
5697000	5701000	Of course, the levels go on past 500, there's no kill screen.
5701000	5706000	Now here's the part that goes with other Namco games.
5706000	5717000	It was said, actually didn't even come out until later, much later, what the name of the protagonist of Dig Dug is.
5717000	5726000	His name is not Dig Dug. His name is Hori Taizo, which, you know, being last name first Japanese.
5726000	5731000	It also is a pun on Hori Taizo, which, I want to dig.
5731000	5739000	So it'd be sort of like if we'd called him Will Dig, or Wanda Dig, Wanda Dig.
5739000	5747000	So after, he's also a playable character in Mr. Driller Drill Spirits.
5747000	5750000	Because you know who Mr. Driller is?
5750000	5752000	It's Dig Dug, no it's his kid.
5752000	5753000	It's his kid?
5753000	5754000	Yeah.
5754000	5755000	It's his kid.
5755000	5757000	It's Dig Dug. Sorry, you're just going to offset the deal with it.
5757000	5760000	Because it's Dug. It's Dig Dug.
5760000	5763000	No.
5763000	5770000	So the character in Mr. Driller is, God I just had this a moment ago too.
5770000	5772000	Hori Susumu.
5772000	5782000	So now his ex-wife, basically the Dig Dug character's ex-wife, is Kissy from Baradook.
5782000	5784000	I don't know if you ever played that game.
5784000	5787000	It was sort of like Metroid before Metroid came out.
5787000	5790000	Down to the female protagonist and everything.
5790000	5796000	So, Hori is called the hero of the Dig Dug incident in the Mr. Driller series.
5796000	5802000	So those three games are all related through marriage and children.
5802000	5803000	Alright.
5803000	5806000	So there were a bajillion versions that came out.
5806000	5807000	Yes.
5807000	5812000	Not just did we have our arcade ones, we had Atari 2600, 5200, which I have.
5812000	5826000	Atari 7800 Intellivision, Apple II, Atari 400, 800 PC, Commodore VIC-20, Commodore 64, IBM PC, Texas Instruments TI-99-4A, which I think I had the TI-99 one as well.
5826000	5829000	There was the Famicom version, Game Boy.
5829000	5835000	There was a plug and play system version that came with Galaxian, Pac-Man, Rally-X, and Bosconian.
5835000	5838000	We had the version on Xbox Live Arcade.
5839000	5842000	There was a Windows one for Namco Networks.
5842000	5848000	They also had an advanced version that had the sprites from Dig Dug Digging Strike.
5848000	5854000	There were, let's see, the Namco All-Stars Pac-Man and Dig Dug.
5854000	5859000	There were the Wii Virtual Console ones, Dig Dug 2, which, okay.
5859000	5862000	Pac-Man's arcade party had it in there.
5862000	5864000	The NES version on Virtual Console came back out.
5864000	5867000	Nintendo 3DS and Wii U had versions as well.
5868000	5876000	Gaken made a tabletop handheld version of Dig Dug that was one of three flip-top games with the VFD screen.
5876000	5880000	It also came out with Jungler and Amadar.
5880000	5883000	And it's been out on just about every version ever.
5883000	5890000	And Dig Dug was listed the 6th most popular coin-op video game by the killer list of video games website.
5891000	5892000	So...
5893000	5894000	God, there were just...
5894000	5896000	There were sequels as well.
5896000	5897000	Dig Dug 2...
5897000	5898000	Which is ass.
5898000	5899000	Yes.
5899000	5900000	Don't bother with Dig Dug 2.
5900000	5902000	Mr. Driller was conceived as Dig Dug 3.
5902000	5903000	Oh, I didn't know that.
5903000	5904000	Yeah.
5904000	5905000	But it makes sense.
5905000	5906000	Yep.
5906000	5908000	There was Dig Dug Digging Strike on Nintendo DS.
5908000	5916000	There was a side play that combined the side play and overhead view that had a link to Mr. Driller.
5916000	5919000	There was Dig Dug Deeper on PC.
5921000	5924000	Yeah, just all kinds of different versions that came out.
5924000	5928000	And there's also a skin of it in Pac-Man Championship Edition Deluxe, which is awesome.
5928000	5931000	There's a bootleg of Dig Dug called Zig Zag.
5932000	5937000	Pooka has been in other Namco games, including Pac-Man World.
5937000	5942000	Pooka was playable in Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness.
5942000	5947000	And available as playable in Pac-Man World Rally, as well as Flygar.
5947000	5952000	Pooka was also in pole position on one of the roadside billboards.
5952000	5957000	In Pac-Man World, he was one of the friends of Pac-Man that was kidnapped by Talk Man.
5957000	5963000	He was also in R4 as the American Racing Team's Dig Dug Racing Team mascot.
5964000	5968000	He was on the Phantomile track in R4 as well.
5968000	5971000	R4 is like the best Ridge Racer game ever, by the way.
5971000	5972000	Yes, it is.
5972000	5973000	Yes.
5973000	5975000	He was also in Ridge Racer 64.
5975000	5984000	Dig Dug and the Mr. Driller character Susumu were playable in Namco X Capcom.
5984000	5988000	There was the Dig Dug robot chicken episode, President Evil.
5989000	5993000	Dig Dug, Pooka, and Flygar were in Wreck-It Ralph.
5994000	5999000	And sold out A Three Evening with Kevin Smith.
5999000	6003000	Mario Kart Arcade GP, Pooka was a special character.
6003000	6005000	A Nobinobi boy.
6005000	6009000	Players can sometimes play on maps with Dig Duggs and Pookas.
6010000	6015000	In the fifth season of X-Files, there was a character playing Dig Dug on an episode.
6015000	6018000	Okay, this is getting obscure, but I can see it.
6018000	6022000	Wasn't Pooka also in point blank?
6022000	6024000	I thought it was one of the targets in point blank.
6024000	6027000	Fifth Dream in chat, and I'm sorry if you were going to get to this, JB.
6027000	6029000	Fifth Dream in chat says, let's not forget that Namco dating sim.
6029000	6031000	It had Dig Dug characters.
6032000	6038000	In Death Battle, Bomberman fights the Dig Dug character for battle.
6038000	6045000	And then Pookas are enemies in Smash Run mode in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS.
6046000	6047000	That's it.
6047000	6048000	I'm done.
6048000	6049000	I'm done, Doug.
6049000	6051000	I've dug that dig.
6051000	6052000	Alright, there it is.
6052000	6053000	Your classic game of the week.
6053000	6055000	A true classic, Dig Dug.
6055000	6059000	Now my favorite version of Dig Dug is on the Playstation 3 because of reasons.
6059000	6063000	That particular collection on the Playstation 3.
6063000	6065000	That version is the best of all versions.
6065000	6066000	Because of reasons.
6066000	6070000	But I have fond fond memories of the Commodore 64 version.
6070000	6072000	Which, you know, you know me.
6072000	6073000	Commodore 64.
6073000	6076000	I mean, that game was everywhere when I was a kid.
6076000	6077000	Everywhere.
6077000	6078000	Every system.
6078000	6082000	There's actually a good OC, Happy Hardcore remix.
6082000	6084000	Really?
6084000	6086000	For the Dig Dug music.
6086000	6087000	That's funny.
6087000	6088000	Alright, anyhow.
6088000	6089000	We're gonna take a break, guys.
6089000	6091000	When we come back, there's plenty more show to come.
6091000	6093000	We're gonna have rapid fire news, of course.
6093000	6099000	The FUGO Question of the Week, which is about the Heroes Reborn, kind of ties into that a little bit.
6099000	6100000	And then, of course, more news.
6100000	6102000	Mailbag FUs and phone calls.
6102000	6105000	I know a lot of you have some stuff you want to say this week, so we'll get to all that.
6105000	6108000	When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6114000	6123000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday evening, July the 12th of 2015, with the 605th episode of our show.
6123000	6128000	If you're just joining us live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, where we, of course, do tape our show every Sunday night.
6128000	6137000	Obviously, we were hit about an hour before the show went live tonight with the news that Satoru Iwata passed away suddenly over the weekend.
6137000	6140000	And, obviously, we're all still reeling from that.
6140000	6146000	And if you missed the beginning of the show, we spent a good 30 minutes at the top of the show kind of talking about it and our reactions and all that.
6146000	6149000	But just, you know, this is all really unfolding as we are live.
6149000	6155000	It is Monday morning in Japan right now, so, you know, they're hearing the news and processing and reacting.
6155000	6159000	And, actually, I just saw in our chat room, Rama's in there tonight.
6159000	6164000	In tribute, he's under one of his other handles, Black Luigi, if you've seen the man cosplay.
6164000	6169000	But Rama's in chat saying that flags are at half-mast in Nintendo Japan.
6169000	6176000	And actually links us to a Twitter picture where you can actually see Nintendo corporate headquarters in Japan and they are flying the flags at half-mast.
6176000	6185000	So it's sad, but a great sign of respect, obviously, to a man that was very, very loved, I'm sure, at that company.
6185000	6189000	Anyhow, I'm sure we will have some callers on that issue later on in the show.
6189000	6196000	But as I said earlier, the show goes on and there's a lot going on in the game industry that happened this week that we want to talk about.
6196000	6200000	So let's get back into it with some rapid-fire news and some of the other news from this week.
6200000	6201000	Loki.
6201000	6207000	This is great news. I'm pretty excited about this since I bought this game when it originally came out on PlayStation 3.
6207000	6217000	But if you did buy Journey from that game company back on PlayStation 3, you'll be happy to know it's a cross-buy title.
6217000	6228000	And if you did purchase it previously, you'll be able to play it for free on July 21st on your PlayStation 4 and enjoy all of its graphical upgrades.
6228000	6233000	Or you can buy it for the first time. And it is, I mean, that one game of the year for a reason.
6233000	6238000	And by now, the twist of the game is out there so much, it's unfortunate.
6238000	6240000	It's still a gorgeous game.
6240000	6244000	Yeah, it's still a gorgeous game and the fact that the whole online collaboration.
6244000	6247000	I can't imagine how much better it's going to look now.
6247000	6250000	Yeah, yeah, seriously. I'm excited to play through it again.
6250000	6254000	Absolutely. So that'll be coming out on the 21st, so look forward to that.
6254000	6261000	Something that you can get a little sooner than that, if you have an account on Origin, remember, hey, they're still offering free games every now and then.
6261000	6270000	This time, it's Zuma's Revenge. So go pick that up. It's absolutely free for a limited time on EA's On the House program.
6270000	6277000	Xtafer, my buddy from the show Hoard House, loved Zuma, so I'll have to make sure he knows about this.
6277000	6278000	I played the crap out of it, too.
6278000	6280000	He can get addicted all over to it again.
6280000	6283000	It's frustratingly hard sometimes.
6283000	6290000	And then, last but not least, there's a karaoke game coming out. I know, that's crazy.
6290000	6295000	I mean, this hasn't been a new karaoke game in quite a while.
6295000	6297000	I'm a SingStar.
6297000	6307000	Well, yeah, but everything's kind of going the route of the whole service thing, where even Just Dance, where you just buy it and you have access to a library of songs.
6307000	6316000	Now, though, they're kind of bringing out one with a really unique title. It's called That's What I Call Sing, which doesn't make any sense.
6316000	6324000	It's pretty incorrect as far as grammar goes, but it is going to be coming out later on this year.
6324000	6332000	It has quite a few Top 40 songs that are in there that I recognize occasionally when I listen to the radio in my wife's car.
6332000	6334000	Who's making it?
6334000	6337000	I have no idea, to be honest.
6337000	6342000	But it is coming out on October 21st, or the 23rd.
6342000	6346000	October 23rd, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6346000	6352000	And it has such wonderful songs, including Uptown Funk from Bruno Mars.
6352000	6360000	I saw Applause from Lady Gaga, Royals by Lorde, Moves Like Jagger. You know, pretty much all the Top 40 shit right now.
6360000	6368000	Rama in chat says it's a play on That's What I Call Music. They have that popular CD series, the Now That's What I Call Music.
6368000	6373000	They call it That's What I Call Singing, or That's What I Call Karaoke, or something like that.
6373000	6375000	And so, That's What I Call Sing.
6375000	6384000	I did see a hilarious, like, someone posted a picture of that, and then they posted a picture of, was it, like, the prison? Sing? You know?
6384000	6387000	I just thought of it this way.
6387000	6394000	Alright. Well, I don't know. I have Sing Star Abba and Sing Star Queen. I don't need any other karaoke games.
6394000	6398000	Done. That's it. Done. That's all I need in life, those two games.
6398000	6406000	Meanwhile, though, some other stuff to put on your radar this week. A new crowdfunding campaign for a kids' gaming magazine.
6406000	6407000	Is it Highlights?
6407000	6413000	No, it's not Highlights for Kids. Well, you know how we had Retro Magazine, you know, which was a little more for adults.
6413000	6421000	Well, now, a former senior editor and art director for Electronic Gaming Monthly, Martin Alessi, has started a crowdfunding campaign for Little Player,
6421000	6429000	a bimonthly magazine that's aimed towards kids 7 to 12. It's only going to cover games rated E, C, E, and E10,
6429000	6435000	and it's supposed to be a safe, fun, ad-free reading experience for young readers by going to Kickstarter.
6435000	6441000	So you can check that out on Kickstarter. Just search for Little Player, because it's kind of hard for me to give out links.
6441000	6449000	But, yeah, that's pretty cool. So you can check that out. The Kickstarter will end on August 7th at 10 p.m. Central Time.
6449000	6454000	So, I loved having Nintendo, you know, I mentioned earlier in the show, we were reflecting on memories.
6454000	6460000	Nintendo Power was such a huge part of my childhood, like, I'm excited that maybe other kids can have that too.
6460000	6468000	And, you know, it's good all around, because it encourages them to read, but they're reading about something they, you know, really enjoy, which are games.
6468000	6475000	And this little, like, prototype they have there, you know, demonstrates, like, Yoshi's Woolly World, which would be a great example of a game that might be highlighted for kids.
6475000	6476000	It's not very woolly in that picture.
6476000	6477000	Well, no.
6477000	6478000	That's false advertising or anything.
6478000	6480000	It's a mock-up, Loki. Calm down.
6480000	6481000	It's a terrible mock-up.
6481000	6485000	They're not going to put Mortal Kombat X on the cover. All right, anyhow.
6485000	6487000	What if it's E-rated, though?
6487000	6492000	It's Mortal Kombat X, the friendship edition.
6492000	6499000	Moving on. A franchise that we've been following for a very long time here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6499000	6507000	BeatMania 2DX is location testing its newest version. Do you know what number they're up to in 2DX games?
6507000	6508000	20 billion-y.
6508000	6509000	Close.
6509000	6512000	26?
6512000	6515000	A little high. A little high on that. This is going to be number...
6515000	6516000	24?
6516000	6525000	23. It's BeatMania 2DX 23. It's called Copula is the name of it. It's kind of a yellow, yellowish interface. It looks like P.Pula.
6525000	6531000	Every time I see Copula, I think either Count Dracula, like if you were to...
6531000	6532000	If he was a cop.
6532000	6534000	Or Count Chocula. Or Capoeira.
6534000	6535000	Copulate.
6535000	6537000	Copulate.
6537000	6538000	Not like that one.
6538000	6539000	Or Francis Ford Copulate.
6539000	6547000	I can totally see it as a strange, you know, fish-out-of-water cop drama starring Dracula as a beat cop, you know.
6547000	6551000	Copula.
6551000	6558000	He's just an ordinary vampire. He doesn't understand the, you know, the world.
6558000	6563000	Oh my god. Brakeman says, Copula, vampire cop coming to theaters near you.
6563000	6566000	I would totally watch that. That's like such an 80s...
6566000	6568000	Cop dog.
6568000	6570000	BeatMania 2DX cop dog.
6570000	6582000	For the record, a copula is a connecting word, in particular a form of the verb be connecting a subject and complement.
6583000	6589000	And there's a torpedo that just shot and exploded the whole conversation.
6589000	6593000	Darktichy in chat says, the logo is supposed to represent like a bullet train.
6593000	6597000	And it's supposed to be like trains is the theme in the game, which would make sense.
6597000	6599000	You know, they really, really love trains over in Japan.
6599000	6603000	They had a whole bunch of Power Rangers that were trains. I know this because...
6603000	6608000	Why can't they just call it BeatMania 23 choo-choo, motherfucker?
6608000	6612000	Alright, look. BeatMania 2DX 23 copulate.
6612000	6616000	Some new things coming in the game.
6616000	6622000	There's a new gauge option, assisted easy, that will reduce the clear border from 80% to 60%.
6622000	6627000	Beginner gets its own folder. Movie previews are now available in the song UI.
6627000	6631000	Because I don't, you know, I'm so far removed from 2DX news these days.
6631000	6637000	But when I was playing that machine that was at Scandia, they had some hilarious videos.
6637000	6644000	Also for the record, a copula is also a type of musical term.
6644000	6648000	Meaning it's the texture of certain sounds.
6648000	6649000	Really?
6649000	6652000	So in this case, and I'm just going to quote from here.
6652000	6656000	It can be thought of as the linking of notes together to form a melody.
6656000	6659000	Ah, so it's that same definition but in regards to music.
6659000	6661000	Okay, I still like copulate.
6661000	6664000	For the record, the word is, is a copula.
6664000	6666000	The sky is blue.
6666000	6669000	Alright.
6669000	6670000	I is bored.
6670000	6672000	I am bored.
6672000	6678000	Alright, no seriously, I'll charge also in the game.
6678000	6680000	It's a new type of charge.
6680000	6686000	No, it raises your gauge as you hold it, but it will reduce your gauge if you aren't holding down on it.
6686000	6688000	So you must press the button.
6688000	6690000	Was that a copula?
6690000	6691000	No.
6691000	6692000	Oh, well damn.
6692000	6695000	But saying that it is a thing, that was a copula.
6695000	6697000	Okay, so you need to do the thing.
6697000	6699000	That's not a copula.
6699000	6700000	Damn it.
6700000	6702000	It's a link of description.
6702000	6707000	I will point out that one of the songs in the game is called Long Train Runnin'.
6707000	6709000	And I don't know if that's related to the DDR song.
6709000	6711000	I can only hope it is.
6711000	6712000	I hope it is.
6712000	6715000	But I love that, so that is one of the songs there.
6715000	6720000	And then, maybe this is a copula, there's a song called Do The Thing.
6720000	6724000	Does it mention who the artist is on Long Train Run?
6724000	6727000	Yes, it is DJ M.A.S.S. M.A.D. L.Z.M.
6727000	6731000	It's called Part 2 and it's in the genre Broken Samba Breaks.
6731000	6733000	Well, that's... yeah.
6733000	6735000	That's something, I guess.
6735000	6738000	OkumaJP in chat says, Me can has burger?
6738000	6740000	That is not a copula.
6740000	6745000	How did we ever fill three hours of show talking about nothing but music games?
6745000	6746000	How did we do it?
6746000	6747000	I don't know.
6747000	6749000	There was more news about music games.
6750000	6753000	No, I'm just saying it's rapid fire news and we've talked for five minutes
6753000	6757000	making fun of the name of BeatMania 2DX23.
6757000	6761000	For the record, that is rapid fire news, is is a copula.
6764000	6766000	How about if I say fuck right off?
6766000	6768000	Is right a copula?
6768000	6769000	No.
6771000	6776000	But saying fuck is a word, is would be a copula.
6776000	6777000	Ah, ok.
6777000	6779000	I am irritated.
6782000	6785000	Ok, well I is reading the next story.
6785000	6787000	You are using bad grammar.
6787000	6790000	Which is about Sega.
6790000	6799000	So Sega is admitting that maybe they've made some mistakes in the past.
6799000	6801000	I like how they're still...
6801000	6806000	The whole night now, every time a copula, we're just going to have to emphasize it.
6806000	6811000	Well, I like how they're admitting that we may have made a mistake instead of like,
6811000	6812000	yes, we made a mistake.
6812000	6815000	Why can't, why is there always going to be some doubt?
6815000	6819000	Like, let's just leave it open to, we didn't do anything wrong.
6820000	6822000	Anyhow, so here's the thing.
6822000	6827000	It's an interview with Hajime Satomi, who's of course the head of Sega
6827000	6831000	and talked about the reputation the company's had over the past ten years
6831000	6835000	and even saying that maybe they've led fans astray a little bit.
6835000	6841000	But noting that acquiring Atlas in 2013 helped Sega understand its situation.
6841000	6842000	In a quote saying,
6842000	6845000	As far as the Western market goes, we learned a lot from Atlas.
6845000	6847000	If we can make a title with proper quality,
6847000	6850000	I believe there's a good chance for it to do well even in the West
6850000	6852000	for players that like to play Japanese games.
6852000	6855000	Sega in the 1990s was known for its brand,
6855000	6859000	but after that we've lost trust and we were left with nothing but reputation.
6859000	6862000	For this week's reason, we'd like to win back the customer's trust
6862000	6864000	and become a brand once again.
6864000	6867000	So it's always nice to hear when people own up to mistakes,
6867000	6872000	such as the 2006 version of Sonic the Hedgehog, but, you know.
6872000	6874000	And every other, you know, since then.
6874000	6876000	Or Sonic the Hedgehog 4, or, you know.
6876000	6879000	Well, the Wii U one was not bad at all.
6879000	6881000	Or Generations was pretty good too.
6881000	6883000	So, anyway.
6883000	6884000	Part of Generations.
6884000	6887000	Anyway, there you go.
6887000	6889000	That's all I have for rapid fire news.
6889000	6890000	Dar Sakura.
6891000	6895000	Well, I mentioned a little bit of this earlier
6895000	6901000	about there being a save importer for Dragon Age Inquisition.
6901000	6906000	Basically you can import your game from the PS3 version to the PS4 version,
6906000	6910000	or from the Xbox 360 version to Xbox One.
6910000	6914000	And there are instructions for this on the actual DragonAge.com website.
6914000	6919000	So go check it out for those who are interested in doing the upgrade.
6920000	6923000	Also, there are a bunch of games heading over to Steam.
6923000	6925000	Some PS1 games.
6925000	6928000	Among them, Battle Arena Toshinden 2.
6928000	6933000	And looks like Nitrous Oxide.
6935000	6937000	Trying to look over here.
6937000	6939000	Yep, that's the game that had Crystal Method stuff in it.
6939000	6941000	Buggy.
6941000	6944000	And Tatunoko Fight.
6944000	6946000	Which I am looking forward to.
6946000	6950000	So, also, and this makes me kind of happy,
6950000	6955000	Tekken 7 is going to certain arcades this month for testing after EVO.
6955000	6962000	Basically it is going to be at a bunch of different Dave and Busters,
6962000	6965000	including the Milpitas one.
6965000	6966000	Oh nice.
6966000	6967000	We need to go there.
6967000	6969000	But what about the one over here?
6969000	6970000	I'm looking at the list.
6970000	6972000	You mean the tiniest Dave and Busters in the galaxy?
6972000	6973000	I don't care.
6973000	6975000	You mean Dave and Buster's Closet?
6975000	6977000	It's more like Dave's Closet. It's the Dave.
6977000	6979000	Dave and Busters.
6979000	6981000	It's just Dave.
6981000	6986000	But yeah, it's coming to Dave and Busters New York on 42nd Street.
6986000	6989000	Dave and Busters Dallas on North Central Expressway.
6989000	6993000	The Milpitas location at the Great Mall Drive.
6993000	6995000	Which I need to go shopping, so it can be a combo day.
6995000	6997000	Tekken and underwear.
6997000	7001000	It's coming to round one, Puente Hills Mall in City of Industry.
7001000	7006000	Round one, South Center Mall in Tequila, Washington.
7006000	7009000	That sounds like tequila. I want some.
7009000	7013000	And round one, Stratford Mall in Bloomingdale, Illinois.
7013000	7016000	Rama's saying it's already at the Dave and Busters in Times Square.
7016000	7018000	So get to it.
7018000	7020000	We are going to have to take a trip to Milpitas.
7020000	7021000	Sounds good.
7021000	7022000	That's it.
7022000	7025000	Alright, then let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
7025000	7029000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.
7029000	7034000	Which, of course, you can access our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
7034000	7039000	And we're on Google Plus at google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
7039000	7044000	This week, since I posted the question much earlier in the day, it was about Comic-Con.
7044000	7048000	And with Comic-Con, of course, we heard about Heroes of the Week.
7048000	7050000	And we had a lot of fun.
7050000	7054000	So we thought we'd ask, what television show would you like to see made into a game?
7054000	7058000	And maybe even, if you can keep it short, tell us a little bit about what the game would be like.
7058000	7060000	Like, how would it play and so forth.
7060000	7062000	So let's start on Google Plus tonight.
7062000	7064000	Because Google Plus never seems to get enough love anymore.
7064000	7068000	So over on Google Plus, we'll start with Redertainment who says,
7068000	7072000	a game based on the Australian TV series Danger 5.
7072000	7074000	I'm thinking something like that.
7074000	7076000	I'm thinking something like that.
7076000	7079000	It's Australian TV series Danger 5.
7079000	7082000	I'm thinking something like Carmen Sandiego.
7082000	7085000	You're given a mission by an obnoxious eagle or person.
7085000	7091000	And your objective is to travel the world hunting various high figures in Germany's Nazi party and kill Hitler.
7091000	7097000	So that's half the plot of that movie you've been obsessed with lately.
7097000	7099000	What's that? Kung Fury. Thank you.
7099000	7101000	Yeah, but Danger 5 gets really strange.
7101000	7104000	Like, second season's really odd.
7104000	7106000	It's like the whole 80s thing.
7106000	7110000	Prince Peach Fuzz over on Google Plus says,
7110000	7114000	I'd love an archer game with some GoldenEye 64-type multiplayer.
7114000	7117000	This answer's already my favorite and I haven't even read them all.
7117000	7124000	The plot would consist of a search for an old taunt treasure with many drinking games and Dr. Krieger experiments.
7124000	7126000	I love this idea.
7126000	7129000	And it needs to be done by the people to do the South Park games.
7129000	7132000	To keep that humor intact, I think.
7133000	7137000	ActDef says, I don't think I want a TV show being turned into a game.
7137000	7141000	A lot of games have been adapted from TV shows tend to suck. Really suck.
7141000	7144000	Although cartoons and the animated shows are a whole other story.
7144000	7146000	Usually because of the liberties they have with them.
7146000	7148000	Well, what about game shows?
7148000	7151000	I guess it's a whole other type of thing.
7151000	7154000	A lot of people don't really consider them TV shows, but I don't know.
7154000	7156000	Tekashi's Castle.
7156000	7158000	Didn't they have a game for that?
7158000	7161000	They didn't. Well, they sort of did.
7161000	7165000	But I would want Tekashi's Castle, but not in the sense that you would think.
7165000	7170000	Not actually playing the game, I would just want to make the obstacle courses for the people to get injured in.
7170000	7176000	And then I'd want to have that playback and I could watch Sims or whatever run through it and hurt themselves.
7176000	7177000	And that'd be hilarious.
7177000	7181000	Breakman in chat says, 1 versus 100. Too soon, you dick.
7181000	7183000	Alright, anyway.
7183000	7189000	Most was the extreme elimination challenge. The dubbed version of that was hilarious.
7189000	7191000	Over on Facebook, some answers.
7191000	7198000	Tech 2030 says, Alias needs to be brought back to TV and they could release a 2D Mark of the Ninja style stealth game to go with it.
7198000	7202000	Silent Tom says, I'd love to see a properly made Team Titans game.
7202000	7206000	It wouldn't be a stretch to use the Arkham Knight engine because they're technically in the same universe.
7206000	7211000	Critical Myth says, most of the first things that come to mind are already getting great adaptations via Telltale.
7211000	7214000	Would love to see what they could do with something like Doctor Who.
7214000	7219000	I would love to see Star Trek pull together a Mass Effect level action RPG.
7219000	7223000	Oh god. I'm not worthy of such an amazing game if they could make something like that.
7223000	7224000	You know what would be hilarious?
7224000	7225000	Huh?
7225000	7229000	It's like Nick Arcade using like, you know, like the Playstation camera or something like that.
7229000	7233000	Hey, 90s nostalgia is real. Like, I think something like that could do like really fucking good.
7233000	7239000	You play the games and stuff and then you have to do the actual, like, challenges where it's against a green screen type thing.
7239000	7240000	Yeah.
7240000	7248000	William Murderface says, I would love to see an XCOM style Agents of Sealed game with some intelligence collecting segments similar to those in Batman Arkham Origins.
7248000	7251000	Also, an Arrow game like the Arkham games.
7253000	7255000	Brad, our buddy from Pod Culture says, I'm pretty lucky.
7255000	7259000	As a geek, most of the shows I like already do have a game of some sort.
7259000	7261000	Star Trek, Doctor Who, The Walking Dead.
7261000	7263000	They all had games. Some better than others.
7263000	7266000	But if I had to pick a single show, it would have to be Arrow.
7266000	7268000	It could easily use the Batman Arkham Knight engine.
7268000	7271000	It could pull in heroes and villains from other DC TV properties.
7271000	7274000	Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl.
7274000	7276000	Haseo Sumeruagawa says, Arrow.
7276000	7279000	It could be translated into a series well or even like a Telltale game.
7279000	7281000	Zether says, Red Dwarf.
7281000	7286000	I think it could work as an adventure game like the inventory based Telltale or LucasArts games.
7286000	7291000	Asserping Slurpee says, movie and TV show and pirate games tend to be quite bad so I'll steer clear of them.
7291000	7293000	But I wouldn't mind a game set in the Firefly universe.
7293000	7295000	It could play like Dragon Age Inquisition.
7295000	7297000	You wouldn't play as the crew of Serenity.
7297000	7301000	The player would have to procure and upgrade his own spaceship and hire a crew.
7301000	7305000	A diverse crew of characters would be optimal as opposed to a crew of all Jane type people.
7305000	7308000	Though I would experiment with a crew of all companions.
7308000	7311000	Fahrenheit, Fire, oh I'm sorry, Russell.
7311000	7314000	I don't know if that's, I think Fahrenheit is the nickname.
7314000	7317000	Fahrenheit says, Firefly for a game.
7317000	7322000	The character Malcolm Reynolds could easily fit in a Telltale game where player choices are made.
7323000	7327000	Fifth Dream says, I would love a Penny Dreadful Telltale game.
7327000	7329000	Or how about a Big Brother game?
7329000	7334000	It would be a lot like The Sims but more adonimous.
7334000	7335000	I can't read that word.
7335000	7336000	Anonymous?
7336000	7337000	No, not anonymous.
7337000	7338000	Autonimous?
7338000	7339000	Autonimous?
7339000	7340000	I'm failing.
7340000	7342000	Until you played competitions.
7342000	7346000	And if The Sims starts getting annoying you could just vote it out of the house.
7346000	7349000	Nemesis 47 says, Doctor Who.
7349000	7354000	I know it's been done before but the series deserves a good console game than a ho-hum puzzle game on the Vita.
7354000	7357000	Or a rushed game just to make a few million in the franchise.
7357000	7361000	If BBC can get the right people and a good idea for the game it can be amazing.
7361000	7366000	And ER says, a lot of my favorite anime shows do get games so I just wish some of them would get translated.
7366000	7369000	I can second the call for Firefly though, I'd love a game set in that universe.
7369000	7374000	And then Justin H says, I would love to see a funny Batman game like the original TV series.
7374000	7376000	I totally am down with that.
7376000	7377000	I would love that too.
7377000	7387000	I still think that they should bring back a series that's basically the old Batman and Robin and the old Batman villains but set in modern day.
7387000	7394000	But not necessarily Batman, it's just these old villains or whatever that have no clue of modern society but they're doing everything the old way.
7394000	7401000	Like, oh we're going to do something, we're going to rob this bank or something and it's just ridiculous.
7401000	7402000	I would love to see that.
7402000	7404000	That's a great idea for a game.
7404000	7408000	Let me go around here in studio quickly because that's all the answers we got.
7408000	7413000	In studio quickly, what do you guys think should become a video game from television, if anything?
7413000	7421000	From television, I would say maybe like, I don't know, I've already mentioned a few.
7421000	7423000	God, what series are we really?
7423000	7430000	Monty Python, how about a Monty Python Holy Grail or a Monty Python turn-based RPG game?
7430000	7432000	There have been Monty Python games.
7432000	7434000	It was a long time ago.
7434000	7436000	It was a complete waste of time.
7436000	7438000	It's been a while though.
7438000	7440000	It's time for an upgrade.
7440000	7442000	That's probably a terrible idea.
7442000	7447000	How about, let's get a game based off of Conan O'Brien.
7447000	7450000	That could be pretty strange.
7450000	7460000	Well my answer is easy and I'm very disappointed in all of the listeners for nobody naming this but clearly the show that needs to be a video game is RuPaul's Drag Race.
7460000	7463000	Hello. Hello.
7463000	7466000	And yes, I know there's Dragopolis on iPhone. That doesn't count.
7466000	7469000	It's not directly tied to the show. It just has a lot of the same people.
7469000	7471000	Darsagra.
7471000	7479000	I really can't think but instead I would like a video game to be made into a TV show and that would be The Adventures of Fem Shep and Garrus.
7479000	7485000	Fair enough. Taking the question and making it her own.
7485000	7486000	I will flip it around.
7487000	7491000	Let's see. Tigerclaw says RuPaul's Drag Race would be a great kart racing game.
7491000	7497000	Bob Coffee says RuPaul's Drag Race would be the Mario Kart clone we didn't need but the one we deserve.
7497000	7500000	Good luck and don't fuck it up.
7500000	7502000	Come on. You know we need a video game with that.
7502000	7505000	You know we need a video game where RuPaul comes on the screen and says,
7505000	7511000	The time has come for you to lip sync for your life, life, life, life.
7512000	7516000	And then we have cameras and shit. Can't cameras read lips in this day and age?
7516000	7521000	Can't the camera know if I'm lip syncing in my living room? Don't they know?
7521000	7523000	Yes, they can technically read lips.
7523000	7524000	Yeah, so I don't know.
7524000	7526000	I don't know how accurate it is.
7526000	7532000	Anyway. Alright, let's move on. We got some more news for you guys before we get to calls. Loki.
7532000	7533000	I don't know.
7534000	7541000	Akuma JP says, The Real Housewives. It would be the slap on the face game.
7541000	7545000	The Real Housewives of Atlanta as a video game.
7547000	7549000	I said what I said.
7552000	7555000	Back to news. I'm sorry. That comment was too good for me to pass up though.
7555000	7561000	So this is kind of a little interesting. Hitman, you know the new reboot or I don't know what they're calling it.
7562000	7564000	I guess it's a reboot, relaunch of the franchise.
7564000	7571000	That's supposed to be coming out later this year actually as a digital download which is kind of strange.
7571000	7577000	So December 8th, they're going to launch it as a download on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
7577000	7581000	But it's not the full game. It's just a part of it.
7581000	7587000	And then throughout 2016, they're going to be releasing more and more of the game until the story arc is done and finished.
7587000	7592000	Of course, all of that content is going to be included within the asking price of $60.
7592000	7595000	But if you wait for the disc, you get that all together.
7595000	7601000	It's kind of interesting. I wonder, is this supposed to be one of the first games that uses that early access thing or something?
7601000	7604000	Where they just kind of put the game out as it's being made?
7604000	7609000	It's also a very interesting way to get around the used game issue.
7609000	7616000	Because if you're getting all these people buying it digitally so that they can get it early, then you don't have to worry about those used games floating around.
7617000	7619000	And those discs can be full priced.
7619000	7623000	I wonder if this isn't going to be a trend. I think that's why this is noteworthy.
7623000	7626000	Are we going to see more digital releases before disc releases?
7626000	7631000	Now granted, this puts the company in a bit of hot water with traditional retailers.
7631000	7641000	But are they using the old excuse where, well, then we can skip the disc printing?
7642000	7648000	Unlike early access games, this will always be a polished Hitman experience.
7648000	7655000	We think the word episodic sets up expectations that we will sell individual content drops for individual prices.
7655000	7657000	But that's not something we're planning on doing.
7657000	7663000	That said, there are some episodic elements to the story in the sense that it's delivered in chunks over time.
7663000	7666000	So experiencing the story will probably feel episodic.
7666000	7675000	But there's also a ton of other content, including live events, which will have nothing to do with the story but will be improving and changing the game constantly while you're playing it.
7675000	7678000	I think it's just a way for them to get the money quicker.
7678000	7687000	And at the same time, if you buy it digitally, you can't have the reviews based on the game because the game's not going to be done yet.
7687000	7695000	So it could be terrible and then people would still be buying it because it may be better later and they could always patch it to be better.
7695000	7703000	It's kind of like what they're doing now with content being broken and stuff, except they're saying it's not going to be broken. It's just not done yet.
7703000	7705000	Just release it when it's done.
7705000	7710000	Brakeman says, I like this, but I don't like this. There's some good things about this, but some bad things.
7710000	7713000	It's harder to ensure quality when you release a game like this.
7713000	7719000	Kaijuto in chat says, it's called Sucker Access. This sounds fucking stupid. Won't buy it.
7719000	7727000	Pow in chat says, well, we're already getting unfinished games. Cough, Assassin's Creed, cough. And I would add to that, cough, Batman on PC, cough.
7727000	7733000	So, hey, now we're just making it official.
7733000	7739000	SHO 100 Matt points out, EA Sports does early access for their sports titles like a week or so early.
7739000	7742000	That you even have to pay for, so that's kind of lame.
7742000	7748000	Yeah, I never saw the need for it, but then again, we're starting to head towards a strictly digital purchase landscape for consoles.
7749000	7758000	Well, I guess one of the perks to buying digitally is that you get games in your digital library that can last for years and years,
7758000	7765000	as I'm finding with my Xbox 360 library and what is showing up on my Xbox One for backwards compatibility.
7765000	7769000	Well, some more notes out on backwards compatibility for the Xbox One this week.
7769000	7775000	And one of those is a form of an approval of sorts from Ubisoft's CEO,
7776000	7784000	Yves Guillemot, who says that the Xbox One's backwards compatibility feature is very good news for the industry.
7784000	7790000	It will help some of the brands like Splinter Cell for us come to the Xbox One, which is great.
7790000	7797000	So, some CEOs seeing that, oh, this could be a good thing because, you know, people can rediscover those old games,
7798000	7805000	especially, you know, in time for folks to play the newest game in the series on the new console or what have you.
7805000	7806000	So that's kind of neat.
7808000	7816000	Also worth pointing out, rumors going around that Burnout Paradise will probably be a thing for Xbox One backwards compatibility.
7816000	7818000	Criterion Games flat out made a tweet.
7818000	7826000	Yes, we are talking to Microsoft about making Xbox 360 Burnout Paradise available on Xbox One via backwards compatibility.
7826000	7827000	More news soon.
7827000	7828000	Yes!
7828000	7833000	So, Criterion Games making it crystal clear, if they can make it happen, it's going to happen.
7833000	7835000	You make it happen, I'll buy it. I mean, I fucking love that game.
7835000	7836000	Yeah?
7836000	7841000	Seriously, I love that game. Of course, I don't have an Xbox One, but I love that game anyway.
7841000	7842000	But you still have a 360.
7842000	7843000	I still have a 360.
7843000	7844000	There you go.
7844000	7851000	So, that's awesome. I think I still have that on disc somewhere, so I got to make a note not to get rid of those discs
7851000	7854000	because a lot of those games are going to come back on Xbox One, so that's pretty cool.
7854000	7855000	I have it on PC, too. I should play it.
7855000	7857000	Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
7857000	7859000	Alright, moving on. DarkSakura.
7859000	7864000	Oh, it would help if my computer would cooperate with me.
7864000	7868000	This is happy news, although I don't think that it's nearly long enough.
7868000	7872000	You know that kid in Canada who did all the swatting stuff?
7872000	7877000	Yes, I do, because we were talking about that a couple weeks ago on the show, I think.
7878000	7886000	Yeah, he was a League of Legends player, and he was apparently a member of Lizard Squad, the little hacking group.
7886000	7899000	Well, I wouldn't say little, more notorious, but he pleaded guilty to over 23 charges of harassment across North America.
7899000	7909000	And he was sentenced to, let me see, 18 months in jail for this.
7909000	7916000	So, that's a year and a half, even though, I mean, he caused a lot of problems.
7916000	7926000	Among the different, what's the word I'm thinking of, the charges were extortion, public mischief, criminal harassment.
7926000	7935000	He was originally going to face more than 40, and he admitted to targeting more than 30 people in the US and Canada between January and December 2014,
7935000	7942000	who were mostly women and gamers who would not accept friend requests or follow requests on social media,
7942000	7946000	and that he had shown a sadistic delight in what he had done.
7946000	7950000	The charge should have been being a fucking asshole, but the Canadians are too nice.
7951000	7964000	Targets were in Polk County, Florida, Phoenix, and Tucson, Arizona, four different communities in California, Minnesota, Utah, and a few places in Ohio and Canada.
7964000	7967000	Don't know specifically where in Canada.
7967000	7973000	They were looking for a two-year custody and supervision order with 16 months in youth detention.
7973000	7983000	What he got is, he got technically 16 months in jail and 8 months under supervision, and has been banned from the internet.
7983000	7990000	Wow. Wow. That takes something to get banned from the entire internet.
7990000	7992000	That also sounds like something that's impossible to do.
7992000	7997000	I know, I'm kind of, well, I mean, but if under law, like, that's fascinating.
7997000	8000000	The Canadian government actually said, you are banned from the internet.
8000000	8003000	And if he, that could mean if he touches the internet, he goes back to jail.
8003000	8008000	They probably think that it's going to be for the term of his sentence and probation.
8008000	8009000	Wow.
8009000	8015000	The thing is that because he's a minor, they can't release his name under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.
8015000	8018000	But, you know, someone's going to find out and put that out there.
8018000	8021000	I hope the parents got a stern talking to.
8021000	8024000	I hope the parents got worse.
8024000	8025000	Yeah.
8026000	8031000	But I just still think that 18 months is light for what he did.
8031000	8039000	I mean, it could just possibly be stupid teenager not thinking things through, or just being an asshole bully.
8039000	8045000	But we need to send a message to other people, because it's not like he's the only person that's ever done this, unfortunately.
8045000	8048000	And we need to send a message that society will not tolerate this bullshit.
8048000	8049000	Period.
8049000	8051000	And parents need to educate their kids.
8051000	8056000	And if your kid is being an asshole, you know, smack them, you know, verbally.
8056000	8058000	Discipline. Have discipline.
8058000	8060000	Discipline. Thank you. That's a good way to put it.
8060000	8061000	All right.
8061000	8063000	Kind of along those same lines.
8063000	8072000	Speaking of Lizard Squad, there is another member of Lizard Squad who has been convicted, Julius Kibimaki.
8072000	8080000	And apparently he's been convicted with 50,000 counts of cybercrime, including harassment, fraud, and data breaches.
8080000	8083000	And he was a part of the group that took down...
8083000	8084000	50,000?
8084000	8085000	50,000.
8085000	8096000	And he was a part of the group that did DDoS attacks against Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, that took it down during December of last year.
8096000	8107000	And, you know, ultimately I think he stopped when Kim Dotcom actually bribed them with $300,000 worth of vouchers towards Mega.
8107000	8117000	And now with this, this basically so far what they've brought up charges against him amounts to two years of a suspended sentence.
8117000	8127000	But with that, though, there's one of the developers that was actually being targeted by this, John Smedley.
8127000	8129000	He is...
8129000	8132000	He's out for blood now, basically.
8132000	8137000	He's the president of the former Sony Online Air Team president.
8137000	8145000	And, you know, he was aboard the American Airlines flight when they issued a fake bomb threat.
8145000	8149000	You know, having his plane turn around because of safety reasons.
8149000	8151000	Oh, God, I remember that.
8151000	8154000	That was, oh, that was rude, to say the least.
8155000	8162000	And, you know, basically he has there's a string of tweets, which I will go ahead and read right now in regards to this.
8162000	8164000	So that was a piece of garbage.
8164000	8169000	That was the piece of garbage that brought down my plane, leaked my information, did all kinds of crap to me.
8169000	8177000	It's important to note he was convicted of crimes that he had nothing to do yet with the PSN DDoS over Christmas.
8177000	8179000	Yes, he was a part of that.
8179000	8184000	And he still has 15 other criminal cases awaiting prosecution in Finland.
8184000	8187000	I may go after his parents in civil court, too, little dirtbag.
8187000	8195000	So stay tuned because what security, that's his name on Twitter, he's a sociopath and he will get what's coming to him.
8195000	8201000	What they won't tell you is that he did jail time already and got his ass kicked hard inside.
8201000	8208000	The FBI nailed this guy, literally, immediately took the Finnish government long to catch up.
8208000	8216000	Basically, I also got to listen to the entire conversation between him and American Airlines the day he called in the bomb threat.
8216000	8221000	His parents need to be held accountable for his actions in addition to his going to jail.
8221000	8223000	So I'm coming for you, Julius.
8223000	8224000	Wow.
8227000	8228000	Don't hold back.
8228000	8229000	Yes.
8230000	8234000	I mean, how do you like how do you not know what your kid is doing?
8234000	8242000	I mean, you know, oh, he just committed 50,000 acts of computer espionage and harassment stuff.
8242000	8243000	Man.
8244000	8245000	Whatever.
8245000	8252000	Tigerclaw is pointing out in chat that there's a follow up and it sounds like there was some type of retaliation attack for those tweets.
8254000	8258000	Just, my God. Garbage. Garbage, garbage, garbage.
8259000	8260000	Seriously.
8260000	8264000	All right. Well, let's let's shift gears here significantly.
8264000	8268000	I want to talk about some more information that's coming out of Comic-Con.
8268000	8273000	And that is some Street Fighter V news, because, you know, Comic-Con, they do get video game things as well.
8273000	8277000	And they did announce a new character for Street Fighter V at Comic-Con.
8277000	8279000	That character is Ken.
8279000	8282000	So in other news, the pope is Catholic.
8282000	8284000	Sky is blue.
8284000	8286000	So they changed his moves.
8286000	8287000	Yeah, they did.
8287000	8290000	They've done some changes to Ken a little bit.
8290000	8293000	Your eye rolling over there. How are you feeling?
8293000	8294000	Dan's going to be pissed.
8294000	8295000	Oh, because of the Ken changes?
8295000	8296000	That's his guy.
8296000	8297000	Yeah.
8297000	8301000	Don't worry. They will sell a classic costume pack, I'm sure, for only five dollars.
8301000	8304000	It doesn't matter the costume. It matters that his move set's different.
8307000	8309000	That'll be very interesting.
8309000	8315000	So anyhow, also announced at Comic-Con, there's going to be a crossover comic book, Street Fighter X G.I. Joe.
8315000	8322000	So, you know, how appropriate that they're actually talking comic books at Comic-Con, but I'm sure that potential's pretty rad there.
8322000	8326000	But doesn't sound like that's going to have any ultimate impact on the video games.
8326000	8328000	But there you go.
8328000	8332000	So Ken is coming to Street Fighter V, but you may not like it.
8332000	8337000	We'll see when the game goes into beta testing, what, later this month?
8337000	8338000	Isn't his hair different now, too?
8338000	8339000	It is. It is.
8339000	8340000	I mean...
8340000	8341000	Why'd you mess up his hair?
8342000	8349000	I also, though, I do understand, like, you can't do the same thing over and over and over. You gotta try something new.
8349000	8355000	Honestly, back in the Street Fighter II days, it's like, okay, he's just kind of like a... it's another Ryu character.
8355000	8358000	Right. Yeah, Ryu and Ken were like the same, you know, but different.
8358000	8359000	Yeah.
8359000	8364000	Didn't Ryu have a better fireball and then Ken had a better dragon punch?
8364000	8365000	Yep.
8365000	8366000	Was that the thing? Yeah.
8366000	8367000	So...
8367000	8368000	Alright.
8368000	8369000	But that's, like, minor.
8369000	8372000	Alright, let's get to the emails. You guys send us emails every week.
8372000	8376000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.
8376000	8380000	And every week you guys send us emails and we read some of our favorites here on the show.
8380000	8385000	So let's get to the emails. And why, again, do I not have the theme?
8385000	8387000	I'm like, this is like, what, three weeks in a row now?
8387000	8390000	I guess I somehow deleted it from the default playlist or something.
8390000	8392000	How's that possible?
8392000	8394000	I don't know. Pick something different.
8394000	8395000	I'll see what I can dig up.
8395000	8396000	Pick Buffalo.
8397000	8402000	Or I can dig it up and I can find the theme.
8402000	8405000	So here it is. Tonight's mailbag.
8409000	8410000	Oops.
8416000	8417000	Jeez.
8417000	8422000	Hello, OLR crew. I probably love the show.
8422000	8423000	Probably.
8423000	8424000	You might.
8424000	8426000	That's what it says. Question.
8426000	8428000	I think this is the feeling that I'm feeling.
8429000	8431000	Is Mario real or unreal?
8431000	8435000	I just want to know if any of you have seen the trailer of Mario running on the Unreal Engine.
8435000	8442000	Way back on OLR episode 461 during the mailbag segment, DarkStalker demanded that Mario be developed running on the Unreal Engine.
8442000	8443000	I did.
8443000	8446000	And now we can see it. Thank you, LoveSam.
8446000	8450000	I did hear about the Mario in the Unreal Engine demo. I did see that.
8450000	8453000	Someone recreating Mario 64 in Unreal Engine.
8453000	8457000	Well, there was that a while ago, but now there's like a new one. There's another like new.
8457000	8460000	It's like here's Mario and like this. We set him up like that.
8460000	8464000	You know, Mario 64 engine type stuff, but he's just right through random scenes.
8464000	8467000	Hold on, because there's something else that concerns me about this email.
8467000	8470000	I'm sorry. What episode number did they say you requested this in?
8470000	8471000	461.
8471000	8477000	Do you know how? We're on episode 605. So 461 would have been like three years ago.
8477000	8479000	How did you know that?
8479000	8489000	No, I think that's awesome. I'm just I just I don't know how I will do this way in a good way.
8489000	8499000	I am blown away and I'm obscenely flattered that many of our listeners out there know this show better than I do.
8499000	8501000	I don't know.
8501000	8508000	Granted, every show is out there on the I mean, I think still every show for the past like five years is available on orange.com.
8508000	8511000	We haven't deleted anything. We did have to purge at one point several years ago.
8511000	8516000	But even the oldest shows like you go into chat and ask dark Tetsuya where the old shows,
8516000	8521000	because there's this whole like virtual drive set up that you can log into and there's like all these old shows.
8521000	8526000	So I know there's like really dedicated people out there that listen to like multiple episodes of O.L.R.
8526000	8534000	a week. And I, I, I'm always like deeply flattered by that because I don't think I could listen to that much O.L.R.
8534000	8537000	I can't listen to any of my voice.
8537000	8544000	Oh, I don't. Yeah. I mean, I when I listen to the old episodes, I'm a little critical, like, oh, God, we were such a hot mess.
8544000	8548000	But, you know, I also kind of go were we true.
8548000	8552000	We learned just a hot mess with better shoes. We learned we learned from it all.
8552000	8560000	We really do. So anyway, I love it.
8560000	8563000	Last email. Hello. Smiley face.
8563000	8574000	Firstly, did you know? Oh, God, please spelling. Did you know that there is to be a film sequel to American McGee's Alice Madness Returns called Alice Otherlands?
8574000	8579000	But no third game. Alice the Madness Returns was the second game in the series.
8579000	8584000	That was awesome. My husband did ask Mr. McGee if there would be a third game.
8584000	8589000	And he said there weren't any plans. But we. But if we won it, let you know.
8589000	8596000	Any ideas? No, I never played the first one, so I wasn't too into it.
8596000	8605000	Yeah, I'm a little out of the loop, admittedly, on the Alice games, you know, because just I don't have enough time in the week to play everything that's out.
8605000	8611000	But I remember when Alice Madness Returns came out, because that was a pretty big deal, because that came out quite a few years after the original.
8611000	8614000	And it was on PlayStation three and Xbox 360.
8614000	8619000	And that was like 10 years after the first one. And it's a very stylistic kind of game.
8619000	8627000	So maybe if you wait another 10 years, there'll be a third game in the Alice series.
8627000	8635000	But, yeah, no, they American McGee's gone on record saying that they've always envisioned it as a trilogy and that they do have a story available for a third game.
8636000	8644000	But only if, you know, the audience basically demands it, because I know the second game was not incredibly well reviewed.
8644000	8650000	It was kind of lukewarm. But, you know, not that reviews are everything. It's really about sales.
8650000	8654000	I have friends that are really into the series and the mythology around it. Are you okay?
8654000	8658000	Yeah, I'm fine. This desk is broken. I have to fix it. That's all.
8658000	8660000	Okay. Maybe it's time for an Ikea trip.
8660000	8669000	Maybe it is. But, yeah, it's pretty. I like the scenery in it. It just, I wasn't really doing a lot of PC gaming when it came out.
8669000	8672000	So, no.
8672000	8677000	Fifth Dream says Kickstarted it. It's about to come out a series of animated shorts.
8677000	8681000	He can't get the rights from EA, but he has the movie rights.
8681000	8684000	I was going to say he should just go to Kickstarter, but aha, that's right.
8684000	8689000	EA put out that second game. They're probably sitting on the rights and don't want to do it.
8689000	8690000	I know.
8690000	8696000	Secondly, I wanted to let you know about a game I found on the Steam sale a few weeks back called Parcel.
8696000	8707000	It's a puzzle game where you need to get a Parcel box and one or more characters from one place across the stream to somewhere else through laser obstacles.
8707000	8711000	The Parcel box can be used to block the lasers so the character can get past them.
8712000	8720000	There are several different areas, each with a number of levels, and each area has a new character that interacts with the box in a different way.
8720000	8727000	It is well structured with very easy tutorial levels to really quite hard levels in each area.
8727000	8730000	I have been stuck several times. Stuck now.
8730000	8739000	The problem is that their advertising sucks and I don't think many people have found it, which also means there isn't much help when you can't work it out.
8739000	8744000	Fortunately, you don't have to complete every level to move on. I may need to skip the current one.
8744000	8751000	Anyway, I think this is a great game that deserves a mention. Hopefully more people will find it and work out what I can't.
8751000	8755000	Thanks for being a great show to entertain me on a Monday morning. Kitten Poker.
8755000	8761000	You're welcome. Wow, that's like two new names I don't totally recognize this week in the email bags.
8761000	8763000	I think Kitten Poker is from the UK.
8763000	8766000	Well, thank you all for emailing us. It's really awesome.
8767000	8776000	I know I've seen it somewhere before, probably just flipping through stuff on Steam. Maybe I'll go check it out. I like a good puzzle game.
8776000	8780000	Paging Raginator because he knows a lot about those Steam games. I don't know if he's played Parcel.
8780000	8786000	No, I had not heard of it, but I will have to browse Steam and look up more information on that.
8786000	8794000	I appreciate heads up from listeners because there's so much out there, especially on Steam and the mobile stores, Google Play and iPhone.
8794000	8802000	There's so much out there that, without recommendations, it's hard to sort through it all.
8802000	8804000	Keep us in the loop.
8804000	8809000	Alright, participate at orangelaungerator.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.
8809000	8815000	Now it is time to get to the FUs of the week. Why? Because angst and stuff.
8824000	8836000	FU goes towards managing FMLA stuff. That's it.
8836000	8847000	FU to my game because the whole concept they came up with originally about it being a broken game and stuff.
8848000	8854000	Fortunately, I've seen it done elsewhere now. They have this new game that just released that actually looks really awesome at this point.
8854000	8860000	It's a different genre altogether, but the way they handled it being a broken game is pretty hilarious.
8860000	8864000	But yeah, unfortunately, mine's not up to that level yet, but that's fine.
8864000	8874000	FU to the fact that I have to get up really early again tomorrow. I've been having to do the early stuff a lot lately and I'm not a morning person.
8875000	8881000	FU to morning people. I don't know how you do it. You must have lots of donuts and coffees. I think that's the only way I could do it.
8881000	8885000	Red Bull. That's the only way I stay awake in the morning.
8885000	8887000	No, I can't do Red Bull.
8887000	8897000	I stay up late. Lately though, I've been just working on stuff and I literally fall asleep while I'm working on stuff. That's how old I'm getting.
8897000	8905000	Rama in chat says, my new job has me up at 5 a.m. I feel you. And that's like 2 a.m. my time. I don't even know how you do it. How are you listening to this show right now?
8905000	8907000	I mean, thank you, but oh my God.
8907000	8911000	Yeah, my new job does that to me too. It's called Kids.
8911000	8913000	Oh my God. No, no, no.
8913000	8914000	And people wonder why I don't want to.
8914000	8922000	Yeah, right? I'm like, no, no, no. The cat's bad enough. The cat gets us up every morning now at 6 o'clock. She's throwing herself against the door now if she can't get in.
8922000	8923000	You know what?
8923000	8924000	What?
8924000	8926000	Dan feeds Midna in the morning.
8926000	8928000	Well, yeah, Alan will get up and go feed Sanrio.
8928000	8930000	I won't hear a thing.
8930000	8935000	Well, I sleep with earplugs on just so I don't have to hear that or anything.
8935000	8937000	White noise machine is what you need.
8937000	8939000	We have a fan that makes white noise.
8939000	8941000	Oh, we didn't even want to...
8941000	8945000	Technically, fans typically make brown noise. It's a lower frequency.
8945000	8947000	I don't want brown noise in the bedroom.
8947000	8950000	White noise is usually high pitched.
8950000	8962000	Well, whatever we have. We have the sound of a box fan. It's an 11 hour MP3 that I have playing through a set of computer speakers with a subwoofer.
8962000	8968000	And we play it for my kid to stay asleep. And it's fantastic. There's so much white noise in my house.
8968000	8970000	Is it box fantastic?
8970000	8977000	It's box fantastic, yeah. But it's just like, it's so relaxing. Except my wife hates it.
8977000	8981000	I just don't want the brown note when I try to sleep, because I have a nice bed. I don't want to ruin it.
8981000	8985000	There's no such thing as a brown note. They've already busted that myth.
8985000	8987000	At any rate...
8987000	8991000	On the last episode of OLR, we will play the brown note. That'll be how we go out.
8991000	8996000	I have an air filter in our room. And it does pretty well for us.
8996000	8999000	Yeah, that's what my son uses. My other son, he has a...
8999000	9004000	And honestly enough, Midna doesn't whine or paw at the door, but she will try to get into bed and sleep with me.
9005000	9011000	Because they go fucking crazy for that shit. My cat was whining at me for Saffa. I'm like, Saffa's right there on the floor.
9011000	9015000	You just ate some a second ago. What the hell you want?
9015000	9018000	Midna gets crunchy, grain-free cat food.
9018000	9024000	Alright, Brad is complaining that that would be a shitty way to go out on our last episode.
9024000	9027000	Our last episode is going to be...
9027000	9031000	We'll play a note so epic that shit will fly out of your ass.
9031000	9036000	Much like Mentos causes dipepsy to fly out of the bottles.
9036000	9039000	No, I think in reality I just want to play Porky Pig at the end.
9039000	9041000	That's all, folks. That's it.
9041000	9045000	And they copyright strike by Warner Brothers.
9047000	9051000	Alright, let's get to it. Some more news.
9051000	9056000	And then Skype Line is going to open up at 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9056000	9058000	But first, Loki.
9058000	9061000	But first, let's talk about Nintendo again.
9061000	9063000	And Animal Crossing.
9063000	9071000	You may remember that the next couple Animal Crossing games are quite up to the level standards that we're kind of used to as far as an Animal Crossing game.
9071000	9083000	We kind of think, okay, you're supposed to build a town, pay off that goddamn loan from Tom Nook, and then the mortgage never ends because you're always doing improvements and shit like that.
9083000	9085000	And there's all these townsfolk that piss you off.
9085000	9091000	But now they have this board game thing and some house designer thing that's going to be super expensive.
9091000	9094000	So you're going, why did they even make these games in the first place?
9094000	9096000	Well, here's why.
9096000	9104000	Initially, when the Amiibo was announced, there was nothing really to be said about Animal Crossing Amiibos or any of the plans for that matter.
9104000	9110000	But, as Animal Crossing team, we were confident that if there was one, it would be really cute.
9110000	9113000	And honestly, we just wanted Animal Crossing Amiibo.
9113000	9120000	We wanted the company to make Animal Crossing Amiibos, so that's why we made a game that works with them.
9120000	9125000	So you put that shit together just to make some fucking Amiibos for Animal Crossing.
9125000	9129000	You could have put a little bit more effort into that.
9129000	9133000	This is why I'm really worried the bubble's about to burst on Amiibo.
9133000	9137000	Things like that where it's just not even about the game anymore.
9137000	9141000	It's like you could have said, oh, well, we just wanted to put a...
9141000	9148000	That's why we made our Animal Crossing game that's super fucking awesome support Amiibo in this really unique way.
9148000	9153000	No one said they took these away and, eh, we just kind of pieced together something that uses Amiibos.
9153000	9157000	Because that's the only way we get Animal Crossing Amiibos.
9160000	9166000	Alright. I got nothing. I'm not pre-ordering that game. That's all I have to say on that.
9168000	9174000	I do want that NES sprite Mario thing, though, which will probably do something in Mario Maker.
9174000	9176000	That I do want, but...
9176000	9180000	It would be cool if it unlocked, like, the first Mario game or something.
9180000	9188000	Or, hey, if we're feeling really generous, the first, second, third, maybe lost levels, and Super Mario World games.
9188000	9192000	Well, I think... I don't know if the original levels are in there, but...
9192000	9198000	You know, like, the template for Mario Bros. 1 and Mario World, that's all in there, so...
9198000	9200000	That'll be interesting.
9200000	9201000	I do kind of want that game.
9201000	9207000	YYR says the Mario sprite Amiibo will likely be exclusive to eight Best Buy locations.
9207000	9208000	Bite your tongue.
9208000	9210000	I'm sorry, eight GameStop locations.
9210000	9213000	And there will only be eight of them in each location.
9213000	9220000	Anyhow, all that aside, last week we had some laughs during a segment called Match Game, right?
9220000	9224000	And the epic question had to do with Splatoon's Splatfest.
9224000	9228000	And I'll just leave it to you to go back and listen to last week's show.
9228000	9229000	That's all I'm going to say.
9229000	9231000	However, we also got into it a little bit.
9231000	9236000	ActDeaf and I may have had some words about Team Cat versus Team Dog.
9236000	9239000	So we talked about what should the next Splatfest be.
9239000	9248000	Well, clearly, the powers that be at Nintendo right now, the powers that be decided something different.
9248000	9249000	They were not listening to the show.
9249000	9253000	And they have announced what the next Splatfest theme will be.
9253000	9260000	So on July 17th, which is when the next Splatfest will be from 9 p.m. Pacific time to July 18th at 9 p.m. Pacific time,
9260000	9268000	it will be Team Roller Coasters versus Team Water Slides.
9268000	9270000	Not water sports, people.
9270000	9271000	Water Slides.
9271000	9273000	Roller Coasters and Water Slides.
9273000	9276000	How does Roller Coasters not win this?
9276000	9279000	Especially when you know that it's based on participation as well.
9279000	9281000	Aren't Water Slides roller coasters?
9281000	9284000	I mean, technically, I guess not.
9284000	9289000	But I sort of see Water Slides as just roller coasters where you're the vehicle.
9289000	9290000	It's as easy.
9290000	9294000	Water Slides, you got to walk your ass up to the top of that water slide.
9294000	9297000	It's involving waiting lines and shit like that.
9297000	9298000	That's fucking effort.
9298000	9300000	Roller Coaster does a lot of shit for you.
9300000	9302000	There's no fucking walking to the top of the hill.
9302000	9304000	That's what the chain's for.
9305000	9308000	Or even now, it's magnets.
9308000	9309000	How do they work?
9309000	9310000	It's all magnets now.
9310000	9311000	Exactly.
9311000	9314000	If you ride a California Xtreme or the Roller Coasters.
9314000	9317000	Now, you showed me a water park that has an elevator that goes up to the top.
9317000	9320000	Maybe on even playing field here.
9320000	9322000	But so far, they're not willing to install that kind of shit.
9322000	9326000	I like the Water Slides where you get to the top and you're standing on the thing and then they pull the lever.
9326000	9328000	Pull the lever. Wrong lever.
9328000	9329000	And then you fall.
9329000	9330000	So, awesome.
9330000	9333000	Anyhow, actually, what team is Deft on?
9333000	9334000	Because I'm going to be on the other team.
9334000	9335000	I'm just kidding.
9335000	9338000	No, Deft has already proclaimed Team Roller Coaster.
9338000	9340000	I think we can agree.
9340000	9342000	We can agree on that one, Team Roller Coaster.
9342000	9344000	So, I'm going to do that one.
9344000	9347000	I mean, they have Roller Coaster of Love.
9347000	9350000	Do they have any sort of water slide songs?
9350000	9351000	No.
9353000	9358000	Let's see, SSG100Matt says there's water slides where water jets push you up hills.
9358000	9359000	Really?
9359000	9361000	Yeah. And you know where they got the idea from?
9361000	9362000	Roller Coasters.
9364000	9367000	They actually do have the water jet ones over at Sunsplash over here.
9367000	9369000	I've never been to Sunsplash. I feel too old.
9369000	9372000	Who wants to see this old fat man at the water?
9372000	9374000	But granted, there's probably a ton of them.
9374000	9376000	It's Golf Land Sunsplash already, so whatever.
9378000	9383000	Alright, 1877GameOLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9383000	9387000	If you have something you'd like to talk about tonight, please give us a call.
9387000	9389000	We will chat about whatever is on your mind tonight.
9389000	9395000	That's 1877GameOLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9395000	9397000	Meanwhile, while we wait, do you have any last minute stories?
9397000	9405000	No, but I'd like to mention though, since it hasn't been mentioned, that Ernie Cline's new book comes out this week, Armada.
9405000	9409000	Which is sort of kind of based off of Last Starfighter.
9409000	9414000	So, if you're into that whole 80's homage crap, then you might want to check that out.
9414000	9417000	Alright, I have a call on the line waiting, sorry. Let's get to it.
9417000	9418000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9420000	9421000	This is YYR.
9421000	9423000	Hey, YYR, buddy. How you doing?
9425000	9428000	Oh, not too bad, not too bad. Managed to survive.
9428000	9432000	We just went through all the trash in our apartment building.
9432000	9438000	Our landlord was like, you're keeping too much stuff in the garage to all the residents of this building.
9439000	9441000	And he was basically like, get it out now.
9441000	9445000	Which makes the job of going through the trash much more difficult and time consuming.
9445000	9446000	But we survived.
9446000	9447000	You did it.
9447000	9453000	Just imagine that you're playing the old Nickelodeon game show, Finders Keepers.
9453000	9456000	Which the whole object was to dig through the trash.
9457000	9459000	Oh, but you don't want to keep any of this stuff.
9459000	9460000	That's true.
9460000	9461000	Trust me.
9461000	9462000	Well, what's on your mind, my friend?
9463000	9470000	Well, actually, I just called because I wanted to mention something that, a new story that I thought was very interesting.
9470000	9475000	But if you look at all the major gaming sites, they basically don't talk about it at all.
9477000	9483000	And basically what this is, is there's a site out there, it's called rollolo.net.
9483000	9488000	And these people, honestly, I don't know what the heck the site is for.
9488000	9491000	But there's this one guy on there and his name is Yifan Lu.
9492000	9501000	And he announced a couple of months ago that there's an exploit for the PlayStation Vita and TV.
9501000	9503000	Because it's essentially a PlayStation Vita.
9503000	9509000	That is forthcoming and will allow people to play homebrew.
9509000	9513000	You know, some sort of exploit, hack, whatever.
9514000	9520000	That, you know, it's already been possible to run PSP homebrew on Vita.
9520000	9523000	Because there's essentially a PSP in the Vita.
9523000	9528000	But native actual Vita homebrew hadn't been possible up until now.
9528000	9532000	And basically he said, this involves PlayStation Mobile.
9532000	9536000	So you really should sign up to be a PlayStation Mobile developer.
9536000	9542000	And specifically he also mentioned the PlayStation Mobile Development Assistant.
9542000	9547000	And said that we should all download it and further details are forthcoming.
9547000	9552000	So back on June 14th, he announced Rejuvenate.
9552000	9562000	Which was basically his name for this development kit and exploit allowing native homebrew on Vita.
9562000	9568000	And, you know, he explained how it directly involves the development assistant.
9569000	9575000	And then I guess Sony just kind of shit a brick and said, oh god, oh god, what do we do now?
9575000	9582000	So eight days later, on the 22nd of June, Sony posted an announcement on the PlayStation Mobile site.
9582000	9589000	And mind you, right before this happened, I submitted an update to Pixel Poops.
9589000	9591000	Which went through and is for sale.
9592000	9594000	It just makes the game a little easier.
9594000	9598000	The joggers don't cross the Taco Bell rows and columns before a certain point.
9598000	9605000	And then, you know, they don't cross the Taco Bell eating space until a little after that.
9605000	9607000	I thought you had to give it a different name.
9607000	9609000	I thought it was a different name.
9609000	9612000	I thought you had to give it a different name to avoid copyright issues.
9612000	9615000	Is it like Taco Place or something? I don't know.
9615000	9617000	Oh, actually I don't name it at all within the game.
9617000	9619000	It's just assumed that it's Taco Bell.
9619000	9621000	Alright, fair enough.
9621000	9626000	So anyway, the announcement that Sony posted on a page, I think this is pretty interesting.
9626000	9631000	It says, it's titled, please stop using and delete PSM development assistant.
9631000	9635000	And they say, a software issue was found in the development assistant.
9635000	9641000	For those developers using it, we kindly ask you to stop using the application and delete it from your PlayStation Vita.
9641000	9644000	We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
9644000	9648000	I need to go download this and sign up.
9649000	9655000	If you go to the PlayStation dev portal, which is at PSM.PlayStation.net,
9655000	9660000	in the bottom left corner you'll see there's like recent announcements and that's right at the top.
9660000	9662000	Does it cost anything to sign up for a dev kit?
9662000	9671000	It's been a while since I watched PushyPixels and their whole team in Cooking Unity sign up on that.
9671000	9676000	I just don't remember if it costs anything to sign up as a PlayStation dev.
9676000	9679000	Well you know what, it's too late now anyway. They're not accepting Play...
9679000	9683000	Because PlayStation Mobile is shutting down sales in three days anyway.
9683000	9686000	So it's too late for that now.
9686000	9694000	But here's the thing, the development assistant was actually necessary to test things out on the Vita before you try to release.
9694000	9704000	So basically from that day forward, two days after that on the 24th, they released a new firmware for the Vita, 3.52.
9704000	9713000	And the sole change was they plugged the hole and they basically stopped the dev assistant from working because it requires the latest firmware.
9713000	9717000	So now there's absolutely no way to test your things on Vita.
9717000	9721000	So anyone who was trying to get an update through at the last second, they basically were screwed.
9721000	9724000	Oh my gosh.
9724000	9740000	And meanwhile, they posted an update on this WoLolo.net saying, well, Sony didn't take kindly to what we were doing, so if you want to be able to run Homebrew on your Vita at some point, do not update past 3.51.
9740000	9746000	And it's still in beta, but they're going to be announcing more details soon.
9746000	9756000	But if you actually want to use your Vita to play current games and play online or do whatever, then it's just like the previous gen consoles, you have to make a choice.
9756000	9759000	Do you want to use it for hacks or do you want to use it for games?
9759000	9765000	I would have still thought that they would try to somehow transition this a little better.
9765000	9771000	You know, there's people out there that want to develop, that want to do things on the Vita, and the Vita kind of needs a little love.
9771000	9775000	I hope they do come up with something to roll it right over onto the Vita.
9775000	9781000	I hope they do something to replace that or even have it just as easy to do that for PlayStation 4.
9781000	9788000	I mean, I understand they don't want it to turn out to be some sort of Xbox Indies or whatever where there's a ton of stuff on there.
9788000	9790000	I actually kind of don't care about that.
9790000	9796000	From what I've heard, there was a little bit of a developer backlash when Xbox Indies came out and they're like,
9796000	9808000	Well, you know, we pay a lot of money and we put a lot of effort into releasing games on console and now you have these people and they can just release games on the console with very little expense and very little effort.
9808000	9817000	So I think there was some kind of pushback and that's why I think maybe Xbox Live indie games aren't going to be part of the backwards compatibility on one.
9817000	9824000	Man, too bad. I'm sorry that they're upset that their games are competing against other things.
9824000	9831000	I mean, a lot of them aren't selling as well as an Xbox Live arcade game. Plus, the exposure wasn't as good.
9831000	9839000	They're behind another curtain. A lot of people always said the indie games weren't really ever featured. They were hard to find stuff. So, I don't know. Anyway.
9839000	9845000	Well, YYR, I appreciate you bringing this to the forefront, especially if other places aren't covering it. I think it's good to know.
9845000	9850000	I'm sorry to hear that mobile is going to be taking its last breath in a couple days here.
9850000	9852000	God, I've got to download that game quickly.
9852000	9855000	Yeah, you better get on it.
9855000	9860000	If you already downloaded something, you'll be able to re-download it until, I believe, mid-August.
9860000	9861000	I've got to do it tonight then.
9861000	9868000	Or was it September? I can't remember. It's on the site. And then after that, you won't be able to re-download. You won't be able to do anything. It's all gone.
9868000	9871000	I was backing up to my PC or something.
9871000	9879000	Fifth Dream says, I couldn't find Pixel Poops. Quickly, for the Monday crowd hearing this and for our live crowd, how can you find Pixel Poops easy?
9880000	9887000	You can't do it from the web store. It's not accessible there. PlayStation Store on the web, PlayStation Mobile is invisible.
9887000	9894000	You have to go on the Vita or PlayStation TV itself, go into the PlayStation Store, and then along the top you'll see a few tabs.
9894000	9903000	The rightmost one is PlayStation Mobile. If you go there and then you click on New Releases, you'll find it somewhere towards the top.
9903000	9904000	Alright.
9904000	9916000	And I appreciate anyone who goes and decides to spend the 79 cents on it. Thank you. I'll be about 49 cents a day when they pay me in November.
9916000	9920000	I'm glad we could at least hopefully get you a beer out of this.
9920000	9931000	That would be fantastic. And whoever bought it, if I see you in person, maybe I'll treat you to 49 cents out of a beer also.
9931000	9936000	There it goes. There it goes. I love it. Alright. Alright, have a good one my friend. You take care.
9936000	9938000	Have a great week.
9938000	9939000	Alright.
9939000	9940000	Take care.
9940000	9941000	Bye bye now.
9941000	9947000	Alright, phone lines are lighting up over at 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, but we have another call right now. Let's get to it.
9947000	9949000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9949000	9950000	Hey guys, it's Jason.
9950000	9952000	Hey Jason. How you doing?
9952000	9953000	Doing pretty good yourself.
9953000	9959000	Good. Sorry we missed you in the intro tonight, but you know, we had the rough news at the top of the show, but I'm glad we can hear from you now.
9959000	9965000	Completely understandable. Besides, I just kind of have to get my 13 seconds in, so bye guys.
9965000	9967000	Ah, stop. Stop. What's on your mind tonight?
9967000	9975000	I just wanted to drop two little trivia bombs that were touched on in some of the nostalgia, but didn't really go anywhere that kind of caught my ear.
9975000	9976000	Please.
9976000	9984000	You pointed out to Loki, he was talking about Takeshi's Castle game and MXC as we know it in America, and you said that it did exist.
9985000	10004000	I don't know how many people know this, but Takeshi's Castle, I assume emulators have evolved since I first tried to play it, but I actually got a hold of a ROM for that and tried playing it in the late 90s, early 2000s, and nothing was working, and me and my friend were just completely stumped.
10004000	10015000	Fast forward a couple of years later in just complete and total circumstance, Takeshi's Castle was a game that required the second player Famicom controller because of the microphone.
10015000	10028000	It was a game that took place entirely by song, rhythm, and pitch. I don't even know how detailed those microphones were back in the day, but it's something that you had to sing.
10028000	10035000	My understanding is basically something along the lines of Japanese folk songs in order to progress your character through the game.
10035000	10044000	And so as it comes to emulators that would have implemented support for that kind of thing back in the day, as far as I was aware, that was practically non-existent.
10044000	10055000	Yeah, you're right, because those microphones were used in some other crazy things too, but one of the other well-known ones is Legend of Zelda. There's the pole's voice or whatever they were called.
10055000	10066000	You were supposed to be able to stun them or kill them or something by using the microphone. When they ported it over to the US, you didn't have that at all, so I think it's just used an arrow to kill them or something a little simpler.
10066000	10077000	Yeah, definitely a lot more rudimentary for the American crowd. Fun bout of trivia. The other one is that I know the connotation, I think also something that Loki pointed out.
10077000	10088000	The connotation was something that you could do playing in your home since cameras are evolving so much as they are, but he brought up a Nick arcade game that you could actually play.
10089000	10097000	I'm not fairly certain. I know it was covered on this show. Did anybody ever pay attention to the Nth level Kickstarter?
10097000	10100000	Was that the one where they were trying to bring back the show?
10100000	10101000	Yep.
10101000	10112000	Yeah, I do remember talking about it. I feel like it might have been a rapid fire thing, because usually unless we have the Kickstarter person on the show, we don't spend a lot of time about Kickstarters.
10112000	10121000	Unless it's really huge, like blood stained or whatever. But yeah, I feel like we addressed it briefly on the show. I remember hearing about it. Did they ever make the money?
10121000	10138000	No. Nth level was asking for something, I think it was either $300,000 or $400,000 or something along those lines, and they only got backed for like $30,000. So they didn't even get to six figures, not even close to even half back or anything like that.
10138000	10139000	Yikes.
10139000	10140000	Yeah.
10140000	10144000	But that was more to bring back the show, not to make an actual game of it, right?
10145000	10165000	Correct. It is to do the show as a production with the original cast. I mean, Kickstarter has all of their projects up, so you can still go search for ENTH level and still see everything that they were bringing together, which sounded pretty solid and may still happen if they get funding otherwise.
10165000	10176000	It just may not be as, you know, backer, consumer oriented as the show may have been with individual contributors' money.
10176000	10186000	Yeah, Estes Show and her mat actually dug up that Kickstarter and linked it in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. They made $30,000, they made $3,000.
10186000	10190000	Oh, Jesus. Even I screwed up until wow.
10190000	10203000	Yeah, I mean, it's just, I think it was a hard thing to probably get, you know, a lot of people want to preorder the game or, you know, they usually get a tangible reward, and I think that's really hard to do with a TV show.
10203000	10204000	Oh, yeah.
10204000	10217000	And, you know, what were they giving away? For $5 wallpaper, for $10, the access to Facebook and Google groups and all this, you know, you didn't really get a lot of like really tangible stuff until you were talking a lot of money.
10217000	10222000	Like a guaranteed contestant spot or something like that probably would have really driven the point home.
10222000	10223000	Yeah.
10223000	10238000	Of course, the problem is that you probably still slanted towards like pre-teens and teens and not exactly the child in all of us today with fond memories of that show and the games and sports and all that kind of stuff.
10238000	10245000	Exactly. Well, all right. Well, maybe we'll see video game game shows make a comeback in another fashion one way or another.
10245000	10246000	That'd be nice.
10246000	10257000	I would think with the cameras being a thing, there ought to be a way through PlayStation or Microsoft or even maybe who knows what Nintendo has in store where I can do something in my living room and somebody else can see it.
10257000	10267000	And like, you know, 1 versus 100, again, a game that's hugely ahead of its time because you could have somebody that's actually playing that game live in front of all these other people.
10267000	10273000	Now, granted, you didn't see them on the camera, but what they were doing was influencing the game for the thousands of people that were playing along.
10273000	10286000	I think it's a little funny that you're talking hypotheticals like this when you yourself have been in the situation to be able to interview a celebrity just with a webcam and headset.
10286000	10287000	True.
10287000	10303000	And the sheer number like I seem to remember that even like ESPN will Skype in sports, sports, celebrity sports stars and all those kinds of things because, you know, fuck the improbability of a satellite link with inherent delays and all of that other nonsense.
10303000	10315000	Talk to somebody on Skype, Google Hangouts, anything and the connectedness of near real time communication from from site to site, even across the world is fucking magnificent today.
10315000	10322000	That's that's very true. And, you know, you reference the whole like interviewing celebrity and it was on my Twitter. So, I mean, it was it was the Huffington Post that did it.
10322000	10329000	And they actually found me through Twitter because I had tweeted about the celebrity and they they contacted me and they asked me to do the interview thing.
10329000	10334000	And so they had me, I think, on Google Plus and they had this other girl who is a fan on Skype. And so they were.
10334000	10339000	Yeah, we and it was like we were part of that because they basically run a TV network. It's just all online.
10339000	10342000	We were a part of that TV network through Skype.
10343000	10349000	Exactly. Yeah, it's kind of crazy. Anyway. All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go because our phone's been lighting up tonight, but good to hear from you as always.
10349000	10350000	As always. Thanks, guys.
10350000	10352000	Take care, my friend. Bye bye.
10352000	10353000	Bye.
10353000	10359000	All right. My God, the phones tonight. I'll try to squeeze in a couple more calls. I see a few coming in, so I want to I want to try and get them all.
10359000	10360000	Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
10360000	10362000	Hey, everyone. It's Rama.
10362000	10367000	Hey, Rama. I love this. You're wearing your Luigi hat in tribute, I assume. Black Luigi tonight.
10367000	10368000	And your shirt.
10368000	10369000	And the matching shirt.
10369000	10374000	The L does not stand for loser. I love it. What's on your mind, my friend?
10378000	10386000	I'm just kind of at a loss of words because I'm just thinking about all the good times I had playing Nintendo growing up and my cousin coming over.
10386000	10396000	We would sit there and play. See, what will we play? Play the Goonies, Gradius, Contra, all the great ones, you know?
10396000	10403000	Oh, yeah. I mean, it's just it's just a huge like reality check about mortality and all that.
10403000	10411000	I don't want to go too dark on the show, but, you know, it's just like it is a huge reality check for a lot of us that like, oh, my God, like we're all getting older.
10411000	10418000	And I get that. I do have like one more quick memory to actually have a bit of news that I think everyone would like to hear.
10418000	10427000	I remember growing up, I spent my time between my parents house and my great grandmother's house and then back and forth, I would take my Nintendo.
10427000	10433000	And what was awesome was my mother had a big screen, 32 inch floor model TV.
10433000	10441000	I remember staying at her place for the summer and Super Mario Brothers 3 just had happened to come out.
10441000	10442000	Oh, boy.
10442000	10445000	I think you know where I spent most of my summertime.
10445000	10447000	Heck, yeah.
10447000	10448000	Yes.
10448000	10456000	In that world four where all the monsters were huge and it just blew our minds like, oh, my God, huge goombas and Koopas.
10456000	10462000	You know, I didn't discover world four later because I end up more or less short cutting through it half the time.
10462000	10464000	But then I went back and started going through it.
10464000	10467000	I was just like, oh, I missed all of this.
10467000	10471000	Let me get through this real quick, you know?
10471000	10472000	Nice.
10472000	10478000	When was the last time you played Super Mario Brothers 3 all the way through without warping?
10478000	10486000	Um, God, it's been so long and the actual I think the cartridge is actually sitting on my shelf back there.
10486000	10487000	Yes, it is.
10487000	10496000	But I have this like wish list of things I want to live stream someday, you know, when I have a rainy day because I'm not six months behind on any live stream projects or anything.
10496000	10498000	But I will say this much.
10498000	10506000	I have actually sat down with Super Mario World because my old roommate and I talked about how he had the highest score in the house and no one could beat him.
10506000	10510000	Got up one Saturday morning, put on a pot of coffee, pop the game in.
10510000	10523000	I went through every single level, opened up the star road, went through a special zone, went through every single level, beat the game.
10524000	10530000	And the best part is he was just coming in from work as I finished the game and he just saw my final score.
10530000	10535000	I just looked at him, put the controller down and goes, your turn.
10535000	10541000	I love it. Oh man, Super Mario World. How cool was that?
10541000	10546000	Not only did they have that star world where, you know, it was kind of like a warp zone of sorts, right?
10547000	10557000	But then they had that super secret one where you had all the gnarly, cool, awesome, basically asshole Mario stages but not quite that big of an asshole.
10557000	10562000	Like, you know, Canadian level asshole. You're not that big of an asshole. You're just kind of an asshole.
10562000	10571000	And if you didn't touch the level, if you let it sit there, I think for about two minutes it will play an updated version of the Super Mario Brothers theme.
10572000	10577000	Hmm. That's right. You would leave it there forever. Yes, I remember that. It's crazy.
10577000	10582000	All right. Warama, my friend, thank you for the memories. I appreciate them tonight.
10582000	10586000	Take care and anime jam session, of course, Tuesday nights here on the network.
10586000	10588000	But I never gave you my news.
10588000	10590000	Oh, yeah, yeah. What's up?
10590000	10599000	Okay. There is an upcoming anime convention in New York City coming up called Waku Waku and they're having a variety of Japanese guests there.
10600000	10606000	One of the guests that they have announced is Keiji Inafune.
10606000	10608000	Nice.
10608000	10617000	And they are selling VIP tickets and if you purchase one of these VIP tickets, you will get to play Mighty No. 9 with the man.
10617000	10622000	That's awesome. Oh, man, I wish I didn't already have a bunch of travel set for the year.
10622000	10625000	I'm really overdue for a trip to New York. I'd love to come hang.
10625000	10633000	But I'm going to have to figure out, like, when I finally do have the money to come out to New York and the time, when a good time for me to do it.
10633000	10636000	Because I've got to come out for a con or something. I've got to do it the right way, right?
10636000	10643000	Well, I am switching jobs soon, but I will say this much. Just give me three weeks notice.
10643000	10647000	I can do that. I'd need that much notice for myself, so, yeah.
10647000	10652000	All right. All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much.
10652000	10654000	No problem, y'all. Take care.
10654000	10655000	You, too. Bye.
10655000	10656000	Bye.
10656000	10662000	All right, 1877 Game O.L.R. using him on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and again, they're just coming in back to back tonight, so let's get to it.
10662000	10664000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
10664000	10665000	Hey, this is Akdef.
10665000	10667000	Hey, Akdef, my friend. How are you?
10667000	10675000	Really great, especially since you're now considered the best team, to pick the best team in Splatoon.
10675000	10677000	I've finally seen the lights.
10677000	10682000	Because roller coasters are way better than water slides, and it's also as awesome as dogs.
10682000	10688000	Also, water slides are only good for, like, a few months out of the year, whereas roller coasters, man, you can enjoy those any time of the year.
10688000	10700000	Yeah, that's what I tweeted that exact thing a few days ago, that, oh, my God, who could vote about, who could vote water slides, because, yeah, that's only in the summer.
10700000	10702000	Roller coasters are available all the year.
10702000	10703000	That's right.
10703000	10704000	All year long.
10704000	10711000	Unless you unfortunately live by one of those theme parks that closes in the winter, like they do in the Northeast, but, see, in California, you know, a place like Magic Mountain, they don't ever close.
10711000	10719000	I don't know why you would close in the winter, either, because apparently the winter air is supposed to be, like, the perfect, you know, the air pressure is the perfect density for roller coaster riding.
10719000	10723000	Well, you know, riding a roller coaster in the snow isn't that much fun.
10723000	10725000	Whatever.
10725000	10726000	Or safe.
10726000	10727000	Yeah, probably.
10727000	10729000	Safe.
10729000	10731000	Uh, yeah.
10731000	10733000	Good times, good times.
10734000	10740000	But, yeah, I wanted to talk about the, well, the death of history water.
10740000	10741000	Of course.
10741000	10744000	It really, it really, it was shocking news.
10744000	10753000	I was on an amiibo event today that I helped organize, and we were having a lot of fun.
10753000	10760000	We were having a training day, basically, for people that were new to the amiibos and all that stuff.
10760000	10767000	And, yeah, that's surprising that we heard the news, and I was like, nah, not really?
10767000	10776000	I couldn't believe it at first, then I checked my Facebook, I checked Twitter, and, yeah, all the news was freaking out, and it was pretty shocking.
10776000	10781000	Though, it was pretty cool that everyone kept playing.
10781000	10788000	We all kept playing, we all kept training our amiibos and all that stuff.
10789000	10790000	And...
10790000	10796000	Well, yeah, I mean, Mr. Iwata loved to make games for people to play, and enjoyed seeing people having fun.
10796000	10801000	So, I don't think he would want us to sit around, you know, boo-hooing what's happened.
10801000	10804000	You know, we've had our moment, now let's go play some games.
10804000	10807000	I think that's what Iwata truly would want.
10807000	10812000	Yeah, and it was organized in a local gaming cafe, so.
10812000	10820000	In one room we had little Smash Brothers, in another one they had Star Fox on the Super Nintendo.
10820000	10836000	So it was pretty cool that, even though it was a sad thing to hear, and it still is, that everyone still enjoyed and reminisces about how great the man was.
10836000	10846000	Because, really, even though he, you can't blame him for mistakes that Nintendo has done in the past, but still, he was a really, really great man.
10846000	10851000	Really great designer, programmer, and a pretty good person overall.
10851000	10854000	Everybody makes mistakes. We make mistakes.
10854000	10860000	And, you know, when it comes to, you know, gaming culture and a lot of the stuff we've covered on this show, like, let's not forget.
10860000	10867000	You know, nine, eight, nine years ago, we would razz Sony every single week for something that came out of their mouths.
10867000	10869000	You know, when that PlayStation 3 was first announced.
10869000	10872000	And my how times can change, you know?
10872000	10881000	So, you know, even though we've certainly said some critical things about Nintendo, and I'm not going to try to hide that or sweep that under the rug with the news that's been going on.
10881000	10888000	I just, you know, reiterate that comes from a place of fandom and respect and wanting to see the very best.
10888000	10891000	And sometimes not always feeling like they're on a course for the best.
10891000	10894000	But, anyway, just reiterating that.
10894000	10903000	Yeah. And, yeah, also in respect to Iwata, I'm renaming my curvy amiibo to Iwata.
10903000	10907000	Just for respect and admiration for the guy.
10907000	10912000	Like I said, he was a great person, a great developer, programmer.
10912000	10920000	So, yeah, that's the least I can do in terms of what paying respects it can be.
10920000	10922000	I think that's a great gesture.
10922000	10926000	All right. All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can start to wrap up.
10926000	10927000	But thank you so much for the call.
10927000	10928000	Hey, thanks for having me.
10928000	10930000	All right. Take care, my friend.
10930000	10934000	1877 game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10934000	10937000	I'm going to see if we can squeeze in one more call.
10937000	10941000	But that's the first call I've hung up and there hasn't immediately been something else on the line.
10941000	10944000	So I think we are starting to wrap up.
10944000	10945000	But I'll give it one more shout out.
10945000	10949000	1877 game OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10949000	10952000	I already checked in with you, Loki.
10952000	10953000	You say you didn't have any last minute stories, right?
10953000	10954000	No, I didn't see anything.
10954000	10959000	I did have something I wanted to address because I know when I was looking at all the potential stories for tonight,
10959000	10961000	there was a few things we just didn't have time for.
10962000	10967000	One of them was the news about Crypt of the NecroDancer, apparently, is coming to the PlayStation 4.
10967000	10968000	That'd be cool.
10968000	10969000	Yeah, that is pretty awesome.
10969000	10970000	That's a fun game.
10970000	10975000	So that's coming to there and the Vita as well, actually, coming out there as well.
10975000	10977000	Let's see.
10977000	10982000	Also, Yoshinori Ono revealed a Brazil stage in Street Fighter V.
10982000	10985000	And there will also be another upcoming character announcement.
10985000	10988000	So talking some more about some of the stages there in the game.
10988000	10990000	So I think that's kind of cool.
10991000	11000000	And then Google Japan did a WarioWare-esque minigame around Godzilla and Ultraman in kind of a celebration of that.
11000000	11003000	So there you go.
11003000	11008000	Fifth Dream in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com says Hatiful Boyfriend on PS4 has a new path.
11008000	11013000	Well, Hatiful Boyfriend on PS4 is coming out really soon, isn't it?
11013000	11015000	We're getting a lot of stuff this week.
11015000	11016000	I think it's coming out soon. I'm not sure when.
11016000	11018000	I think it's this month.
11019000	11020000	Very cool.
11020000	11021000	All right.
11021000	11023000	Well, it sounds like no other calls are coming in.
11023000	11025000	So we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.
11025000	11028000	But, hey, if you want to call us in a future week, get us added on Skype.
11028000	11030000	Orange, Laundry, all one word.
11030000	11032000	If you want to connect with us another way, you can always send us a tweet.
11032000	11034000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
11034000	11037000	Or you can hit us up on Facebook as well.
11037000	11041000	And, of course, we love emails, especially the fact we heard from some new people this week.
11041000	11045000	I love hearing from the vets, too, and the people that email us regularly.
11045000	11047000	But I really love to hear from new people.
11047000	11050000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
11050000	11054000	If you've been listening for, like, three years and you've never sent us an email, come on, do it this week.
11054000	11055000	Do it this week.
11055000	11057000	Share with us a Nintendo memory.
11057000	11062000	We've been having a lot of reminiscing this week, and I'd love to hear some more because, you know,
11062000	11067000	video games have impacted all of us in one way or another, or I don't think you'd be here listening to this program.
11067000	11069000	So there you go.
11069000	11073000	Anyhow, that's about going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11073000	11077000	As I say at the end of every week's episode, you know, if you enjoyed what you heard on the show,
11077000	11081000	please consider giving us a nice review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio.
11081000	11084000	Those five-star reviews go a long way.
11084000	11089000	With so, so, so many things out there that people can choose to pick from, it's sometimes hard to be noticed.
11089000	11095000	So all we ask, tell a friend or five or several about the show and help spread the word about our little show
11095000	11097000	where every gamer has a voice.
11097000	11099000	Support independent broadcasting.
11099000	11103000	You know, we've got a lot of friends at the Voice Geeks Network, vog and network.com,
11103000	11105000	that also work very hard on their shows and what they do.
11105000	11107000	So check them out.
11107000	11108000	Really appreciate it.
11108000	11109000	All right.
11109000	11110000	It's time to wrap up.
11110000	11118000	Go around and get everybody's final thought for the night as we exit from this very, very somber show tonight.
11118000	11125000	But we've had some good, I'm glad we've had some good laughs in spite of all the not-so-hilarious things that have happened today.
11125000	11127000	Going around and get everybody's final thought tonight.
11127000	11129000	Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight?
11129000	11132000	I need luck.
11132000	11136000	My final thought is I'm going to go rub Dark Sakura for good luck.
11136000	11138000	No.
11138000	11142000	Rub, rub, rub.
11142000	11145000	Last but not least, Loki.
11145000	11147000	I don't know.
11147000	11151000	I don't have to answer the phones for two weeks.
11151000	11152000	Vacation.
11152000	11153000	That's not vacation.
11153000	11155000	Training.
11155000	11156000	All right.
11156000	11157000	That's it.
11157000	11158000	That's going to do it for another episode of the show.
11158000	11160000	Thank you so much for listening to the show.
11160000	11161000	We really appreciate it.
11161000	11164000	And I don't know what else to say.
11164000	11166000	It's been a really crazy day.
11166000	11169000	But, you know, go play some games.
11169000	11170000	That's what it's all about.
11170000	11172000	Have fun.
11172000	11174000	Stop being a jerk to each other online.
11174000	11176000	Although I don't think anybody listens to this show as a jerk.
11176000	11181000	But just in general, if you know jerks, tell them to stop being such.
11181000	11183000	And that's it.
11183000	11184000	Have fun.
11184000	11185000	That's what it's all about.
11185000	11188000	Iwata wanted us to have fun, so go have fun.
11188000	11189000	Have a good night.
11214000	11219000	But you know they were all still true.
11219000	11221000	See you next week.
11244000	11247000	Thank you.
