00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This week, Microsoft's next great interactivity machine just got a little more distant as they've announced that HoloLens won't initially be targeted for gaming or entertainment.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But don't let that get you down, there's plenty more news as well as your comments, calls, and feedback, all happening right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, tonight with episode number 606 for this July the 19th of 2015.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My name is Rob Roberts, or on Twitter, at Skie, S-K-I-E, here with you over the next three hours or so to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle, with my co-hosts here in studio with me tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki!

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hi.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
How you doing, Loki?

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm doing fine.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah? Now what's this about, you're starting a health food craze? Like, is health frozen over? What's happening?

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, no, as I've been...

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You okay?

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Well, I hope to be better or not. So, you know, as I mentioned before, I've been trying to eat healthier, because I haven't been eating too healthy, and so, you know, originally I had cut out soda, which I'm still doing, aside from, you know, the occasional Red Bull maybe once a day, not every day though.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And then I cut out fast food, so that was this week. I haven't been eating, actually may have actually been part of the last week even, so I've been just having Subway instead of McDonald's or Burger King or Jack in the Box or anything like that.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And so I've been just eating...

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Are you going on the Subway diet?

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not going on the Subway diet.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't want to get tacky, but I hear they need a new spokesperson.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm not going on the Subway diet. I'm just going on the... I'm not eating, you know, a hamburger diet, I guess. But then, no, and then on top of that, if anybody knows me pretty well, they know that I don't eat salad. I hate salad. I don't eat salad.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
So today I'm eating salad, so...

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What?

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yeah. Well, it's not really salad because the reason I don't like salad, most of the reason is I don't like the texture of salad. Like, literally eating leaves makes me want to gag. It's like my body's like, this isn't meat. Throw this up. Throw this up. You're not going to eat this.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Were you averse to things like Princess Tomato and the Salad Kingdom too?

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't know about that. Maybe. So I know I found something, like, I was going shopping today because I was originally going to start a diet called Keto, but it's really hard on your body. It's supposed to be a high-fat, moderate protein, low-carb diet, and there's just no way.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Like, it's just, it's going to do a number on me if I tried to do that. So I had to find something kind of in the middle ground. So I did this, and I bought a bunch of stuff for salad today, but what I did instead of buying, actually, like, salad leaves and stuff is I found broccoli slaw, which is, like, they take broccoli and carrots and, like, was it radicchio and stuff like that, and they just kind of, like, cut it down, like, almost like shaved.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's just really small pieces, but, like, I tried it, and it doesn't taste like anything. It's just kind of, like, I don't know.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You gotta find what works for you.

29
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, exactly. So it's healthy, but it doesn't taste bad. It doesn't taste, like, really anything, so I'm like, fuck it, I'll eat that.

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Everybody's got their thing too. Like, me, it's mayonnaise. If mayonnaise, like, when you talk about cold slaw, I'm like, ugh, because you know what's usually in that.

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So yeah, so today I cooked, I grilled some chicken, and I cooked, you know, some peppers and onions and garlic and celery and then cut up some tomatoes, radishes.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So I threw that all together and ate it for lunch, and that's what I had. It was pretty close to a salad, minus, you know, actual, like, salad leaves.

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I mean, but it's got broccoli in it. I mean, shit, that's fucking healthy.

34
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Alright, there he is. Broccoli and shit.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's not cooked, though. It's not cooked.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The Loki diet. Broccoli and shit. It's fucking healthy.

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So that's what I'm gonna eat. That's what I packed for lunch for tomorrow and, like, and I've been, like, eating nuts and stuff instead of, like, having, you know, you know, almonds.

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Not testicles. That's just gross. I just don't feel like, you know, having cow testicles or anything like that.

39
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Alright. Alright, well good luck with your lifestyle adjustment.

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And here's the thing, even, like, with the two weeks, I mean, just even cutting out soda and stuff, I've already lost five pounds, so.

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Wow! The first, the first five-

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, it's because I ate, like, shit. Like, I was literally, like, eating, like, McDonald's and then going home and, like, having a bunch of cereal or something like that and just, and having soda to go along with that and snacking with soda during the day and having, for breakfast, you know, like, eggs, bacon and hash browns and stuff.

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah, just eating, like, cutting down half of that stuff, you know, just even just switching to, like, a sandwich that cuts out, like, 2,000 calories right there.

44
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Good, good for you. Count the calories and do what you gotta do.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I didn't need any of that. I mean, I felt, like, crappy eating that stuff anyway, so now I just feel really tired.

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I was so goddamn cranky this weekend, though, because I was trying to cut, like I said, getting prepped for that other diet before I aborted that last minute.

47
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Alright, Loki, it's not a diet show. It's a video game show.

48
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah, whatever. I played video games, too, so.

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Alright, no, we'll get to that, but I also have to introduce Dark Sakura tonight, but there's a little twist to this.

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Dark Sakura's gonna join us by phone here and we'll explain why in a minute, so we're giving Dark Sakura's cell phone a call right now.

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm privileged enough to know her number and I'm sorry I'm not gonna give it to you, but hopefully she'll pick up because I warned her I was going to be calling, so I think she's there.

52
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hello.

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hey, Jamie, how you doing?

54
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Um, I'm very happy right now.

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you? Why aren't you here at Studio N7 right now doing Orange Lounge Radio? What's going on, girl?

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm full of rum.

57
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Rum? You've been drinking?

58
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I found a screwdriver on my friend's couch.

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wait a minute, are you drunk right now?

60
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes.

61
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So, did you-

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So why aren't you on the show right now?

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, she is here on the show, she's not here here on the show. Am I to understand, you've called in drunk to the show tonight.

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Bitch, I might have.

65
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So what's going- you got like a friend from out of town, like way out of town visiting, and you're having like a girl's party day or something, right?

66
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I have a friend from Japan visiting at Julie's house, and so Dan and I have come here, and my intention was to drive right over after maybe having a drink, and a drink turned into five.

67
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, good on you for being adult enough to not drink and drive, so you know, we can all respect that.

68
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I've now had seven shots of rum.

69
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well-

70
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I have unleashed the Kraken upon my liver.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Once you've recognized you've crossed that point of no return, you just say, eh, fuck it. There you go.

72
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Did you- I don't know if you could hear the opening minutes of the show, but did you hear that Loki is going on a diet, and he's been eating broccoli slaw, and like all this- this is why it took me a minute to get to you.

73
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's because the world is stopping right now.

74
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Did he get replaced with a pod person?

75
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What?

76
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I understand the concern, but no, I'm still gonna eat bacon.

77
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Bacon's good. I can have bacon on my diet.

78
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There you go. Isn't your diet the fuck it diet?

79
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
No, no, no, no, no. I'm on keto.

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, that's where Loki looked at it before.

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's just sort of like, fuck it except carbs.

82
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There it is. Loki was thinking about that one. He just mentioned that a minute.

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Over at our chatroom, we are joined-

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Rum is low carb.

85
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We are joined by our chatroom every week.

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We do tape live Sunday nights at the Voice Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

88
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If you are listening live at vognetwork.com, join our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com.

89
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Oh my god, I love the chatroom. I want to hug them all.

90
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
They love you too, Jamie.

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Except, except, except for, um, let's see, people, because they might be kind of smelly.

92
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah, I would name people by name tonight, Jamie. That's not a good thing to do.

93
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Uh, Brad from Pod Culture says-

94
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't name anybody. I'm a good girl who does not name people by name. I just talk about them anonymously.

95
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, so, Jamie is phoning this one in? Yes, apparently she is.

96
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Uh, Fifth Dream says, hug me first.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Technically, Rob called me.

98
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Alright, well look, there's a good reason we had to have you on the program tonight though,

99
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
because you went on another adventure this weekend, right?

100
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I did and I broke myself.

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Alright, tell us about this. Where did you go? How did you break yourself? What happened?

102
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I went to California King yesterday that was a big ballroom filled with glorious games.

103
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It was beautiful, except they didn't have a theater of magic, so it was pissed.

104
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Melody and I, like, went on, like, an hour long hunt for a theater of magic,

105
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and then ended up getting distracted by Come On Baby, which we ended up playing Come On Baby.

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Is that the one where, like, you hit the buttons really fast to make the babies, like,

107
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
climb up the ladders and do all that weird stuff? That they have that at golf movies?

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, they're, like, drowning to death and you have to, like, come up and, like, make them swim up and then

109
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
boost up through the water. That sounds dark. And then the DDR part.

110
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So there were just video games everywhere. There was, like, music games and pinball games.

111
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh my god, I was surrounded. I thought that I needed to change my underwear.

112
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Wait, say that last part again? Wait, what?

113
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I was surrounded by so many games, I needed to change my underwear.

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It was beautiful. It was blissful.

115
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So, what was, like, what was, like, the best thing you saw there, where you were, like,

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
oh my god, I can't believe I'm playing this?

117
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The Money Corner, because they had a Kraken GJ.

118
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh my god, I haven't played Kraken GJ in years.

119
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Fuck, this still exists. Like, oh boy, it sucks.

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And I played Beatmania the final and I played Beatmania 3 and I did not play 2DX, oddly enough,

121
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
but I did play some DER. They had a 5th mix.

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And I played Papa Music Fantasia and I played Papa Music Mickey and I played Para Para,

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
which is how I broke my hip, like an old lady. I played a bunch of pinball.

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
How did you break your hip playing Para Para?

125
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay, I did Deluxe. It was my last song and I had already done Night of Fire and Boom of Fire,

126
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
which was pretty easy. But there's this part in Deluxe where you have to, like, move to the side

127
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and then you lift your knee up and twist your hip a little bit.

128
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And I don't know, it was just, like, the most tiny little move, but it made my hip just go,

129
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
no, you have back problems, bitch, stop playing.

130
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So I took coding and felt kind of better and then I didn't play anything more Para Para after that.

131
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Although, like, one completely random guy did Belfar for me just because I wanted to see it.

132
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Nice.

133
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And I played a bunch of pinball and I played Versus Castlevania and Mouse Trap

134
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and I just dropped that screwdriver. Shit.

135
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Now, I'm pissed because I didn't get to go to California Extreme.

136
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I wanted to go and I was planning on going and I wanted to see everybody,

137
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
but, I mean, I've been dealing with a case of food poisoning this week.

138
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I mean, just putting it out, that's what it is.

139
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's good for eating bad food.

140
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yeah, I know. It's pretty much what I get. But, yeah, Friday, Saturday was not good.

141
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm doing better now. Like, I'm eating cookies now. I feel much better because I made them.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I made cookies and you're not even here to eat them.

143
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't have them because I'm a good girl.

144
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But, yeah, so I unfortunately missed out on California Extreme.

145
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I've been drinking rum all night.

146
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But I know that California Extreme isn't just an entire room full of old games and pinball machines,

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
although that's probably the coolest part.

148
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But they also do panels and talks and they have some of the classic game makers there.

149
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Did you get to experience any of that or nah, you were just focused on games?

150
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I was going to go to the Atari panel, but instead I went to the one right before that, which was the Crazy Auto panel.

151
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't know how many people know the trivia, but Crazy Auto was what turned into Ms. Pac-Man.

152
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They were a group of MIT dropouts who basically were trying to make speed-up kits.

153
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Because back in the day, arcade owners wanted speed-up kits so that people wouldn't just, you know,

154
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
beat a whole game or play for hours on one quarter.

155
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So they tried to find randomizers and ways to speed things up.

156
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And the guys started off doing a missile command speed-up, and then they got sued by Atari,

157
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and then Atari was like, wait, this is stupid, let's hire them instead.

158
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So they hired them.

159
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And that's where Super Missile Command came from.

160
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The same group also did Ms. Pac-Man, but it started off with Crazy Auto.

161
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There's this kid there who's like 14, but he started when he was 10 just collecting classic games.

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Because he didn't like any of the current games.

163
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And he ended up buying a Ms. Pac-Man for 100 bucks that didn't work.

164
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Turned out all it needed was a fuse replaced.

165
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So his dad replaced the fuse and he had a working Ms. Pac-Man.

166
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So he found like ROMs and dumped them and reskinned them into Crazy Auto.

167
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And it was pretty cool.

168
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The guy who created Crazy Auto was there doing the panel with him.

169
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So it was a pretty neat thing.

170
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But I mean, there's heck of this guy who's 14.

171
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Well, right now he's 14.

172
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He's no code, yet still managed to do all this, design the back glass and everything.

173
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I was like, well done kid, and I'm glad your parents didn't, you know, like ground you or anything.

174
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's rad.

175
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, and that's one of the...

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm almost more upset I missed that stuff because those stories are awesome.

177
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And I wish I could have been there to try to invite these people on the show too to share them here too.

178
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But you know, it is what it is.

179
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I have to take care of myself.

180
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But you know, all the video games are cool too.

181
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I wish I could have played my Journey, but I guess I'll just have to wait for next year.

182
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, Rob, you missed it.

183
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There was a Journey pinball.

184
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Like the band Journey?

185
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, someone did a conversion of...

186
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I forgot what it was, but they made it into a Journey pinball.

187
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That is outstanding.

188
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I took pictures for you though.

189
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You can pet it if you want to.

190
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The pictures, I mean, not the machine.

191
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I will pet both. I'll do what I want.

192
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
But I can hope that maybe some of that stuff will show up at a...

193
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I think they're full on converting this Rockage.

194
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Remember we were talking about that and I went to that earlier this year.

195
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I believe the full on conversion is beginning, that it will be MagWest this upcoming year.

196
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And I'm hoping a lot of that same stuff will show up there.

197
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So I don't have to wait an entire year for California Streaming.

198
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm hoping.

199
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So weren't any new tables there. I mean, the newest one there was KISS.

200
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
There was the original Proto Big Bang bar there, not the Repro ones.

201
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Like I said, Melody and I went on a big hunt for Theater of Magic, but we didn't find any.

202
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The Bimani section, though, was freaking nuts.

203
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I mean, there were three DVR machines in the pump-it-up.

204
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And then there was a Juke Beat, DJ Max Technica.

205
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
There were two pop music. There was a full band of Guitar Freaks, Drummania, and Keyboardmania III.

206
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Aw, I love Keyboardmania. I'm gonna play that game forever.

207
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah, I saw that you. I took a good picture for you.

208
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Thank you.

209
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
There was a pop music Disney. There was a dance maniac, JParadise2.

210
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Now see, when I went four years ago, I think there was maybe a DVR machine, a Beatmania machine.

211
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That was it, although I was still happy to have that.

212
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So that stuff just totally exploded, but in a good way.

213
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There was a Kraken DJ, two Beatmanias, the final.

214
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah, the two Beatmania finals were the Beatmania III caps.

215
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Wait, let me ask this question, because you're just making me jealous naming all this off.

216
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Let me ask this question, though, because I'm curious.

217
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You would think if we all get excited about these old-school arcade games and things,

218
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
that maybe there would be places that would be open more often, like arcades, where we could go play these more often.

219
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But unfortunately, as we know, the arcade scene has been dying and being replaced with ticket-spitting redemption machines, Vegas for Children.

220
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
How was the attendance there? I mean, was it very well-attended?

221
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It was busy.

222
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Was it?

223
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It was pretty loaded. I mean, like I said, people were around the nice turntable.

224
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But it was a pretty good crowd. It was very busy. It definitely had the con funk about it.

225
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Or maybe that was just the Jehovah's Witnesses next door.

226
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
This was also the Jehovah's Witness conference.

227
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wait a minute, the Jehovah's Witness were having a conference next door at the same time as California Stream?

228
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Seriously.

229
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It was like being at AX a few years ago all over again.

230
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's like when I went to the Rocky Horror Picture Show convention that was right next door to the gun show.

231
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Mm-hmm.

232
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Good times.

233
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, there was actually someone that had one of the things that feel like a cabinet.

234
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, nice.

235
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That was pretty cool.

236
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah.

237
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And there were a few different, like the Hercules table was there again, which is like the giant-sized pinball table that uses a pool cue as a pinball.

238
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh my gosh.

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
There were a few different conversions.

240
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There were like three mini ultra-cades, like pin ultra-cades, that had like portal pinball on one of them and a few of the other pinball effects in the various video pinball ones.

241
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Wait, William Murderface wants to know, did the Jehovah's Witness try to give you pamphlets?

242
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
No, we scared them off.

243
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh, okay.

244
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yeah.

245
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
All these suits and everything, I'm like, dude, why are these people here? Oh, Jehovah's Witness is okay.

246
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Oh my gosh.

247
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That was cool.

248
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, Jamie-

249
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
A few of them did make it into the game floor, but that was pretty funny.

250
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, so some of them paid to get in and play some games, huh? That's fun. Good times.

251
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yep.

252
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:52,000
All right. Well, Jamie, I'm going to wrap up so we can get on and talk about gaming news tonight, but you're missed over here at Studio N7, but have fun tonight, okay?

253
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What did you throw at me?

254
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What?

255
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You said you missed me. What did you throw?

256
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
A cookie, because you're not here.

257
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh my god.

258
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Rob, there's Red Velvet cookies over here, but I didn't eat any of them because I'm a good girl.

259
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Put them in a bag-

260
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm just going to drink, Mom.

261
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Put them in a bag and get them over to me. I love Red Velvet. Come on.

262
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Rob, even though it's funny, I'm literally like five minutes away from you.

263
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That is hilarious. I don't know how to feel, but so you're like five minutes away and you're still too drunk to be here. That's all right. No, I understand.

264
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't want you to- I don't want you to drink.

265
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, I can absolutely drive me over, but I would just be like-

266
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yeah, it's okay. It's okay. You're a bit of a hot mess, but that's why we love you.

267
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Kaijuto and Chad says she sounds loaded, so-

268
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What? I'm loaded?

269
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You sound loaded.

270
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I am, and just like, I'm going to have some more.

271
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm seven shots of crack and rum in, and guess what?

272
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I agree with my friend George because crack and rum makes every drink taste like cookies.

273
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh my gosh. All right. Well, be safe and don't drink too much, okay?

274
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Karen's driving, so what the hell do I care?

275
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
All right. Well, I don't want you to end up in the hospital.

276
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
All right. All right, Jamie. We're going to let you guys so we can move on with the show, but have fun. Tell everyone we said hi.

277
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Hey, guess what? Guess what? Guess what?

278
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What?

279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I love you guys and I love the chat room.

280
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
For dinner.

281
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Bye, Jamie.

282
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Bye.

283
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The lovely dark Sakura, ladies and gentlemen, joining us by phone because she's too drunk to OLR tonight.

284
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Oh, Loki, and here you are sitting here eating your broccoli slaw.

285
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I already eat my broccoli. I mean, that's nuts.

286
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Listening to that. All right. No, California Streams sounds like a lot of fun. I'm really pissed I didn't get to go, but, you know, it is what it is.

287
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We're going to move into how is your gaming week here in just a moment, but I did want to just do a little bit of a follow up here because, you know, last week on the show, we were a little bit taken by surprise.

288
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I shouldn't say a little bit, a lot of it taken by surprise with the passing of Satoru Iwata, which the news had broke about his passing only about 45 minutes before we went live last week.

289
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And so, you know, we let known many of our thoughts and things on last week's show.

290
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So if you haven't heard 605 yet, definitely download that right at the beginning.

291
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We kind of talk about, you know, how we feel and so forth.

292
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But a lot of that has really dominated the talk in the industry this week, as you can imagine.

293
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You know, people were grieving for several days and still are a matter of factly.

294
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And that's going to take a while really to get over.

295
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You know, the world continues. The news cycle moves on.

296
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Games are still being made for the holiday and slowly but surely we'll have more and more news to talk about.

297
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But, you know, the beginnings of this week were really dominated by just everybody having something to say about this surprise passing of Satoru Iwata.

298
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You know, there was obviously the funeral was earlier this week and we've heard statements from people like Miyamoto, Reggie Fils-Aime.

299
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Even Sony and Microsoft, you know, had things that they said, whether it be through Twitter or so forth.

300
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Apparently tons of Nintendo fans had shown out to pay their respects at Iwata's funeral.

301
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Actually, Genyo Takeda's statement from Iwata's memorial is out there and you can read it.

302
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And it's really heartbreaking, just to kind of summarize here, to read the end of this here.

303
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Because if you didn't already know, Takeda is half of who's running Nintendo right now with Miyamoto.

304
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
And who knows if either one of them will be stepping up to lead it full time.

305
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
But it's very likely that another executive could be brought in from somewhere else.

306
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But it could be. It could be Takeda. It could be Miyamoto.

307
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But what Takeda said here is so sad here. I'm just reading an excerpt from the statement from the memorial.

308
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
In the face of your unbelievable passing, it will surely take some time before we can emerge from this deep sorrow.

309
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Please know, however, that the seeds you've planted and the plants that have sprouted will put forth small flowers as they bring smiles to the faces of people around the world.

310
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Blossom into a grand flower bigger than even you, our leader, Iwata-san.

311
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Together with Miyamoto and others of our generation, we swear in our hearts that we will continue our efforts so that someday we can report and present to you the blossoming of these flowers.

312
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
May you continuously watch over and guide us managers, our employees, and your family.

313
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Just right in the feels to hear something like that.

314
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's just, you know, they're hurting. It's a family and they're hurting.

315
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And those of us that are fans of Nintendo are certainly hurting too.

316
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And, you know, not to say there's good things about this, but I will just say one thing I'm noticing on Twitter and so forth is that, you know,

317
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Twitter's been a really volatile place the past nine months or so, you know, with some very heated things and disagreements going on.

318
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm not really going to get into all the weeds of all that, but just it's been very ugly.

319
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,000
But this week, at least I feel like that ugliness at least stopped for a little bit.

320
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I mean, there's always going to be some trolls and people that, you know, jump into the situation to say something extremely tacky.

321
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And I'm just, I'm shaving off those just complete lunatics that show up to make light of something like that.

322
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:27,000
But for the most part, Twitter has been very unified in just the grieving and the memorializing.

323
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And, you know, I'm just going to go play balloon fight right now.

324
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm just, I'm going to forget all this like arguing shit and I'm going to go play a game.

325
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And I just, I think, I think if there's anything positive from such a horrible situation, it's something like that.

326
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That it may be this whole thing kind of reminds us that, you know, time is short.

327
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You know, a Wada only lived to be 55. That's, that's not old age by any means.

328
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I know sometimes it feels like it when you're a teenager, you're 20, 55 is not old when you get to be my age, 55 looks a lot closer.

329
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But, um, you know, you realize that there's only so many days and do you want to spend your days arguing on the internet with strangers?

330
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Or do you want to spend your days having fun, playing games, enjoying the time that you're yet?

331
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
And why not both?

332
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Stop it, Loki. Stop it right now.

333
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Um, also just, just a couple of things I want to mention quickly about, um, uh, what is passing.

334
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
There's a great remix tribute out there by, uh, Hip Tanaka who, um, you know, did a lot of music for a Wada's projects.

335
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Namely, uh, he did a, a remix of some of the music with Balloon Fight. If you haven't heard it, you really should check that out.

336
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Um, the Nintendo World Store actually has a little area, um, set up to memorialize a Wada.

337
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
People are coming in, writing down their thoughts.

338
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Uh, they do have that, uh, being planned on being set up till at least July 24th.

339
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Um, so if you want to check that out.

340
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Um, Wall Street Journal is rumoring that Miyamoto is the one that's tipped to lead Nintendo.

341
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Um, I always thought Miyamoto was more of a designer, uh, more of a game maker.

342
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But then again, a Wada was a game maker.

343
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Um, so I suppose it would really depend on maybe what Miyamoto wants a little bit.

344
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:17,000
But certainly that name is going to carry a lot more weight than possibly, um, you know, many others that Nintendo, especially if Nintendo did bring in from the outside.

345
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You know, that name Miyamoto is still going to carry a whole lot of weight, so.

346
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I think that they should really just operate with like some sort of like Voltron-like robot where we can have Reggie in one and then Miyamoto in another.

347
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
You know, just kind of work as a team.

348
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So sort of like maybe nobody's in charge and they just kind of, somebody unfortunately has to, um, pull the strings.

349
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But, you know, and make sure things are running.

350
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,000
But the interesting thing is if they do bring someone in from the outside, I don't think that's necessarily the end of the world.

351
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Because maybe whoever it is they do bring in from the outside can just manage and let those people shine.

352
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
And let that Voltron of talent.

353
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
What's Howard doing nowadays?

354
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What's that?

355
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Never? Howard?

356
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Howard? Howard Phillips?

357
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What is he doing these days? I think he's on the board of some other organizations.

358
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And, um, I thought he was a part of the Mariners thing for a while.

359
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Probably not anymore.

360
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
But, um, yeah, I don't know. I don't know what Howard Phillips does these days.

361
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I guess I'd have to check Wikipedia or something.

362
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So, or somebody in chat will probably yell it out in a minute.

363
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
But, uh, keep in mind it's going to be very rare that an American runs Japanese organizations.

364
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
So that's, you know, I don't really see that happening.

365
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
That's why a lot of people are like, well, what about Reggie Fils-Aime?

366
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I think Reggie Fils-Aime is great for Nintendo of America.

367
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
But, you know, to oversee all of it, um, I don't know if that's going to work.

368
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
They say as well.

369
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
SSJ100Matt says, bring back Howard and Nestor to co-run Nintendo.

370
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Speaking of which, let's not have them run Nintendo, but put them in Smash.

371
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Wouldn't that be great?

372
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Howard and Nestor would be awesome.

373
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Wouldn't that be great?

374
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Uh, Dartetsuya says, I think, uh, says some mobile games.

375
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
He was kick-starting, but I haven't heard anything since then.

376
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Um, and then, uh, you know, I was going to say maybe, uh, Iwata, but not as, like, a character.

377
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Because that might be kind of tacky. Maybe a trophy.

378
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Or, you know, some other type of memorial would be really cool, I think.

379
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So, anyway, um, Dungeon Buster mentioning that Satoru Shibata from Nintendo Europe might be a contender.

380
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
So, uh, we'll see. You know what? It's going to take up some time to figure it out.

381
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And, uh, out of respect to the organization, I just, I don't really want to sit here and really theorize it too much further.

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Uh, they'll be ready when they're ready.

383
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Uh, for the meantime, uh, they have reaffirmed their commitments to Iwata's dreams.

384
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I mean, that was the first thing Nintendo came back out on Twitter and said.

385
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And just, you know, they actually showed the picture of the rainbow over Nintendo's headquarters.

386
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And just all the Kirby dolls and flowers and just everything people were leaving out of me.

387
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
It's just, uh, it just gets ya. It really gets ya.

388
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Um, uh, even though they didn't put Iwata in Smash, somebody did a ROM hack that put Iwata into Balloon Fight.

389
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Which, I thought, that's a really cute way to do that.

390
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So, anyhow, um, just a follow-up there to all that last week.

391
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
And, you know, obviously I would be remiss to not, even though we talked about it at length last week,

392
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,000
to not acknowledge that this is something the gaming community has been dealing with heavily this week.

393
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And will probably continue to for quite some time.

394
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You know, Tokyo Game Show is not really going to be the same.

395
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
That next Nintendo Direct is going to be weird.

396
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I mean, who knows if Nintendo may even do another Nintendo Direct.

397
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I would not blame them if they put all that on hold for a while.

398
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
And I don't think any of us could. But, I mean, we'll see. We'll see what happens.

399
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Anyhow, the show goes on. We move on. There's still gaming news as we get closer and closer to the holidays.

400
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Many things coming out from all different consoles and systems.

401
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And things that we are playing right now.

402
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
So, I'm going to start with my pal, Loki, with how was your gaming week?

403
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
What types of video games have you been playing this week?

404
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So, this week I didn't play a whole ton of games. I was mainly working on my game.

405
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
So, I got a little bit of headway down there. I'm almost done with the level I was working on.

406
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I was just kind of hooking everything up. I just had to build a few things now that I forgot about.

407
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Like, you know, I kind of pieced together one of the confetti cannons to be the actual cannon on the car to fire the cats out of.

408
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I'm sure none of that makes any sense, but you'll soon understand what I mean.

409
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And then, I don't know. So, it was mainly that.

410
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And then, I did play some stuff this weekend, though. I tried going back to play Ether One, as I mentioned a few weeks ago.

411
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I had an issue with Ether One. I mean, I played Ether One for a while a few weeks ago.

412
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Then I ran into an issue where the game kind of crashed.

413
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And when I reloaded my save, it didn't seem to want to load into the game.

414
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So, I read up on it a little bit, and they said, just give it more time. So, I was like, okay, fine.

415
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So, I let it load for about five minutes, and it finally loaded into the game. I was like, okay, cool.

416
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So, then I was like, okay, I'm going to save over my save game, and I'm going to kind of go on from there and just move into the next part of the game.

417
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So, I hit the next loading screen, and it locks up again.

418
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
That's like, ah, crap. So, I'm like, okay, I'll let it load for a few minutes. Nothing happens.

419
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So, I restarted the game now with my new save game, and sure enough, it loads, but it takes like five minutes.

420
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I just have no patience for this. I don't know what the fuck's wrong with this game.

421
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:37,000
They have some really bad bug with their save system and loading system, and I'm just not patient enough to wait five minutes every screen.

422
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Or, sometimes it just doesn't even load. So, fuck it. Whatever. No matter how good of a game it is, I'm not playing it anymore.

423
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
The other game, though, I ditched. Yeah, it's unfortunate, and I was really into that game, too.

424
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And, unfortunately, it just didn't work out.

425
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And this is a bug that apparently is on both the console and on the PC version of the game.

426
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
So, it's something that they hopefully need to fix. So, I don't know.

427
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The other thing I played is, I went back to Trials Fusion again, and Trials, they have new DLC that they have.

428
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
They kind of teased this during E3, and it's weird.

429
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:35,000
The DLC, it was this amazing adventure. I'm trying to remember what the hell it's called now. I'm trying to look up the name here.

430
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Basically, what it was is, instead of riding a motorcycle, you are a cat with a gun riding a unicorn that shoots fire out of its mouth.

431
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:53,000
And I know that sounds really awesome, but it's a little derpy.

432
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Because it's supposed to be, like, you know... I don't know. It's supposed to be really cool. They're kind of cheesy and stuff.

433
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:16,000
The actual model is a motorcycle. So, when you're playing the actual game with a motorcycle, and the back tire is hitting the ground, the feet gallop on the back.

434
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
So, it looks really strange, because sometimes the horse is galloping only with the back feet, or galloping only with the front feet.

435
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And the sound of the cat makes is really derpy as well. It's just, I don't know.

436
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
So, it was Awesome Level Max, was the name of the DLC.

437
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So, I played through the whole bit of DLC for that. They have two parts of it. They have this Awesome Level Max, or the Adventure Mode thing that they have, where you actually ride the horse around.

438
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And it was kind of cheesy. The level design is not great. They have one level, in fact, that kind of warps between levels.

439
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's kind of showing you what's coming up later on. But between each warp, it's not entirely synced.

440
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So, there have been times where I'm doing a perfect run, it warps me, and just crashes immediately. Crashes into the wall.

441
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm like, what the fuck? I mean, seriously, it's ridiculous. I even pulled back up on the horse, because it's an incline that's coming, and it just throws me straight into the wall.

442
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It's frustrating. And, in fact, I got gold on that level, and the gold level, to hit gold, you have to have a certain time limit, and up to 15 faults.

443
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm like, 15 faults? Shit, that's bad level design right there. If I'm dying 15 times and that's kind of good, then there's something wrong with the way you design that level.

444
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Unless they want you to keep screwing up, maybe. I don't know.

445
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I don't know. So, there was that.

446
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Maybe that's how you save time.

447
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
The first section of the DLC is this thing. It's Red Links versus the fans.

448
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And so, it's Red Links, the developer of the game, designing the best levels they could possibly muster for this DLC pack, versus some of the best level designers from the game.

449
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Because there's tons of great level designers out there, and so I actually played through some of those, and those are pretty fun.

450
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:10,000
So, it was worth his 10 bucks. I was just playing through it. Oh, and then I went through one of our pals over at Cooking with Unity, which I really wish they would come back.

451
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Magma Lemur, he had beaten a few of my times on some tracks, so I had to go beat him again.

452
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
So, I had to inch those out a little bit.

453
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:29,000
But, yeah, I'm enjoying the game. It's frustrating. I'm still not quite to the point where I understand all the mechanics of it, like trying to do some of the tricks, like bunny hopping and stuff like that.

454
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
It's a little bit tricky, but it's a fun game. Keeps my attention for a while.

455
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The other thing I would like to mention, though, they added a freemium element to it as well.

456
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And so, now there's this shit that's these golden acorns or something that you have to purchase in order to buy customizable customization DLC.

457
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And that's the only way you can get them, as far as I'm aware, is buying them.

458
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So, fuck you, Ubisoft. You already have enough DLC for this game. Now you're doing this shit. I mean, come on. It's a little ridiculous.

459
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Unfortunately, we're seeing more and more in all these different games.

460
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Alright, my gaming week. So, again, most of my gaming time was spent in Final Fantasy XIV Heaven's Word, just because it's such a darn solid MMO.

461
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And I've been working my way. You know, I beat the game last week, or beat the story, but there's still, you know, endgame. It's an MMO. It never ends. It keeps going.

462
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So, I've been playing, trying to gear up the last couple dungeons and so forth and the different roulettes to get the tomes to buy the gear so I can do the raid.

463
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:40,000
They just put in Alexander a couple weeks ago, which is the raid, which is basically you going through a giant robot, which is Alexander.

464
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And, you know, there's these different stages. So, I got to do that raid with some members of my free company last night, and that was cool.

465
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Actually, we cleared all four levels because they actually have an easier kind of raid mode in right now, and they're putting a really, really hard one in this next week.

466
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So, that's cool. I'm fine doing the easy one. I don't really have to do the super hard mode.

467
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Banging my head against a fight for three hours on end isn't exactly my cup of tea, but I'm glad I can still do some stuff with the raiding that we're able to do.

468
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So, that was a lot of fun. So, that ate up most of my time, but this weekend I was out at Best Buy because I wanted to get a wrist rest for my keyboard, and I saw that they were selling Elder Scrolls Online for $20 off.

469
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So, I was like, oh, well, I've been curious, and I've been wanting to get this on PlayStation 4, so I'm going to pick up the Elder Scrolls Online.

470
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:43,000
So, I picked up Elder Scrolls Online on PlayStation 4. So, I brought it home, and I put the disc in, and I've installed it, and it downloaded some 30-gig patch. I don't know.

471
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So, finally, late last night, I went to play it, and I made my characters a very complex character-making system.

472
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
The interface feels a lot like Skyrim, of course, which they want it to feel like a multiplayer Skyrim.

473
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And so, I made my character, and then I rolled into the world, and I'm in the prison, I'm doing the tutorial, and I'm like, there's certain things I'm supposed to do that I'm not seeing.

474
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It'll say press, and then it's just blank to move forward or whatever, and I'm like, alright, well, I'm not an idiot. I know that's the left stick, but it's weird that the little picture isn't there.

475
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And then suddenly, after 30 seconds, that picture pops in of the left stick. I'm like, alright.

476
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:29,000
And so, then I'm going around the world, and I get into a fight, and it's like press R2 to attack. I'm like, what do I attack? There's nothing there.

477
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And then finally, after like 60 seconds, something pops in. And then it's like, okay, so now you're going to hit L2 to dodge.

478
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:46,000
And I'm like, what am I dodging? And then I get killed. And I'm like, I don't understand what's happening right now. I'm really tired. I'm just going to shut this off and go to bed.

479
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
So I went to bed, and I get up today, and I'm doing my thing, and I'm like, alright, I think I need to try Elder Scrolls Online again, because I don't understand what the hell happened last night.

480
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So I'm getting in there, and I'm playing it again, and sure enough, I'm having these same problems where I'm trying to just do the tutorial levels, and like, fucking enemies don't even pop in at all.

481
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And buttons are just missing in the tutorial, and I don't understand how this game was fucking coded, because it makes no fucking sense.

482
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And I understand it's an online-only game, and disclosure, sure, my PlayStation 4 is wireless, as I think most systems are set up these days.

483
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
It shouldn't matter, though.

484
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Exactly. I can play Final Fantasy XIV just fine on PlayStation 4 wireless. I can play pretty much anything else on PlayStation 4 wireless. I'm sorry, I'm not going to accept the excuse that, oh, because it's not wired, that's why it's running as unplayable as it is.

485
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:48,000
And so, I'm trying to go around just the first little level to find, and like, I even took a video of this, so I can upload it later.

486
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Like, the little mob, I don't even want to say boss, because it really wasn't anything, you have to like sneak around this thing that's in like a gazebo looking thing, I don't know, you have to sneak around and attack it, basically.

487
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And so, you couldn't see the mob in the gazebo, so I had no idea which way it was facing, and finally, like after 90 seconds it pops in, I'm like, this game is unplayable, I want a refund.

488
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,000
How is anybody playing Elder Scrolls Online on PlayStation 4? I have to know, because for me, it's unplayable.

489
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:28,000
And it even, again, it patched, I don't have problems with any other games on PlayStation 4, and I can hear people talking in the world, so it's not like my connection is total shit.

490
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So, I guess I could try and do the wired thing and see if it hooks up that way, but I'm sorry, that's a pretty shitty workaround. Just calling it like it is.

491
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Like, if it's downloading what these things look like from the internet or something, like, why isn't that just on the disc, or already there when you go into the zone?

492
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I always thought that things like pictures of the R2 button were already there on the disc. I don't understand.

493
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:12,000
So, anyway. Alan Alchemy in chat says our PS4 is wired for anyone who's like, get off WiFi. Actually, we moved that to the Xbox One, you forgot, we moved that into the Xbox One when we got the PlayStation 4.

494
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:24,000
So, the PlayStation 4 is, because I had to download like 80 gigabytes of Halo Chief Master Collection, all the other backwards, so I was like, I'll just make the Xbox One wired for now.

495
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So, and let's see, so I'm looking, what else in the chatroom here, over at live.vaganetwork.com, let's see.

496
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Black Wolf says, mine's wired, neater, neater. Have you played Elder Scrolls Online, though? Because, I don't know.

497
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I played the beta, and that was enough for me. I was just like, nope.

498
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
See, and that's what some people were talking about in chat, that, oh, I played that, but it was on PC.

499
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But, again, I would like to know how anybody got past the first level, because I'm sure there's people out there playing on PlayStation 4 and loving it, and they see the recruitment posts, but for me, I can't play it.

500
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I can't play it. I want a refund. Like, it's that bad. I don't, it's, I just spent $40 on a game that I can't fucking play.

501
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You know, okay, yeah, it was on sale, but then it's like, well, shit, I used the code inside, so am I fucked? Like, I'm not gonna be able to get a refund? I'm sorry, that's bullshit.

502
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Game doesn't work. I want a refund. Anyway.

503
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Again, folks, Kaijuto saying, I played the beta, and textures were jacked. DungeonBuster saying, I played it on PC, and I wasn't much of a fan.

504
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Tigerclaw saying, I played it online when it came out. I didn't have problems with it, but it was on PC.

505
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So, again, just calling it like I see it. I know I might piss off some Elder Scrolls fans, but I've got video. I've got my receipts to back up what a crap experience I'm having.

506
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I'm not, I'm not having it. I'm not interested, really, in playing it. So, alright, anyhow.

507
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And, yeah, it's not beta anymore. Like, this game's been out a month. I got it on sale.

508
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Well, it's still being worked on.

509
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That's, I'm sorry, when did, when did we start accepting that as an excuse? That, oh, well, the game's still new, so it's still being worked on, so we still have to get that back.

510
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, it should be done.

511
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Yeah, tell that to the people that bought Batman on PC. Come on. Come on.

512
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Oh, how much extra time did they give themselves for Elder Scrolls, you know, online? It was supposed to be, can you imagine if this game wasn't by the play and was still charging the monthly subscription fee? Can you imagine that?

513
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Well, luckily, you at least usually get one month free with that stuff, and I would have learned that lesson real quick, but, my God.

514
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Anyway, again, Final Fantasy XIV works fine. So, I'm convinced this is a problem unique to Elder Scrolls Online. If you can prove me wrong otherwise, then fine. I'll hear it and I'll go back and try to enjoy the game again, but I'm not encouraged.

515
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Anyway, I hate talking so negative about a game, but I just, it doesn't work.

516
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:17,000
It was a game when it was first announced, I was like, fuck yes, and then the more they showed me of the game, I'm like, ugh. This isn't what I want. This isn't what I want. And then they tried to debate, I'm like, this isn't really what I want.

517
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:37,000
So, anyway, after I had my fill of Elder Unplayable Online, I turned it off and powered on my Wii U and played Blaster Master on Virtual Console, which was a far better use of my time. Far better use of my time. Blaster Master is still a shit after all these years. Hard as hell, but it's so rewarding. Such a good game.

518
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Anyway, let's move on. Some housekeeping tonight. We will not be here the weekend of Labor Day, so that's coming up in about, god, it's probably only about five weeks away at this point, maybe? It's kind of, maybe six? Dragon Con's coming up in just that short amount of time. I can't even believe it. It's gonna be crazy.

519
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So, yeah, we'll have details on Dragon Con in the coming weeks, and we'll all be there and say hi and all that good stuff. We're very excited about Dragon Con this year. But we will not be here live with the show over Labor Day weekend. Otherwise, we should still be here with the show every week until then.

520
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You can also add us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

521
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Before we get into the news, Tiger Claw in chat asking, by the way, did anyone play that Splatfest thing on Splatoon? Who won the water slides versus roller coasters thing?

522
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You know, I completely forgot about that yesterday, because between the food poisoning stuff I was dealing with and trying to play Elder Scrolls and playing Fallout fantasy 14, I just totally forgot that the Splatoon thing was yesterday until I saw all the tweets about it, so whoops.

523
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Akdeft in chat says roller coasters won.

524
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Of course. As it should.

525
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Yeah, I would have been team roller coasters for what it's worth. Of course, the one time I would have picked the right team. Nope, didn't play. Whoops. Whoops at me.

526
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Alright, let's get into some news. Lots of stuff going on in the gaming world. Loki.

527
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Yes, so it's been a while since we actually heard anything about Dead Rising 2, or Dead Rising, Dead Island 2. It looked fantastic from the trailer. Of course, I'm not assuming that that trailer actually represents accurate game footage, but I don't know.

528
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Anyways, I guess apparently the company Jaeger, who was doing the development on the game, has parted ways with Deep Silver.

529
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Basically saying our Jaeger team is fully committed to the development of AAA quality titles, we work closely with international publishers and partners, and at the same time have always remained an independent development studio.

530
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Our team has made the best... okay, there's so much fluff on this shit. However, Jaeger and Deep Silver's respective visions of the project fell out of alignment, which led to our decision that's being made.

531
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:21,000
So they wanted to do something with that game that the developer wasn't comfortable with, it sounds like. So that someone else is going to be developing it now. Makes me kind of wonder what that might have been.

532
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Uh oh, I wonder if it was a money grab thing.

533
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:32,000
DLC maybe? I don't know, who knows. Well, we can speculate all day, but it's going to a different developer right now.

534
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I thought that game was way further along than apparently it is, because I remember seeing that at E3 last year and thinking, I wasn't huge on Dead Island. In fact, what was it, Riptide or whatever? That was kind of the expansion, or it was a standalone.

535
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I really didn't care for that.

536
00:47:50,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Well, the other thing is, they're saying that apparently the company may have missed some milestones, so maybe it wasn't creative decisions. Maybe it was, hey, you guys aren't making the game fast enough.

537
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Or maybe they just wanted the game done faster than the developer thought it was appropriate. They didn't want another Arkham Knight type situation.

538
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Perhaps.

539
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
You know, rush the game out.

540
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Well, that's too bad for those that were looking forward to it, but at the same time, you know, if delaying it to get somebody else on board to fix it is what they need to do, then cool, but I hope, you know.

541
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Didn't they put a new developer on Duke Nukem Forever at one point, and wow.

542
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
This doesn't necessarily mean it's going to turn out okay in the end, but let's hope that it will.

543
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Yeah, we'll get to that.

544
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Let's see, Kaijuto in chat says, that was a huge CG cutscene. It wasn't the game, I don't think.

545
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yeah, of course not. No, it wasn't the game.

546
00:48:47,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Well, but I remember at the conferences, they showed that whole trailer thing for Dead Island 2. I remember that, but we were fortunate enough, we had a closed, you know, behind closed doors thing with Deep Silver.

547
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:15,000
We actually saw footage from Dead Island 2 that looked to me like it was the game. I mean, if it was like, I thought, and again, I'm having to go back a year and a half. I didn't think I'd have to talk about this again, so forgive my fuzzy memory, but I thought they were playing it live.

548
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:24,000
I didn't think it was one of those pre-recorded things where, because they do that sometimes. Sometimes they make it look like it's going to be like, oh, we're playing it live right now, but they'd actually recorded it all in advance.

549
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I thought they were playing it live, but you know, who knows these days with the way these things are set up, and now hearing this news makes me kind of wonder about that, but it looked fine from what I was seeing, but who knows?

550
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So, Kaijuto says, either way, zombies are played out, so who cares? Well, maybe waiting a year or two wouldn't be such a bad thing if that's the case, if people kind of feel like zombies are sort of played out.

551
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Yeah, I think. I mean, we just had Dying Light come out. Was that this year? Or was that last year?

552
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I feel like there's always a place for zombies. Like, there's just always some zombie game coming out.

553
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
What's this year?

554
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I don't know.

555
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I mean, yeah, but I don't know. I would like to have them spend some extra time on it and get it right.

556
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yep. Don't release something that's unplayable.

557
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:19,000
I also don't understand. I mean, I know the game's Dying Light, or not Dying Light, Dead Island, but I think it's supposed to be set in California. It's not really an island.

558
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
They had explained that, though. I don't know what it was.

559
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I know. It's, like, quarantined or something like that. Yeah. That's as much as saying Dead Rising is, you know, Dead Island. I mean, it's a poor excuse, but whatever.

560
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Alright. Well, I'm sure y'all know that EVO's going on right now. The huge tournament in Las Vegas for different fighting games, which I always want to say EVO because of that song from BeatMania 2DX.

561
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:54,000
It's EVO. I always want to say it that way, but it's EVO, I guess. Wouldn't it be EVO because it's evolution? Why do we say EVO and not EVO? I don't know.

562
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Anyway, if I'm screwing up the pronunciation, I apologize, but I heard other people saying it as EVO, so that's what I'm going to go with.

563
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:10,000
So, EVO's going on this weekend, and lots of news about Street Fighter V. I think I heard that they just announced a new character for Street Fighter V. Somebody was saying that in chat.

564
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But this was announced yesterday, I think, and that is that Street Fighter V is going to be taking a more service-based approach to post-launch content, meaning the Street Fighter V disc is the only disc you'll ever need to own.

565
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:38,000
There will not be Ultra Street Fighter V, Super Street Fighter V, Ultra Turbo Championship Edition Street Fighter V versus the Care Bears or whatever it is. There's only going to be Street Fighter V.

566
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,000
So that alone is pretty neat to hear, and that all balance and system adjustments will be free.

567
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So if they're just tinkering with that, which the way it was in Street Fighter IV is that if you wanted all the up-to-date adjustments, you had to buy Ultra or whatever it was they did at the end. They had to buy some of those discs as they went along the way.

568
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:05,000
All post-launch gameplay related content will be earnable for free by playing the game.

569
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:15,000
So it seems like the more you play the game, you'll get the little currency or whatever in the game, and then you can unlock characters post-content for free.

570
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
But if you want them right away, of course you could also pay for that as well.

571
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
And it seemed like a lot of this had to do with the fact that things would get out of sync.

572
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You'd have some people that are playing the old-school Street Fighter IV and then people that are on the new one.

573
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So this would help keep everybody on the same page by making the balance and system adjustments available for free.

574
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:50,000
This could also be somewhat of a response to the fact that Capcom took an awful lot of shit when it was discovered that so many characters and things that they were going to release as DLC were already there on the disc anyway.

575
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Didn't that happen with Marvel vs. Capcom 3 or something like that?

576
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And I want to say Street Fighter X Tekken had a little bit of that too where a lot of that was found on the disc.

577
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,000
So this might be their way of trying to counteract that a bit too.

578
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
So going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

579
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Kaijuto says, that's not good news. That means they're going to make that shit into a huge pay-as-you-play game.

580
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Well, they're saying it's going to be possible to do it for free. I mean, who knows how much of a grind.

581
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:29,000
But there's going to be both fight money, which you get through playing the game, and zenny, which you can use real money.

582
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
So, hmm, we'll see.

583
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Fifth Dream says, get Sakura by beating it on the highest level 30 times with only low punch or buyer for $19.99.

584
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Just watch. We will be fucked by this.

585
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
As J100Matt says, it's a nice gesture, but I'm skeptical to see how this goes.

586
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I can appreciate the skepticism and I understand.

587
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
By the way, speaking of EVO, surely, this has been everywhere. It was on Twitter, it was on Facebook, everywhere.

588
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Did you see the whole thing about Jamie Lee Curtis went to EVO in cosplay to avoid the crowd?

589
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Good for her. What a rockstar.

590
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:13,000
I kind of think that she should really embrace, I'm not saying she's not, but she should really embrace that gamer in her.

591
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:19,000
It keeps her young. Here's the thing, when I think of Jamie Lee Curtis, obviously Jamie Lee Curtis is a badass mofo, right?

592
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Like True Lies, Halloween, Fish Called Wanda, she's an on-screen legend. Everybody loves Jamie Lee Curtis.

593
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
But when you think of her these days, you think of Activia commercials, right?

594
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
And you think about the parodies of her on Saturday Night Live.

595
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Freaky Friday.

596
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,000
It helps you poop! And all that stuff, right? The Activia.

597
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:47,000
So I'm kind of like, Jamie Lee Curtis, you're like a cool mom right now. You're taking your kid to EVO.

598
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:53,000
You should embrace that gamer side right now. Jamie Lee Curtis, go all in.

599
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Host a gamer show on Twitch or something. I don't know, maybe she has no interest in that stuff.

600
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
But it seems like she really does like these fighting game things.

601
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
She dressed up.

602
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Yeah, she dressed up. I think a lot of that too, I think a lot of that is just cool mom factor because I think she did it for her kid.

603
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:17,000
And I think she probably plays the video games because it's a way for her to have a hobby that she does with her kid.

604
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:25,000
And you know, I don't want to sound like, gosh, the woman surely can't appreciate video games for any other reason.

605
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I mean, maybe that's it, and that's totally cool if that's the reason.

606
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,000
But I'm just saying, I feel like there's a lot of that family bonding coming into play over this.

607
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
So maybe she doesn't have an interest in doing more gaming things, but I just think, I don't know.

608
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I would just like to think that she's really good at Street Fighter or something like that.

609
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Just come up there, just kick someone's ass dressed up like Vega, and then all of a sudden it's like the reveal!

610
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
It was Jamie Lee Curtis the entire time!

611
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I think that'd be badass. That'd be amazing.

612
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:02,000
TigerKlonchat says, this is the first time EVO had a real celebrity attend the event, so that's kind of a big deal.

613
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:08,000
ActDeaf says, considering the age of many attendees at EVO, I don't think it'll be a problem talking about like,

614
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
do people even necessarily know who Jamie Lee Curtis is?

615
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
That is fucking sad. I'm sorry. Educate yourself.

616
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Jamie Lee Curtis is awesome.

617
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Okay, I hate gore movies. I've talked about this a million times on the show.

618
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I don't like the gore, I don't like Saw, I don't like the super scary movies.

619
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Still, I've seen Halloween, and I like Halloween.

620
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And I'm not talking about that Rob Zombie bullshit, I'm talking about 70s opening moments of the mask-wearing,

621
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
eerie-ass piano theme and fucking Jamie Lee Curtis Halloween.

622
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
How have you not seen that movie?

623
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I need you to watch that movie this week if you haven't seen it.

624
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
If you're like 18, you're like, who's Jamie Lee Curtis? I don't know.

625
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Watch Halloween, goddammit.

626
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Anyway.

627
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Kaizhudo in chat says, Rob also thinks she only plays cooking mama. That is not true. Shut up.

628
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,000
TigerKlon says, she was great in True Lies. I wish they did a sequel.

629
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Yeah, they always talked about doing a sequel, but then they never did, which is really sad.

630
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I think Governor Schwarzenegger had a lot to do with that.

631
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Kaizhudo in chat says, Halloween didn't have a lot of gore, though.

632
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And that's true, I mean, it had some, but it wasn't, like, it was 70s gore, you know, it was different then.

633
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
So it wasn't as nasty.

634
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
So. Anyway.

635
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Shoutout to Jamie Lee Curtis for being a cool gamer lady.

636
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
And I would love to have her on this show, dammit.

637
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Open invite. If you're Jamie Lee Curtis, let's dish.

638
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I won't bring up activity, I swear.

639
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Alright, let's move on. Loki.

640
00:57:48,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Alright, so, this is kind of unfortunate, but the UK High Court, they have basically ruled that the regulation apparently for fair use, I guess, ripping, you know, DVDs or music for personal use is not fair.

641
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Not fair use anymore. So.

642
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I guess this is, they're saying a new ruling as of the 2014 regulation that made it legal to make personal copies of performances has been nullified.

643
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
So you're not going to be able to rip that kind of stuff if you live in the UK.

644
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Well, good luck trying to stop people from ripping CDs into their iTunes. Give me a break.

645
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I'm sure everyone's like, oh, well, I better stop now. That's going to stop everybody from, like, pirating Game of Thrones and all that shit as well.

646
00:58:45,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I get the whole thing. To an extent, I get it. Like, you know, the whole fact where, oh, well, I have to make a perfect Blu-ray copy of Street Fighter V in case my disc ever goes bad someday.

647
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I just have to keep a copy over here for that. You know, I kind of...

648
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I always thought that was a little bit, like, who really does that?

649
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I think it's more of a convenience thing, though. I mean, because, like, if you're, I understand, like, if you're ripping a copy and giving it to your friend or something like that, that's not okay, I guess.

650
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:33,000
So, but, like, if you're, like, ripping a copy of, like, you have a collection of DVDs or Blu-rays or something like that, and now you have this, like, media set up or whatever that you're going to stream them all to your TV using your PC,

651
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I don't see a problem with you ripping that. It's your own personal shit. First off, I don't see how the court's going to fucking come down on you and say, oh, uh, you know.

652
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:53,000
No one's going to get in your business about that shit unless they're just making it, you know, in case they catch you out there, you can't say, oh, well, it was for personal use, you know. I don't know.

653
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I don't even know what the point of this is, because, I mean, they're not going to, how are you going to enforce that? Is some, was your, like, nosy neighbor going to come up?

654
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Yeah, um, Bobby next door was, uh, he was ripping his shit from, you know, Blu-ray to watch on his TV. You better send the police after him, because, uh, that's just not okay.

655
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I have a feeling it might be to close some type of legal loophole for maybe when they go after people that do it on a much greater scale.

656
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:31,000
I mean, the real problem is, and this is when you're going to start to gain the notice of these companies, is when, uh, you start selling these CDs that you burn at, you know, flea markets.

657
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And, you know, when you're turning around and making a profit off of that is when it really becomes a problem.

658
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Um, I, I kind of think maybe this is to close some type of legal loophole in that regard, that maybe some of those people in defense are trying to say, well, these are the copies I was authorized to make. I don't have the original before, so I, anymore, so I was just selling the copy and it was still mine.

659
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:01,000
And maybe this is to close that up a bit, but I just feel like it leaves open this whole, like, come on. It's, it's an unrealistic expectation of society.

660
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:11,000
But at the same time, I mean, I hate, hate always, you know, siding with the music industry cause I don't know. Um, because they're really behind the times with a lot of things, I think.

661
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I think the music industry should have caught the iTunes wave and all this stuff and probably the streaming music and all this a good five years before they really did. And I think it really hurt them in the end, you know, but, um, streaming music is really where so much is at right now that it's just, it's so easy to do it.

662
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And I think, uh, you know, when people used to pay $15 for a CD and now they can just get it for free on Spotify, you know, the music industry is hurting in that regard and I sort of get it, but at the same way, at the same time, you know, maybe they have to figure out what's more value that we can sell and have music with that.

663
01:01:49,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Um, and I know sometimes they've given away like t-shirts with a CD or discount concert tickets or something with a CD and it seems like, you know, give away some more of those tangible things. I don't know.

664
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Maybe, uh, some pre-order bonuses.

665
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Maybe.

666
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Maybe some on disc DLC.

667
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:28,000
A disc, a track that's only like, Hey, back in my day, back in my day, uh, a locked track on the disc was somebody telling you, did you know if you leave Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill running like five minutes after the last song, there's a totally acapella song still there at the end.

668
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And there'll always be somebody that was like, I've never tried that.

669
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Did you go home and fast forward their CDs?

670
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Wow, there is a secret song.

671
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:43,000
The X-Files soundtrack. You can reverse the, or you can rewind in the first track and it'll go back and play about five new tracks that are before the first track.

672
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
No, I didn't even know that. I didn't know that.

673
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Yeah, it's a trippy one.

674
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Huh. And then was there a Nine Inch Nails album that had like 99 tracks on it? You had to keep it going past, I don't know. Anyway, forget it.

675
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,000
We're showing our age here a little bit. There's people listening to this show now that are like, what's the CD?

676
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
What's the X-Files?

677
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
What's the X-Files? You'll find out.

678
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,000
And soon.

679
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
You'll find out because it's coming back.

680
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I still haven't seen that last movie either. And I hear that was really like cheesy.

681
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
You're going to find out what Twin Peaks is all about too. That's coming back.

682
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I have never.

683
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Everything 90s is awesome.

684
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I have never watched Twin Peaks.

685
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Twin Peaks is so good. I mean, it is very 90s though. Like just all the fashion and everything. You're like, oh my God. But it's so good.

686
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Scary and it's funny. Anyway, moving on.

687
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:43,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, friend.

688
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Alright, so if you have the BA...

689
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. I'm sorry. I'm sorry because this is important. This is common in chat room.

690
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:56,000
As Jonah Hunter-Matt says, I used to burn OLR episodes on CDs to listen to in the car on my way to school.

691
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Get... Call the po-po. Send them to his house. Arrest this man. That is... Excuse me. Excuse me. That is our content.

692
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
How dare you put it on a CD? How dare you copy that content?

693
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Obviously, I'm completely joking. It's out there on the internet for free. We don't make any money off this.

694
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
So put it on torrent sites. Maybe more people will hear it that way.

695
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I... Great. Put them on CDs. Conveniently leave them behind at restaurants. No, I'm kidding. Don't do that.

696
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,000
The trick is, though, in order to get more views on the websites, when you put it up as a torrent, you need to make sure that you mention that it's part of Game of Thrones.

697
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Yes.

698
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Now, it's not a name we normally use on this show to describe our episodes, but Game of Thrones really is accurate when you're putting it up on a torrent site.

699
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Or just, you know, use some of what Salacious Pop says in the match game as titles for the show. You know, that'll attract more attention and more hits, I'm sure.

700
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Anyway...

701
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Or Game of Thrones sex scene compilation.

702
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I'm being asked if Travis's lawyer's got me yet. I only got... I missed Understation Live this week. Hopefully he'll actually put a podcast up soon.

703
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:21,000
But lord only knows what threat I missed on this week's Understation Live. Can't wait to hear. Alright, anyway. Moving on. Loki.

704
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:35,000
So if you happen to be a member of the Epic Games forum, you probably would want to change your password. Therefore it's been compromised and they're recommending, of course, that you change your passwords.

705
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:54,000
They have discovered that it was compromised by hackers and that, as of such, they've had access to your username, email, and password and a date of birth that you provided during registration. So please change all those things, including your date of birth. Sorry.

706
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
So.

707
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
They get everything.

708
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Yep. They've got your date of birth now.

709
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
Is nothing safe anymore?

710
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Nothing.

711
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Sorry for the silence. I'm eating a cookie. I have no Jamie here either tonight to help full time. Cookies are important, people.

712
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Apparently the crime we committed is that there are USL 1.0 episodes on the OLR Wiki. I didn't even know that.

713
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
I put him there.

714
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:35,000
It was pro- Access to SH-100 Matt. He's the one that's putting all the shows on CDs and shit. Is him or Dark Tetsuya? They probably co-conspired. I don't know nothing.

715
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I blame that hacker 4chan.

716
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
You'll never take me alive.

717
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It's the guy that did the Epic forums hack. Took that show and put it on the Wiki.

718
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Alright, anyhow. Moving on. I noticed Brad from Pod Culture and chat was just talking about this a moment ago that he's actually doing this right now.

719
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:02,000
And that is Microsoft opening up the Xbox to Windows game streaming to everyone.

720
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:09,000
So it's no longer just for people that are in super special secret beta test programs or what have you.

721
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:23,000
But Xbox to PC game streaming restrictions are now gone and anyone with the Xbox One and Windows 10 can play an Xbox One game on whatever Windows 10 device you have.

722
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I'm still trying to figure out how to actually get registered to download Windows 10.

723
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Because it's like, oh, just click on the little Windows icon in your toolbar and like, I don't have one of those. Where is this magical window that I'm supposed to click on to get free Windows 10?

724
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Are you keeping all your things up to date?

725
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Yeah, I actually updated the other day. So I should be up to date as of like Saturday. So, where is my goddamn window? That's what I want to know.

726
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Do you have a genuine copy of Windows?

727
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:59,000
Yes, it came with my laptop. I actually do have a genuine copy this time for my laptop.

728
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Well, there you go. Yeah, Brad from Bot Culture says playing Forza Horizon 2. Is Windows 10 like actually out out?

729
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Well, what's supposed to happen is you're supposed to like, you click on that thing and it's supposed to like notify you or whatever when it's available there to roll it out slowly.

730
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:25,000
But I kind of want to get it rolled out because as I think I mentioned on the show before, I've been trying to use Unity 5, or at least on Twitter, people are probably aware of that.

731
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I've been trying to use Unity 5.0 and it just, there's some weird ass bug where anytime I try to change the color of something using a pallet picker, it fucking crashes.

732
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And so it's been pissing me off. And so Windows 10, hopefully that getting installed, hopefully fix the problem.

733
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Hmm. Well, apparently there's the Windows 10 Xbox app and there's party chat tweaks to how screenshots are working and video clips are shared via the game DVR.

734
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,000
So more features there coming out for that. Tiger Hall is saying July 29th is apparently when they roll it out.

735
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Yeah. You can choose to install it if you want. I do want to install it.

736
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:18,000
All right. I'm going to probably wait just a little bit because I want to see how, you know, the real people of the world out there react to Windows 10, but I'm curious about it.

737
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:26,000
It is an odd numbered version of Windows. And you're probably thinking, wait a minute. No, no, no, Rob, you're an idiot. Ten's not an odd number.

738
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
They skipped nine. So this is an odd number.

739
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

740
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I think it's good because seven was good. And then what was before seven? The one before seven was Vista and people didn't like that.

741
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
So, yeah, so it is good.

742
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So, you know, anyway.

743
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I'm hoping it's good.

744
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Yeah, it should be.

745
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,000
I just need an Xbox to stream to it now.

746
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
You know, it's weird.

747
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I'm still undecided if I'm going to do an Xbox or a Wii U. Leaning towards Xbox.

748
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
All right.

749
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
But I'm actually kind of leaning towards maybe nothing because, you know, same argument goes with the Xbox One as the Wii U.

750
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Why should I buy a system for a couple games?

751
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
So, we'll see.

752
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:21,000
All right. Moving on, I got another story for you guys that has to do with a complete randomization of everything in this upcoming game called Rust, which is being created by Face Punch Studios.

753
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
What a lovely, inviting name.

754
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Here's the thing about Face Punch Studios. They are randomizing racial and gender aspects of player characters.

755
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Now, here's the thing about that. You might think, all right, what's the big deal?

756
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
But people are not necessarily responding positively to this.

757
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:53,000
What this means is that based on your Steam gamertag, whatever it is you are on Steam, that's used as a seed, basically, to generate what the player character is going to look like in the game.

758
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
So, that's not to say that you get to create your character.

759
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:03,000
You won't get to create or pick the character's race or gender. You will be...

760
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Or penis size.

761
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Or posterior size, like I could in Elder Scrolls Online. I can say that. That was the best part of Elder Scrolls Online I saw so far, is that there's a slider for that ass.

762
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Posterior size. Anyway. No, you will not be able to even pick your character.

763
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Volition, I'm telling you right now, if you're listening, that's what you need to change that slider to. That ass just needs to be that slider name, though.

764
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
So anyway, here's the quote from Gary Newman with Face Punch Studios.

765
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:43,000
To clear up some confusion, when it does go live, you won't get a choice of whether you're female or male. We're not taking the choice away from you. You never had a choice.

766
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:54,000
So, it's an interesting game design decision that, even though it appears that the race and the gender is customizable, you are going to be essentially stuck with whatever it is.

767
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:02,000
There's a part of me that's like, alright, but if you have the engine in there to be able to create whatever, then just let people make what they want to make.

768
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:13,000
But, I also see the point of, alright, in Final Fantasy XIII, I didn't get to pick any of that for the characters I was playing, so how is this necessarily any different?

769
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I suppose a lot of it depends on the story.

770
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
There is no story.

771
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
There is no story.

772
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
It's a survival game.

773
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Oh, it is.

774
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
It's like DayZ, but with naked people. Seriously, what is it?

775
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Well, we do need to diversify the naked people we have out there.

776
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,000
No, it was previously. Up until now, they just had women. It was all naked schlongs running around.

777
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:46,000
So, they have that going for it, but what I'm saying is, do you really think, are you really going to go out there and say, oh yes, you all have a choice?

778
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:54,000
There's seriously a hacker out there that's going, damn, hell, I have no choice. Please, come on.

779
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
That's actually a really good point.

780
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:07,000
They're going to come up with a character customizer that's going to come out there and they'll hack it into the game. I'm sorry. They're going to find a way.

781
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It's an interesting twist, but I just, you know, again, now that you're telling me there's no story behind it, I'm kind of like, well, then if the ability is there to do whatever you want.

782
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Maybe there is a story, like, as much of a story as, like, DayZ. It's basically a survival game. You craft shit and you survive.

783
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
But it's, you know, kind of like this, I don't know if it's post-apocalyptic or what it's supposed to be like, caveman type thing.

784
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:43,000
But basically, you start off with no clothes and you go running around and you find items, guns and stuff and then you do that.

785
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:52,000
But I don't know. I mean, you play an MMO today and there's a lot of characters that look the same. I mean, you know, maybe mixing it up a little bit wouldn't be such a bad thing.

786
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Well, it's not mixing it up. They're going to still look the same. It's just you don't get a choice on how, you know, they look.

787
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,000
All right. Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see some games that are coming out to a store near you.

788
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So this week, there are a few things coming out. Starting off with Formula One 2015. That's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

789
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Oni Chambara Z2 Chaos from Exceed is coming out on PlayStation 4. Wolfenstein The Old Blood getting a disc release on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

790
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
The Zombie Army Trilogy also on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. And that is it.

791
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Any of those you're going to pick up?

792
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:45,000
I thought about Oni Chambara Z2 Chaos, but I think that's more of a sale game. I don't think that's worth 50 bucks for me.

793
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Yeah, that does sound like a bit much.

794
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I mean, especially if there was Earth Defense Force 4. Fuck yeah, I'm picking that up, but it's not so much.

795
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I actually still may consider getting the import version of Earth Defense Force. We'll have to see because that is coming out in the fall.

796
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
All right. Well, let's go over to Japan and check out some of the releases over there.

797
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:18,000
On the PlayStation 4 this week, on July 23rd, Sengoku Basara 4 Sumerage in regular and limited edition comes out from Capcom on the PlayStation 4 this week.

798
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
So I think there'll be some people picking that up.

799
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:29,000
On the Xbox One, nothing this week because, you know, Xbox One in Japan isn't really the same thing as it is in other parts of the world.

800
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:40,000
On the Wii U this week, Japan does get a Monster Hunter Frontier GA premium package. I'm not sure what's all in that, if it's a price reduction or what that is.

801
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
That's really the only thing that is on the Wii U this week.

802
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:55,000
On the Vita this week, Makai Shin Trillion in regular and limited edition are out in Japan, as well as Van Wolf Cross is out in regular and what they call First Press Edition.

803
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:05,000
And lastly, but not leastly, on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Langrisser Reincarnation Tensei in regular and a Legend Box edition.

804
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:10,000
So, lots of regular and limited editions, but that's pretty normal for Japan.

805
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Dark Soccer is not here, so I will try to fill in best I can with the UK releases this week.

806
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:25,000
It really looks like there's not a whole lot this week. Let's see, on the 21st, Journey's digital release on PlayStation 4, which we're getting that as well.

807
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:34,000
On the 24th, Victor Vran on the PC, and on the 25th, Cradle for the PC. That's really it this week in Europe.

808
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:41,000
So, look forward to those games. Just a couple more games for you guys, or stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

809
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:49,000
And by the way, I should quickly say this, I guess all this is coming out of EVO right now, that they're a Street Fighter 5 character.

810
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
It's a new character, because they did promise that there would be some new characters in the game.

811
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
It looks like Nakali, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, I might be totally saying that wrong.

812
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
But it's apparently in, what kind of, what's the character look like? Anyone got a picture?

813
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Everybody's linking the names. Show me a picture.

814
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:16,000
But okay, so the character was revealed to EVO as a new guy. So they're working on a picture for us right now, so we can take a look at that.

815
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Alright, well we'll do a story here real quick and then I'll look at the picture.

816
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Well, here we go. Let's see, Nakali, and they have a trailer that meets battle in Aztec.

817
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
And, I'm gonna just bring it up real fast.

818
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
He has long dreads that go super cyan.

819
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I'm looking right now. Here, here's what it looks like. Oh, I got it.

820
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Whoa, that's weird looking. Okay.

821
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,000
So, wow, he does have crazy dreads that are going super cyan.

822
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
He's got Cthulhu hair.

823
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Release the Kraken that is my hair. Alright, very cool.

824
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Well, it is different.

825
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Apparently you can spot him at the end of the Ken trailer.

826
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Oh, really? Yeah.

827
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Alright, Loki.

828
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Alright, so let's see.

829
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Where were we?

830
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:20,000
As we were talking a little bit before about rushing things and switching developers and stuff, we were talking about Dead Island 2.

831
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Brought up Duke Nukem Forever.

832
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,000
And, well, of course, Gearbox would love to do a Duke Nukem game.

833
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:37,000
However, they're open to having an outside developer handle the new Duke Nukem game.

834
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Which I think is a fantastic idea. They should have someone else handle the game.

835
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Might I recommend Devolver Digital? I think they would be perfect for that.

836
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
But, yes.

837
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
They said basically that Gearbox has done some prototyping on the new entry.

838
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
However, they think it would be faster if someone else came along to help them out with it.

839
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Dungeon Buster in chat says, I didn't realize people wanted another Duke Nukem game.

840
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I want a good Duke Nukem game. I mean, I'm still waiting for another Duke Nukem game because I don't count Duke Nukem Forever.

841
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
That was a piece of shit.

842
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Kind of like how we discount, you know, I don't know, the original trilogy for, or not the original, the new trilogy.

843
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
The prequel trilogy, yes.

844
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
For Star Wars, definitely.

845
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
So, alright.

846
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Lastly, before we get into the classic game of the week, some hololens information there that Jason teased at the top of the show here.

847
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Apparently, CEO Sataya Nadella, in an interview with ZDNet, was saying that the first hololens will probably be more about developers and enterprise than it will be about games.

848
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Quote, in general, Microsoft's approach will be always this dual-use focus, or this multi-focus.

849
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
What we can uniquely do is bridge consumer to enterprise.

850
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I want every technology of ours to seek that out.

851
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
In the hololens case, when I look at the interest, it's amazing how many are in hospitals, healthcare, retail.

852
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
That's where I'm seeing the interest, and we will definitely go after it.

853
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Gaming will always be a scenario, and there will be other entertainment broadly.

854
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,000
But with the version one of hololens, I want to push us a lot more of the enterprise usage.

855
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
It's because this shit can't run the games, that's why.

856
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
You think it can't even run games yet?

857
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:29,000
It can't run, it doesn't have the processing power to do it, and that's why you have such a narrow field of view, because of that.

858
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
It just would not work for gaming.

859
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
That's their fancy way of saying, well, we're just not really chasing after right now.

860
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
It's more like, your specs aren't going to be up to par when this shit releases in order to be able to run that stuff.

861
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Sure, you can play Minecraft in a tiny, tiny window.

862
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Hey, remember, I don't know, this also dates people.

863
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Remember a long time ago when Wolfenstein 3D came out, and a lot of the games like that, I don't know if you could do that with Doom.

864
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I think you could do it with Duke Nukem, where if it didn't run very well on your PC, you could window that shit down into a small little window in the middle of the screen.

865
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
You could do that with Doom, actually.

866
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Yes, that is what they're doing with HoloLens. It's a tiny, tiny field of view that it works in, and that's it.

867
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:17,000
And they're not about to fix it right now, because it would be too expensive, and they just aren't going to do it.

868
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Which is disappointing, because I kind of wanted to get in on that, but I'm going to have to wait now.

869
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I'm not too surprised, well, I mean, if it's going to take a few years, wait for the technology to get better.

870
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
It's like a lot of Apple devices come out, and you're like, eh, wait for the second one.

871
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Even the iPhone, the 3G was the second device that came out. The first device, it didn't really have custom apps or any of that stuff when it very, very first came out.

872
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
It was that second revision, and a lot of people were saying that even about the watch.

873
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I know Jamie would disagree, but she's not here, so I can say that for the watch, there's a lot of people that are just waiting for the second one before they're interested.

874
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I can still see the point, yeah.

875
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:05,000
That's not all uncommon for people to wait, but specifically with Microsoft, when the Kinect came out, it ended up being a lot of dance games and things like that.

876
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:13,000
But then it also found an audience in hospitals, so you don't have to touch things, a very sterile environment.

877
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Kinect worked very well there, so in some ways, it generated a lot of good will, good buzz stories, and the good of gaming type things for Microsoft.

878
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I don't blame them for maybe wanting to chase down a little more of that either.

879
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I just wish they would have something that was more of like, it runs off of your PC and streams it to the headset.

880
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Think of a Wii U tablet, something like that, where your PC does the processing power, and it streams it to that headset.

881
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:54,000
It breaks that cardinal console thing of everything is the same, and then you have some people can run it better than others, and usually with consoles, that's not the case.

882
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Then you can have the RT version, like they do with the stupid Surface, where it runs off of the headset only.

883
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And then for the versions that you want to get all crazy with your HoloLens stuff, then it runs it better. I don't know. Whatever.

884
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I'll just have to deal with the Oculus Rift then in the meantime. One less headset to buy.

885
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Alright, well let's travel back to a time when games were so much simpler.

886
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,000
We didn't have fucking holograms and shit that were, you know, in our games.

887
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,000
We had the Playstation or whatever it was in front of us, and if you didn't like that, tough titty.

888
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
It's the classic game of the week.

889
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Every week Dark Soccer steps in the vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey, you kids should be playing this game this week.

890
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:52,000
But Dark Soccer, you know what, she's not here, which I got to admit is actually too bad because I really loved the game she picked this week.

891
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:58,000
But I guess I'll have to wait for another week because I don't want to try to talk about a game that she has a lot of memories with.

892
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:06,000
So when she's not here, either Loki or myself will take over the segment, and I think it's probably Loki's turn to do a classic game of the week.

893
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
So, Loki, what did you pick for the classic game of the week this week?

894
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I picked a game that was originally known as Simple 2000 Volume 31, The Monster Attack, better known as Earth Defense Force.

895
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Yes, Earth Defense Force is, it started off as one of the Simple 2000 games.

896
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,000
They were games that were marketed relatively inexpensive for the Playstation 2 by D3.

897
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And lots of great games came from that, most of which never made it out over here, but we did get two.

898
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
We got Only in Chambara and Earth Defense Force.

899
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:54,000
One I wish that we had was Zombies vs. Emulences, but also for Earth Defense Force.

900
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:04,000
So the very first game that was actually localized for Europe actually was Global Defense Force, and that was the localized version.

901
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And that was actually the second game that came out, so they had Earth Defense Force 2, Global Defense Force, and that came out in Europe on Playstation 2 as well.

902
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Basically, the premise of the games is that you are the last line of resistance against an extraterrestrial attacker that happens to be giant insects and robots.

903
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:39,000
And so it's all of your cheesy, like, 50s sci-fi movie stuff thrown together with, like, kind of, I don't know, Japanese sci-fi, something like a Godzilla-looking thing in there.

904
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:50,000
But it's pretty awesome, and it's just you fighting these monsters, and you unlock weapons by kind of grinding through the levels, and they have different difficulties you can play each thing on.

905
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:58,000
You know, starting off with very easy to the dreaded Inferno mode, where it's really fucking hard.

906
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Along with that, they did some newer versions of the game as well.

907
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
There was a Tactics game that they released in Europe as well.

908
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:14,000
The first major release over here in North America was Earth Defense Force 2017, which is the game that kind of got...

909
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I mean, I was aware of the game previously on the Playstation 2, but I never actually played it.

910
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
But when 2017 came over here, I played the crap out of that, and that was on the Xbox 360.

911
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
They later ported that to the Vita.

912
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And then along with that, there was another game, Earth Defense Force Insect Armageddon, which is made by a completely different company instead of Sandlot Games.

913
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:46,000
This was done by, I actually don't remember the company over here, but it was a North American company as opposed to the Japanese.

914
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,000
And so they kind of had a different spin on it, and that came out on Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and PC.

915
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:02,000
And then later, the Earth Defense Force 2025, which is kind of, I don't know if it was an update to Earth Defense Force 2017, I guess.

916
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:11,000
It's more of a sequel, but they kind of had some elements for 2017 as well as they even kind of took a few things from Insect Armageddon.

917
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:18,000
And now that's also coming out over here on Playstation 4 as Earth Defense Force 4.

918
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:33,000
So lots of fun stuff, and pretty awesome series. What's great about it though, it wasn't a technically great series as far as, you know, there was no physics in it really, or very minimal physics.

919
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:37,000
The graphics weren't that great. It was just fun and cheap.

920
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
So if you get a chance, definitely check it out, especially Earth Defense Force 2017.

921
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:51,000
It's got to be dirt cheap now on Xbox 360, or if you have a modern console, then Earth Defense Force 4 is right around the corner. It should be coming out this fall.

922
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Not that you're looking forward to that greatly or anything like that.

923
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:57,000
No, not at all.

924
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Alright, well there it is, your classic game of the week, the original, but it gives Loki an excuse to talk about the whole series.

925
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,000
The original Earth Defense Force 2017 for Playstation 2.

926
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Yeah, I think it's just Earth Defense Force.

927
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Alright.

928
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:30,000
That is going to do it for the first half of our show tonight, but when we come back, there's plenty more to come, including rapid fire news, the FUGL question of the week, more news, emails, and your calls at 1877 Game OLR, or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

929
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
We will come back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

930
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live with our 606th episode in progress for this July the 19th of 2015.

931
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Myself, Rob Roberts, and Loki here with you in studio, not here with us in studio tonight, Dark Sakura.

932
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:05,000
She talked to us earlier in the show, though. She may have been a little bit intoxicated, but she called in to talk about her trip to California Extreme anyway.

933
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:14,000
And by the way, I got a text from her during the break where she said, tell the CG capital T room they're sexy bicycle.

934
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And then another text message came in that said, bitched. So I think in text speak, when you're intoxicated, that means tell the chat room they're sexy bitches.

935
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
So there you go, chat room. You are a bunch of sexy bicycles.

936
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
I was going to say, I think it's sexy bicycles.

937
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,000
From a drunk Dark Sakura herself, you are a sexy bicycle for joining us here live.

938
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:43,000
You know what? You're all a bunch of sexy bicycles out there, too, listening to us on the podcast feed.

939
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,000
If you burn this to a CD and listen to it in the car, I don't know how you made it fit on a CD, because it's three hours long.

940
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
I guess you did that whole MP3 thing or whatever.

941
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
However you're choosing to listen to the show this week, thank you so much for doing it.

942
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Speaking of podcasting, before we get back into the news here real quick, did you see the whole celebration this week with iTunes doing a 10 years of podcasting? Acknowledged it.

943
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
That's pretty awesome. Were we on the list?

944
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Of course we weren't. We haven't been on the list for about 10 years.

945
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:20,000
We've been podcasting for 10 years. I don't understand. Wouldn't you think that there would be a very small number of people that are still podcasting for 10 years to include us?

946
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Why? When they can include, you know, people that are stand-up comics and all these celebrities and things like that.

947
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Wow, podcasting. Celebrities do it, too.

948
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I don't know. After so many years, you just stop caring.

949
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Eating. Celebrities do that as well. And pooping.

950
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,000
That's right.

951
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
That's right. They sure do.

952
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:54,000
But I thought that was interesting because there was this whole hashtag 10 years of podcasting, but actually, y'all, iTunes didn't start podcasting.

953
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I'd like you to think that. Obviously, iTunes, including podcasts, is what took it through the roof.

954
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,000
And even our own numbers went up exponentially when iTunes introduced podcasting.

955
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
So I'm not trying to say, oh, they didn't have an impact, because they sure fucking did.

956
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I mean, it was a huge, huge company, you know, kind of embracing something that was really made with a lot of their devices in mind.

957
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:24,000
But I remember a time when we were doing the OLR to-go edition, you had to use what was it, iPod or Lemon, you know, to download this show.

958
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:30,000
And it was this whole, like, you had to download it and then it would sync to your classic, because I don't think the iPhone was out yet.

959
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
No.

960
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
These were happening. So it was funny. So podcasting has really been around a little bit longer.

961
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:47,000
So, but, um, you know, it's cool, um, to think we won, we won that podcast award, uh, for best gaming podcast. What was that? 2005.

962
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It was about 10 years ago. So, and then that's when everybody stopped caring.

963
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,000
I'd like to think I stopped caring way all before that.

964
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
It's, it's funny to me at this point. I don't even care.

965
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Uh, let's see, go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Brad from Pod Culture says, I wonder the total years of podcasting VoG has, uh, too many.

966
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Do we talk about just podcasting or do we talk about like, uh, radio broadcasting before that?

967
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Because, uh, Bobby did even, Bobby, by the way, is celebrating 10 years. I should, should acknowledge this on our own show at some point.

968
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Um, if, if not next week, but, um, our pal Bobby Black Wolf, who we talk about a lot on this program because his show is on live before us and the voice geeks network.

969
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:42,000
And Bobby's been a huge partner in, in establishing the voice geeks network and so forth. His own podcast is turning 10 years old next week.

970
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:50,000
So when we talk about 10 years of podcasting, Bobby can use that in talking about himself because he's been podcasting for 10 years as of next week.

971
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:58,000
So a huge congratulations to him. Um, and I don't even know if OLR would still be running if it wasn't for Bobby Black Wolf because we would have been homeless for a little while.

972
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Um, so, you know, props to Bobby and, and hitting his 10 year landmark. I do need to make sure we give him his proper kudos at some point here, although I probably would have mentioned it next week too, but maybe I still will.

973
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Uh, so congratulations to him. Um, but anyway, do you count it? Cause Bobby even did like a handful episodes, I think on live 365 before podcasting.

974
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:33,000
And, uh, you know, certainly Travis from organization live was going even before we were on live 365, uh, since like I was at the end of 99 or was like 2000. I can't remember. It was a long time.

975
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:45,000
So when the years start to blur together, you know, that was a very long time ago, uh, act depth and chat says, I remember OLR having a listener cap of 150 people because life is just five.

976
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:55,000
It was a hundred. It wasn't even 150. It was a hundred and we hit it for the first time ever the week that we had the brand new, a curio mocha song from DDR.

977
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:07,000
We had the exclusive, uh, because what happened is that, you know, a lot of DDR fans Konami hired quite a few in the Bay area, including some friends of ours.

978
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,000
And so they had some early releases of the silent Hills soundtrack, which had the song on it.

979
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:21,000
And so we were able to get that CD and play the, play the DDR song before most people had even heard it. So we broke a hundred listeners that night. That was our first huge live night.

980
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
So good times.

981
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
I know Konami won't even talk to us.

982
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Of course, nobody will really talk to them either. So let's be real.

983
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Hey, I'll talk to them about DDR.

984
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
There you go. All right.

985
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Uh, and one of the things I'm looking to do, I mean, I still want to set up my DDR pads and rebuild those.

986
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:46,000
I'm just kind of discouraged a little bit because the garage is like an oven. So, you know, playing DDR in an oven, it's not so much fun.

987
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:52,000
Uh, Brad from Pod Culture, our buddy over there on that show on Monday night, which by the way, oh my God, talk about interviews.

988
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Did you know that on Monday's show, I usually tell you it's on Pod Culture, like after the show before we set off for the night, but I'm, this is huge.

989
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I got to tell you now, Brad from Pod Culture and that crew, they have, they're, they're short interviews, but they're still interviews with the seventh and eighth Doctor Who's.

990
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
And seventh and eighth, I guess they're all together at a con or something. So they got some interviews.

991
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:24,000
So that is coming up on Monday. So that's, so, you know, wow. Here we are, Loki, you and I sitting here talking to each other, but tomorrow night they're going to be talking to Doctor Who, seven and eight tomorrow.

992
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:30,000
That's pretty awesome. And so they're approaching, of course, 10 years old over Pod Culture. So that's a good on them.

993
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:35,000
So if you were to add up all those years of podcasting from everybody together, it's a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot.

994
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Anyhow, we had to get into some rapid fire news. Let's get to it. Uh, we got a lot to cover here. Loki.

995
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:54,000
All right. So as we, um, you know, we're playing a little bit of music during the break, you may remember that a lot of that comes from Blaster Master and Blaster Master is just released on virtual console for the Wii U.

996
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
So if you haven't picked it up, go get it.

997
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Oops. My bad. I might've spoiled that story for you earlier.

998
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
That's all right.

999
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
But hey, I will say this.

1000
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
It's good to remind you.

1001
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
It's only a dollar to upgrade if you had it on the Wii.

1002
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
And if you don't, it's $5.

1003
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:15,000
And some people forgot because some, uh, some friends of mine on Twitter are just discovering this series for the first time because of the Wii U release.

1004
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:23,000
And, uh, one thing I was, I was saying with that is that, um, well, one of my friends was saying that they need to do a remake.

1005
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
They need to redo Blaster Master and have a new one.

1006
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:32,000
And I was like, actually, a lot of people missed it, but in 2007 or eight or so, they had a Blaster Master remake on the Wii.

1007
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Uh, it was like Blaster Master Overdrive or something like that.

1008
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:40,000
It's, um, it's okay. It's okay. It's, it could have been better.

1009
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:47,000
It's one of those games that I think would benefit from like a update, not necessarily a remake, but like just redo the graphics.

1010
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Yeah.

1011
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Like a new, an all-stars version or something.

1012
01:36:50,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Yeah. I don't know. I, I, I was kind of surprised how grading the music got on me in the remake after a while, which as awesome as that song is, it's, it like kept starting over and over and over again.

1013
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Whenever you'd like go into the, you know, a third person and I don't know. Anyway.

1014
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,000
I would like to mention though that Jason from the back kind of looks like Hello Kitty.

1015
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,000
So I'm not really sure on you and the, the, was it the third person shooter portion of the game.

1016
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,000
So kind of looks like Hello Kitty.

1017
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Um, do you like roguelikes? Because if you do, I've got good news for you.

1018
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Somebody has actually compiled 700 free roguelikes into one torrent. That's a lot of roguelikes.

1019
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
It's a roguelike mega collection 2015.

1020
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
And they're not like free because somebody like stole them.

1021
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And no, they're not free because someone stole them.

1022
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Uh, they are free because, well, they're free.

1023
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,000
If you're interested, go check out, um, Reddit subreddit for roguelikes.

1024
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Um, there's a subreddit for roguelikes.

1025
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Are roguelikes. Yes, there is.

1026
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
And, um, you can check it out. They've got the, the torrent there and you can download that.

1027
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Um, I would try to see what games are included with that.

1028
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:13,000
If they, well, the list is going to be pretty big. I wouldn't try to read it all on air.

1029
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Yeah. It says a 700 free and or open source roguelikes.

1030
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:21,000
A few free rogue. Um, let's see here.

1031
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Rogue lights as well.

1032
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,000
So, very cool. Um, I don't know.

1033
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I might have to check that out, I guess.

1034
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Um, let's see.

1035
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
And then this is also pretty interesting news.

1036
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Um, you want a time killer at work?

1037
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,000
You can go play Night Trap through your web browser.

1038
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:49,000
That's right. Someone has ported or at least started to port Night Trap, uh, to the, um, to your browser.

1039
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,000
And you can check it out at nighttrap.azurewebsites.net.

1040
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Go play it.

1041
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
I actually did, uh, check it out. I checked out that link and I was like, oh my god.

1042
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I think the opening movie didn't have audio though.

1043
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Yeah, they were saying that there, uh, there isn't any audio in the op- for the opening or there isn't any audio for the opening video.

1044
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Give it a few seconds to load for a better experience.

1045
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:18,000
So, it's early still. The guy's, you know, working on porting it over. So, that's pretty cool.

1046
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Sharing the love of, uh, Dana Plato and the cast of people dressed really horrifically.

1047
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:29,000
It's not even B-movie. It's like C-movie bad, uh, for your CD-ROM enjoyment.

1048
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Yep.

1049
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Alright, uh, moving on. There is, uh, a new patch for The Witcher 3.

1050
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
It's patch 1.07 is out for The Witcher 3.

1051
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Uh, should be out for all platforms very soon if, uh, you haven't seen it already.

1052
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Uh, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, and so forth.

1053
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Um, it is a 7.3 gig update.

1054
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Uh, new storage locations, better organization options for books, an alternative movement style for the main character.

1055
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Um, so, there you go. Although, they are saying that performance will take a hit on con-

1056
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:07,000
They are not saying that, but, uh, some of the people reviewing it are saying that it is taking a performance hit on consoles.

1057
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
So, who knows if we'll get another patch as a result. We'll see.

1058
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Uh, Rock Band 4 has some more confirmed tracks for the game.

1059
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Including Aerosmith, Toys in the Attic, The Cure, Friday I'm in Love, uh, Live, All Over You, uh, Ozzy Osbourne, Miracle Man.

1060
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,000
And, uh, yeah, there's lots of cool stuff. Judas Priest, Halls of Valhalla.

1061
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
So, uh, I'm sure people are going to be very excited to get into those songs in Rock Band 4.

1062
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Um, yeah, I'm excited to play Rock Band 4. Even if I'm hearing it's basically just Rock Band 2 on-

1063
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Because it's not even half keyboard, so it's more Rock Band 2 on the newer consoles.

1064
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:54,000
But I'm okay with that. It's been too long. It's time to get out the plastic instruments and jam again, don't you think?

1065
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Well, I have a lot of them, so...

1066
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Speaking of getting to jam all over again, guess what, Shenmue fans? You did it!

1067
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Shenmue 3 ended with over 6.3 million dollars in funding. That took 69,000 plus backers to do it.

1068
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,000
It is now the highest funded video game in Kickstarter history.

1069
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Which is, like, was just toppled a month ago by the, uh, Bloodstained Ritual of the Night thing.

1070
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
So, um, yeah, there it is.

1071
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,000
It was, uh, digital for PC and Playstation 4 at some point in 2017.

1072
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Don't know if a physical version will be released outside of those that, uh, did the $60 crowdfunding, but we will see.

1073
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
So Shenmue 3, it's gonna happen.

1074
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:46,000
It didn't make the, what was it, 10 or 11 million that the creator wanted to realize the full vision or whatever it was.

1075
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:53,000
But, hey, still, biggest one ever. They're gonna have a lot to work with there to make the game.

1076
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
So good luck and, uh, make a good game.

1077
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Alright, uh, Loki, you have a few more for us.

1078
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Yes. So High Moon Studios, um, has finally brought back Deadpool, available for sale again on Steam.

1079
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Originally it was pulled because of, um, Activision losing the rights to it, but apparently something has been worked out.

1080
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
So now it's back up on Steam to purchase. However, it's $39.99.

1081
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Maybe wait for another one of those flash sales, but I probably do need to get my Deadpool on because it looks pretty amazing.

1082
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Um, with that, Tekken Cross Street Fighter. Where is it?

1083
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
It's still in development, though. At least that's what they're saying.

1084
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:43,000
And, you know, apparently there was an interview with Tekken's producer, Katsuhiro Harada, and basically asked,

1085
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Hey, uh, whatever happened to Tekken Cross Street Fighter?

1086
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And basically I know, um, you know, I've been saying it since, um, before, but the fact of the matter is that we're pretty far staged into its development.

1087
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:04,000
It might seem like we haven't really started on anything at all, but the character lineup has been decided upon, um, since it's a very long time ago.

1088
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,000
And we've already finished the polygon models, moves, and systems.

1089
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:16,000
So it is still working, you know, being worked on. Maybe they're probably going to use part of the engine from Tekken 7.

1090
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Maybe even the development of Tekken Cross Street Fighter helped, you know, those engines.

1091
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,000
So, hopefully soon. That'd be pretty nice.

1092
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:31,000
And then, last but not least, um, Wreck-It Ralph 2.

1093
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:40,000
It is coming. According to John C. Reilly, he has been confirmed to be in the movie doing the voice of Wreck-It Ralph himself.

1094
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:50,000
So, it's gonna be awesome. Don't know when exactly it's scheduled to be coming out, but I have to go see the original one now.

1095
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
You have to watch that again? Get ready for the new one?

1096
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I haven't watched the original one.

1097
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Well, you've never seen Wreck-It Ralph?

1098
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I've never seen Wreck-It Ralph.

1099
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
What? You need to get on that.

1100
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I do need to get on that.

1101
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Oh my god. How has that not happened yet? Especially, you have kids!

1102
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Yeah, I understand.

1103
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,000
You need to sit down and watch it.

1104
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I do.

1105
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Work on it. That's your homework assignment.

1106
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Alright.

1107
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Don't come back till you do.

1108
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Alright, maybe we'll let you back. But seriously, watch Wreck-It Ralph. It's so fun.

1109
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL Question of the Week.

1110
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

1111
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,000
And we read some of our favorite answers in this segment.

1112
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
That's what we call the FUGL Question of the Week.

1113
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Well, with EVO going on this weekend, we thought we'd ask you guys about fighting games.

1114
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
What's your favorite fighting game of all time and why?

1115
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:50,000
So, pretty simple questions tonight, but I still anticipate it was such a broad genre.

1116
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
We're going to get a lot of different answers.

1117
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
So, Fabrice A. starts us off on Facebook saying,

1118
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
I've always had a soft spot for Mortal Kombat.

1119
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
It's not too hardcore and that's what makes it so fun.

1120
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
No need to train for weeks until you finally get the hang of it.

1121
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Back when I had more time, I played a lot of Virtua Fighter II on Sega Saturn.

1122
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Tech2030 says, Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection on arcade, PSP, and PS3.

1123
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
It was the first fighting game I was ever really into.

1124
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I must have sunk hundreds of hours into it between all the platforms.

1125
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And it was the last game I went to the arcade specifically to play.

1126
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Asserping Slurpee says, by far my favorite fighting game is Star Gladiator.

1127
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
I like how weird and unique the characters are.

1128
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Justin H. says, Super Smash Brothers, and not just because of the character lore,

1129
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
but the damage system far outplays health bars.

1130
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Smash Brothers has the unique ability to pull in a massive casual audience

1131
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
that the others cannot, excuse me, as well as a smaller but very dedicated hardcore base.

1132
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Mason D. says, it's hard for me to pick one, but I played Soul Calibur II a lot.

1133
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
If you can TER, TER, 2G, and Step Guard properly,

1134
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
you can win consistently with most of the cast.

1135
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I like Dead or Alive 5 LR2.

1136
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Hitomi's 6P plus G puts you in a situation where you can 7K counter hit for an air combo,

1137
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,000
2P for pressure, or 3P plus K to punish blocks.

1138
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,000
And I'm sure that's all punch plus kick, guard, things like that.

1139
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
2Long didn't read, I like math.

1140
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Silent Tom says, favorite fighting game of all time is Super Street Fighter II.

1141
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I have so many fond memories from high school,

1142
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,000
playing so long we would wear out Super Nintendo controllers.

1143
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Dar Tetsuya says, overall the Street Fighter II series of course,

1144
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:34,000
but one I have a lot of memories of was Battle Arena Toshinden on the original PlayStation PSX.

1145
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I originally loved the soundtrack, it had some really great energetic music.

1146
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Ragenator said, there's no one game that's my favorite.

1147
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
That being said, I've always loved the old 2D Mortal Kombats,

1148
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:50,000
miscellaneous versions of Street Fighter II, Killer Instinct, Gold, and Samurai Shodown IV.

1149
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Fifth Dream says, it has to be Street Fighter II.

1150
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
That game just blew me away when it came out.

1151
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
I got pretty obsessed over it and I even bought a strategy guide,

1152
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
even though I hardly got to play it in the arcade.

1153
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I even made my mom buy me the regular and turbo versions when they came out on Super Nintendo.

1154
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Winston H says, the Street Fighter Alpha series.

1155
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I played those games the most when growing up.

1156
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Hit Stun says, Virtua Fighter V Final Showdown gets my pick because of how matches flow.

1157
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Combos are only a few seconds long and can end a few different ways,

1158
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,000
so it's never long before you make another decision and get back in the fight.

1159
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Everyone always had lots of opinions to discover,

1160
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
but the moves with tricky inputs are only a little better than the basic strings.

1161
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:35,000
And Tony B says, Street Fighter Alpha III.

1162
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Fond memories playing after school, great selection of characters, ism modes, and two-player boss battles.

1163
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Over on Google+, we have a few answers as well to the same question,

1164
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,000
starting off with ActDeft who says, Capcom vs. SNK 2.

1165
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
The best fighting game of all time. I love that game a lot.

1166
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
Street Fighter Alpha III is a close second.

1167
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Reddertainment says, I tried playing a couple fighting games,

1168
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,000
but I don't play those games regularly because I suck at fighting games.

1169
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
It's not that they're good or bad, I just suck at them.

1170
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,000
And Dustin B says, Favorite fighting game was Virtua Fighter,

1171
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,000
especially the first two or three in the US and later ones when I was in Japan.

1172
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,000
At first, it was the wow factor of having realistically animated martial arts moves in 3D,

1173
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,000
but there were also a lot of strategy and mind games involved when playing others in the arcade.

1174
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Met some cool people and used to trade techniques and advice with other good players,

1175
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
which will always be in my memories.

1176
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
How about you, Loki? Favorite fighting game ever?

1177
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I have three that would be harder to choose from.

1178
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:41,000
So I would say Marvel vs. Capcom 2, because I love me some moral combat.

1179
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Or not moral combat, Marvel vs. Capcom.

1180
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Whoops!

1181
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
I hate moral combat, actually.

1182
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:51,000
All the characters, just the crossover between comic book characters and Street Fighter characters and Mega Man stuff,

1183
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:54,000
that was awesome, so big props to that.

1184
01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:02,000
My other favorite game would be Ur-Guts, because it had the Final Fantasy characters in it,

1185
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
and so that was kind of fun.

1186
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:09,000
But I'd say probably my number one favorite fighting game, Power Stone.

1187
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I love Power Stone and I miss playing that game.

1188
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
I have it on my Dreamcast, I just need to hook it up.

1189
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
My number one and my number two were named.

1190
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,000
My number one probably favorite game for fighting ever is probably Soul Calibur 2,

1191
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:27,000
just because, you know, it was...

1192
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I remember when they put Link on it on the home console for GameCube,

1193
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
and then it had, like, I think Xbox got Spawn or whatever.

1194
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Yeah, everybody wanted Link. You had the GameCube version for Link.

1195
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
And, you know, the single player mode.

1196
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,000
But then the arcade mode was great too, and that was out right at the height of us playing DDR all the time.

1197
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,000
And so, you know, as a cooldown from DDR, we'd go play Soul Calibur 2,

1198
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
and there was that whole, like, you know, you fought for one particular kingdom or whatever,

1199
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
and you fought other people, like, there was that whole...

1200
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Yeah, like the little ghost character.

1201
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
It was like a social thing, but in the arcade, and I love that.

1202
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
And all that's on the internet now, like, you don't really have that local feature like you used to have,

1203
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
which is too bad.

1204
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,000
My second answer would have been Capcom vs. SNK 2,

1205
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,000
which thankfully somebody named there, towards the end there.

1206
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,000
But my third game, the whole series wasn't even named by anybody,

1207
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:19,000
but it's a big part of the reason why we have Capcom vs. SNK 2.

1208
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
My third favorite fighting game would be Fatal Fury Special,

1209
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:28,000
because I love some of the characters in Fatal Fury, the Neo Geo especially at the time.

1210
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
I remember having the... I never owned the console, but, like, I rented one or a friend had one,

1211
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
hooked it up to my TV, played some Fatal Fury Special.

1212
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,000
That was awesome. That was like having the arcade in your... I mean, it was so cool.

1213
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
And then the game itself was a lot of fun.

1214
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Some great characters like Mai, Kim Kap Wan was my favorite, but, you know,

1215
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:50,000
especially in Special you had, like, Tung Fu Ru and Duck King and all these, like, really cool characters.

1216
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,000
And, yeah, I just... I love that series.

1217
01:50:53,000 --> 01:51:00,000
So, yeah, Fatal Fury Special is probably... is in my top three for sure.

1218
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
And very, very competitive top three for me.

1219
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:06,000
So, let's see.

1220
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Looking in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Dr. Tetsuya says,

1221
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
Didn't we have a guy that was huge into Soul Calibur 2?

1222
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Oh, I'm sure a lot of people were huge into Soul Calibur 2.

1223
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
I mean, it wasn't just a side thing for all of us.

1224
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,000
I think they had a whole little community there as well.

1225
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Akuma JP says, Oh, Sky is one of those who plays Kim.

1226
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Wait a minute, is that a bad thing? Can I...

1227
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Yeah, Kim Kap Wan is probably my favorite in the whole game.

1228
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Because he can do, like, that thing where he jumps in the air and you fly down with the feet and...

1229
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,000
He, like, kicks somebody in the stomach as you're falling down.

1230
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
It's awesome. I love that guy. He has, like, the flip kicks and all that stuff.

1231
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Yeah, that guy's awesome.

1232
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
And then I love Mai. Of course I love Mai.

1233
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
But, I mean, like, just the fans and the fire kick.

1234
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Anyway, I just... I think that that series is so awesome.

1235
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Anyway, that's it for the Fuka Question of the Week.

1236
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Let's get back into some news. Loki.

1237
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Alright. I was just checking out the Flash Sale on PlayStation Network.

1238
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,000
They have Borderlands The Handsome Collection down to $30.

1239
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I wish I'd bought that instead of Elder Scrolls.

1240
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
It is tempting. I may have to pick that up. We'll see.

1241
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
So, let's talk about the Oculus Rift.

1242
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:17,000
They've acquired Pebble's interfaces, and this is gonna be used for hand tracking.

1243
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Kinda reminds me a lot of what you see now with...

1244
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
What the fuck do they call that?

1245
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I don't know. There's other hand tracking solutions out there right now.

1246
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:34,000
But this, I guess they're saying, is gonna be kind of working in conjunction with the Oculus Touch.

1247
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:44,000
That new controller that they have to maybe help increase the sensitivity of the capture of your hand movements and stuff.

1248
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,000
So, I don't know. It'll be pretty cool.

1249
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
I'd like to see how that ends up playing out.

1250
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:56,000
I really want to try out the Oculus Touch controller because it looks stupid when you look at it.

1251
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
But apparently everybody has tried it, really enjoying it.

1252
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:06,000
So, I think it's one of those things you have to try to kind of fully grasp how good it is.

1253
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
How long do we have to wait until the Oculus Rift? Another six months?

1254
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Did they ever actually release a date? I don't think they did.

1255
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I think it was supposed to be early 2016. So, like six to...

1256
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Things could still get delayed for all I know.

1257
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Things could still get delayed. Who knows?

1258
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Alright. Well, moving on. We're all bummed out that there's not gonna be a new Tron movie, or at least not now.

1259
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Yes, absolutely.

1260
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:37,000
So, I'm pissed off about that. However, apparently the Tron world lives on.

1261
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:40,000
And this might be a pretty cool way to do it.

1262
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Don't be an MMO. Don't be an MMO. Don't be an MMO.

1263
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Tron Escape is something that has been leaked.

1264
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Don't be a mobile game. Don't be a mobile game. Don't be a mobile game.

1265
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:53,000
It's not. It's a PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC game.

1266
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:59,000
The Brazilian Advisory Rating System outing of it is to be trusted.

1267
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Which, a lot of the times, that's how these things get ruined is through rating board leaks.

1268
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:06,000
So, there you go. Disney hasn't said anything about it, obviously.

1269
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:10,000
But, D23 is around the corner, so who knows?

1270
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I'd be all over that.

1271
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Disney Interactive, apparently, is the publisher of the game.

1272
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:23,000
This also goes in line with another rumor from way back in February or whatever.

1273
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:28,000
But, remember when, and I'm going to say his name wrong, and he's a huge electronics guy.

1274
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Giorgio Moroder?

1275
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:36,000
I can never say his name right, but I know he did some of the stuff with...

1276
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Oh, God. He did some very recent stuff that's been very...

1277
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
But, he also goes back years and years. He's OG.

1278
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
He's apparently been working on something. He was working on it back in February.

1279
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,000
And he said, we have about five themes, electronic stuff,

1280
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:57,000
and let's see if Skrillex is interested in remixing or reworking one of the songs.

1281
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:01,000
So, Moroder says, start to see in chat.

1282
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Random Access Memories with Daft Punk. Oh, he was a part of that album, really.

1283
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
Well, that's awesome. Oh, yeah, because he did...

1284
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
That's right. He did conspire some of the tracks.

1285
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Yeah, that's right. Now that you're saying that, of course.

1286
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
So, that would be really cool. I'd be down.

1287
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Whatever, just be better than the last Tron game.

1288
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,000
And even the last Tron game, I don't know, I would probably play that still.

1289
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Yeah, it wasn't awful, and it had a story that kind of tied into the movies okay,

1290
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
but just like, yeah, it should have been better.

1291
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,000
And maybe it was just rushed to meet the movie. Who knows?

1292
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
But, you know, that game, though, now on like a PlayStation 4,

1293
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:43,000
you're gonna have visuals probably pretty similar to like, you know, the last Tron movie.

1294
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
So, yes.

1295
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:50,000
That's gonna be awesome if that ends up being a real kick-ass game.

1296
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
I really hope they don't screw it up.

1297
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
So, I'm glad to hear that even if the movies can't go on,

1298
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:59,000
now, maybe at least the games can do the franchise justice.

1299
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I mean, if the games end up being just the movie, hey, sounds good.

1300
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,000
I still would like a new movie.

1301
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Yeah, I'd like that too, but, you know, I'll take a game to hold me over.

1302
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Just make it good. Don't suck.

1303
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Alright, anyhow.

1304
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:20,000
Moving on to another story that was something that Game Politics actually ran this week.

1305
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Talking about a new study regarding sexism in video game culture.

1306
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
A new study concluding that it's simply just another form of bullying,

1307
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
which kind of strikes me as a duh, but anyway.

1308
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
The findings come from a study called,

1309
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Insights into Sexism, Male Status and Performance Moderates Female Directed, Hostile and Amicable Behavior.

1310
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:47,000
The researchers were Michael Kasimovic from the Ecology and Evolution Research Center in the University of New South Wales,

1311
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:55,000
and Jeffrey Kunznikov from the Department of Integrative Studies at Miami University, Middletown.

1312
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:02,000
And apparently they actually detailed their research in an editorial that these guys wrote on phys.org,

1313
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:08,000
and they were using Halo 3. It records data about kills and interactions among players.

1314
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:15,000
They played 126 games of Halo 3 as a man and a woman by using a pre-recorded male and female voice,

1315
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
and found that when they were playing as a guy, it was positive feedback, even if they weren't playing well.

1316
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:26,000
When they played as a woman, he got more negative comments, particularly from players who were performing poorly themselves.

1317
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:31,000
A quote saying, This suggests that men behaved according to a social hierarchy.

1318
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:37,000
When they were performing poorly, i.e. they were lower status, they did not challenge a male voiced teammate,

1319
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
but they did challenge a female voiced one.

1320
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:45,000
It's because I think a lot of these people that are playing these games are under the recommended age for those games,

1321
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:48,000
and so you're dealing with a lot of immature people.

1322
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Not to say that people over 18 are all absolutely mature, but I think that that's kind of one of the issues there,

1323
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:00,000
and it's just immature, period. I don't think it's necessarily directed towards one sex or the other.

1324
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
They're just... I don't know. I can't imagine that...

1325
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Well, I think it does show some underlying problems with culture as a whole.

1326
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I can't imagine, though, that... I understand that they're saying 126 games, okay?

1327
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:18,000
And that as a male player, this person would encourage the other member.

1328
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
But was that the same person that they were playing as a female?

1329
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Because how do we know that this person just isn't a douchebag that actually is like,

1330
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
you know, instead of, you know,

1331
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I mean, seriously, there's not like... it's not the gender.

1332
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:40,000
It's just you're dealing with a lot of assholes, and you're dealing with a lot of people that are not so bad.

1333
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:46,000
You're running in... I don't know. I just don't think gender plays a really big role in that.

1334
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Yeah, people are assholes to anybody.

1335
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,000
They'll be an asshole to you if they figure that you're different than them somehow,

1336
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
because it gives them an angle to make fun to, I don't know, get a rise out of you,

1337
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
because they suck, because they can't do well in the game,

1338
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
so they have to somehow dominate you in a different way,

1339
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,000
and whether that be insulting you or something, I don't know.

1340
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
I guess that's how it is.

1341
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:15,000
You know, I think it is a sign of a greater problem in culture to begin with,

1342
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:20,000
but, I mean, the only thing that kind of grasps me as odd about this is that...

1343
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:25,000
and it's sort of what you were saying, is that, you know, the men were suddenly like,

1344
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:28,000
oh, they got positive feedback, even if they weren't playing well.

1345
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Based on my experience in Halo 3...

1346
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
I always get positive feedback. I always get, like, good...

1347
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Okay, because I don't, and I got, you know, there's a lot of really ugly things...

1348
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
No, no, I mean, I give positive feedback.

1349
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
People are not happy with the way I play, usually.

1350
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Oh, God, I mean, and, you know...

1351
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
But it only drives me to hit her some more.

1352
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:53,000
So it's weird to me, like, were they only looking for this whole, like, gender thing,

1353
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
or I'm really surprised you didn't have a lot of, like, sexuality.

1354
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
And just because they're being hostile to you doesn't mean that you're not gonna like it,

1355
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
because, for example, especially when I'm kicking someone's ass in the game,

1356
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
like, back in the Grand Theft Auto days, like, I'd be just creaming these people,

1357
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
and they'd be, like, saying just the worst shit ever,

1358
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:14,000
but it made it so much more pleasurable to just beat the crap out of them.

1359
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,000
It's like, there's nothing you can do. You're just gonna complain about it and try to insult me,

1360
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,000
but you're still losing. You're still losing.

1361
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
I think this is why you're really seeing a big shift, though.

1362
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:29,000
I mean, like, this, because of ugliness like this,

1363
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:34,000
most people play in their own little party, like, their private party, and then that's it.

1364
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
That's the only voices they hear, and that's the way I prefer to play.

1365
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I can't remember last time I played a game online with strangers

1366
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
where I could hear a stranger's voice chatting.

1367
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
That's why it kind of caught me off guard in Elder Scrolls Online

1368
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:47,000
for the few minutes I was playing that, when I could hear other people around me

1369
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
just talking out in the open, because PlayStation 4 servers are dedicated,

1370
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:54,000
so the voice chat goes to those as well, so I could just hear people around talking.

1371
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
I'm like, oh, God, I don't want to hear what I'm gonna hear.

1372
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I know what I'm gonna hear, and it's gonna be awful.

1373
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:04,000
So it's like, I just prefer to cut all that out and just hear my friends.

1374
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Maybe if you cut out all that voice chat, there'd be enough bandwidth to load those monsters in there.

1375
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
That's what I was fucking saying!

1376
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Like, oh my God, that's why I don't get what's going on with that game, anyway.

1377
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,000
All right. Moving on to more stories. Loki.

1378
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,000
But hey, go buy our DLC, because, you know, there's gonna be more worlds and everything,

1379
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
and they have to add that in there.

1380
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Anyways, so this is kind of a name we haven't heard about in a while.

1381
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Jade Raymond is joining EA, and she's actually set to head up a new Motive Studios and Visceral Games.

1382
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:49,000
She's kind of joining them to, I guess, work on some new projects.

1383
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:56,000
The new studio, what was it? Motive, which is a multipurpose studio.

1384
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:04,000
They're creating their own IPs and also helping other in-house developers with their own projects.

1385
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:09,000
And in case you are not familiar with Jade Raymond, she was behind Assassin's Creed.

1386
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:16,000
So I'm curious to see what she has, what they may be working on.

1387
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Apparently she may be assisting with Mass Effect Andromeda, is the thought.

1388
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:25,000
I thought they had said what game it was gonna be, like a new type of game.

1389
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Well, maybe they're just not ready to announce it, I don't know.

1390
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Oh, I guess that's not the case anymore. I see the correction there.

1391
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Apparently the studios are simply co-locating at EA Montreal.

1392
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,000
So they may be working out of the same office as them, but they're not working on that game.

1393
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:49,000
All right. And Tigerclaw says, I hear it's the new Star Wars game.

1394
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Yeah, I thought that's what I had heard somewhere, too, is that it had to do with Star Wars, whatever it was.

1395
02:02:53,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Dartitsuyu though, just to throw it back a little bit here, Dartitsuyu says, oh sure, Nintendo gets criticized when Splatoon doesn't have voice chat.

1396
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Now hold on with that though, because I have been critical of Splatoon for not having voice chat, because I'd like to chat with friends.

1397
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:11,000
There's a big difference. I don't care if they have it disabled for the Stranger Play and all that stuff, and that's fine.

1398
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:17,000
But it's the fact that I can't even chat with friends. In fact, I can't even really matchmake with friends as much as I'd like to in Splatoon.

1399
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
That's the problem I have.

1400
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
I'm sorry, there's a difference between, you know...

1401
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I don't care that they have it shut off with strangers, because they'd probably shut it off anyway.

1402
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:33,000
And that's the thing too, I understand that you're trying to protect the children, or at least that's the excuse that we're using.

1403
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:42,000
But people like to have options. And there are some people, like me, that don't give a shit about the people talking.

1404
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:48,000
The only time that really bothers me is when some idiot has music in the background or something, and there's a lot of feedback or something like that.

1405
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:56,000
And then I'll usually shut it off. Or if someone's bothering me, I'll mute them if they keep talking or yelling or whatever the case may be.

1406
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:01,000
But don't use that as an excuse to just not put it in there at all, because, oh, we want to protect the children.

1407
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:06,000
No, it's bullshit. You're cutting corners to put this game out is what you're doing.

1408
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:10,000
You're cutting corners. Why wouldn't you just enable it then for friends only stuff?

1409
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Obviously you have to swap your stupid codes to be friends with people. Don't you trust them to talk to each other?

1410
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:18,000
I mean, it's a bad excuse is what it is.

1411
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Anyhow, a follow-up quickly on Batman Arkham Knight on the PC. A PC patch is due to come out in August.

1412
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:36,000
This is after word that the game would not even just be fixed until the fall. I guess that news would come out earlier in the week.

1413
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:41,000
But this patch is an interim patch, I guess, that's happening in August.

1414
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:48,000
And what's going to happen with this update will address many of the issues we listed in the June 27th update.

1415
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:52,000
We'll provide additional details as we finalize the interim patch over the coming week.

1416
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,000
We'd like to thank you for your continued patience and feedback, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1417
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:04,000
I still haven't seen, because I know that they can track those returns and everything now on Steam.

1418
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:10,000
I'm not sure it would benefit anyone to publish that information. That's probably why they don't.

1419
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Well, it doesn't matter, though. They're not the ones publishing the information. It's coming from Steam Spy, I think.

1420
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Oh, yeah, that third party.

1421
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:28,000
It's not necessarily sales, but it shows who has the game in the library type thing. So I'm curious to see what the returns were on that.

1422
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
Would it track the... I guess it would.

1423
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:36,000
It would, because it would reduce the amount of library entries, that is.

1424
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Interesting.

1425
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Let's check them. I'm going to take a look.

1426
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Well, while you look into that, I'm going to get into the mailbag.

1427
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Every week, you guys email us. Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1428
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,000
And usually Dark Soccer dives in the mailbag and reads some emails for you.

1429
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
But it's just me! It's me!

1430
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:05,000
So I'm going to read this lone email, our one lone email we have this week, from Elliot B., who emails us and says,

1431
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Hey, O.L.R., while listening to last week's foogle question of the week, I thought of a TV show I'd love to see adapted into a game.

1432
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:17,000
How about a House of Cards game using the Nemesis system from Shadow of Mordor?

1433
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Make fragile alliances with fellow politicians.

1434
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Turn enemies against each other and push pesky reporters under trains in your quest to become the head of state.

1435
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,000
I smell a hit.

1436
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
That is from Elliot B.

1437
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:37,000
So a late answer there to the foogle question of the week on TV shows becoming video games there.

1438
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Appreciate that answer.

1439
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
That's it, though, for emails this week.

1440
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,000
We just got one extra little answer there for the foogle question of the week.

1441
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:50,000
If you want to email us with a question or anything that's on your mind, something maybe we didn't get to this week or what have you,

1442
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send those emails.

1443
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Meanwhile, we're going to get to the FUs of the week.

1444
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Why don't you start us off tonight, Logie?

1445
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:26,000
So just the FUs being tired and cranky this weekend because of my poor diet.

1446
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:31,000
That was my only fault because I didn't really have food in the house and I was trying to limit myself to what I could eat.

1447
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:35,000
And so, you know, without sugar, apparently I get pretty cranky.

1448
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Also, the sales data doesn't make any goddamn sense for Arkham Knight.

1449
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
It's going up.

1450
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
How's it going up if they pulled it off the store?

1451
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:50,000
You can't tell me that thousands of people have all of a sudden redeemed their codes late.

1452
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I don't know.

1453
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
My FU of the week goes to food poisoning.

1454
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Oh my God, it ruined.

1455
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Look, I'm not going to get all TMI, but we all know it's like the worst thing, right?

1456
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
So it ruined my week.

1457
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:06,000
It absolutely ruined my week and the fact that I couldn't go to California Extreme because of it.

1458
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
I'm like a little more than pissed off because of it.

1459
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
But what you do, life sucks sometimes.

1460
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Meh.

1461
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
But FU to that.

1462
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:21,000
And FU to the likely culprit, which I honestly, I don't want to name it on air because it's a big restaurant.

1463
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:25,000
But I just and I don't have conclusive proof.

1464
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,000
But yeah, I'm just.

1465
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Come on.

1466
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
It was one of two places, but here's the thing.

1467
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I will say I'm going to say this much for dinner on Tuesday.

1468
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
We had round table pizza.

1469
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:43,000
And that was when I started feeling like, oh, my God, oh, God, this is this is the end of the world.

1470
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:46,000
But Alan ate it, too, and he was fine.

1471
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,000
So I'm thinking it's something I had earlier and earlier in the day.

1472
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
So.

1473
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I don't know, just be wary of any.

1474
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:00,000
It wouldn't be the first wary of any golden things out there, like any arches that are out there or anything like that.

1475
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:05,000
That may have bad stuff.

1476
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Just be careful. All right.

1477
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Anyway, let's get a couple more stories for you guys there, and then we'll get to some phone calls.

1478
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
One eight seven seven game oil are using them on Skype.

1479
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

1480
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:29,000
There is a new hack out there for your 3DS, and it's allowing people to run homebrew as well as region free games and custom themes.

1481
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:36,000
And it's called the Ninj hack to Ninj hacks 2.0.

1482
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:43,000
You have to have a copy of Cubic Ninja from the same region in your system in order to load the hack.

1483
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:50,000
And apparently it uses the scan QR code feature from Cubic Ninja to do that.

1484
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:57,000
But they're also working it to use a hack that uses Ocarina of Time 3D.

1485
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:03,000
So, we'll see. I'm sure this has already been patched out.

1486
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Yeah, the hack works with 3DSs, new 3DSs, and 2DSs running any region firmware between 9.0 and 9.9.

1487
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:21,000
All right. And it does not play, though, copied games, right?

1488
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
It does not play copied games according to this.

1489
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Then I think this is a blessing to the entire community, because the fact that it will let you play region free games on the 3DS, this is a blessing.

1490
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:35,000
And apparently there's homebrew stuff like 3DS Craft, which is like Minecraft in 3D.

1491
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I think that's awesome. I welcome this. I hope it doesn't get patched out.

1492
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Except it will.

1493
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Yeah, of course it will, because Nintendo's not going to like it.

1494
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:52,000
But I love the fact that it gets around the region free thing, which is a shitty practice to begin with, and that it would enable some of these homebrew things is pretty cool, too.

1495
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Cubic Ninja's really expensive from this, too. I have to take a look at that real quick.

1496
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,000
I want to say that it's hard to find now.

1497
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Yeah, Seattle in chat says Cubic Ninja shot up in price after this hack. Of course it did.

1498
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:10,000
But yeah, it's too bad it'll get patched out within seconds.

1499
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:15,000
But you know how I feel about the whole region locking thing.

1500
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Hackers gonna hack. And it's hard to say it's unethical when it won't play the copied games, because we know that's another reason why a lot of people like this stuff, but this isn't part of that.

1501
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
It's $20.

1502
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
That's what they're showing.

1503
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,000
It's not too bad.

1504
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
It's a pretty old game, but yeah.

1505
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Alright, well one more story for you guys, and it's about another Kickstarter.

1506
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:46,000
But this one sounds pretty cool, because this is about 90s arcade gaming, and specifically Midway Games, who of course made Mortal Kombat back in the day.

1507
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:51,000
NBA Jam, Revolution X, NARC, San Francisco Rush.

1508
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:58,000
There is a new documentary being Kickstarted called Insert Coin Inside the Midway 90s Revolution.

1509
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:03,000
And they are currently trying to raise money to finish the documentary and get it all distributed.

1510
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:10,000
They want to get $75,000, and with 28 days to go they've made $17,000, almost $18,000 of that.

1511
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:14,000
So I don't know, they still got a ways to go, but we'll see, we'll see.

1512
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:23,000
But I know there's a lot of people, especially coming on the week of California Extreme, there's a lot of people out there with a lot of love for some of these old school games.

1513
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:35,000
And I love hearing stories, so I think it's a pretty noble idea to try to get this all on film before, you know, unfortunately, some of these people that can tell the stories someday will no longer be with us.

1514
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
As we unfortunately learned all too soon this past week.

1515
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,000
So I'm all for getting these stories documented on film.

1516
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:49,000
And it sounds like a lot of it's been shot, they just need some money to travel around and get the last few interviews, and then I guess get it all together and distributed and all that.

1517
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:54,000
So, good luck with that Kickstarter. Insert coin if you want to look that up over on Kickstarter.

1518
02:12:54,000 --> 02:13:01,000
I will extend an invite to the show for the folks behind that and see if we can hear more about that at a later time.

1519
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:06,000
All right, that is going to do it for the stories.

1520
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Now it's your turn. If you want to give us a call, Skype Line is open, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you'd like to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight or anything we might have missed.

1521
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:23,000
It's your turn. Meanwhile, I'll check in with Loki real quick and check if there's any last minute stories.

1522
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Yeah, I was going to mention that Red Ash isn't doing so well.

1523
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:38,000
They're about $442,000 out of the $800,000 goal, and they still have 14 days left.

1524
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:42,000
So it's going to be kind of squeaking pretty close.

1525
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Hmm.

1526
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Which is too bad, I really did want a new.

1527
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Yeah, I just think they're trying to do it a little too soon.

1528
02:13:51,000 --> 02:14:02,000
I understand logically why, because games start being made a long time before they're ready to go, and there is a little lull at the end of one project before it's actually released.

1529
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:12,000
And then what the artists and the conceptual people and some of the designers are doing right now, there's not a lot to do if there's not another project.

1530
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:18,000
So I get that, but at the same time, it's really hard to ask people for money when the last project's not out there yet.

1531
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Well, the other thing too is Red Ash kind of even has less to show originally, because I mean, I think when Mighty Nein number nine was kickstarted, they actually had something that looked like gameplay.

1532
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:32,000
You know, this just has some like art. I mean, we don't know what it's gonna look like.

1533
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:38,000
Yeah, that's a good point. I wonder, are you allowed to go back to Kickstarter with a project again if it doesn't come the first time?

1534
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Yes. Yes, you can. So if it fails, I can try again.

1535
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I hope that's what they decide to do if they fail. They just need to wait until after Mighty Nein is out and try again.

1536
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:55,000
But, you know, at the same time, maybe they wouldn't be able to. Maybe some of those people would move on to other opportunities and careers, and then we lose our chance. I don't know.

1537
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:59,000
It's an interesting part of this whole Kickstarter culture we're in now.

1538
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Let me put out another shoutout for calls. 1-877-GAMO-LR, or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, if you'd like to give us a call. It's all one word. Orange Lounge Radio.

1539
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:18,000
And I know it's all working. Some of those issues we had before the program tonight where we had a power surge or something happened that has stopped.

1540
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I'm not using the oven during the show as I was during Bobby Black Wolf, just so we're clear. It's much cooler in here now.

1541
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:27,000
We do have a call coming in. Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1542
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
This is Orme.

1543
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Hey, Orme. What's up?

1544
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Nothing much. I just wanted to basically chime in and talk about a few things.

1545
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Apparently, you guys were talking about Iwata passing away and everything, but did you guys hear about the game that he came out with, The Marrow Maker?

1546
02:15:48,000 --> 02:16:00,000
There's a TV show called Gamer Center CX. They actually did a demo playthrough of it on his website, the Gamer CX website.

1547
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I know the series in Japan, certainly Game Center DX, they even had a game that came out on the 3DS. It's kind of a big thing over in Japan.

1548
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:17,000
I had seen that clip of Iwata on the show. What was that he was showing? A game that we never saw?

1549
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:22,000
Well, Marrow Maker. I'm sure you guys heard about it.

1550
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Oh, gosh. You're one of those people that says Mario.

1551
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Mario, yeah. I absolutely do know how to say it, but because I'm American, I say Mario.

1552
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Well, I'm an American, I say Mario. That's all right. We got all these different accents throughout the US. It's fine.

1553
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:47,000
It threw me from, what's a Mario? Oh, okay. Is he saying mirror? Oh, got it. Mario.

1554
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
I remember what you said the first time.

1555
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,000
All right.

1556
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
There it is.

1557
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Thanks, Loki.

1558
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Mario Maker, Mario Maker, depending on what part of the country you're from.

1559
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Oh, I'm so excited about that game. You know, a lot of people are saying, and this is, again, one of those statements that just hits you right in the feels, like just stabs you with a feel gun or whatever.

1560
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
A feel gun.

1561
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:14,000
A feel gun. I don't know where my mind is going.

1562
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:25,000
The fact that this is Satoru Iwata's last game that he's really been hyping is it's like, now I'm giving you, everybody out there, the tools to make a game.

1563
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:35,000
You know, in a way, it's just kind of like that that's what he leaves us with is something where it's like, now that he's made games for years and years, he's leaving us with something where we can make our own games of sort.

1564
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:49,000
I mean, you know, they're limited to Mario stuff, but still, the fact that, you know, this is a huge venture for Nintendo into taking one of their most known and beloved series and basically opening it up for people to ruin it, absolutely.

1565
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:54,000
And you know what I mean? Because, again, how many seconds until the penis level shows up?

1566
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Immediately.

1567
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:04,000
How many levels until the giant? How many until big booby level where it's all those music blocks, so it's just these big boobs where it's boing, boing, boing?

1568
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Like, five seconds. Five seconds until you get Mario's big booby climb or whatever it's gonna be called.

1569
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Nice.

1570
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I'm pretty excited about it. I was just wondering if you guys are gonna be making any, like, custom levels that we can kind of, like, watch you guys stream or play, because I know I'm gonna have time to play, but I won't be able to have time to make as many levels as I want, but...

1571
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Hell yeah, I'm gonna be picking that game up for sure, day one. That's what I'm buying myself for Loki's birthday, because you know what's coming out on Loki's birthday?

1572
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:46,000
So that's what I'll be buying myself for Loki's birthday. And I don't know about the streaming and all that, because I've been really behind on that this year, although I really want to get that going again.

1573
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:57,000
So, who knows? Maybe after Dragon Con I'll be able to get the ball rolling on that, but I'll definitely be making levels. I can't promise they'll be good, but I'll try.

1574
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:08,000
No problem, no worries. The second thing I want to run is Final Fantasy VII. I've seen a date for it on Amazon, which is something in December of 2016.

1575
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Yeah, it's a placeholder.

1576
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
It's absolutely a placeholder.

1577
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Again, these companies, they want your pre-orders, they want your money upfront as much as they can, and they don't always know when the game's gonna come out, so they'll use a placeholder.

1578
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:31,000
This is why all the time you see on GameStop, you see 1231 of whatever year, they believe it's coming out that year, they just don't know what day.

1579
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:41,000
So, no, unfortunately December 2016 holds no weight, and I honestly believe it's a lot further than that. This game seems a lot more behind.

1580
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:47,000
Well, I shouldn't say behind, but it seems not as progressed, you know, as into it as people think it is.

1581
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I honestly truly believe, as it may, I think that game like maybe, maybe 2018. Maybe.

1582
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Yeah, because of the anniversary.

1583
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that, but that's a damn good point.

1584
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:19,000
But here's the thing, we still have Final Fantasy XV, which clearly isn't making it this year, so I'm assuming that's next year's big game is Final Fantasy XV, then finally we'll have Kingdom Hearts III, I guess, and I would be surprised if they both made it out next year.

1585
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I would think Kingdom Hearts is gonna be more of a 2017 release. That would be about the earliest I would think that Final Fantasy VII could possibly come out, but I really think it's gonna be 2018.

1586
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Alright, well, you know, I mean, it's really difficult for me to see, like, those two blockbusters come out the same year, but you're right. I'm guessing two years from now.

1587
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:45,000
It's gonna be a while. I'm gonna be fucking 40 years old when I get to play that Final Fantasy remake. Oh well.

1588
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Don't say that.

1589
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Alright, I know.

1590
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:48,000
That's how old I am.

1591
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Alright. Alright, my friend, thank you for the call, and take care.

1592
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:54,000
Alright, bye.

1593
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Bye.

1594
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Alright, 1877 game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Some folks in chat talking about making levels in N++, which apparently is out this week on Tuesday. I know there's been a lot of hype around that as well.

1595
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Do you have another story for us, Loki?

1596
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Mmm, no.

1597
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:15,000
Alright, let me put out one more call for calls, then I'm gonna close it up.

1598
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:22,000
1877 game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, but it's already lighting up, so let's get to it.

1599
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1600
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Hello? Are you on mute? I'm talking to the amazing caller on mute, that I can't hear. Who calls into this show often, and usually does not have a problem, but is having one tonight?

1601
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
We'll just blame it on a-

1602
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Hello?

1603
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Alright, we'll just blame it on a power surge, because for some reason I am not hearing them. Maybe he'll try again there in a minute.

1604
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Echo123, of course, if you ever want to test things out. I'm gonna give him one try to get back in here.

1605
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:03,000
1877 game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1606
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:06,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt in chat says, blame it on the cookies.

1607
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Hey, you know what? I've never- Okay, so you know how at the store you can buy those cookies?

1608
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:19,000
They're the ultimate, like, bachelor cookies, which I realize I'm in a relationship that I've been in for like five years, so I wouldn't exactly call myself a bachelor,

1609
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:27,000
but we still live like them, okay? So they sell those cookies that are just like, break them off and put them on the cookie sheet and put them in the oven, right?

1610
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:36,000
And usually it's just chocolate chip, sugar cookies, like it's really basic stuff, right? I found coconut macaroons that you could peel off and bake at the store,

1611
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:42,000
and I was so happy, because those are like my favorite types of cookies. Anyway, we're gonna try this one more time here.

1612
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1613
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Aww, I think your connection is broke, or your mic is broke.

1614
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Sorry, my friend, hope you can fix it.

1615
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Let's act deaf to you guys, I don't know what's wrong with act deaf's connection tonight, because usually it works.

1616
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Let's see, we have another person calling in, maybe this connection will work.

1617
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1618
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Hey, what's up, guys? It's Kaijuto.

1619
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Okay, good, at least Skype works, the other caller's having a problem. Oh, no.

1620
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Well, what's up, Kaijuto? How you doing?

1621
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I'm alright, I'm gonna keep this short just so the other caller can get in, because I really don't have that much to say.

1622
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:16,000
All I just want to say is that you guys are talking about EVO, and what's your favorite fighting game?

1623
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:22,000
I just have one game for you, and that's Yomi. You need to check that out, Y-O-M-I.

1624
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:26,000
It's a card game, it's a fighting game, but it's a card game at the same time,

1625
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:31,000
and it's probably one of the best balanced fighting games you'll ever play,

1626
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:35,000
and just don't get discouraged just because it's a card game.

1627
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:40,000
I mean, it is a serious fighting game. It's actually made by a guy who made one of the street –

1628
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:44,000
well, he didn't make one of the street fighting games, but he did some programming or some crap, I don't know.

1629
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:49,000
But it's a really good game. It was supposed to be a street fighter card game,

1630
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:55,000
and then something went wrong along the way, so the guy decided to just make his own characters and continue to make the game,

1631
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:00,000
but it is freaking great. You can get it on Steam. You could also play it free online right now.

1632
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Just put Yomi online, you'll find it, and there's a bunch of different ways you could play it.

1633
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:09,000
There's a real physical card game. It's one of the best out there.

1634
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:13,000
So it's not like – I mean, when you say card game, my mind went to like,

1635
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:18,000
oh, I actually like a Magic the Gathering or a Dominion type of thing that actually has cards on the table.

1636
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Yeah, it's not even like that. It's not a deck-building game.

1637
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Each character is their own deck of 54 cards. They actually base it off of playing cards,

1638
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:32,000
you know, with the two jokers included. So there's no deck-building. You don't have to collect cards.

1639
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:35,000
You don't have to go searching for the best card for your battle.

1640
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:41,000
They're all contained in that one deck, and you can choose to buy all the characters,

1641
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
which right now there's 20. I don't think they're going to make any more any time soon.

1642
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:50,000
I think he's finished creating the characters. There's 20 characters, and you don't necessarily have to buy everybody.

1643
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:54,000
You can just stick with one or two of your favorites and just battle people online.

1644
02:24:54,000 --> 02:25:00,000
And like any other card game, it's like a rock, paper, scissors kind of aspect, but that's for every card game.

1645
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:04,000
But a lot of the ways they describe it is rock, paper, scissors because there's like –

1646
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:10,000
you have three different moves you can do. Like there's attack, and attack beats throw.

1647
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Then you have throw, throw beats block and dodge, and block and dodge beats attack.

1648
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:22,000
And it's just a matter of just trying to guess what card your opponent is going to play.

1649
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:27,000
And if you played the right card that defeats his card, then you get to do combos just like you do in regular fighting games.

1650
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:33,000
And it's just really cool. It's a lot to explain, but it's a really cool game. You need to check it out.

1651
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:38,000
They also have it on the – I know a lot of you have iPhones, so they have it on the iPhone as well.

1652
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
A lot of different places you can play. They're highly, highly, highly recommended.

1653
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,000
I've talked about it before on your show, and now you guys ignored me.

1654
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Nah, I didn't ignore you. There's not enough time to play everything out there.

1655
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:53,000
But Yomi – well, you got somebody in chat. Fifth Dream just added it to his wish list there.

1656
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:57,000
So Yomi, Y-O-M-I for bonds006 who's asking me what the name of that is.

1657
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Yeah, Yomi translates into read. So you're like – supposedly you're supposed to be reading the mind of your opponent.

1658
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:06,000
And that's why they call it Yomi. It's great.

1659
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:10,000
We have a saying on one of my other shows. Reading is fundamental. So there you go.

1660
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Alright, my friend. I appreciate the recommendation. Check that out.

1661
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Alright, take care.

1662
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,000
You too.

1663
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Good to hear from you. Bye.

1664
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Alright, I guess that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. Sorry to those who didn't get through.

1665
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Act deaf. I don't know what happened with your connection, but consider sending us an e-mail.

1666
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Excuse me. Participate at orangeloungeradio.com because 1877 Game OLR is now closed.

1667
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Thank you so much, though, to our callers tonight.

1668
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,000
And we'll open that up, of course, again next week.

1669
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Next week on the program, of course, Dark Soccer will be back.

1670
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:46,000
I'll let you know if anything changed in the world of Elder Scrolls Online.

1671
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Maybe plugging into Wired will change my opinion on the whole damn game.

1672
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:54,000
We'll see. I don't know at this point, but we'll see.

1673
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:57,000
And who knows. Whatever else happens in games this week.

1674
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Journey out this week on the PlayStation 4.

1675
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
I think a lot of us will be re-exp- I know I will be.

1676
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
I definitely want to play through that again.

1677
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
So it'll be a fun week in games.

1678
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
And I know other people looking forward to N+.

1679
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:12,000
We were talking, I don't remember if this was just on Bobby's show or if we were saying on our show too,

1680
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:16,000
but Rocket League, huge, doing huge.

1681
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,000
They were giving it away for free on PlayStation Plus.

1682
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,000
And now people are just running away huge with this game, loving it.

1683
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I need to check that game out myself so I know that's on my list of things to do there.

1684
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Let's check that game out.

1685
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:32,000
So we'll be back in about seven days to do it all again.

1686
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Hey, you know what I say every week here on the show.

1687
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:38,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here tonight, tell a friend or 12 about the show.

1688
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Help spread the word because that's all we got.

1689
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:43,000
We're an independent podcast, independently done and produced.

1690
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:47,000
And that's all we got is you guys to help us spread the word.

1691
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,000
So we really appreciate that.

1692
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:53,000
A nice five star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or any of that goes a long way.

1693
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:56,000
It's been a while since we've had a new review in either of those places.

1694
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:02,000
So if you haven't left one yet, we'd totally love it if you take five seconds and go write something real quick.

1695
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
We'd really appreciate that over on those sites.

1696
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Because we really try not to ask for your money in order to do this show.

1697
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Sometimes there might be like a charitable thing we'll ask you guys to donate to or what have you.

1698
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,000
But we don't really ask money for our own pockets.

1699
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,000
We just do this because it's fun and we like to hang out with you guys.

1700
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:24,000
So help us spread the word and support independent podcasting even if you didn't like this show.

1701
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:29,000
There's so many other hardworking people out there also doing podcasting you should consider supporting.

1702
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Just like I mentioned, Bobby Black Wolf turning 10 double digits next week.

1703
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Congrats, sir.

1704
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:37,000
It's time to go around to get everybody's final thought.

1705
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Loki, thanks for holding down the fort with me tonight.

1706
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Good luck on your salad adventure. Let me know how that goes this next week.

1707
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Salad adventure. That sounds terrible.

1708
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
You'll do okay.

1709
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Hey, I find that some fast food places have really good salads.

1710
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:56,000
But you need to try here locally.

1711
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Not that I'm endorsing something without getting paid for it, but I guess I am.

1712
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:05,000
You need to try Jack's Urban Eats has the best salads because they put really good meat in the salad.

1713
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:08,000
So it's worth trying for sure. Anyway.

1714
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:09,000
We'll see.

1715
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Your final thought tonight.

1716
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Weezer's still too expensive.

1717
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Maybe you'll get a price drop for the holidays. You never know.

1718
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Yeah, I just kind of want Mario Maker. I don't know.

1719
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
I hear you. I hear you.

1720
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:28,000
I don't want to buy console for that, but we'll see.

1721
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Alright. And my final thought tonight is I really, really do not want to get food poisoning ever again in my entire life.

1722
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:38,000
It's the worst. Gross. Etc.

1723
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:42,000
At least I got to catch up on some video games, namely Heaven's Word.

1724
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Is there anything else I can still do in Final Fantasy XIV?

1725
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
I guess there is. Time to go do it.

1726
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Have a great week everybody. We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1727
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Have a great week. Good night.

02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:55,000
