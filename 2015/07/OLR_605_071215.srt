00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie and Loki

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Satoru Iwata would have been about 24 years old when he programmed this game, Balloon Fight,

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and although most people probably wrote it off at the time as a clone of Joust, which, well yeah, did have a lot of similarities,

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
it did bring some new ideas to the table.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Namely, the balloon trip mode, an endless side scroller, but with Joust-type mechanics.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It was difficult, but it was an awful lot of fun.

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:38,000
And I'm sure every gamer out there at some point has had their hands on a Kirby game,

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and Satoru Iwata was a producer on the first game on the original Game Boy as well as the NES version that came shortly after that many people were familiar with.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The ability for Kirby to inhale enemies and copy their abilities in such an adorable way

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
made him a mascot for years and years until even today.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And of course to think that Mr. Iwata would have been in his mid-thirties, our age, when he was doing programming work on Mother 2,

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
which of course we all know as Earthbound here in the US.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This game was truly something different. It put away the swords and sorcery of the typical JRPG,

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and replaced it with the things that could only be found in a child's imagination.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In 2002, Satoru Iwata took over as the president of Nintendo,

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and what makes Mr. Iwata notable as an executive is that he didn't just swoop in from some other financial firm or company,

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
looking out to make top dollar for the company.

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Satoru Iwata worked his way through various elements of game design.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That fun, originality, and things of a child's imagination are things that are better, and for worse,

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Nintendo has been known for in the past decade throughout the Wii, the DS, the 3DS, and the Wii U.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
As I'm sure many of you are aware before hearing this program tonight,

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
the gaming industry has lost one of the all-time greats,

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
as Satoru Iwata passed away this weekend due to a bile duct growth at the all-too-young age of 55.

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Tonight we remember and we respect this man's legacy and his contributions to the gaming world,

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
which can never be forgotten.

28
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It is Orange Launch Radio episode number 605 for this July the 12th of 2015.

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm Rob Roberts. With me as always, say hello to Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

30
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hi.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hi. And of course, Tech Master Loki here in the house as well.

32
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hello.

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hello. You know, part of the joy, quotey fingers, of doing live radio is that sometimes

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
there's news in the world out there that throws you for a loop a little bit,

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
and you have to plan for the unexpected, as they say.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I seem to recall this show was live, oh golly, it was several years ago at this point,

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
it was probably about six or seven years ago when the whole, and I apologize,

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't know off the top of my head, but my head's spinning a little bit tonight,

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
when the Osama bin Laden news came through that he'd been captured,

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and Obama did that whole press conference, that was right in the middle of our show,

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
and completely unexpected, and you know, live things happen.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So I know all of us here in the studio, as well as those of you in our chat room,

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
of course, live Sunday night, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
right after the Bobby Blackwell show, and if you are listening live,

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
live.vognetwork.com.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sure a lot of us are just reeling from this news, which is just, you know,

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
it's a surprise in many ways.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I mean, this really came out of nowhere to hear that, you know,

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
somebody who just was a major part of E3, with the whole Nintendo Direct,

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and the whole Muppet thing, you know, all that stuff,

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
that was just a big part of that, has just passed away.

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And obviously, you know, if you start to kind of look back over the past year,

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
he did miss E3 last year, because he had not been doing so well, he was sick,

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and I don't think they said a lot, I think they might have said it was the bile duct at the time,

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't recall in the moment what all they had or hadn't said about it,

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
but certainly hadn't been doing well then, we thought he had made a full recovery,

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
but, you know, unfortunately, clearly, that did not happen.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And it really just, it stings in a very familiar way,

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
because me personally, I'm really reminded in so many ways of Steve Jobs,

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and I know some people might come after me for that comparison,

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but I kind of think Steve Jobs was somebody else who was with this company,

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
that was on this huge upswing, very inventive,

63
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and then, you know, he had the issues with pancreatic cancer,

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
which is, I mean, those two are neighbors,

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and I can tell you, because when I was 29,

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and you might remember when I was really sick and I missed the show for like a month,

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I was going through issues that had to do with my bile duct and my pancreas,

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and that shit is no joke, let me tell you.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And, you know, obviously that, we lost Steve Jobs to that,

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and now we've lost another great tech, great, was Satoru Iwata to that,

71
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
it's just, I don't know what else to say about fuck cancer, certainly,

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and God, I just, it's just really overwhelming in the moment to think about

73
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
the fact that, you know, this was a guy who created so many of these games

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
that we have so many memories around,

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and like this show would not exist if it wasn't for some of this man's contributions

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
to the Nintendo Entertainment System, you know.

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, I'm still reeling, I don't know about you guys, help me out here,

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
what are you guys thinking and processing right now?

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Dark Sakura, how are you doing?

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't.

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, no, I know, it's a lot to process. Sudden.

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Well, that, and I'm also coming from the tail end of personal deaths in my family, so.

83
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sure.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is sort of like, I'm overloaded right now.

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh no, I completely understand, I, yeah, Loki, how are you doing?

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm fine, I just have a headache from my kids today.

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
From everything else that goes on in the world, yes, of course.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes, I've taken two rounds of ibuprofen and nothing to help me.

89
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh no, as I said in the beginning of the show and on Twitter and all that stuff,

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
you know, the show must go on in light of all this news, we've, you know,

91
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
got still many things going on in the industry and so forth in the news.

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I will tell you what my doctor told me.

93
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
If you've got a headache, take ibuprofen and Tylenol together.

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah, I used to have, like, a combo pill thing that was like that,

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
but see, I can't swallow pills, so the ibuprofen I have, I get this, like, dye-free ibuprofen.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It doesn't really taste like anything, so it's something I can actually chew up and swallow and it works,

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
because it's a double medicine and not, like, some liquid crap instead of taking, you know,

98
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
like, overdosing on children's Tylenol or something like that.

99
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So it's just like, you know, eating chalk, but hey, it works.

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But anyways, yeah, the long story short, I used to have one that was a combo with that and caffeine,

101
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
but it was some nasty stuff.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yeah, but caffeine is great.

103
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's good if you can swallow it, but if you're, like, in my, where I have a terrible gag reflex,

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I can't, I cannot, I want to, and it really bothers me, I can't, I cannot swallow pills.

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And so, I just, that's the only way around it, is I got to chew and swallow that stuff,

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and it's just, that was some nasty, nasty stuff.

107
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But this stuff's not bad, I can deal with it.

108
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Which is the kids.

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let me go to the chat room where obviously a lot of people are discussing, you know, what's,

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
what's, everybody's kind of reeling from the news and obviously there's a lot of comments in our chat room

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
over at live.vognetwork.com.

112
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Raginator puts it quite succinctly by saying, fuck cancer in the eye socket, fair enough.

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Breakman says, I don't know anyone whose life hasn't been affected directly or indirectly by cancer.

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Pow in our chat room says, I see similarities. Innovative people gone too soon.

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
S2100matt says, like Jobs, he certainly changed the industry for the better.

116
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He really brought about great innovation.

117
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The thing is, Nintendo will carry on his legacy much like Apple did with Jobs.

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
His contributions will be reaching us for many years. He won't truly ever be gone.

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
True says, the memory of he and Shiggy printing Wii money will forever be remembered.

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Certainly, you know, he's, he's, he's an executive that has many gifable moments out there

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
through some of those Nintendo directs.

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And, you know, he's got his own trademarks, you know.

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Who hasn't watched a Nintendo direct and done the whole, please understand, you know, the whole thing that he does, right?

124
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You know, that, that's personality.

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Well, yeah, exactly. It was nice to see, like, someone that actually would be that direct with their consumers

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and just kind of, you know, they're out there.

127
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I mean, how many presidents of companies do you actually get to see, you know, interact with a consumer on a pretty regular basis?

128
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And speaking of, like, being that person, you know, I'm seeing a lot floating around Twitter right now,

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
which you can imagine is just, you know, a mess, an understandable mess over, over what's happening.

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And one of the things that I was reminded of is that I think it was the year the 3DS first came out

131
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and remember it didn't do so hot its first year and it took until the next year when they got, like, the Mario Kart and, you know, all the big games.

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,000
As you recall, the executives took a huge pay cut that year, including, you know, Iwata as the president of Nintendo at the time.

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, he cut his in half.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He cut, they cut their salaries because of those problems, which, you know, you just don't see people doing in this day and age very often at all.

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And that was a very kind of, like, I think humanizing thing in a way that, you know, certainly, certainly made them even more personable.

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And Pao follows that up in chat saying he was an honest person.

137
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How many presidents of big companies dropped their own salary?

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sure, I'm sure there has been others, but it's certainly not something you hear about an awful lot.

139
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster says Iwata was a tough corporate leader who reached out to his fans.

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He held the course, fought to keep Nintendo Nintendo, and wasn't afraid to have a little fun at the same time.

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You know, Iwata, if I remember right, sorry guys, you know, I just found this out about 45 minutes ago, so I'm having to kind of do a lot of this from memory and off the cusp.

142
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
But Iwata, if I remember right, at some point a couple years ago actually took over Nintendo of America.

143
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because Reggie Fils-Aime is not, like, CEO of Nintendo America, or at least he wasn't at the time.

144
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So I don't remember how the timing all worked out, but I do remember that it was Iwata's decision in many ways to basically bow out of E3 and not do the E3.

145
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I mean, well, they do obviously the booth, but they don't do the E3 conferences anymore, they do the Nintendo Directs.

146
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Which, you know, has led to a lot of this personality stuff we've been seeing out of Nintendo in the past couple years.

147
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You know, that was a big decision that Iwata made when he was overseeing Nintendo of America as well.

148
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
SSJ100Matt in chat says he certainly kept fans tuned in with those Iwata Asks web and video updates. Absolutely.

149
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I was going to talk a little bit about Comic-Con at the top of the show tonight, because that was going on this weekend.

150
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We'll address some of that stuff later on, I'm sure.

151
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But I thought we could take a moment here where we would usually do a kick-off topic to just talk about, like, how our lives have been impacted by Nintendo.

152
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
And things that Iwata has certainly influenced and touched and so forth.

153
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And I'll start, since I'm not putting Jamie and Matt too much on the spot here.

154
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But for me, for Nintendo, I mean, in some ways, video games and having that to turn to was so crucial, I think, especially in the fourth grade.

155
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And I remember playing games like Balloon Fight and Zelda, which, you know, Iwata had a little bit of influence over still in those games.

156
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Those were such a huge part of my childhood at that time, I just can't even imagine how I would be different if it wasn't for that.

157
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Because I was that kid in the class that other kids would come to for the Nintendo secrets.

158
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And, you know, how do I get to level 8 on the second quest of Legend of Zelda and things like that.

159
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You know, that was something they would come to me for because I had that subscription to Nintendo Power.

160
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You know, I was the game nerd from an even young age, kept in tune to that.

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Because I loved the fact that video games kind of allowed you, in some indirect way, to have control of what was on the television.

162
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And it wasn't just I'm watching a cartoon, it is I am being a cartoon, I am the cartoon, especially.

163
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And I remember a very vivid memory I have of that is the first time I ever played Super Mario Brothers 2, specifically.

164
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Because, you remember the graphics in that game, when we were that age and that game first came out, it was like, this is a fucking cartoon.

165
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You know, and I realize, you go back in retrospect, we've had games that are plenty better looking since then.

166
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But, at the time, Mario 2 is like, this is a cartoon. I am an interactive cartoon on the television, this is happening.

167
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And so, you know, I've been following that from when I was like 9 or 10, following Nintendo closely.

168
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And now, here we are, 20 some odd years later, doing this show where we're still talking about video games and being tapped into the game industry.

169
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And all that is still a huge influence on my life.

170
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And maybe there's other people that play into that, certainly, too. I mean, Sony, Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft, great companies as well.

171
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But, you know, Nintendo is still there. Nintendo, from my childhood, is still going.

172
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Atari, not the same company it used to be. Great memories with Atari, but they're not really what they used to be. Sega?

173
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think you're great memories with Activision, actually, on the Atari.

174
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, not too far off, yeah. But, you know, Activision, not the same they used to be.

175
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I mean, Destiny is a long way from Pitfall, let's just put it that way.

176
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
And then, you know, Sega was a big part of that same time, again.

177
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And not to belittle the many things that Sega accomplished in that era, but it's not the same company it used to be.

178
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Nintendo, still going after all this time. And not a lot of companies that were around in that time can really say that.

179
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That they're still going strong today. I suppose Activision could, but, you know, it's just so different.

180
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Where, like, Nintendo is like, Nintendo is still Nintendo, you know, for better or for worse.

181
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And, yes, we've been critical of Nintendo on this show before. I'm not going to try to hide that just because of the news today.

182
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But, I've also, and I've said this time and time again, is that when we're critical of something, it's usually because we care so much about it that it really bothers us when we see them making mistakes.

183
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You know, that, like, I love you so much I could just scream. You know, that's how it is with Nintendo a lot of times.

184
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
So, anyway, that's for me. I'm getting to that rambling point.

185
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Dark Sakura, what Nintendo memories do you have from growing up?

186
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Well, I actually went and looked up the list because I always remembered the HAL Laboratories logo.

187
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, yeah.

188
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
With the puppies, you know.

189
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And I was just looking through the list of HAL Laboratory games and just how many of them I've played.

190
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And some of these were, keep in mind, some of them were ports as well.

191
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So, they were responsible for the port of Joust on the Nintendo.

192
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We had a port of Millipede, Othello, you know.

193
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
As far as the other ones, I mean, we had the Adventures of Lolo.

194
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, yeah. I remember that puzzler game, absolutely.

195
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah.

196
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
There was, like, three of them.

197
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Kabuki Quantum Fighter.

198
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I was just looking over the list of a bunch of stuff that was on here that were all things that, like, I had when I was a kid.

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Still have a bunch of them, actually.

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
We actually had, of course, all of the Kirby games on the Super Nintendo.

201
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
For Nintendo 64, there was Pokémon Snap.

202
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It was at HAL Laboratories.

203
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Oh, that's right.

204
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yep. Pokémon Stadium.

205
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There was, Super Smash Brothers was HAL Laboratories.

206
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah.

207
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You know, so we wouldn't have had that without them.

208
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
By this point, this is where Iwata probably was moving in a little more to the Nintendo, but certainly his influence was still there.

209
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This is definitely the company that he ran for a while.

210
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He was at HAL Laboratories first.

211
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yeah.

212
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
So, just all kinds of stuff.

213
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And we've heard those stories about where, like, he was high up and, wasn't it the original Smash Brothers where, I remember, was the original or the one on the GameCube or one of them?

214
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He fucking jumped in there and started programming so they could meet a deadline.

215
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Like, that's who he was.

216
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, and if I do recall correctly, when the first Pokémon came out, or one of them, anyway, they could only fit, like, one of the regions on the cartridge and he went in and reprogrammed it to where they could fit two regions on there.

217
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, somebody in chat had brought that up and I apologize, I didn't read that comment.

218
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But yeah, it was brought up.

219
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh, yeah.

220
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Vogdammit.

221
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Love that name in our chatroom.

222
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It says, Iwata was the reason Kanto fit into Pokémon Gold and Silver.

223
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, that was Pokémon Gold and Silver, that was it.

224
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
He also programmed, well, I mean, was behind, I think, one of my favorite ever pinball games, Revenge of the Gator.

225
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh shit, that was a HAL game. Oh my god, that was like the Game Boy Link game when that came out. Oh my god.

226
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Just looking through a few other ones on here, you know, going back a little bit further back into the older days, I mean, we had Kirby, Tilt, and Tumble.

227
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And, let's see. And then, of course, there was, before it got turned into Mother 3, there was going to be Mother 64, or Earthbound 64, as it was.

228
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So, all kinds of stuff.

229
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah.

230
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And, on top of that, I mean, we've also got, there's a list of other games, other systems, sorry, that HAL Laboratories provided games for.

231
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Like, Commodore 64 games, Mole Attack, Pinball Spectacular, Slalom, Bowling Jupiter Lander.

232
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I think I played Slalom, I had no idea that HAL did work with Commodore 64.

233
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Le Mans, Money Wars.

234
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh my god, Le Mans was the first Commodore 64 game I ever owned.

235
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yep.

236
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
True. Wow.

237
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
For Cliccovision, Mr. Chin. For MSX, a ton of stuff. Like, the Eggerland games, there were also Famicom Disk games.

238
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Huh.

239
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The Golf Force games after the anime from the 80s. Inspector Z, Pachi Pro Densetsu, Rollerball, Space Maze Attack.

240
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Let's see what else. For MSX2, there were a few other games, and a couple of Windows games, which were mostly the Eggerland games. So, yeah.

241
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Looking at chat, because a lot of folks sharing memories in our chat room, and then I'll get over to Loki.

242
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Sjoan Hunter Matt says, I have many vivid memories from playing Nintendo. We had a very close friend of the family that passed when I was very young.

243
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I have very few memories of him left, but the ones that I do have are of me and him playing Nintendo.

244
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Dark Tetsuya said, yeah, my uncle passed away last year, and NES Zelda was the first big game him and I played together.

245
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So Nintendo's been a big part of my life ever since then.

246
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,000
True says, getting my NES on Christmas Day 25 years ago and playing it with my family is a big memory of mine.

247
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Loki?

248
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't know. I've owned Nintendo consoles ever since the NES, all through the Wii.

249
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But, yeah, I remember my first NES was back in 1987, I think.

250
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I remember all my friends had one, but I didn't have one yet.

251
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So we would always go over to their house and play games and stuff.

252
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And then one day, I don't even remember, there was no occasion to it other than just one day,

253
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
my dad had set it up in my room or something like that, and Zelda was running it on.

254
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I was like, oh, sweet! So it was like Zelda, and it was like Bubble Bubble and Breakthrough.

255
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It was like three random games. I'm sure they got it used somewhere or something.

256
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But that's what they bought it on. Which is funny, because my dad, he says he's not a gamer yet.

257
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,000
He had a ColecoVision with like 70-some games, so yeah, that doesn't really jive with what you're saying there.

258
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Could just be a collector.

259
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
No, no. He used to play them too. I mean, come on.

260
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So yeah, I've had pretty much everything, except for the Game Boy. I never really got into the Game Boy, I don't know.

261
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
But I had everything else.

262
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't know. I mean, as far as actual HAL games, I can't remember. I mean, I remember playing Adventures of Lolo.

263
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I just don't remember exactly which games they did that I would have played. I played pretty much everything.

264
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I mean, we used to go rent shit all the time. That was what you did. So I probably played a little bit of everything.

265
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't know. But definitely, yeah. I mean, it probably got me into games a lot more than I was originally.

266
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Definitely had the interest of games ever since my childhood, and I'm sure Nintendo only helped with that since I've been playing their games for most of my life.

267
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
So yeah, I can definitely see they have a big influence.

268
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm just thumbing through Twitter here, which sometimes a little bit of the whole groupthink and unverified things take over on Twitter a little bit.

269
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But some of the things that are jumping out at me that I think are worth repeating. There's a quote here attributed to Iwata.

270
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer.

271
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Which certainly would speak to a lot of the ways that he conducted himself and made decisions.

272
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Another user, and I'm not reading who said that. I'm just reading my personal timeline right now, so I don't want to call out people.

273
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:46,000
But I'm seeing these tweets that Satoru Iwata's last public message was an apology to everyone who was let down by Nintendo's E3 digital event.

274
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I can't. I can't.

275
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Another tweet about the pay cut thing. The fact that his last essentially big game is going to be Mario Maker.

276
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He's leaving with Mario Maker. We can create our own games and make our own dreams come true like he did.

277
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That's a really powerful footnote there. The fact that Mario Maker, it's like now we created these games and now you're going to create these games.

278
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Nintendo. Certainly, the type of gaming that we have in Mario Maker, we've seen that.

279
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Not even just a little big planet, but since the Commodore 64 was brought up, we had pinball construction set.

280
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Game making has always been some type of category of games, but the fact that it is Nintendo and this type of a franchise that people are going to be able to have a canvas and go crazy with.

281
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
People in Little Big Planet just want to make Mario games anyways.

282
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Isn't that the truth? Isn't that the truth? Because we always have the stories about World 1-1 is the big thing that is made.

283
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Anyway, also coming through the wire, we're hearing that Miyamoto, and I don't have this verified yet, but I wouldn't doubt it.

284
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Shigeru Miyamoto has been named the temporary president while I assume a long-term plan is figured out.

285
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And someone get that guy a checkup because we can't...

286
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Put him in a bubble. These people must be protected and treasured.

287
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Give that guy some Vitamin C or something.

288
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Well, as much as we might be saying this a little bit tongue-in-cheek, Miyamoto's been working very hard already.

289
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Because when the Wii U's been struggling a little bit, who did they turn to to come up with ideas on how this gamepad is going to really work with this system?

290
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
That's all been Miyamoto. So you know that guy's been working overtime as it is.

291
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And now the fact that he's going to get called on to essentially run the company for a few months while they figure out what they're going to do, that guy's not going to get any sleep for a while.

292
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And I'm sure him and Iwata were very, very close. Again, I'm sure it's not to keep going back to Apple, but it's something that's very fresh in my mind.

293
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I know Tim Cook and Steve Jobs were close too, and Steve said as he was passing, I want Tim to take over the company.

294
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Yeah, well it sounds to me that I'm sure they probably have had a contingency plan in place. I mean, I'm sure this isn't sudden news for them.

295
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
They probably knew about it, it just wasn't something that they were sharing with the world.

296
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Some other comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

297
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Pao says, even Hideki Kamiya took a break from fighting trolls on social media and tweeted, in my heart, forever.

298
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Which is interesting because we have a story on that. It's coming up a little later in the show.

299
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Tigerclaw says, you think Reggie could be promoted to president for Nintendo?

300
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
DungeonBuster says, as cool as Reggie is, probably not.

301
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yeah, I don't see Reggie taking over the entire Nintendo, especially with Nintendo being a Japanese company.

302
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I just kind of think they're going to probably end up promoting from the Japanese end of things.

303
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
But I wouldn't be surprised at all if Reggie is given more and more responsibilities over the American arm of things, if he wants that.

304
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Or there might be some other people too. There's probably some other executives yet to come from this whole thing.

305
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So, gosh, I don't even know what else to say.

306
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:33,000
It's surprising, but I'm having this moment of, just candidly, since we are live and I tend to talk as I think when we're live.

307
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm just having this moment of like, holy shit, we're all getting older because here's the people that created the games we played as kids getting older.

308
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And God, Iwata wasn't even really that old. 55 is not old, I'm sorry.

309
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
He should have been able to retire and travel around the world on a yacht when he was 65.

310
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:11,000
We have stories every month, it seems, about some great who has passed on. It's just a lot to handle.

311
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And I'm thinking about, speaking of like, gaming's greats and so forth.

312
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You know, next weekend here in California, Dark Soccer and I were talking earlier this week about California Extreme is happening this weekend.

313
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Which is a great kind of way to celebrate the arcade, the past, and gaming.

314
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And they get, because it's in the Bay Area, they get a lot of people from the Bay that used to be involved.

315
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Like, I know they've got, what, the Qbert creator is supposed to be there, some of the pinball dudes, right?

316
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:48,000
A lot of folks are going to be there, but I can't help but think, you know, this news is going to have a big cloud over that in a way, I think.

317
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
As would be expected, so...

318
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Anyway, let's see, going to chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

319
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Zappi is saying that the press release says that Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda, who's the general manager of Nintendo and co-creator of Punch Out,

320
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,000
so another one that came up from the early days, are actually running the company currently.

321
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
So it sounds like there's more than one, so that's good.

322
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And it's pretty possible that they've already been running the company for a while now.

323
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,000
If Iwata hadn't just been in that E3 Direct, I would almost...

324
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Again, I think that's where this is different from the Steve Jobs situation, because Steve Jobs, he was out on medical leave for like two years at one point while Tim Cook was running the company.

325
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:53,000
But unfortunately, and I've seen another tweet on my timeline about how does it feel to be a Miyamoto and get that call that's like, this just happened, you know?

326
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And I think in some ways, though, they were probably a little more prepared for this than the rest of us were.

327
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I mean, there's also the fact that he died yesterday on the 11th, and we're just hearing about it now as it's turning into Monday morning in Japan.

328
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
So there's time to process news and figure out.

329
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:24,000
So if they had an inkling that something was very, very, very wrong with Iwata and that his bile duct issues were coming back,

330
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
they have to do what they have to do and set that plan B that's now going into motion right now.

331
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So I'm sure they were thinking about this stuff a couple weeks ago, as difficult as it is to talk about.

332
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Anyhow, the show goes on. There's a lot going on in the gaming world.

333
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I want to make sure we cover the rest of what's going on in gaming news this week.

334
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
But certainly with that news having broke just an hour before we went live tonight, we have to, have to say something about it.

335
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm sure there's going to be much more to come in this week.

336
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You know, as people rightfully so everywhere will be doing their tributes to Iwata.

337
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And I would even fully expect you'll see something from Sony and Microsoft even.

338
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I mean, because they're not, I mean, what's the way to phrase this?

339
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
They're all business friendly people.

340
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You see Sony congratulating Microsoft and Microsoft, you know, you see all those tweets and things, you know, there's that friendly business.

341
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Nintendo's been around as far as in the gaming industry, been around a lot longer than Sony and Nintendo,

342
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and a lot of them have to kind of attribute some of them being in that industry because of Nintendo.

343
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
We just visited last week a piece of gaming history where Sony and Nintendo were getting into it together at a point, right?

344
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
It was just dug up out of the trash this week.

345
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:51,000
So anyway, it's going to be, it's going to be a very somber week with a lot of memorial and I just paying tribute, I'm sure.

346
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Anyhow, we're going to keep on, we put the show together usually in the afternoons on Sundays about two, three o'clock.

347
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
We usually know what we're going to be talking about for the day.

348
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Just a fun little behind the scenes fact about the time you see the Fugu question of the week go up.

349
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
That means we're currently positioning, you know, what stories we're going to talk about tonight, what's going to go where.

350
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
So we're going to move forward with everything that we had planned to talk about tonight.

351
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
But certainly I'm sure a lot more of you want to talk about this.

352
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
We will open the Skype line later.

353
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
1877 Game OLR username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

354
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I'm going to continue to read comments throughout chat and so forth.

355
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
But for now, we will move on with what's going on in the gaming world.

356
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
We always start off each show with how is your gaming week?

357
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So let's talk about the video games that you've been playing this week.

358
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Dark Sakura, you told me before the show you've had a pretty, pretty fruitful gaming week, right?

359
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Yes. We went to Coin Op last night, which is a classic arcade and bar.

360
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I haven't been there yet.

361
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It's my second time going. It was pretty fun.

362
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Those are making a resurgence all over. It seems like a lot of big towns are getting those.

363
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Well, this is the place that used to be Maryland's downtown.

364
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So for Sacramento folks, they know where it is.

365
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Anyway, one of Dan's friends owns most of the machines there.

366
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So he was actually there shopping out the Wizard of Oz pinball table that they have there.

367
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I played SVC Chaos, which now I remember why I don't play SVC Chaos because it's not very good of a game.

368
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I played Marvel vs. Capcom. Dan was playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

369
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I played some Final Fight. I played something else.

370
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I actually played Theater of Magic. They have a Theater of Magic there.

371
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh, get out. I love that table.

372
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
They have a six-player X-Men.

373
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Nice. We need to go on a date.

374
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Yay, date. They had a drink there that was amazing.

375
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
We'll bring Loki. It'll be a triple date if we can get Loki away from everything else.

376
00:32:49,000 --> 00:33:01,000
They had a drink there called the 91 Unleaded that's basically coffee, like cold brew coffee, cinnamon, rum, and walnut bitters.

377
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It was pretty bitter. It was great. I liked it.

378
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Anyway, they also have the shot called the Cold War Kid that's actually pretty good too.

379
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And then they had Giant Jenga, which I recorded the last ten minutes of it and I might be convinced to put it up on my Facebook.

380
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Wait, what's Giant Jenga?

381
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It's basically Jenga made out of big bricks, so it's like, yay tall.

382
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But it's on a stand.

383
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It's an arcade game?

384
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
No, no, no, no. It's Jenga.

385
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Oh, okay. They just have board games that you can play there too?

386
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
They have three different sets of Giant Jenga.

387
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Oh, okay.

388
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
And then they were playing Kinect 4 outside.

389
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I was confused. I thought like Jenga was like some weird- I'm like, how do people not steal the pieces?

390
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So they have like a ladder or something that you go on?

391
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
No, it doesn't get that high. Like maybe it was like my height and I'm 5'2". And it's on a table.

392
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Okay.

393
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
A little table.

394
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Okay.

395
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
That's like a perfect stand to play.

396
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
How big are these pieces?

397
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh, that's not that big.

398
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I need to-

399
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I was like thinking like the size of his coffee table or something like that.

400
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Where can you buy Giant Jenga? Because you know Jenga became a huge inside joke at the last GamerX?

401
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah.

402
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
With some of the other podcast buddies of mine. So I need to find Giant Jenga and bring it to the next one.

403
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I think that these were basically just custom-made blocks.

404
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Oh, okay. Interesting.

405
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah. Because I mean really if you've got the dimensions of regular Jenga blocks, it's not too hard.

406
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Times two. Times two.

407
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Well, it's funny because YYR in chat says Giant Jenga is literally just Jenga with an eight times mod on the block.

408
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Pretty much.

409
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Pretty much. That's about accurate.

410
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
We're just going to scale it to 400 percent.

411
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But it was pretty, pretty fun.

412
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Nice.

413
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And then I've played Final Fantasy XIV because thanks to Shane, we just said fuck it on getting all the tomes for my gear.

414
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And we just bought gear because I happened to check my bank and I had like 400,000 gold or gil or whatever.

415
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So I'm like shopping trip.

416
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And so now I'm back on story progression, which actually is funny.

417
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
My gear is better than the gear I'm getting through story.

418
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Oh, good.

419
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It's funny you get like the rainbow robes of casting and everything.

420
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It's got goth black.

421
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's like it's kind of like I look like the goth clown girl.

422
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
It's rainbow on the inside.

423
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
It's dark like my soul.

424
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I've played Dragon Age Inquisition a little bit because for everyone who mods their PC version, update eight borks all the mods.

425
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:36,000
But there is something out there on the DAI modder Tumblr on how to roll back to version seven where all your mods will work.

426
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So they're working on going ahead and trying to get the mods working for version eight for when the next DLC comes out.

427
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I also am playing Dragon Age Origins again, which I hadn't played it since a long time ago, I think.

428
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And this time I'm actually going for one of the playthroughs that I didn't do before.

429
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,000
And it's I have lots of mods in there, but I have like this one mod in there and I can't figure out which one it is.

430
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But it basically removes all some of the women's hair.

431
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And when you get a back view of them, you can see their eyeballs floating in the back of their head.

432
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And it's just really creepy.

433
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And then some people have like plastic skin looking from one of my mods going wrong.

434
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I can't figure out what the hell which mod it is because I tried to do one and then all of a sudden my character didn't have any hair.

435
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Clearly the Joan Rivers mod.

436
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah.

437
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But at any rate, that's what I have been. Oh, yeah.

438
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
And we got Puyo Puyo Tetris.

439
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And I had to re-teach myself how to read very stylized Japanese again.

440
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And Dan kept going to this one. He's like, this has got to be versus. It looks like versus.

441
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Dan, it says Hitori. That means alone. One person.

442
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
So we finally figured out how to get like, because you have like a versus computer mode.

443
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Like you have you have adventure mode. Then you have versus the versus computer is Hitori mode.

444
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,000
And then you've got like two player mode. So it sucks if you're playing the Tetris pieces.

445
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
You need to bring that over. I want to check it out.

446
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Sounds cute. It's pretty fun. It's so funny you're yawning because break man in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

447
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Did Jamie have time to do anything else this week? Has she had time for sleep?

448
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
And you've just yawned. Maybe not.

449
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I've been really tired anyway just because I've had a lot between work and everything.

450
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
You know, I actually the sad thing is that I am behind on my writing.

451
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So I need to buckle down and spend a couple of lunch breaks on my story.

452
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,000
So gotcha. Yeah. All right. Let's move over to Loki. How was your gaming week this week?

453
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I worked on my games and I say games because I was working on trying to prototype something so that I could do a game jam this coming weekend.

454
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But they ain't going to happen. The reason it's not going to happen is because I can't mentally focus myself long enough with all the you know,

455
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
trying to dodge kids and stuff for 72 hour game jam that takes place on the weekend.

456
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,000
There's no goddamn way I'm going to be able to crank out a game in like 10 hours.

457
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:22,000
That's just not going to happen. So I'm still going to probably work on whatever that prototype was.

458
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I mean, it's a neat idea. It's a cross between like Mega Man and Mickey Fighters, if you remember that.

459
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So basically it's a 2D shmup game where when you blow up enemies, they kind of crash down out of the sky and then they stick to you.

460
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And then when you're firing, they fire their bullets as well.

461
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,000
And it just eventually you become this giant mass of bullets and shit that you're fighting other things with.

462
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,000
But along with that, you'll be able to kind of like absorb the enemies into like do like charge up a meter to do different special attacks and stuff.

463
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,000
So that was kind of what I did. And I've got like, I've got the 2D portion, like the jumping and moving stuff done.

464
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I just was trying to finish the rest of it, but you know, whatever.

465
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But yeah, I got to go back to work on my game. I was just kind of mixing up a bit.

466
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,000
See, the reason why is I was trying to, I would have had more time to work on that prototype, but I was trying to get Unity 5 to work.

467
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Unity 5 has this weird bug on my computer for whatever reason that whenever I click on something to change the color of a texture, it crashes.

468
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And it pissed me off and I just spent way too long trying to fix that.

469
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Alright, so aside from programming stuff, I actually did play games.

470
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I played through almost the entire game of Portal Stories MEL and it was pretty good. I like it.

471
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:56,000
It is a little frustrating at the end because the last boss battle that you have to do involves you carrying a Portal turret around and, or the Sentry turrets around and shooting stuff with it.

472
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And you know from carrying stuff around in Portal that if you bang stuff against the wall or something like that, it's hard to navigate while holding something in your hand.

473
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And with the turrets, if you bang them against something, they fall out of your hands and when they tip over, they die. So it's really frustrating.

474
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And so I played through like the boss part three times. I know what I have to do. It's just that navigating around all this shit that's falling on the ground, you know, my turret clips on a chair or something and all of a sudden it's popped out of my hand.

475
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Or I set it down and it tips over because there's momentum from something. So it's really annoying.

476
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
But the game was fun. I recommend checking it out and playing it. It's free if you have Portal 2, so go download it.

477
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:51,000
The other game I played was Ether One and this is a PlayStation 4 and PC game. I think it was free on PlayStation Plus either this month or last month, relatively recently.

478
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And it's an interesting storyline. Once again, it's kind of a little bit like, sort of like Portal but not. I guess it's like a first person puzzle game, if that makes sense.

479
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And then so you're kind of, the premise is you're this scientist who's kind of in this machine. Think of it like The Matrix or something like that.

480
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You sit in this machine, you kind of go into someone else's memories. Maybe like The Cell. Remember that old 90s movie, The Cell?

481
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So, like The Cell, and you're going into this woman's memories to try to cure her dementia. And the way you do that is by kind of unlocking memories that she kind of has hidden away.

482
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:45,000
You know, that she is blocked out because of traumatic events. And so you're trying to restore these memories by kind of going through all of her memories and just discovering, you know, secrets about her and stuff like that.

483
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:53,000
And it's really trippy. It's a pretty fun game. A little bit confusing. It's like what to do in some of the puzzles sometimes. There's a lot to retain.

484
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:04,000
But it's kind of cool as you pick up objects and you can kind of storm in your inventory, like this hub world thing. And I know there's going to be some sort of twist into this.

485
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:17,000
The thing that really bugged me though, it's Unreal 4 but the popping is really terrible. Like stuff pops in about 10 feet in front of you. Just like accessory stuff that's on the ground.

486
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But that wasn't so bad. I mean, I was able to overlook that. However, there is a really bad save bug. And so my game crashed. My game crashed. And now when I go to reload that save, it doesn't work.

487
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:42,000
However, I've been reading up on it and apparently it could work, but it may take like five minutes to load your save game. So like, I'm like, ah, you know, I was really getting into the game too.

488
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:52,000
And like, see the thing was I finished the second or third level in it and I was like, okay, I want to go back to the second level and I want to make sure I 100% everything. I wanted to get all this like side stuff.

489
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:03,000
And so when I went to go, you know, transport myself there, it crashed. I was like, seriously? Because I was really getting into it and then it just crashed. And it's like, okay, well now you've just soured it for me.

490
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:14,000
But I don't know. I just wish they would test this stuff a little bit more. You would think that this would be something that they would be able to pick up on. But yeah, definitely worth checking out though.

491
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Yeah, there is that save bug thing. So just make backups of your saves. Just try to, you know, back yourself up.

492
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I try to do that on RPGs anyway, because I'm always afraid I'm going to do like some, some fuck up where I irreversibly can't go back. It's like anytime I start a dungeon or something, I make like a second save. I do that anyway. It's just a weird OCD habit I have.

493
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:42,000
But yeah, definitely if you, if you try that game, cause there are, I guess they're going to patch it, but um, you know, in the meantime, just go check it out. It's free if you have PlayStation plus.

494
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So it was literally one of those things. Like I was looking at my library of games like, I don't know what this is. I'm like, I'm just going to play it. I'm just going to see what it is.

495
00:43:49,000 --> 00:44:01,000
And then I went into it. I'm like, cause it was funny when my son was watching, I'm like, I'm going to download this. This is the boring lighthouse game. Cause that's what the icon is just of a lighthouse and you click on it and stuff.

496
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:10,000
And I'm like, okay, I don't know what I'm doing, but I'm going to try it out. And I got really into it. I mean, box art can be deceiving. Exactly. Well, back in the day, there's something about that lighthouse.

497
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:21,000
There's some secret about the layouts cause there's a light, you know, how are we going to have a bio shock thing? You know, there's something with the lighthouse here. Is this, is this another realm of bio shock?

498
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Another dimension. Some comments from our chat. Akuma JP says, sounds like stalker, the game Tron edition. Dungeon Buster says, whoa, stalker and Tron in the same game. Maybe I should try that.

499
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It's, it's really, it's seriously, it's a pretty good game. I would definitely check it out. And it's PlayStation plus. There's really no reason not to. Exactly. It's a little creepy. Like there's like, especially when you're going into the memory stuff, like there's one part cause I think the woman that you're in the memories of kind of knows that you're in there.

500
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Is it a scary game or no? It's not scary at all. Okay. It's just like, there's no, is it like psychologically unsettling at all? You know how some scares can be very disturbing?

501
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:11,000
There's nothing violent or anything. It's just a puzzle game. Oh, I think those are the best though. Like, if you can be scary without having to resort to gore, I think that is like, well, yeah, it's not, not like scary.

502
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Like it's not supposed to be a horror game or anything. It's, but like there's one part, like the first level you go to is like in a mine and you find out that there's this tragedy where like everybody died and you're kind of trying to figure out why.

503
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And, and I, and like I said, I've been kind of skimming a lot cause there's a ton of shit, like all these notes that people leave that you can read. And like, I just, I couldn't come, you know, comprehend all of it.

504
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:47,000
This sounds like something Jamie should be on. I don't know. I feel like this is a Jamie game. Crazy person or something basically is cutting all their, their, um, ventilation pipes and basically flooded it full of something.

505
00:45:47,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Jamie, you did that last week. Jamie, you like fucked up things. I think I'm just messing with you, but no, you know, like you like, like the five nights of Freddy's and all those like, you know, kind of psychological scare type of game.

506
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:12,000
But it's like on someone I'll in like Britain or something like that. And it also sounds like the ring a little bit cause didn't the ring again. It there's like someone, it's like some aisle in like Britain or something.

507
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm not really sure what it is because I don't go at it to make you have stuff. Haven't played yet because I mean apparently Alexander Graham Bell plays a part of it, so I'm not really sure what that's all about, but you know, I don't know.

508
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:37,000
All right. Um, check it out though. It's, it's free. If you have PlayStation Plus, hopefully you're like me, you just download everything or market to download because that's what I do. Um, so definitely worth checking out.

509
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,000
All right. Breakman says this game comes with a small bag of LSD. Uh, okay.

510
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:50,000
To register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at vog network.com use the passphrase mother.

511
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So my gaming week, I'll keep it short because honestly, pretty much all of my gaming time honestly has been on final fantasy 14 heavens word.

512
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I know again 14, but that's how MMOs are, but I really buckled down and pushed myself to finish the story this week.

513
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,000
So I got my astrology and all the way to level 60 and finish the story. Like got the credits in the story.

514
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Obviously I will not spoil anything. I'm not going to be a jerk. I'm just going to say that I was really, really impressed with some of the cinematics in the final chapter of the game.

515
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I don't know how else to say minute, but probably the final chapter of that expansion. I was, I was very impressed. One scene in particular, I'm trying to think how to describe this for people that have seen it, but without being spoilery.

516
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I will say it is when you are taking your airship to the new zone for the first time. That's that spoiler free, right?

517
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Uh, so that scene, I was like just the art direction in that scene, the way it was presented. I mean, and just an Epic moment in the game.

518
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I like it was a jaw hit floor kind of moment. I was like, Holy shit, this game is on fire. And like, it's not, it's not anything I've experienced in an MMO.

519
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:11,000
And I went on a whole little Twitter rant after that. Um, and I was just like, you guys, and I, I do believe this and I know a lot of you think I'm a fan boy for Final Fantasy 14.

520
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And well, yeah, I guess I probably am, but I think for good reason, because I really think this is the strongest Final Fantasy game since six. I think it's that good.

521
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I mean, I know MMOs are a weird place and it's got the monthly fee and yada yada, but if you can tolerate all that, I think that the story really is just the way it weaves everything in Final Fantasy lore together.

522
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Like there's, again, I don't want to spoil, but there's references that throw back to old Final Fantasy games that will like have you like flappy hands, like, you know, like maybe not for Loki, but maybe for me, definitely like,

523
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I just, I couldn't get into the Lord 14. That was one of the problems.

524
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Well, it wasn't, well, 1.0 was garbage anyway.

525
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It wasn't 1.0 was during the beta. I still can't, like it's just too much to follow.

526
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm not, I'm not going to lie. You have to be able to get up to about level 35 before it starts getting really good. And you know, for, for better or for worse, you know, that is one of the drawbacks.

527
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:19,000
If you can tolerate it that long, um, I think you get rewarded, but I understand, you know, it's still an MMO, which is going to turn some people off at the end of the day, but I just wow the story.

528
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:24,000
To be fair, I couldn't get into the lore in 11 either, but you know, at least it was fun.

529
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
11 was really hard.

530
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Yeah. So, uh, some folks in chat yelling at me, Brakeman says, there's an airship in the game. You've spoiled it for me. And Brakeman says, an airship in a Final Fantasy game? How dare they?

531
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And guess what? There's a CID too.

532
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And you know what? There's a chocobo.

533
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
So there's always a CID, there's always a chocobo and there's always an airship.

534
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
And my favorite people, the little shits.

535
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Is that, is that Lalafell translated?

536
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,000
No, that's the cabbage people. The, the silfs.

537
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Oh, the silfs.

538
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
As I call them, the little shits.

539
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Yes, yes. Love it.

540
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
And then the desert lizard hobos.

541
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Anyway, well you, you're just going to be surprised at how much stuff you're going to be like, that, oh my God, that's a, that's, I saw that in Final Fantasy.

542
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You know, there's just a lot of that. Anyway, uh, that's it. I'll stop fangirling and all that.

543
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Um, but I will say, uh, it also played a little bit of Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox One.

544
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Cause you know, that's kind of been still, still needing to get my use out of that new toy.

545
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So I justify that by trying to check in with that once in a while.

546
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Um, and that flash sales, what do they call it on Microsoft's deal of the week?

547
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
I don't know what the hell it's called, but they got a ton of games discounted right now.

548
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
So I was picking up Ori and the Blind Forest cause I've had that game recommended to me by multiple people.

549
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And there was another one I was going to pick up too.

550
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Did you get Sunset Overdrive?

551
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I don't think that one's on sale.

552
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It's by use. I'm sure it's probably cheap by now.

553
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Probably. I do want to get it. I do. I do want to get that.

554
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,000
But anyway, now that I finally beat Heavensward, cause like seriously, that took a lot of hours.

555
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So is there like, is there much of like an end game after that?

556
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Well, um, quickly, I will say there are some dungeons still that you run to get better, improved gear.

557
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And then they just opened up last week. So about two weeks after the expansion went live,

558
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
they opened up the first raid called Alexander, which is the raid.

559
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Which is also, you might recognize that name from Final Fantasy lore, but they've made it so that,

560
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
and this isn't really a spoiler cause it's publicly on the Final Fantasy site,

561
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
but Alexander is basically a giant fucking robot that you go inside.

562
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And so that's the raid. So the raid just opened up.

563
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So for a lot of the end game people, you have that.

564
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
If you're not into that, they have the EX Primals is what they call right now.

565
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
You can fight those, Bismarck and Ravana.

566
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:47,000
And then I think the way Final Fantasy usually patches, you'll probably see 3.1, probably in October.

567
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
And that'll probably bring more story and more dungeons.

568
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
What, no Ultima weapon or another weapon?

569
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
That wasn't, Ultima weapon was 2.0, Loki. Catch up.

570
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Ultima weapon's been done. We're done with that.

571
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I'm sorry. It's the Ultima weapon. It's supposed to be the strongest thing in the game.

572
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I would have thought they would have saved that, you know, or made it more powerful.

573
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
If you're able to defeat it at the beginning of the game, I mean, like that's kind of lame.

574
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
By the way, Rob, I need you to fight Ultras with me now.

575
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
I love that fight. I can. Cause it actually plays the Final Fantasy 6 battle music.

576
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Cause I want to do the chicken thing.

577
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
It's fun.

578
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
The chicken thing was Gilgamesh, which I've done.

579
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
But I want to do the, I want to do the Ultras battle now.

580
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Cause I can do it.

581
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Alright, we got to move on with more show, but yes, certainly.

582
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Let's see, going to a chat room. Dungeon Buster says, or sorry, AkumaJP says Ultima is so last gen.

583
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
YYR says it's all about Ultima 360 now.

584
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And then YYR says Sunset Overdrive is on sale on Amazon right now for 40 bucks.

585
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Oh no, 30 bucks? 30 bucks?

586
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Eh, that's still too expensive.

587
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Nah.

588
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
$19.99.

589
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I expect that'll be the normal price soon. Wow, okay. I didn't know that. I'll have to go check that out.

590
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I bet it's cheaper used.

591
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Alright, we'll see, we'll see.

592
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Alright, let's get into the other things that have been going on in gaming this week.

593
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Oh, quick housekeeping.

594
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I don't have a lot except for the fact that I have booked travel to Dragon Con.

595
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And I know Bobby's going to. Travis Donovan.

596
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I think Jon from Critical Myth is there this year too.

597
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I can't remember who all from the network is 100% confirmed for Dragon Con.

598
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I don't have anything to say about panels or anything like that yet.

599
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
We don't know.

600
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,000
But we'll be there and we'll be supporting all of that.

601
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So if you're going to be in the Atlanta area Labor Day weekend, come on down to Dragon Con.

602
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I love that show.

603
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,000
We're going to have a great time.

604
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Oh, I can say this.

605
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
I will be doing my first major cosplay at Dragon Con.

606
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I will.

607
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I'm going to be doing serious cosplay.

608
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Which, you know, I have, I've done like a little bit.

609
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Like Ron Malone me a costume one time, but I don't, like that was different.

610
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
This is like, no, I'm doing this me.

611
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
It's going to be my costume, except I will say this disclaimer.

612
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I am paying a girl locally to do it.

613
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
She's a, but I think I kind of feel like that's, it's not like I'm going to Party City and buying a costume in a bag.

614
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Like, you know, she's a hardworking, independent, seamstress type of thing.

615
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
She did a lot of the costumes for Rocky Horror.

616
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,000
They're between shows right now, so she could use the extra funds.

617
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So I was like, okay, hey, come on.

618
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I got an idea for you.

619
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I really want to do this cosplay, but I'm not, I don't know how to sew.

620
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Or if I did, it would look like a damn mess.

621
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Well, I appreciate you biting the bullet and dressing up as Tingle this year, so.

622
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Maybe, maybe. I didn't say what I'm doing.

623
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So maybe, you never know.

624
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I don't know.

625
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Dark Sakura, is that, am I violating cosplay rules if I, if I pay somebody else to do it?

626
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
No.

627
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Okay, just making sure.

628
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
I paid somebody else to sew mine.

629
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Okay, good.

630
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I made, now, however, I made all my props, styled my wig, and made, yeah, I actually did make all my props and style my wig.

631
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
It's just, I can't sew for beans.

632
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Yeah.

633
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And the one that I actually sewed from beginning to end, I had Evan helping me.

634
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Well, I'm going to take care of the camo pants.

635
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Oh, don't want to say too much.

636
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I knew it.

637
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
All right.

638
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I knew it.

639
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Well, combat Tingle will be very interesting.

640
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
So would it be that I've contributed to this costume?

641
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Yes, you have.

642
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Uh-huh.

643
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
All right.

644
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So Fifth Dream in chat says, honestly, if you can't figure it out by the time Dragon Con rolls around, I can't help you.

645
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Like, I just can't.

646
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Anyway, why, uh, sorry.

647
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, paying a girl locally to do it.

648
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
This is prostitution, Rob.

649
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Get your mind out of the gutter.

650
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
It's prostitution.

651
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Yeah, prostitution.

652
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It's puns.

653
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
That's why my wife loves me.

654
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Only, that's why we all love you, Loki.

655
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Maybe not in the same way your wife does, but only you can get us all to laugh on a week that's been kind of difficult.

656
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

657
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
There's been a lot of other stuff going on in the week leading up to the show.

658
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I brought up the whole Dragon Con thing because we will not be here live Labor Day weekend.

659
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
That was the whole reason I brought that up.

660
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:04,000
We will not be here live Labor Day weekend, which is September, fuck, I forgot the day.

661
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I think it's like September 8th because it's kind of late in the year this year.

662
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Anyway, we won't be here that week.

663
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Loki, let's get into some news.

664
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Alright, so of course, as everyone is well aware, the PC version of Batman Arkham Knight has been pulled.

665
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And Warner Brothers basically apologizing and committing themselves to quality.

666
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Basically, they're going back and looking at what they can do better to help make sure that this type of thing doesn't happen again.

667
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And they're quoted as saying, again, we would like to apologize to the fans and let you know they were taking full responsibility for releasing a product that did not meet our quality standards.

668
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Which is why we suspended sales of the game.

669
00:56:52,000 --> 00:57:01,000
As soon as we understood the issues, we can assure you that because of this latest launch, we are modifying the internal review process for all of our games.

670
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,000
For those who are waiting for the updated version of the game on PC, please know that we are working on this every day.

671
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,000
For the players who are continuing to play Batman Arkham Knight on PC, fixes are continually being made to the game.

672
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And we await your final, as we wait for the final updated version.

673
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And basically they're saying, you know, this is going to be coming out probably in the fall.

674
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:37,000
With that, our continued focus on getting the right PC fixes in place for the main game has had an impact on the development of all DLC content for the PC version of the game.

675
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:46,000
This means Batman Arkham Knight Batgirl, a matter of family DLC, will not be available on July 14th for those who are currently playing the PC version of the game.

676
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:53,000
We apologize for the delay and only want to make sure that any content we offer is up to the standards that PC players expect.

677
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And they're saying Batman Arkham Knight will be available on SteamOS, Linux, and Mac in fall of 2015 as well.

678
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Huh. So, do you think at this point anybody's going to care by the time they fix it?

679
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:23,000
You know, I think a lot of people probably won't care, and I'm sure some people still want to play it, but a lot of people by that time, there's going to be a lot of other games that have come out.

680
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Maybe we'll just kind of put Batman Arkham Knight on the back burner until a game of the year version comes out.

681
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yeah.

682
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
I can see that happening.

683
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Or, you know, by the time that it comes out, maybe a Steam sale and get that dirt cheap or something.

684
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I just think that, and it's fine, you know, so their sales suffer a little bit, it's a good lesson to learn then.

685
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Maybe they won't try this shit again, you know, so I'm hoping that it does set a good example.

686
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
And it sounds like that they're taking the right precautions.

687
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
They're at least saying stuff like that they're taking the right precautions.

688
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So, let's hope that this is something that they actually learned a lesson from, and we don't see a repeat of this in the future.

689
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Then again, there are some companies that say this kind of shit all the time, and the next release that comes out is the same old shit again, so we'll see.

690
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Alright, we'll see. Are we all going to be quick to forgive WB Games, or do you think PC owners will...

691
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Oh, I don't think we should be quick to forgive them. I mean, let them prove themselves.

692
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Why should we forgive them for this shit?

693
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:35,000
It's good that they did what they should have been doing, and being responsible and saying, ah, it was crap, we shouldn't have released it, but you did.

694
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:42,000
You chose to release it, you knew the state it was in, you just took a gamble on it, and unfortunately people, you know, didn't like it.

695
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
And now they have a way to get their money back.

696
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Make it worth the wait, right?

697
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Exactly.

698
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Alright, well, Dragon Quest, you know, Dragon Quest, they're getting those localized versions of 7 and 8, I'm sorry, they're not localized, that's a problem.

699
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:04,000
They're getting the versions of 7 and 8 over in Japan, but they're not being localized over here, at least not yet.

700
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And many people are asking for that to happen.

701
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Well, that could all hinge on the success of Dragon Quest Heroes.

702
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:28,000
That's right, the executive producer Yumiaki was interviewed this week and mentioned that if sales for Dragon Quest Heroes actually meet expectations, then they will be more confident in releasing more Dragon Quest titles in North America.

703
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:36,000
This is on the heels of when Dragon Quest producer Yuji Horii said that the Nintendo 3DS Dragon Quest titles are coming to France.

704
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
So, certainly, you know, that means it's being moved to at least another title.

705
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Further comments from Yumiaki who says, we want to get them out here, we really do.

706
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,000
The Dragon Quest games are very text-heavy, so the time and the cost it takes to localize these and do well is quite something.

707
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Business-wise, we have to think quite hard whether we'll make that money back from localizing to North America.

708
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It's always been a difficult decision, but the more you tell us, the louder the voices, the more likely we are to do it.

709
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Uh-oh, when he says the louder the voices, he's just inviting people to do a change.org petition, people.

710
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
That's what he wants. Go now.

711
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
I'm...

712
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Well, you alright?

713
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,000
No, it's just stupid. I mean, I understand the point, but I've heard this before.

714
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Hello, Konami. Let's support your games that come out, even if they weren't that great, because we want more Dance Dance Revolution games out.

715
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And in the end, they'll decide whether they want to fucking do it or not, regardless of sales.

716
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:39,000
It could meet its expectations, but, oh, it only met our expectations. It didn't sell great.

717
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I mean, it just sold what we thought it would sell.

718
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,000
You know what'll end up happening is if they just do something like this, that they'll just make it GameStop exclusive or something like that.

719
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:56,000
And, you know, it just won't come out every, you know, there'll be limited channels you can purchase that at.

720
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:04,000
I don't know. I just don't think that's gonna matter that much. But, hey, you know what? Maybe Heroes is gonna be a good game? Check it out.

721
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Yeah, I'll probably still check the game out anyway, because I just like a lot of Dragon Quest games anyway.

722
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Well, Heroes is supposed to be a little bit different, though, because it's like...

723
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Yeah, I know it's not gonna be like the others, but, you know, neither was Type 0. So, anyway.

724
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Now, speaking of Dragon Quest games that are very different.

725
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:33,000
In Famitsu magazine, which obviously is huge over in Japan, Square Enix did a new announcement in Famitsu that there is a new Dragon Quest game coming for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and Vita.

726
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:43,000
It's called Dragon Quest Builders. Now, here's the thing. You look at these screenshots of Dragon Quest Builders, that's fucking Minecraft with Dragon Quest characters.

727
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So, and it's called Builders. That's all we know. We don't know anything else at this time.

728
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It wouldn't be really surprising, though, considering, you know, everybody wants a piece of Minecraft in one way or the other.

729
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:06,000
We're seeing, you know, the LEGO game has the whole EverQuest has gone towards a Minecraft-esque sort of direction.

730
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So, I'm not totally surprised to see this. And I don't mind, as long as it's done well.

731
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I know, like, I seriously thought, you know, a LEGO game that was basically Minecraft would have been amazing, because everybody's like, you know, oh, Minecraft is basically like a LEGO game.

732
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Right.

733
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:32,000
And then I played it, I'm like, wow, this is not very good. So, it's like, I'd rather play Minecraft, actually, now that I had to deal with that.

734
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:43,000
So, I'm curious for more information. That's all we know right now. We don't have a lot on this otherwise, but more as we hear about it.

735
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Probably Tokyo Game Show, I'd imagine, is where this is going to be having more information at.

736
01:03:50,000 --> 01:04:02,000
We're going to get over to DarkSakura, but I want to just jump in here, because Zappi in chat, kind of following up with something we were talking about earlier with the news of Iwata's passing.

737
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I had mentioned, wait to see, because, you know, even Sony and Microsoft will probably do something, and apparently PlayStation account just put a tweet that says, thank you for everything, Mr. Iwata.

738
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
So, that's on the official PlayStation account there.

739
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And that will probably be the first of many, many, many gaming remembrances and so forth to come on throughout the week.

740
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:33,000
So, if we hear more stuff throughout the show, we'll keep you posted.

741
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,000
In the meantime, back to the rest of the news from the week. DarkSakura.

742
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Well, this is something I've been keeping on top of. While I'm not playing on console, I am very much into Dragon Age Inquisition.

743
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:54,000
And I have, actually my best friend plays on the Xbox 360, which the version is definitely scaled down.

744
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:04,000
But now BioWare has put out a word saying that all future DLC for Dragon Age Inquisition is only going to be on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

745
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:11,000
There is a save importer that's going to let you bring your stuff over, which I'll be talking about later.

746
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:22,000
But, pretty much, it's just that having to develop four or five different machines and two of them being, you know, ten years old or so.

747
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,000
It's just not really worthwhile anymore. The copies haven't sold as well as they had hoped.

748
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,000
So, basically, continuing support is only going to be for the current gen systems.

749
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Which, honestly, I was actually surprised that they released them on PS3 and Xbox 360.

750
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Yeah, I think a lot of us were. But, I mean, it was, I guess, kind of that bridge.

751
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:51,000
You know, last year's, I think this holiday you're going to see really not much on 360 and PlayStation 3.

752
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
But last year was probably still a bridge year in many ways.

753
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
But now, bridge is closed. Upgrade or get out.

754
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Well, and on top of that, though, just having done almost a side-by-side comparison between the 360 version.

755
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And I'll go ahead and say the PC version just because, you know, that's what I've been playing.

756
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
There's a universe of difference between them.

757
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to think of other games. Like, even Mass Effect.

758
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
You know, I played it on the 360 and I was satisfied.

759
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
But then you see it on the PC and you're just like, damn.

760
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Especially with, like, the high def text mode.

761
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
You take Grand Theft Auto V.

762
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Oh, yeah.

763
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I mean, Grand Theft Auto V looked great on, you know, PS3 and Xbox 360.

764
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
But then it looked even better on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

765
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
And then even better on PC.

766
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Mm-hmm.

767
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
All right, moving on, Loki.

768
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:55,000
So, kind of going back to the story that we were just talking about as far as Warner Brothers, you know, and maybe reevaluating, you know, the quality of their products before they release them.

769
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Hey, haven't heard anything about Mortal Kombat X for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

770
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Those were supposed to be coming out, I believe, in June.

771
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:10,000
But, yeah, right now they're TBA.

772
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
So, I guess they need more time.

773
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And, you know, basically their comment is we don't have any updates right now that we can provide comments on.

774
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
So, is it even going to happen at this point?

775
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I don't know.

776
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Like, who would buy it at this point?

777
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:32,000
It would be such a limited audience, I would think, unless they're going to put, like, the Game of the Year edition out on them or something.

778
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
But then it's like, God, you've got to pack even more stuff.

779
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:36,000
You're going to have a harder time fitting.

780
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,000
It could still be okay.

781
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I mean, I don't know. There's still a lot of people that still have Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

782
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And maybe have jumped into, you know, the new systems.

783
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I mean, you don't want to lose out on the audience.

784
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Yeah, I mean, I guess there's a potential audience.

785
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:02,000
You know, we have to remember that even though the people that probably listen to this show and certainly host this show,

786
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
we tend to be more on that cutting edge where we're adopting a lot of the newer consoles faster.

787
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
But there's a lot of people out there that are like, I can't get a PS4.

788
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Exactly. I don't have an Xbox One or Wii U yet. I mean, so, I don't know.

789
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:19,000
There's still a demand for the previous generation, which is more affordable.

790
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Because you could probably get a PS3 for, like, 99 bucks right now, right?

791
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Oh, probably even less than that.

792
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Yeah, I think that you could.

793
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I think, like, you can get a refurb 360 for 100 bucks with a few games to run in.

794
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
So, it's much, much more reasonable.

795
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Anyhow, moving on, a completely different note.

796
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Hideki Kamiya, his mouth sometimes gets him into trouble.

797
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
And, Lord knows, he has a lot of interesting things to say on Twitter.

798
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Some consider it to be an honor to be blocked by him on Twitter.

799
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Because he blocks a lot of people.

800
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:58,000
If you don't know who I'm talking about, he's the guy with Platinum Games and, you know, making a lot of the moves with Bayonet.

801
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Oh, God, Platinum's involved with everything these days, it seems like, right?

802
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Didn't they have, like, three things at E3 between, like, Transformers and Star Fox?

803
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
A Transformers game looks really good.

804
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Yeah, right? Well, what's interesting is that he made some interesting tweets this week where somebody had tweeted him asking him,

805
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
What are your thoughts on Mighty No. 9?

806
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And Hideki Kamiya said, It's like an insult to their old home.

807
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:30,000
And somebody followed up with that question, asking, Do you think that because it looks bad or because it looks too similar to Rockman?

808
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
And he followed up saying, Similar? It's a copy.

809
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:41,000
So, interesting. He's kind of calling out Mighty No. 9 for being so darn similar to Mega Man, which...

810
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Because it is! It is!

811
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,000
It is kind of the secret. It's the pink elephant in the room. It is...

812
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Inafune, moving on, because Capcom would make it, so he made it himself.

813
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:02,000
It's there in the groove. I mean, it's basically, you know, they changed enough of the game to make a Mega Man game without it being Mega Man.

814
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:09,000
And who can blame them? They wanted to make a Mega Man game. Capcom said, Fuck you, we don't want a Mega Man game, so what are you gonna do?

815
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
I mean, people want it. People were eating that up.

816
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:23,000
But the game you just referenced ended up getting into a little bit of legal issues. Do you think Capcom's just waiting for Mighty No. 9 to release?

817
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Well, here's the problem about that, though. See, this would be making the assumption that Capcom was releasing a bunch of Mega Man games by themselves.

818
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Well, they have the anniversary thing, whatever it's called.

819
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
No, no, no. That's just re-releasing shit. That's not the same.

820
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:47,000
It was supposed to be like Naoki going out there and making a new dancing game. Like, he left Konami, which...

821
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:54,000
He could very well be leaving Konami at any point, I mean, considering how Konami's been treating some of their top talent.

822
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:02,000
But, you know, it'd be like him going out there and making another dancing series. It was essentially DDR, but not DDR.

823
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:14,000
And that's what a lot of these guys have done. Inafune, the guy behind the Castlevania Kickstarter stuff, now Red Ash.

824
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:22,000
It's basically all these games that these companies did not want to gamble on that they really wanted to make, and now they're gonna make them.

825
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
And these companies are gonna lose out on it. So you don't take the gamble, you don't reap the reward.

826
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:35,000
You know, I'm getting a very popcorn.gif vibe from our chat room right now. Dungeon Buster says he's not wrong, and I backed 90 number 9.

827
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Let's see. Sjundermat says, I backed it because it looked like such a good copy of Mega Man.

828
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Dungeon Buster says, Kamiya has also said that Inafune is just a businessman.

829
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
ActDef says, Kamiya is a loudmouth and I love it.

830
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,000
YYR reminding us Konami had patents all over DDR, both on the software and the hardware.

831
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Yes, I'm aware. It's only a few more years before those patents expire too, so.

832
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Release the hounds!

833
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Yes, a few more years and we'll be making our own dancing games, yes!

834
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, anyone who didn't think it was a copy is silly. So, interesting.

835
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
The reaction is, fuck yeah, it's a copy and that's what we want!

836
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
Tell me, how much of it is a copy? I mean, it's a platform game that you fight, you're a robot that fights robots.

837
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,000
I mean, come on. And the gimmick is that you absorb the powers of the robots that you defeat.

838
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I mean, come on. That's just a platformer. I mean, there could be other platformers out there that have that same gimmick.

839
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:41,000
To me, it's kind of like, okay, so you know how Wes Craven was really big in the 80s for the slasher films like Nightmare on Elm Street, right?

840
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:51,000
What did he end up being big for like ten years after that? Scream. What was Scream? A parody of 80s slasher films, right?

841
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
So, I don't know. I know that's a really weird analogy, but that's kind of like what this feels like to me.

842
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:02,000
It's a very self-referential evolution of the game and that's okay.

843
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
It's just these companies, they just want to let these people go.

844
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:15,000
People that were responsible for big properties that brought them a lot of fame and a lot of attention to their company.

845
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:23,000
If they really just want to throw them aside because they think that they can re-release another game in a series, then this is what's going to happen.

846
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
You're going to get all these guys saying, well, fuck you. We don't need you as a publisher. We will publish our own shit.

847
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And we can. And they will. Or at least they'll find a publisher to publish their own shit.

848
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:39,000
SSG100Matt saying, celebs have made millions parodying themselves. Then we get into Scary Movie.

849
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
That's where like Lindsay Lohan and what's-his-name Charlie Sheen and all that showed up.

850
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Which Popcorn.gif, one of the best ones, is from Scary Movie with Brenda sitting on the couch with her popcorn.

851
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Let's see. Fifth Dream reminds us Scream has a TV show now. That's right. Oh my god, I forgot we were to that point.

852
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
That's what we've gone to. Wes Craven isn't involved, too.

853
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
But the same thing happened to Nightmare on Elm Street. Freddy's Nightmares.

854
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Right, that's right. I forgot about that.

855
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And don't forget, in the early 90s there was the Nightmare Cafe.

856
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Well then isn't there also like the Glee guy is doing Scream Queens or something like that?

857
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Which is another light on... I don't know. I know.

858
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:25,000
That's why I need Critical Myth because they keep track of all those shows.

859
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
But I don't even know if those shows would be something they even care about.

860
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:32,000
It doesn't matter because Ash vs. the Evil Dead is going to be coming out and it's so amazing.

861
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Who cares about anything else?

862
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on. We could talk about horror movies and television, but we have more stories.

863
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates.

864
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Well, this is actually something that I found on one of my favorite sites ever, which is Mental Floss.

865
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:58,000
They put out an article saying that there was a couple of experiments that were detailed in psychological science

866
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:06,000
where they walked participants through watching basically a lot of death and dying things that would cause some mental trauma.

867
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And then had them play Tetris after completing a task that was supposed to reactivate those memories.

868
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:21,000
And so the people who played Tetris actually reported fewer intrusive memories from the film after that.

869
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It's basically a follow up from a 2009 study where they proposed that playing Tetris could reduce PTSD flashbacks.

870
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Because basically it uses the same processing center in the brain that brings back and compresses all of those memories into just a flash of memories.

871
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:52,000
So basically the working memory that you use for Tetris is the same that is used to recall traumatic memories.

872
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:59,000
So by playing Tetris you're replacing that space. It's sort of like you're overwriting part of that data.

873
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Is it that... I mean, I don't want to... God, this might sound really tacky, so I apologize.

874
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:10,000
But is it kind of back in that whole... Have you ever heard that saying, like, idle hands are the devil's play type of thing?

875
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Playground.

876
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Yeah, that's it. That's it. Devil's playground?

877
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Yes.

878
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Is it kind of like that? Because by keeping your brain doing this thing, you're not able to think about that thing.

879
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Kind of like that? That's what it seems like.

880
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I guess, but also it's like it's actually reducing the capacity that the memory has to bring that up.

881
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:37,000
So after playing that, they've got a new series of memories in the place where those lived.

882
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:46,000
So it's very... I'm curious to see more about that. I'd like to see this actually done with people with PTSD.

883
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Which neither of these studies did, but it proposed an approach of the treatment for trauma.

884
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Break Man in our chat says, so once again, those evil video games are helping people.

885
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:05,000
So yeah, I like to hear these stories about like that video games, like positive impacts on the brain.

886
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:12,000
I mean, certainly with so many negative things out there to hear about, you know, the positive things is always such a nice break.

887
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
And like how they can help people, you know.

888
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,000
My question is whoever used Music C? I mean, seriously, that would cause me some trauma.

889
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:28,000
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some video games that are coming out in a store near you somewhere in the world.

890
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Starting in the US, Loki.

891
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Yeah, there's actually some stuff coming out this week unlike last week where there was literally nothing.

892
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:41,000
So this week we've got Godzilla coming out on PlayStation 4 from Bandai Namco Games.

893
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Deception 4, The Nightmare Princess on PlayStation 4.

894
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Also coming out, we've got EA Sports Rory McGlory PGA Tour.

895
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Yes, that's the new sports player PGA Tour game now that Tiger is no longer on the cover.

896
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,000
That is coming from EA on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

897
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Also, the God of War 3 remastered for PlayStation 4. Lots of PlayStation 4 games this week.

898
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And that's it.

899
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
All right, traveling over to Japan.

900
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Coming out this week in Japan on the PlayStation 4, Batman Arkham Knight gets its Japanese release on the 16th as well as the God of War 3 remaster.

901
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
And Godzilla Versus is what they're calling it in Japan for some reason.

902
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Just a slight name change, but that comes out in Japan all on the 16th.

903
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,000
On the Xbox One, you have Roy McGlory PGA Tour.

904
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Oh, I'm sorry, that's a Europe date. That's not on my Japanese list.

905
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
So there's actually nothing in Japan this week on the Xbox One.

906
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Weird that none of those games are getting Xbox One ports, but hmm.

907
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,000
On the Wii U this week, Yoshi's Woolly World finally makes its way out to Japan.

908
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
That is on July the 16th as well.

909
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And then looking at the Vita and the 3DS, the Vita has still a few games here.

910
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Sweet Clown goes in, Saiji no Okashi no Dokueshi comes out this week as well as a game called iDoll U.

911
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:18,000
I don't know if they're going to make a doll out of you or what that is, but it's called iDoll U.

912
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:25,000
And then lastly on the Nintendo 3DS this week, Dasutsu Adventure Zetsubo Yosai.

913
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
What are you laughing about over there?

914
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I was just thinking maybe it's like Aideru.

915
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
No, it looks... I don't know if it's...

916
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
That would be how iDoll would be pronounced.

917
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Yeah, no it's i and then like a doll, like a...

918
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Yeah, that's what I was thinking about the pronunciation.

919
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I don't know if this is based on an anime or what, but I know there's a girl in a kitty suit.

920
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Okay, that's all that matters.

921
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Yeah, that's all that matters. Must play.

922
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Japanese games.

923
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
It's a must play.

924
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Alright, and AkumaJP reminding us that Xbox One is not relevant here.

925
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,000
No, and I'm surprised that Microsoft really isn't trying to make a stronger play.

926
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Although I thought I heard that they did a changing of the guards over Xbox Japan to try and push that a little bit more.

927
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:13,000
But I guess maybe we'll hear Tokyo Game Show would be a big time for them to make a move if they're going to.

928
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
We'll see.

929
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

930
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
And the classic game of the week.

931
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Oh, I'm sorry. No, we didn't get to UK dates.

932
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
We got to do those first.

933
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Darzagra.

934
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Please.

935
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Okay, on the 15th we have The Vanishing of Ethan Carter on PlayStation 4.

936
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
For Mac and PC we have Luxlinger.

937
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,000
And on the 17th, The Deception 4, The Nightmare Princess on the Sony stuff.

938
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
And that's it.

939
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Alright, now we have a couple more stories.

940
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
And then the classic game of the week. Loki.

941
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:51,000
So there's some more rumored information coming out about the whole treatment of Kojima Productions from Konami.

942
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:59,000
And this time the source is actually the Japanese voice actor for Solid Snake and Big Boss, Akio Atsuka.

943
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:07,000
And basically this was translated from Gemetsu, an article on there.

944
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:10,000
But Kojima Productions was forced to disband.

945
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:20,000
But it appears that the work the team has been putting their utmost effort into is nearly complete.

946
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:26,000
And I'm not exaggerating when I say I expect it will become their greatest masterpiece.

947
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I couldn't help it.

948
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I just wanted to say, kept you waiting, huh?

949
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:36,000
But even if this is the end, Metal Gear Solid is immortal.

950
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:44,000
So based on that it sounds like that they may have actually wanted, or Kojima might have actually wanted to stay at Konami.

951
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,000
But they just were going to disband Kojima Productions for some reason.

952
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Huh.

953
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Instead of him actually wanting to leave the company.

954
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Wow.

955
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
They must not like money.

956
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I don't understand what the hell is going on there, but it's just...

957
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Maybe we'll hear something, I don't know if we'll hear something from Kojima after he leaves the company, but I don't know, we'll see.

958
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I'm sure we'll see a Kickstarter in no time.

959
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Oh, yeah.

960
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Tigerclaw says, at least Kojima can work on something original.

961
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Dar Tetsuya says, I did check out Ground Zeroes this week. Aside from not being sure where to go, I had some fun with it.

962
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
So, alright.

963
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Well, moving on.

964
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I mentioned earlier in the show, Comic-Con was this weekend.

965
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:30,000
And I know a lot of you guys pay attention to a lot of things that come out of Comic-Con.

966
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Some of the trailers and things.

967
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:39,000
But I know one big TV show that is having a presence at Comic-Con is Heroes Reborn.

968
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Because Heroes was a show on NBC a few years ago, and then it kind of went downhill in Season 2.

969
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
It never really recovered from the Rider's Strike.

970
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Some would argue, though, that Season 4, its last season, was probably as good as its first season.

971
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
But by then, a lot of people had checked out.

972
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Well, like a lot of TV shows seem to be doing these days, God, what else got rebooted?

973
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
I know The X-Files is coming back.

974
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
24 came back after a quick hiatus, right?

975
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Heroes is coming back in a new show called Heroes Reborn.

976
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
And why am I bringing this up on OLR, a video game show?

977
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Well, because they actually announced this week that Heroes Reborn Gemini will be coming out for consoles, PC, and Mac.

978
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
And Heroes Reborn Enigma will come out for smartphones and tablets.

979
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
And these games are based on Heroes Reborn, which will be coming out for NBC.

980
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Now, I remember when Heroes was first out, they had a big online presence that tied into comics that they would have online.

981
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
That would actually tie into the show itself.

982
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
And you would see characters that show up in the comics first that then would show up in the show. It was kind of interesting.

983
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:48,000
So they're talking about specifically the console, PC, Mac version, the Gemini Heroes Reborn.

984
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Expanding on the television story arc, Gemini is a first-person adventure game where players take on the role of Cassandra,

985
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:59,000
a young woman determined to solve the mysteries of her past while discovering her new powers.

986
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
And then Enigma is going to be a first-person puzzle game that will star Dahlia,

987
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
who is an evolved human with incredible powers while she's trying to get out of a government facility.

988
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:13,000
So, very interesting. A trailer supposedly came out today during the Heroes Reborn panel.

989
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Obviously, with all the news that came out, I got distracted, so I didn't get to see those trailers.

990
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:23,000
But, yeah. Kind of an interesting little tie-in there to a TV show.

991
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Anybody looking forward to the Heroes Reborn TV show? I think I'm going to give that a chance.

992
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I loved season one of the first show.

993
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:39,000
I tried to go back to Heroes to watch season four or three. I don't even remember which one I ended up quitting in.

994
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I think it was three. And I just had a hard time going back into it.

995
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Yeah, three was really, really hard to watch.

996
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:55,000
I think I may try again, but yeah. I don't know. I liked Peter Petrelli as a character, aside from him being a little whiny.

997
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Like, it had a really good pacing in the first season, but then it just kind of lost it, I guess.

998
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Second season went batshit crazy, and there were just characters that were just bad, you know?

999
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Like, they never really explained that girl who would cry, and then people would die.

1000
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Oh, God. She was the worst.

1001
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Right? Nobody liked her. And then they kind of wrote her off the show, except they didn't, like, I don't know.

1002
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,000
And then, like, her brother... I don't know. Anyway, I don't want to get into the whole thing.

1003
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
It was frustrating. Let's just say that.

1004
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Let's say YYR says,

1005
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
It will find a home on my DVR, aside the blacklist in Gotham.

1006
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
There you go.

1007
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
And S. Jonah and Matt saying as well,

1008
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
The Rider's Strike really hurt the show.

1009
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And then, Kaijuto says,

1010
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
It should be called Heroes Regurgitated.

1011
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,000
You know, they are... a lot of the season one characters, like, almost too many of them, are supposed to be coming back.

1012
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
So I'm a little worried about that, but we'll see.

1013
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
But none of the interesting ones are, though.

1014
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Yeah.

1015
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Is Allie Larder coming back? Please say no.

1016
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I don't think so.

1017
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I don't want her coming back.

1018
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
I don't think... Well, I think that was part of the problem with...

1019
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:02,000
In the... Originally, the series was supposed to be all new heroes every season.

1020
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,000
But because people liked the season one group too much, they kind of forced them into the story.

1021
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
They continued on. It just... It didn't really work.

1022
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I was fine with them continuing on the story.

1023
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:16,000
It's just, like, when she had how many clones or, like, she would, like, how many personalities?

1024
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It's just... It's ridiculous.

1025
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,000
No, and Brakeman says, I don't think Siler is coming back. I don't think so either.

1026
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I mean, granted...

1027
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
He's too big of a star now.

1028
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Yeah, you never know who's secretly signed, but I think the only people they've said are coming back are Hiro, who I think is...

1029
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
That he's fine. For him to come back is good.

1030
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
If Hiro comes back, that means we might get George Takei.

1031
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Which was the only scenes I ever watched of the show.

1032
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
That's right.

1033
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,000
But he's dead though in the show.

1034
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,000
George Takei?

1035
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Yeah, his character died, remember?

1036
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Oh, I don't remember that.

1037
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I only watched the show. I only watched the scenes with Hiro in it.

1038
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Well, anyway, and then the cop guy is coming back.

1039
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
What about Cheerleaderine?

1040
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
No, I don't think she's coming back.

1041
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,000
She's too big of a star now, and unfortunately, yeah, the guy that played Matt wasn't...

1042
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
He's been in, like, Big Ass Spider and, like, I think probably a Sharknado movie.

1043
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:11,000
The guy who plays Hiro, he's in Hawaii Five-0, I think.

1044
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
I think that's the show he's in now.

1045
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Brad says, the glasses guy, Mohinder, and the Petreli mom.

1046
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I don't know.

1047
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Mohinder's lame. I do like Noah. Yeah, he's pretty awesome.

1048
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
He was pretty much, like, a badass in that.

1049
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I kinda like... Just don't give him any powers.

1050
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
I liked how he was just, like, this guy with no powers, but it was just, like, it would kick ass.

1051
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
So, I was down with that.

1052
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Mohinder is just lame. He became, like, that weird, like, lizard guy.

1053
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Ando.

1054
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Ando. Yeah, didn't Ando end up getting power or something?

1055
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Yeah, he did.

1056
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I think so, yeah.

1057
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
He had the power to, like, basically amplify other people's powers.

1058
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
And then he learned how to use it as, like...

1059
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
You know who I really want to come back?

1060
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And I know this might come off as distasteful.

1061
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
It's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be respectful.

1062
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
Because I know she had some medical issues lately.

1063
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
But Michelle Nichols was...

1064
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
But she was in the Ally Larter storyline.

1065
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:07,000
She was their kid's grandma or something, right?

1066
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I just remember she was in that storyline.

1067
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I want to see her, because I want to see her make a full recovery

1068
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
and go back to gracing us with her presence on television again.

1069
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I probably should sit down and watch it, but I've had no desire to watch any of it

1070
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
because of reasons.

1071
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I understand.

1072
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,000
PowInChat says,

1073
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
The cheerleader comes back, but she's now 35 and an alcoholic.

1074
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
She should be cheerleader-ing anyway.

1075
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Alright, let's get to the classic game of the week.

1076
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Let's get to a simpler time.

1077
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
When Rider Strikes didn't ruin shows that had great potential.

1078
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
The classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault

1079
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
and find the game that she thinks,

1080
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Hey, you little brats, play this game this week because of reasons.

1081
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
And I do want to point out, you picked this far earlier today

1082
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
before the other news that came out.

1083
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
So it doesn't tie into that news, but we didn't have time.

1084
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I don't know why it would tie into that news.

1085
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Well, we didn't have time to change things.

1086
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
So anyway, Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1087
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Dig Dug.

1088
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Yes, I haven't done Dig Dug before, so I did Dig Dug.

1089
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
This is one of my all-time favorites.

1090
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
That's the best music.

1091
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Anyway, it came out in 1982 in Japan.

1092
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
It was put up by Namco and it ran on the Namco Galaga hardware,

1093
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,000
which, outside of Japan, it was published by Atari.

1094
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
So basically, really simple little game,

1095
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:37,000
but it has led to a few other kind of big franchises

1096
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:41,000
and actually has tie-ins with some other Namco franchises

1097
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
in ways that you might not think.

1098
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
So basically, in Dig Dug, you jump down

1099
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
and you have the Pookas and you have the Fygars.

1100
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
And the Pookas are the round red monsters

1101
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
and the Fygars are the dragons that breathe fire on you.

1102
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:02,000
So basically, you go around and you pump them full of air

1103
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
and they explode.

1104
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I mean, I'm sure we all saw that episode of Robot Chicken, right?

1105
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Somehow they explode without getting blood and guts everywhere.

1106
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
They're full of hot air, literally.

1107
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
They're full of hot air. That's it.

1108
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
And you can drop rocks on them.

1109
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I was actually super impressed with this particular playthrough

1110
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,000
because the guy lures three Pookas over

1111
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
and then drops a rock on all of them, and that's some mad skills.

1112
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:37,000
And then the very last enemy basically is going to travel through the dirt

1113
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
and try to get back to the surface and run away.

1114
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
And if he runs away, you don't get the points for it, of course.

1115
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:48,000
They turn into what's called ghost eyes as they travel through the dirt.

1116
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:54,000
So basically, depending on how you destroy them,

1117
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:59,000
you get double points for Fygars if you get them horizontally

1118
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,000
because they only blow fire horizontally.

1119
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And then you get even more points by dropping rocks on them.

1120
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And if they're killed by a rock, they get 1,000 points.

1121
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:13,000
And then after that, it's 1,500 and then 2,000.

1122
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Digging gives you points, too.

1123
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,000
So you get 10 points for each block that you dig.

1124
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,000
So you can actually dig out the whole level

1125
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
and get a bajillion points for it.

1126
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
There's an achievement for it on Xbox 360.

1127
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
It was a pain in the ass.

1128
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Pain in the ass.

1129
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
That was the name of the achievement, Pain in the Ass.

1130
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I don't think so, but that's what it was called in my heart.

1131
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
By the way, this is like, of all the retro arcade games,

1132
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:44,000
this is probably one of my very...

1133
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
I almost don't want to say my very favorite, but I think it might actually be.

1134
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
This is one, if I see it in an arcade,

1135
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
because it still shows up in arcades today.

1136
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
If I see it, I have to play it.

1137
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
And then I'm on it for a good, not to sound cocky,

1138
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
but I can get pretty far in it still on one quarter.

1139
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I need to get one of those plushie pookas that they put out.

1140
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Because you live in my cubicle.

1141
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I have a white Pac-Man ghost, though.

1142
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I won that out of a vending machine.

1143
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
A crane game.

1144
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Anyway, if you drop a rock on an enemy at the same time that they explode,

1145
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
there's a glitch in the game that causes all the enemies to disappear,

1146
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
but the game won't progress.

1147
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
You'll just keep digging.

1148
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
So you can't get to the next level, but you can dig.

1149
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Of course, the way that you resolve the glitch, though,

1150
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
is making a rock drop until there's no rocks left.

1151
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:45,000
You also can get a bonus item at the center of the screen that you can collect.

1152
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:49,000
So there are different fruits and vegetables, as well as the flagship from Galaxian.

1153
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
So that's pretty cool, too.

1154
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
And you get a bonus from the fruit or vegetable.

1155
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
It's 8,000 from the pineapple.

1156
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And here's a pro tip.

1157
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
That thing shows up in the center after you drop two rocks.

1158
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
That's what I said.

1159
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Oh, whoops.

1160
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Sorry, I was reading chat.

1161
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Okay.

1162
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:15,000
So they're also now, of course, in the original Namco version.

1163
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:23,000
The game ends on round 256, which is round 0, that gets you to a kill screen.

1164
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:29,000
The Atari version, however, basically bypasses the kill screen.

1165
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:35,000
It takes you to...

1166
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Hold on, I'm trying to find where it is.

1167
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Yeah, it actually is going to be game over at 256, regardless of what happens,

1168
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
with no official kill screen.

1169
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:50,000
The kill screen on the Namco version was a Pooka that was right on top of Dig Dug with no way to kill him.

1170
01:33:50,000 --> 01:34:00,000
So in 1996, we got the Namco Classics Volume 2 that had Dig Dug arrangement in it, which was two-player Dig Dug.

1171
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,000
But this one was still mostly not changed, except for adding the two-player aspect.

1172
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:16,000
It was re-released again along with regular Dig Dug and ten other Namco games on PS2, Xbox, and GameCube in Namco Museum.

1173
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:25,000
In that version, there were balls that were inspired by the Cosmo gang, The Puzzle, that can kill a lot of enemies in a row.

1174
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And then we've just had all kinds of different versions of it that came out, especially the Dig Dug arrangement.

1175
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Dig Dug Remix was from Namco Museum Battle Collection that came to iOS.

1176
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:45,000
It was like Dig Dug arrangement, but without the multiplayer.

1177
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:53,000
In 2005, there was Dig Dug for cell phones and Palm OS that was pretty much like the original,

1178
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
but the levels were based on the NES version of Dig Dug.

1179
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Of course, the levels go on past 500, there's no kill screen.

1180
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Now here's the part that goes with other Namco games.

1181
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:17,000
It was said, actually didn't even come out until later, much later, what the name of the protagonist of Dig Dug is.

1182
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:26,000
His name is not Dig Dug. His name is Hori Taizo, which, you know, being last name first Japanese.

1183
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,000
It also is a pun on Hori Taizo, which, I want to dig.

1184
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:39,000
So it'd be sort of like if we'd called him Will Dig, or Wanda Dig, Wanda Dig.

1185
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:47,000
So after, he's also a playable character in Mr. Driller Drill Spirits.

1186
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Because you know who Mr. Driller is?

1187
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
It's Dig Dug, no it's his kid.

1188
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
It's his kid?

1189
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Yeah.

1190
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
It's his kid.

1191
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
It's Dig Dug. Sorry, you're just going to offset the deal with it.

1192
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Because it's Dug. It's Dig Dug.

1193
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,000
No.

1194
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:10,000
So the character in Mr. Driller is, God I just had this a moment ago too.

1195
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Hori Susumu.

1196
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:22,000
So now his ex-wife, basically the Dig Dug character's ex-wife, is Kissy from Baradook.

1197
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I don't know if you ever played that game.

1198
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
It was sort of like Metroid before Metroid came out.

1199
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Down to the female protagonist and everything.

1200
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:36,000
So, Hori is called the hero of the Dig Dug incident in the Mr. Driller series.

1201
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:42,000
So those three games are all related through marriage and children.

1202
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Alright.

1203
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
So there were a bajillion versions that came out.

1204
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Yes.

1205
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Not just did we have our arcade ones, we had Atari 2600, 5200, which I have.

1206
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Atari 7800 Intellivision, Apple II, Atari 400, 800 PC, Commodore VIC-20, Commodore 64, IBM PC, Texas Instruments TI-99-4A, which I think I had the TI-99 one as well.

1207
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,000
There was the Famicom version, Game Boy.

1208
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:15,000
There was a plug and play system version that came with Galaxian, Pac-Man, Rally-X, and Bosconian.

1209
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
We had the version on Xbox Live Arcade.

1210
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
There was a Windows one for Namco Networks.

1211
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:28,000
They also had an advanced version that had the sprites from Dig Dug Digging Strike.

1212
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:34,000
There were, let's see, the Namco All-Stars Pac-Man and Dig Dug.

1213
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:39,000
There were the Wii Virtual Console ones, Dig Dug 2, which, okay.

1214
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Pac-Man's arcade party had it in there.

1215
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
The NES version on Virtual Console came back out.

1216
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Nintendo 3DS and Wii U had versions as well.

1217
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Gaken made a tabletop handheld version of Dig Dug that was one of three flip-top games with the VFD screen.

1218
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
It also came out with Jungler and Amadar.

1219
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
And it's been out on just about every version ever.

1220
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:10,000
And Dig Dug was listed the 6th most popular coin-op video game by the killer list of video games website.

1221
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,000
So...

1222
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
God, there were just...

1223
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
There were sequels as well.

1224
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Dig Dug 2...

1225
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Which is ass.

1226
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Yes.

1227
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Don't bother with Dig Dug 2.

1228
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Mr. Driller was conceived as Dig Dug 3.

1229
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Oh, I didn't know that.

1230
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Yeah.

1231
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
But it makes sense.

1232
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Yep.

1233
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
There was Dig Dug Digging Strike on Nintendo DS.

1234
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:36,000
There was a side play that combined the side play and overhead view that had a link to Mr. Driller.

1235
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,000
There was Dig Dug Deeper on PC.

1236
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Yeah, just all kinds of different versions that came out.

1237
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
And there's also a skin of it in Pac-Man Championship Edition Deluxe, which is awesome.

1238
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
There's a bootleg of Dig Dug called Zig Zag.

1239
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Pooka has been in other Namco games, including Pac-Man World.

1240
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Pooka was playable in Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness.

1241
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:07,000
And available as playable in Pac-Man World Rally, as well as Flygar.

1242
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Pooka was also in pole position on one of the roadside billboards.

1243
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,000
In Pac-Man World, he was one of the friends of Pac-Man that was kidnapped by Talk Man.

1244
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:23,000
He was also in R4 as the American Racing Team's Dig Dug Racing Team mascot.

1245
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
He was on the Phantomile track in R4 as well.

1246
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
R4 is like the best Ridge Racer game ever, by the way.

1247
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Yes, it is.

1248
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Yes.

1249
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
He was also in Ridge Racer 64.

1250
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Dig Dug and the Mr. Driller character Susumu were playable in Namco X Capcom.

1251
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
There was the Dig Dug robot chicken episode, President Evil.

1252
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Dig Dug, Pooka, and Flygar were in Wreck-It Ralph.

1253
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,000
And sold out A Three Evening with Kevin Smith.

1254
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Mario Kart Arcade GP, Pooka was a special character.

1255
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
A Nobinobi boy.

1256
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Players can sometimes play on maps with Dig Duggs and Pookas.

1257
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:15,000
In the fifth season of X-Files, there was a character playing Dig Dug on an episode.

1258
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Okay, this is getting obscure, but I can see it.

1259
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Wasn't Pooka also in point blank?

1260
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I thought it was one of the targets in point blank.

1261
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Fifth Dream in chat, and I'm sorry if you were going to get to this, JB.

1262
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, let's not forget that Namco dating sim.

1263
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
It had Dig Dug characters.

1264
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:38,000
In Death Battle, Bomberman fights the Dig Dug character for battle.

1265
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:45,000
And then Pookas are enemies in Smash Run mode in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS.

1266
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,000
That's it.

1267
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I'm done.

1268
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I'm done, Doug.

1269
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
I've dug that dig.

1270
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Alright, there it is.

1271
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Your classic game of the week.

1272
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
A true classic, Dig Dug.

1273
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Now my favorite version of Dig Dug is on the Playstation 3 because of reasons.

1274
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:03,000
That particular collection on the Playstation 3.

1275
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
That version is the best of all versions.

1276
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Because of reasons.

1277
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,000
But I have fond fond memories of the Commodore 64 version.

1278
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Which, you know, you know me.

1279
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Commodore 64.

1280
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,000
I mean, that game was everywhere when I was a kid.

1281
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Everywhere.

1282
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Every system.

1283
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:22,000
There's actually a good OC, Happy Hardcore remix.

1284
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Really?

1285
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
For the Dig Dug music.

1286
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
That's funny.

1287
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Alright, anyhow.

1288
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,000
We're gonna take a break, guys.

1289
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
When we come back, there's plenty more show to come.

1290
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
We're gonna have rapid fire news, of course.

1291
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:39,000
The FUGO Question of the Week, which is about the Heroes Reborn, kind of ties into that a little bit.

1292
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
And then, of course, more news.

1293
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Mailbag FUs and phone calls.

1294
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I know a lot of you have some stuff you want to say this week, so we'll get to all that.

1295
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
When we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1296
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this Sunday evening, July the 12th of 2015, with the 605th episode of our show.

1297
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:08,000
If you're just joining us live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, where we, of course, do tape our show every Sunday night.

1298
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Obviously, we were hit about an hour before the show went live tonight with the news that Satoru Iwata passed away suddenly over the weekend.

1299
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
And, obviously, we're all still reeling from that.

1300
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:26,000
And if you missed the beginning of the show, we spent a good 30 minutes at the top of the show kind of talking about it and our reactions and all that.

1301
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:29,000
But just, you know, this is all really unfolding as we are live.

1302
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:35,000
It is Monday morning in Japan right now, so, you know, they're hearing the news and processing and reacting.

1303
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,000
And, actually, I just saw in our chat room, Rama's in there tonight.

1304
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:44,000
In tribute, he's under one of his other handles, Black Luigi, if you've seen the man cosplay.

1305
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:49,000
But Rama's in chat saying that flags are at half-mast in Nintendo Japan.

1306
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:56,000
And actually links us to a Twitter picture where you can actually see Nintendo corporate headquarters in Japan and they are flying the flags at half-mast.

1307
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:05,000
So it's sad, but a great sign of respect, obviously, to a man that was very, very loved, I'm sure, at that company.

1308
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Anyhow, I'm sure we will have some callers on that issue later on in the show.

1309
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:16,000
But as I said earlier, the show goes on and there's a lot going on in the game industry that happened this week that we want to talk about.

1310
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
So let's get back into it with some rapid-fire news and some of the other news from this week.

1311
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Loki.

1312
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:27,000
This is great news. I'm pretty excited about this since I bought this game when it originally came out on PlayStation 3.

1313
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:37,000
But if you did buy Journey from that game company back on PlayStation 3, you'll be happy to know it's a cross-buy title.

1314
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:48,000
And if you did purchase it previously, you'll be able to play it for free on July 21st on your PlayStation 4 and enjoy all of its graphical upgrades.

1315
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Or you can buy it for the first time. And it is, I mean, that one game of the year for a reason.

1316
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
And by now, the twist of the game is out there so much, it's unfortunate.

1317
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
It's still a gorgeous game.

1318
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Yeah, it's still a gorgeous game and the fact that the whole online collaboration.

1319
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I can't imagine how much better it's going to look now.

1320
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:10,000
Yeah, yeah, seriously. I'm excited to play through it again.

1321
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Absolutely. So that'll be coming out on the 21st, so look forward to that.

1322
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Something that you can get a little sooner than that, if you have an account on Origin, remember, hey, they're still offering free games every now and then.

1323
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:30,000
This time, it's Zuma's Revenge. So go pick that up. It's absolutely free for a limited time on EA's On the House program.

1324
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Xtafer, my buddy from the show Hoard House, loved Zuma, so I'll have to make sure he knows about this.

1325
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,000
I played the crap out of it, too.

1326
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
He can get addicted all over to it again.

1327
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
It's frustratingly hard sometimes.

1328
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:50,000
And then, last but not least, there's a karaoke game coming out. I know, that's crazy.

1329
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I mean, this hasn't been a new karaoke game in quite a while.

1330
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
I'm a SingStar.

1331
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Well, yeah, but everything's kind of going the route of the whole service thing, where even Just Dance, where you just buy it and you have access to a library of songs.

1332
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Now, though, they're kind of bringing out one with a really unique title. It's called That's What I Call Sing, which doesn't make any sense.

1333
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:24,000
It's pretty incorrect as far as grammar goes, but it is going to be coming out later on this year.

1334
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:32,000
It has quite a few Top 40 songs that are in there that I recognize occasionally when I listen to the radio in my wife's car.

1335
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Who's making it?

1336
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
I have no idea, to be honest.

1337
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:42,000
But it is coming out on October 21st, or the 23rd.

1338
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,000
October 23rd, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1339
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:52,000
And it has such wonderful songs, including Uptown Funk from Bruno Mars.

1340
01:45:52,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I saw Applause from Lady Gaga, Royals by Lorde, Moves Like Jagger. You know, pretty much all the Top 40 shit right now.

1341
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Rama in chat says it's a play on That's What I Call Music. They have that popular CD series, the Now That's What I Call Music.

1342
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,000
They call it That's What I Call Singing, or That's What I Call Karaoke, or something like that.

1343
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
And so, That's What I Call Sing.

1344
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:24,000
I did see a hilarious, like, someone posted a picture of that, and then they posted a picture of, was it, like, the prison? Sing? You know?

1345
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I just thought of it this way.

1346
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Alright. Well, I don't know. I have Sing Star Abba and Sing Star Queen. I don't need any other karaoke games.

1347
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Done. That's it. Done. That's all I need in life, those two games.

1348
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Meanwhile, though, some other stuff to put on your radar this week. A new crowdfunding campaign for a kids' gaming magazine.

1349
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Is it Highlights?

1350
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:53,000
No, it's not Highlights for Kids. Well, you know how we had Retro Magazine, you know, which was a little more for adults.

1351
01:46:53,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Well, now, a former senior editor and art director for Electronic Gaming Monthly, Martin Alessi, has started a crowdfunding campaign for Little Player,

1352
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:09,000
a bimonthly magazine that's aimed towards kids 7 to 12. It's only going to cover games rated E, C, E, and E10,

1353
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:15,000
and it's supposed to be a safe, fun, ad-free reading experience for young readers by going to Kickstarter.

1354
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:21,000
So you can check that out on Kickstarter. Just search for Little Player, because it's kind of hard for me to give out links.

1355
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:29,000
But, yeah, that's pretty cool. So you can check that out. The Kickstarter will end on August 7th at 10 p.m. Central Time.

1356
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:34,000
So, I loved having Nintendo, you know, I mentioned earlier in the show, we were reflecting on memories.

1357
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Nintendo Power was such a huge part of my childhood, like, I'm excited that maybe other kids can have that too.

1358
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:48,000
And, you know, it's good all around, because it encourages them to read, but they're reading about something they, you know, really enjoy, which are games.

1359
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:55,000
And this little, like, prototype they have there, you know, demonstrates, like, Yoshi's Woolly World, which would be a great example of a game that might be highlighted for kids.

1360
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:56,000
It's not very woolly in that picture.

1361
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Well, no.

1362
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
That's false advertising or anything.

1363
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
It's a mock-up, Loki. Calm down.

1364
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
It's a terrible mock-up.

1365
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,000
They're not going to put Mortal Kombat X on the cover. All right, anyhow.

1366
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
What if it's E-rated, though?

1367
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:12,000
It's Mortal Kombat X, the friendship edition.

1368
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Moving on. A franchise that we've been following for a very long time here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1369
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:27,000
BeatMania 2DX is location testing its newest version. Do you know what number they're up to in 2DX games?

1370
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
20 billion-y.

1371
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Close.

1372
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,000
26?

1373
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,000
A little high. A little high on that. This is going to be number...

1374
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
24?

1375
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:45,000
23. It's BeatMania 2DX 23. It's called Copula is the name of it. It's kind of a yellow, yellowish interface. It looks like P.Pula.

1376
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Every time I see Copula, I think either Count Dracula, like if you were to...

1377
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:52,000
If he was a cop.

1378
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Or Count Chocula. Or Capoeira.

1379
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Copulate.

1380
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Copulate.

1381
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Not like that one.

1382
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Or Francis Ford Copulate.

1383
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I can totally see it as a strange, you know, fish-out-of-water cop drama starring Dracula as a beat cop, you know.

1384
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Copula.

1385
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:18,000
He's just an ordinary vampire. He doesn't understand the, you know, the world.

1386
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Oh my god. Brakeman says, Copula, vampire cop coming to theaters near you.

1387
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I would totally watch that. That's like such an 80s...

1388
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Cop dog.

1389
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
BeatMania 2DX cop dog.

1390
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:42,000
For the record, a copula is a connecting word, in particular a form of the verb be connecting a subject and complement.

1391
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:49,000
And there's a torpedo that just shot and exploded the whole conversation.

1392
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Darktichy in chat says, the logo is supposed to represent like a bullet train.

1393
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:57,000
And it's supposed to be like trains is the theme in the game, which would make sense.

1394
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
You know, they really, really love trains over in Japan.

1395
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,000
They had a whole bunch of Power Rangers that were trains. I know this because...

1396
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Why can't they just call it BeatMania 23 choo-choo, motherfucker?

1397
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Alright, look. BeatMania 2DX 23 copulate.

1398
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Some new things coming in the game.

1399
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:22,000
There's a new gauge option, assisted easy, that will reduce the clear border from 80% to 60%.

1400
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Beginner gets its own folder. Movie previews are now available in the song UI.

1401
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Because I don't, you know, I'm so far removed from 2DX news these days.

1402
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:37,000
But when I was playing that machine that was at Scandia, they had some hilarious videos.

1403
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Also for the record, a copula is also a type of musical term.

1404
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Meaning it's the texture of certain sounds.

1405
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Really?

1406
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
So in this case, and I'm just going to quote from here.

1407
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,000
It can be thought of as the linking of notes together to form a melody.

1408
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Ah, so it's that same definition but in regards to music.

1409
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Okay, I still like copulate.

1410
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
For the record, the word is, is a copula.

1411
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
The sky is blue.

1412
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Alright.

1413
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I is bored.

1414
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I am bored.

1415
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Alright, no seriously, I'll charge also in the game.

1416
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
It's a new type of charge.

1417
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:26,000
No, it raises your gauge as you hold it, but it will reduce your gauge if you aren't holding down on it.

1418
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
So you must press the button.

1419
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Was that a copula?

1420
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
No.

1421
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Oh, well damn.

1422
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
But saying that it is a thing, that was a copula.

1423
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Okay, so you need to do the thing.

1424
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
That's not a copula.

1425
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Damn it.

1426
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
It's a link of description.

1427
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I will point out that one of the songs in the game is called Long Train Runnin'.

1428
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
And I don't know if that's related to the DDR song.

1429
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
I can only hope it is.

1430
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
I hope it is.

1431
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,000
But I love that, so that is one of the songs there.

1432
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:00,000
And then, maybe this is a copula, there's a song called Do The Thing.

1433
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Does it mention who the artist is on Long Train Run?

1434
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Yes, it is DJ M.A.S.S. M.A.D. L.Z.M.

1435
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:11,000
It's called Part 2 and it's in the genre Broken Samba Breaks.

1436
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Well, that's... yeah.

1437
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
That's something, I guess.

1438
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
OkumaJP in chat says, Me can has burger?

1439
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
That is not a copula.

1440
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,000
How did we ever fill three hours of show talking about nothing but music games?

1441
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,000
How did we do it?

1442
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I don't know.

1443
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
There was more news about music games.

1444
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:33,000
No, I'm just saying it's rapid fire news and we've talked for five minutes

1445
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
making fun of the name of BeatMania 2DX23.

1446
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:41,000
For the record, that is rapid fire news, is is a copula.

1447
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
How about if I say fuck right off?

1448
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Is right a copula?

1449
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
No.

1450
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:56,000
But saying fuck is a word, is would be a copula.

1451
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Ah, ok.

1452
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
I am irritated.

1453
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Ok, well I is reading the next story.

1454
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
You are using bad grammar.

1455
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Which is about Sega.

1456
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:19,000
So Sega is admitting that maybe they've made some mistakes in the past.

1457
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I like how they're still...

1458
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:26,000
The whole night now, every time a copula, we're just going to have to emphasize it.

1459
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Well, I like how they're admitting that we may have made a mistake instead of like,

1460
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
yes, we made a mistake.

1461
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Why can't, why is there always going to be some doubt?

1462
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Like, let's just leave it open to, we didn't do anything wrong.

1463
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Anyhow, so here's the thing.

1464
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,000
It's an interview with Hajime Satomi, who's of course the head of Sega

1465
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:51,000
and talked about the reputation the company's had over the past ten years

1466
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,000
and even saying that maybe they've led fans astray a little bit.

1467
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:01,000
But noting that acquiring Atlas in 2013 helped Sega understand its situation.

1468
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:02,000
In a quote saying,

1469
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
As far as the Western market goes, we learned a lot from Atlas.

1470
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
If we can make a title with proper quality,

1471
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I believe there's a good chance for it to do well even in the West

1472
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
for players that like to play Japanese games.

1473
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Sega in the 1990s was known for its brand,

1474
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,000
but after that we've lost trust and we were left with nothing but reputation.

1475
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,000
For this week's reason, we'd like to win back the customer's trust

1476
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
and become a brand once again.

1477
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:27,000
So it's always nice to hear when people own up to mistakes,

1478
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:32,000
such as the 2006 version of Sonic the Hedgehog, but, you know.

1479
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
And every other, you know, since then.

1480
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Or Sonic the Hedgehog 4, or, you know.

1481
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Well, the Wii U one was not bad at all.

1482
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
Or Generations was pretty good too.

1483
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
So, anyway.

1484
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Part of Generations.

1485
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Anyway, there you go.

1486
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
That's all I have for rapid fire news.

1487
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Dar Sakura.

1488
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Well, I mentioned a little bit of this earlier

1489
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:01,000
about there being a save importer for Dragon Age Inquisition.

1490
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Basically you can import your game from the PS3 version to the PS4 version,

1491
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,000
or from the Xbox 360 version to Xbox One.

1492
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,000
And there are instructions for this on the actual DragonAge.com website.

1493
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:19,000
So go check it out for those who are interested in doing the upgrade.

1494
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Also, there are a bunch of games heading over to Steam.

1495
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Some PS1 games.

1496
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Among them, Battle Arena Toshinden 2.

1497
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:33,000
And looks like Nitrous Oxide.

1498
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Trying to look over here.

1499
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Yep, that's the game that had Crystal Method stuff in it.

1500
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Buggy.

1501
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
And Tatunoko Fight.

1502
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Which I am looking forward to.

1503
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
So, also, and this makes me kind of happy,

1504
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Tekken 7 is going to certain arcades this month for testing after EVO.

1505
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Basically it is going to be at a bunch of different Dave and Busters,

1506
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,000
including the Milpitas one.

1507
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Oh nice.

1508
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
We need to go there.

1509
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
But what about the one over here?

1510
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I'm looking at the list.

1511
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
You mean the tiniest Dave and Busters in the galaxy?

1512
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I don't care.

1513
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
You mean Dave and Buster's Closet?

1514
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
It's more like Dave's Closet. It's the Dave.

1515
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Dave and Busters.

1516
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
It's just Dave.

1517
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:26,000
But yeah, it's coming to Dave and Busters New York on 42nd Street.

1518
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Dave and Busters Dallas on North Central Expressway.

1519
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:33,000
The Milpitas location at the Great Mall Drive.

1520
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Which I need to go shopping, so it can be a combo day.

1521
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Tekken and underwear.

1522
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:41,000
It's coming to round one, Puente Hills Mall in City of Industry.

1523
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Round one, South Center Mall in Tequila, Washington.

1524
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
That sounds like tequila. I want some.

1525
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
And round one, Stratford Mall in Bloomingdale, Illinois.

1526
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Rama's saying it's already at the Dave and Busters in Times Square.

1527
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
So get to it.

1528
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
We are going to have to take a trip to Milpitas.

1529
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Sounds good.

1530
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
That's it.

1531
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Alright, then let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

1532
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

1533
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Which, of course, you can access our Facebook at facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

1534
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:19,000
And we're on Google Plus at google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

1535
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:24,000
This week, since I posted the question much earlier in the day, it was about Comic-Con.

1536
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
And with Comic-Con, of course, we heard about Heroes of the Week.

1537
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
And we had a lot of fun.

1538
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:34,000
So we thought we'd ask, what television show would you like to see made into a game?

1539
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:38,000
And maybe even, if you can keep it short, tell us a little bit about what the game would be like.

1540
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Like, how would it play and so forth.

1541
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
So let's start on Google Plus tonight.

1542
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Because Google Plus never seems to get enough love anymore.

1543
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:48,000
So over on Google Plus, we'll start with Redertainment who says,

1544
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:52,000
a game based on the Australian TV series Danger 5.

1545
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I'm thinking something like that.

1546
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I'm thinking something like that.

1547
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:59,000
It's Australian TV series Danger 5.

1548
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I'm thinking something like Carmen Sandiego.

1549
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,000
You're given a mission by an obnoxious eagle or person.

1550
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:11,000
And your objective is to travel the world hunting various high figures in Germany's Nazi party and kill Hitler.

1551
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:17,000
So that's half the plot of that movie you've been obsessed with lately.

1552
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
What's that? Kung Fury. Thank you.

1553
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Yeah, but Danger 5 gets really strange.

1554
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Like, second season's really odd.

1555
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
It's like the whole 80s thing.

1556
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Prince Peach Fuzz over on Google Plus says,

1557
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I'd love an archer game with some GoldenEye 64-type multiplayer.

1558
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,000
This answer's already my favorite and I haven't even read them all.

1559
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:44,000
The plot would consist of a search for an old taunt treasure with many drinking games and Dr. Krieger experiments.

1560
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
I love this idea.

1561
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,000
And it needs to be done by the people to do the South Park games.

1562
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,000
To keep that humor intact, I think.

1563
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:57,000
ActDef says, I don't think I want a TV show being turned into a game.

1564
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
A lot of games have been adapted from TV shows tend to suck. Really suck.

1565
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Although cartoons and the animated shows are a whole other story.

1566
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Usually because of the liberties they have with them.

1567
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Well, what about game shows?

1568
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I guess it's a whole other type of thing.

1569
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
A lot of people don't really consider them TV shows, but I don't know.

1570
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Tekashi's Castle.

1571
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Didn't they have a game for that?

1572
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
They didn't. Well, they sort of did.

1573
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:25,000
But I would want Tekashi's Castle, but not in the sense that you would think.

1574
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Not actually playing the game, I would just want to make the obstacle courses for the people to get injured in.

1575
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:36,000
And then I'd want to have that playback and I could watch Sims or whatever run through it and hurt themselves.

1576
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
And that'd be hilarious.

1577
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Breakman in chat says, 1 versus 100. Too soon, you dick.

1578
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
Alright, anyway.

1579
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Most was the extreme elimination challenge. The dubbed version of that was hilarious.

1580
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Over on Facebook, some answers.

1581
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Tech 2030 says, Alias needs to be brought back to TV and they could release a 2D Mark of the Ninja style stealth game to go with it.

1582
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Silent Tom says, I'd love to see a properly made Team Titans game.

1583
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,000
It wouldn't be a stretch to use the Arkham Knight engine because they're technically in the same universe.

1584
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Critical Myth says, most of the first things that come to mind are already getting great adaptations via Telltale.

1585
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Would love to see what they could do with something like Doctor Who.

1586
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,000
I would love to see Star Trek pull together a Mass Effect level action RPG.

1587
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Oh god. I'm not worthy of such an amazing game if they could make something like that.

1588
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,000
You know what would be hilarious?

1589
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Huh?

1590
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
It's like Nick Arcade using like, you know, like the Playstation camera or something like that.

1591
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Hey, 90s nostalgia is real. Like, I think something like that could do like really fucking good.

1592
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:39,000
You play the games and stuff and then you have to do the actual, like, challenges where it's against a green screen type thing.

1593
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Yeah.

1594
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:48,000
William Murderface says, I would love to see an XCOM style Agents of Sealed game with some intelligence collecting segments similar to those in Batman Arkham Origins.

1595
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Also, an Arrow game like the Arkham games.

1596
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Brad, our buddy from Pod Culture says, I'm pretty lucky.

1597
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,000
As a geek, most of the shows I like already do have a game of some sort.

1598
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Star Trek, Doctor Who, The Walking Dead.

1599
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
They all had games. Some better than others.

1600
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,000
But if I had to pick a single show, it would have to be Arrow.

1601
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
It could easily use the Batman Arkham Knight engine.

1602
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
It could pull in heroes and villains from other DC TV properties.

1603
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl.

1604
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Haseo Sumeruagawa says, Arrow.

1605
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
It could be translated into a series well or even like a Telltale game.

1606
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Zether says, Red Dwarf.

1607
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I think it could work as an adventure game like the inventory based Telltale or LucasArts games.

1608
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Asserping Slurpee says, movie and TV show and pirate games tend to be quite bad so I'll steer clear of them.

1609
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
But I wouldn't mind a game set in the Firefly universe.

1610
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
It could play like Dragon Age Inquisition.

1611
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
You wouldn't play as the crew of Serenity.

1612
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,000
The player would have to procure and upgrade his own spaceship and hire a crew.

1613
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,000
A diverse crew of characters would be optimal as opposed to a crew of all Jane type people.

1614
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Though I would experiment with a crew of all companions.

1615
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Fahrenheit, Fire, oh I'm sorry, Russell.

1616
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:54,000
I don't know if that's, I think Fahrenheit is the nickname.

1617
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Fahrenheit says, Firefly for a game.

1618
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:02,000
The character Malcolm Reynolds could easily fit in a Telltale game where player choices are made.

1619
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Fifth Dream says, I would love a Penny Dreadful Telltale game.

1620
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Or how about a Big Brother game?

1621
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:14,000
It would be a lot like The Sims but more adonimous.

1622
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I can't read that word.

1623
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Anonymous?

1624
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
No, not anonymous.

1625
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Autonimous?

1626
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Autonimous?

1627
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:20,000
I'm failing.

1628
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Until you played competitions.

1629
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:26,000
And if The Sims starts getting annoying you could just vote it out of the house.

1630
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Nemesis 47 says, Doctor Who.

1631
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:34,000
I know it's been done before but the series deserves a good console game than a ho-hum puzzle game on the Vita.

1632
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Or a rushed game just to make a few million in the franchise.

1633
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,000
If BBC can get the right people and a good idea for the game it can be amazing.

1634
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:46,000
And ER says, a lot of my favorite anime shows do get games so I just wish some of them would get translated.

1635
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I can second the call for Firefly though, I'd love a game set in that universe.

1636
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:54,000
And then Justin H says, I would love to see a funny Batman game like the original TV series.

1637
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I totally am down with that.

1638
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
I would love that too.

1639
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:07,000
I still think that they should bring back a series that's basically the old Batman and Robin and the old Batman villains but set in modern day.

1640
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:14,000
But not necessarily Batman, it's just these old villains or whatever that have no clue of modern society but they're doing everything the old way.

1641
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Like, oh we're going to do something, we're going to rob this bank or something and it's just ridiculous.

1642
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I would love to see that.

1643
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
That's a great idea for a game.

1644
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Let me go around here in studio quickly because that's all the answers we got.

1645
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:33,000
In studio quickly, what do you guys think should become a video game from television, if anything?

1646
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:41,000
From television, I would say maybe like, I don't know, I've already mentioned a few.

1647
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
God, what series are we really?

1648
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Monty Python, how about a Monty Python Holy Grail or a Monty Python turn-based RPG game?

1649
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
There have been Monty Python games.

1650
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
It was a long time ago.

1651
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
It was a complete waste of time.

1652
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
It's been a while though.

1653
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
It's time for an upgrade.

1654
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
That's probably a terrible idea.

1655
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:07,000
How about, let's get a game based off of Conan O'Brien.

1656
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,000
That could be pretty strange.

1657
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Well my answer is easy and I'm very disappointed in all of the listeners for nobody naming this but clearly the show that needs to be a video game is RuPaul's Drag Race.

1658
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:23,000
Hello. Hello.

1659
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:26,000
And yes, I know there's Dragopolis on iPhone. That doesn't count.

1660
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
It's not directly tied to the show. It just has a lot of the same people.

1661
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Darsagra.

1662
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I really can't think but instead I would like a video game to be made into a TV show and that would be The Adventures of Fem Shep and Garrus.

1663
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Fair enough. Taking the question and making it her own.

1664
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
I will flip it around.

1665
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Let's see. Tigerclaw says RuPaul's Drag Race would be a great kart racing game.

1666
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Bob Coffee says RuPaul's Drag Race would be the Mario Kart clone we didn't need but the one we deserve.

1667
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Good luck and don't fuck it up.

1668
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Come on. You know we need a video game with that.

1669
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
You know we need a video game where RuPaul comes on the screen and says,

1670
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:11,000
The time has come for you to lip sync for your life, life, life, life.

1671
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:16,000
And then we have cameras and shit. Can't cameras read lips in this day and age?

1672
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Can't the camera know if I'm lip syncing in my living room? Don't they know?

1673
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Yes, they can technically read lips.

1674
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Yeah, so I don't know.

1675
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
I don't know how accurate it is.

1676
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Anyway. Alright, let's move on. We got some more news for you guys before we get to calls. Loki.

1677
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I don't know.

1678
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Akuma JP says, The Real Housewives. It would be the slap on the face game.

1679
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:45,000
The Real Housewives of Atlanta as a video game.

1680
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
I said what I said.

1681
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Back to news. I'm sorry. That comment was too good for me to pass up though.

1682
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:01,000
So this is kind of a little interesting. Hitman, you know the new reboot or I don't know what they're calling it.

1683
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I guess it's a reboot, relaunch of the franchise.

1684
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:11,000
That's supposed to be coming out later this year actually as a digital download which is kind of strange.

1685
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:17,000
So December 8th, they're going to launch it as a download on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1686
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:21,000
But it's not the full game. It's just a part of it.

1687
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:27,000
And then throughout 2016, they're going to be releasing more and more of the game until the story arc is done and finished.

1688
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Of course, all of that content is going to be included within the asking price of $60.

1689
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,000
But if you wait for the disc, you get that all together.

1690
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:41,000
It's kind of interesting. I wonder, is this supposed to be one of the first games that uses that early access thing or something?

1691
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Where they just kind of put the game out as it's being made?

1692
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:49,000
It's also a very interesting way to get around the used game issue.

1693
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Because if you're getting all these people buying it digitally so that they can get it early, then you don't have to worry about those used games floating around.

1694
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And those discs can be full priced.

1695
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:03,000
I wonder if this isn't going to be a trend. I think that's why this is noteworthy.

1696
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Are we going to see more digital releases before disc releases?

1697
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Now granted, this puts the company in a bit of hot water with traditional retailers.

1698
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:21,000
But are they using the old excuse where, well, then we can skip the disc printing?

1699
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Unlike early access games, this will always be a polished Hitman experience.

1700
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:35,000
We think the word episodic sets up expectations that we will sell individual content drops for individual prices.

1701
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
But that's not something we're planning on doing.

1702
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:43,000
That said, there are some episodic elements to the story in the sense that it's delivered in chunks over time.

1703
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
So experiencing the story will probably feel episodic.

1704
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:55,000
But there's also a ton of other content, including live events, which will have nothing to do with the story but will be improving and changing the game constantly while you're playing it.

1705
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
I think it's just a way for them to get the money quicker.

1706
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:07,000
And at the same time, if you buy it digitally, you can't have the reviews based on the game because the game's not going to be done yet.

1707
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:15,000
So it could be terrible and then people would still be buying it because it may be better later and they could always patch it to be better.

1708
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:23,000
It's kind of like what they're doing now with content being broken and stuff, except they're saying it's not going to be broken. It's just not done yet.

1709
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Just release it when it's done.

1710
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Brakeman says, I like this, but I don't like this. There's some good things about this, but some bad things.

1711
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,000
It's harder to ensure quality when you release a game like this.

1712
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Kaijuto in chat says, it's called Sucker Access. This sounds fucking stupid. Won't buy it.

1713
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Pow in chat says, well, we're already getting unfinished games. Cough, Assassin's Creed, cough. And I would add to that, cough, Batman on PC, cough.

1714
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:53,000
So, hey, now we're just making it official.

1715
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:59,000
SHO 100 Matt points out, EA Sports does early access for their sports titles like a week or so early.

1716
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
That you even have to pay for, so that's kind of lame.

1717
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Yeah, I never saw the need for it, but then again, we're starting to head towards a strictly digital purchase landscape for consoles.

1718
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Well, I guess one of the perks to buying digitally is that you get games in your digital library that can last for years and years,

1719
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:25,000
as I'm finding with my Xbox 360 library and what is showing up on my Xbox One for backwards compatibility.

1720
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Well, some more notes out on backwards compatibility for the Xbox One this week.

1721
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:35,000
And one of those is a form of an approval of sorts from Ubisoft's CEO,

1722
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Yves Guillemot, who says that the Xbox One's backwards compatibility feature is very good news for the industry.

1723
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:50,000
It will help some of the brands like Splinter Cell for us come to the Xbox One, which is great.

1724
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:57,000
So, some CEOs seeing that, oh, this could be a good thing because, you know, people can rediscover those old games,

1725
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:05,000
especially, you know, in time for folks to play the newest game in the series on the new console or what have you.

1726
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
So that's kind of neat.

1727
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Also worth pointing out, rumors going around that Burnout Paradise will probably be a thing for Xbox One backwards compatibility.

1728
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Criterion Games flat out made a tweet.

1729
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Yes, we are talking to Microsoft about making Xbox 360 Burnout Paradise available on Xbox One via backwards compatibility.

1730
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,000
More news soon.

1731
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Yes!

1732
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:33,000
So, Criterion Games making it crystal clear, if they can make it happen, it's going to happen.

1733
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
You make it happen, I'll buy it. I mean, I fucking love that game.

1734
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Yeah?

1735
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Seriously, I love that game. Of course, I don't have an Xbox One, but I love that game anyway.

1736
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
But you still have a 360.

1737
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I still have a 360.

1738
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,000
There you go.

1739
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:51,000
So, that's awesome. I think I still have that on disc somewhere, so I got to make a note not to get rid of those discs

1740
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
because a lot of those games are going to come back on Xbox One, so that's pretty cool.

1741
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
I have it on PC, too. I should play it.

1742
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

1743
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Alright, moving on. DarkSakura.

1744
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Oh, it would help if my computer would cooperate with me.

1745
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,000
This is happy news, although I don't think that it's nearly long enough.

1746
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:12,000
You know that kid in Canada who did all the swatting stuff?

1747
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Yes, I do, because we were talking about that a couple weeks ago on the show, I think.

1748
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:26,000
Yeah, he was a League of Legends player, and he was apparently a member of Lizard Squad, the little hacking group.

1749
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Well, I wouldn't say little, more notorious, but he pleaded guilty to over 23 charges of harassment across North America.

1750
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:49,000
And he was sentenced to, let me see, 18 months in jail for this.

1751
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:56,000
So, that's a year and a half, even though, I mean, he caused a lot of problems.

1752
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Among the different, what's the word I'm thinking of, the charges were extortion, public mischief, criminal harassment.

1753
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:15,000
He was originally going to face more than 40, and he admitted to targeting more than 30 people in the US and Canada between January and December 2014,

1754
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:22,000
who were mostly women and gamers who would not accept friend requests or follow requests on social media,

1755
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:26,000
and that he had shown a sadistic delight in what he had done.

1756
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:30,000
The charge should have been being a fucking asshole, but the Canadians are too nice.

1757
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Targets were in Polk County, Florida, Phoenix, and Tucson, Arizona, four different communities in California, Minnesota, Utah, and a few places in Ohio and Canada.

1758
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Don't know specifically where in Canada.

1759
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:53,000
They were looking for a two-year custody and supervision order with 16 months in youth detention.

1760
02:12:53,000 --> 02:13:03,000
What he got is, he got technically 16 months in jail and 8 months under supervision, and has been banned from the internet.

1761
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Wow. Wow. That takes something to get banned from the entire internet.

1762
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
That also sounds like something that's impossible to do.

1763
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:17,000
I know, I'm kind of, well, I mean, but if under law, like, that's fascinating.

1764
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,000
The Canadian government actually said, you are banned from the internet.

1765
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:23,000
And if he, that could mean if he touches the internet, he goes back to jail.

1766
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:28,000
They probably think that it's going to be for the term of his sentence and probation.

1767
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:29,000
Wow.

1768
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:35,000
The thing is that because he's a minor, they can't release his name under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.

1769
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,000
But, you know, someone's going to find out and put that out there.

1770
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:41,000
I hope the parents got a stern talking to.

1771
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,000
I hope the parents got worse.

1772
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Yeah.

1773
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:51,000
But I just still think that 18 months is light for what he did.

1774
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I mean, it could just possibly be stupid teenager not thinking things through, or just being an asshole bully.

1775
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:05,000
But we need to send a message to other people, because it's not like he's the only person that's ever done this, unfortunately.

1776
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:08,000
And we need to send a message that society will not tolerate this bullshit.

1777
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Period.

1778
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
And parents need to educate their kids.

1779
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:16,000
And if your kid is being an asshole, you know, smack them, you know, verbally.

1780
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Discipline. Have discipline.

1781
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Discipline. Thank you. That's a good way to put it.

1782
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,000
All right.

1783
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Kind of along those same lines.

1784
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Speaking of Lizard Squad, there is another member of Lizard Squad who has been convicted, Julius Kibimaki.

1785
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:40,000
And apparently he's been convicted with 50,000 counts of cybercrime, including harassment, fraud, and data breaches.

1786
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,000
And he was a part of the group that took down...

1787
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,000
50,000?

1788
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:45,000
50,000.

1789
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:56,000
And he was a part of the group that did DDoS attacks against Xbox Live and PlayStation Network, that took it down during December of last year.

1790
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:07,000
And, you know, ultimately I think he stopped when Kim Dotcom actually bribed them with $300,000 worth of vouchers towards Mega.

1791
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:17,000
And now with this, this basically so far what they've brought up charges against him amounts to two years of a suspended sentence.

1792
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:27,000
But with that, though, there's one of the developers that was actually being targeted by this, John Smedley.

1793
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
He is...

1794
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,000
He's out for blood now, basically.

1795
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:37,000
He's the president of the former Sony Online Air Team president.

1796
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:45,000
And, you know, he was aboard the American Airlines flight when they issued a fake bomb threat.

1797
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:49,000
You know, having his plane turn around because of safety reasons.

1798
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Oh, God, I remember that.

1799
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:54,000
That was, oh, that was rude, to say the least.

1800
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:02,000
And, you know, basically he has there's a string of tweets, which I will go ahead and read right now in regards to this.

1801
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
So that was a piece of garbage.

1802
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:09,000
That was the piece of garbage that brought down my plane, leaked my information, did all kinds of crap to me.

1803
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:17,000
It's important to note he was convicted of crimes that he had nothing to do yet with the PSN DDoS over Christmas.

1804
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Yes, he was a part of that.

1805
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:24,000
And he still has 15 other criminal cases awaiting prosecution in Finland.

1806
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,000
I may go after his parents in civil court, too, little dirtbag.

1807
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:35,000
So stay tuned because what security, that's his name on Twitter, he's a sociopath and he will get what's coming to him.

1808
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:41,000
What they won't tell you is that he did jail time already and got his ass kicked hard inside.

1809
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:48,000
The FBI nailed this guy, literally, immediately took the Finnish government long to catch up.

1810
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Basically, I also got to listen to the entire conversation between him and American Airlines the day he called in the bomb threat.

1811
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:01,000
His parents need to be held accountable for his actions in addition to his going to jail.

1812
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
So I'm coming for you, Julius.

1813
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Wow.

1814
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Don't hold back.

1815
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Yes.

1816
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:14,000
I mean, how do you like how do you not know what your kid is doing?

1817
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:22,000
I mean, you know, oh, he just committed 50,000 acts of computer espionage and harassment stuff.

1818
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Man.

1819
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Whatever.

1820
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Tigerclaw is pointing out in chat that there's a follow up and it sounds like there was some type of retaliation attack for those tweets.

1821
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Just, my God. Garbage. Garbage, garbage, garbage.

1822
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Seriously.

1823
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:44,000
All right. Well, let's let's shift gears here significantly.

1824
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I want to talk about some more information that's coming out of Comic-Con.

1825
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,000
And that is some Street Fighter V news, because, you know, Comic-Con, they do get video game things as well.

1826
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:57,000
And they did announce a new character for Street Fighter V at Comic-Con.

1827
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
That character is Ken.

1828
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,000
So in other news, the pope is Catholic.

1829
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Sky is blue.

1830
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
So they changed his moves.

1831
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Yeah, they did.

1832
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
They've done some changes to Ken a little bit.

1833
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Your eye rolling over there. How are you feeling?

1834
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:14,000
Dan's going to be pissed.

1835
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Oh, because of the Ken changes?

1836
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,000
That's his guy.

1837
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Yeah.

1838
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:21,000
Don't worry. They will sell a classic costume pack, I'm sure, for only five dollars.

1839
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,000
It doesn't matter the costume. It matters that his move set's different.

1840
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
That'll be very interesting.

1841
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:35,000
So anyhow, also announced at Comic-Con, there's going to be a crossover comic book, Street Fighter X G.I. Joe.

1842
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:42,000
So, you know, how appropriate that they're actually talking comic books at Comic-Con, but I'm sure that potential's pretty rad there.

1843
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,000
But doesn't sound like that's going to have any ultimate impact on the video games.

1844
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
But there you go.

1845
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,000
So Ken is coming to Street Fighter V, but you may not like it.

1846
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:57,000
We'll see when the game goes into beta testing, what, later this month?

1847
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Isn't his hair different now, too?

1848
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,000
It is. It is.

1849
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I mean...

1850
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Why'd you mess up his hair?

1851
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:09,000
I also, though, I do understand, like, you can't do the same thing over and over and over. You gotta try something new.

1852
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:15,000
Honestly, back in the Street Fighter II days, it's like, okay, he's just kind of like a... it's another Ryu character.

1853
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Right. Yeah, Ryu and Ken were like the same, you know, but different.

1854
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Yeah.

1855
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Didn't Ryu have a better fireball and then Ken had a better dragon punch?

1856
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Yep.

1857
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Was that the thing? Yeah.

1858
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
So...

1859
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Alright.

1860
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,000
But that's, like, minor.

1861
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Alright, let's get to the emails. You guys send us emails every week.

1862
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email.

1863
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:40,000
And every week you guys send us emails and we read some of our favorites here on the show.

1864
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:45,000
So let's get to the emails. And why, again, do I not have the theme?

1865
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I'm like, this is like, what, three weeks in a row now?

1866
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:50,000
I guess I somehow deleted it from the default playlist or something.

1867
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
How's that possible?

1868
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I don't know. Pick something different.

1869
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
I'll see what I can dig up.

1870
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Pick Buffalo.

1871
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Or I can dig it up and I can find the theme.

1872
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,000
So here it is. Tonight's mailbag.

1873
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Oops.

1874
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Jeez.

1875
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Hello, OLR crew. I probably love the show.

1876
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Probably.

1877
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
You might.

1878
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
That's what it says. Question.

1879
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I think this is the feeling that I'm feeling.

1880
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
Is Mario real or unreal?

1881
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:35,000
I just want to know if any of you have seen the trailer of Mario running on the Unreal Engine.

1882
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Way back on OLR episode 461 during the mailbag segment, DarkStalker demanded that Mario be developed running on the Unreal Engine.

1883
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,000
I did.

1884
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:46,000
And now we can see it. Thank you, LoveSam.

1885
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:50,000
I did hear about the Mario in the Unreal Engine demo. I did see that.

1886
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Someone recreating Mario 64 in Unreal Engine.

1887
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Well, there was that a while ago, but now there's like a new one. There's another like new.

1888
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:00,000
It's like here's Mario and like this. We set him up like that.

1889
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:04,000
You know, Mario 64 engine type stuff, but he's just right through random scenes.

1890
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Hold on, because there's something else that concerns me about this email.

1891
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
I'm sorry. What episode number did they say you requested this in?

1892
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,000
461.

1893
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Do you know how? We're on episode 605. So 461 would have been like three years ago.

1894
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
How did you know that?

1895
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:29,000
No, I think that's awesome. I'm just I just I don't know how I will do this way in a good way.

1896
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:39,000
I am blown away and I'm obscenely flattered that many of our listeners out there know this show better than I do.

1897
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I don't know.

1898
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Granted, every show is out there on the I mean, I think still every show for the past like five years is available on orange.com.

1899
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:51,000
We haven't deleted anything. We did have to purge at one point several years ago.

1900
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:56,000
But even the oldest shows like you go into chat and ask dark Tetsuya where the old shows,

1901
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:01,000
because there's this whole like virtual drive set up that you can log into and there's like all these old shows.

1902
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:06,000
So I know there's like really dedicated people out there that listen to like multiple episodes of O.L.R.

1903
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:14,000
a week. And I, I, I'm always like deeply flattered by that because I don't think I could listen to that much O.L.R.

1904
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I can't listen to any of my voice.

1905
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Oh, I don't. Yeah. I mean, I when I listen to the old episodes, I'm a little critical, like, oh, God, we were such a hot mess.

1906
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:28,000
But, you know, I also kind of go were we true.

1907
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,000
We learned just a hot mess with better shoes. We learned we learned from it all.

1908
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:40,000
We really do. So anyway, I love it.

1909
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Last email. Hello. Smiley face.

1910
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Firstly, did you know? Oh, God, please spelling. Did you know that there is to be a film sequel to American McGee's Alice Madness Returns called Alice Otherlands?

1911
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:59,000
But no third game. Alice the Madness Returns was the second game in the series.

1912
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:04,000
That was awesome. My husband did ask Mr. McGee if there would be a third game.

1913
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:09,000
And he said there weren't any plans. But we. But if we won it, let you know.

1914
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Any ideas? No, I never played the first one, so I wasn't too into it.

1915
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Yeah, I'm a little out of the loop, admittedly, on the Alice games, you know, because just I don't have enough time in the week to play everything that's out.

1916
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:31,000
But I remember when Alice Madness Returns came out, because that was a pretty big deal, because that came out quite a few years after the original.

1917
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:34,000
And it was on PlayStation three and Xbox 360.

1918
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:39,000
And that was like 10 years after the first one. And it's a very stylistic kind of game.

1919
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:47,000
So maybe if you wait another 10 years, there'll be a third game in the Alice series.

1920
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:55,000
But, yeah, no, they American McGee's gone on record saying that they've always envisioned it as a trilogy and that they do have a story available for a third game.

1921
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:04,000
But only if, you know, the audience basically demands it, because I know the second game was not incredibly well reviewed.

1922
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:10,000
It was kind of lukewarm. But, you know, not that reviews are everything. It's really about sales.

1923
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:14,000
I have friends that are really into the series and the mythology around it. Are you okay?

1924
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Yeah, I'm fine. This desk is broken. I have to fix it. That's all.

1925
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Okay. Maybe it's time for an Ikea trip.

1926
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Maybe it is. But, yeah, it's pretty. I like the scenery in it. It just, I wasn't really doing a lot of PC gaming when it came out.

1927
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:32,000
So, no.

1928
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Fifth Dream says Kickstarted it. It's about to come out a series of animated shorts.

1929
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:41,000
He can't get the rights from EA, but he has the movie rights.

1930
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I was going to say he should just go to Kickstarter, but aha, that's right.

1931
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:49,000
EA put out that second game. They're probably sitting on the rights and don't want to do it.

1932
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,000
I know.

1933
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:56,000
Secondly, I wanted to let you know about a game I found on the Steam sale a few weeks back called Parcel.

1934
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:07,000
It's a puzzle game where you need to get a Parcel box and one or more characters from one place across the stream to somewhere else through laser obstacles.

1935
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:11,000
The Parcel box can be used to block the lasers so the character can get past them.

1936
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:20,000
There are several different areas, each with a number of levels, and each area has a new character that interacts with the box in a different way.

1937
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:27,000
It is well structured with very easy tutorial levels to really quite hard levels in each area.

1938
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:30,000
I have been stuck several times. Stuck now.

1939
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:39,000
The problem is that their advertising sucks and I don't think many people have found it, which also means there isn't much help when you can't work it out.

1940
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Fortunately, you don't have to complete every level to move on. I may need to skip the current one.

1941
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Anyway, I think this is a great game that deserves a mention. Hopefully more people will find it and work out what I can't.

1942
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:55,000
Thanks for being a great show to entertain me on a Monday morning. Kitten Poker.

1943
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:01,000
You're welcome. Wow, that's like two new names I don't totally recognize this week in the email bags.

1944
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
I think Kitten Poker is from the UK.

1945
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Well, thank you all for emailing us. It's really awesome.

1946
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:16,000
I know I've seen it somewhere before, probably just flipping through stuff on Steam. Maybe I'll go check it out. I like a good puzzle game.

1947
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Paging Raginator because he knows a lot about those Steam games. I don't know if he's played Parcel.

1948
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:26,000
No, I had not heard of it, but I will have to browse Steam and look up more information on that.

1949
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:34,000
I appreciate heads up from listeners because there's so much out there, especially on Steam and the mobile stores, Google Play and iPhone.

1950
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:42,000
There's so much out there that, without recommendations, it's hard to sort through it all.

1951
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Keep us in the loop.

1952
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Alright, participate at orangelaungerator.com if you want to send us an email for a future week.

1953
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Now it is time to get to the FUs of the week. Why? Because angst and stuff.

1954
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:16,000
FU goes towards managing FMLA stuff. That's it.

1955
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:27,000
FU to my game because the whole concept they came up with originally about it being a broken game and stuff.

1956
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Fortunately, I've seen it done elsewhere now. They have this new game that just released that actually looks really awesome at this point.

1957
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:40,000
It's a different genre altogether, but the way they handled it being a broken game is pretty hilarious.

1958
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:44,000
But yeah, unfortunately, mine's not up to that level yet, but that's fine.

1959
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:54,000
FU to the fact that I have to get up really early again tomorrow. I've been having to do the early stuff a lot lately and I'm not a morning person.

1960
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:01,000
FU to morning people. I don't know how you do it. You must have lots of donuts and coffees. I think that's the only way I could do it.

1961
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Red Bull. That's the only way I stay awake in the morning.

1962
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
No, I can't do Red Bull.

1963
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:17,000
I stay up late. Lately though, I've been just working on stuff and I literally fall asleep while I'm working on stuff. That's how old I'm getting.

1964
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Rama in chat says, my new job has me up at 5 a.m. I feel you. And that's like 2 a.m. my time. I don't even know how you do it. How are you listening to this show right now?

1965
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
I mean, thank you, but oh my God.

1966
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:31,000
Yeah, my new job does that to me too. It's called Kids.

1967
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
Oh my God. No, no, no.

1968
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,000
And people wonder why I don't want to.

1969
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Yeah, right? I'm like, no, no, no. The cat's bad enough. The cat gets us up every morning now at 6 o'clock. She's throwing herself against the door now if she can't get in.

1970
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
You know what?

1971
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:44,000
What?

1972
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Dan feeds Midna in the morning.

1973
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Well, yeah, Alan will get up and go feed Sanrio.

1974
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
I won't hear a thing.

1975
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Well, I sleep with earplugs on just so I don't have to hear that or anything.

1976
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
White noise machine is what you need.

1977
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
We have a fan that makes white noise.

1978
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Oh, we didn't even want to...

1979
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:05,000
Technically, fans typically make brown noise. It's a lower frequency.

1980
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
I don't want brown noise in the bedroom.

1981
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:10,000
White noise is usually high pitched.

1982
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Well, whatever we have. We have the sound of a box fan. It's an 11 hour MP3 that I have playing through a set of computer speakers with a subwoofer.

1983
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:28,000
And we play it for my kid to stay asleep. And it's fantastic. There's so much white noise in my house.

1984
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Is it box fantastic?

1985
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:37,000
It's box fantastic, yeah. But it's just like, it's so relaxing. Except my wife hates it.

1986
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:41,000
I just don't want the brown note when I try to sleep, because I have a nice bed. I don't want to ruin it.

1987
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:45,000
There's no such thing as a brown note. They've already busted that myth.

1988
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
At any rate...

1989
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:51,000
On the last episode of OLR, we will play the brown note. That'll be how we go out.

1990
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I have an air filter in our room. And it does pretty well for us.

1991
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Yeah, that's what my son uses. My other son, he has a...

1992
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:04,000
And honestly enough, Midna doesn't whine or paw at the door, but she will try to get into bed and sleep with me.

1993
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Because they go fucking crazy for that shit. My cat was whining at me for Saffa. I'm like, Saffa's right there on the floor.

1994
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:15,000
You just ate some a second ago. What the hell you want?

1995
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Midna gets crunchy, grain-free cat food.

1996
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Alright, Brad is complaining that that would be a shitty way to go out on our last episode.

1997
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Our last episode is going to be...

1998
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:31,000
We'll play a note so epic that shit will fly out of your ass.

1999
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Much like Mentos causes dipepsy to fly out of the bottles.

2000
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:39,000
No, I think in reality I just want to play Porky Pig at the end.

2001
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
That's all, folks. That's it.

2002
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:45,000
And they copyright strike by Warner Brothers.

2003
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Alright, let's get to it. Some more news.

2004
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:56,000
And then Skype Line is going to open up at 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2005
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
But first, Loki.

2006
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:01,000
But first, let's talk about Nintendo again.

2007
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
And Animal Crossing.

2008
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:11,000
You may remember that the next couple Animal Crossing games are quite up to the level standards that we're kind of used to as far as an Animal Crossing game.

2009
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:23,000
We kind of think, okay, you're supposed to build a town, pay off that goddamn loan from Tom Nook, and then the mortgage never ends because you're always doing improvements and shit like that.

2010
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
And there's all these townsfolk that piss you off.

2011
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:31,000
But now they have this board game thing and some house designer thing that's going to be super expensive.

2012
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:34,000
So you're going, why did they even make these games in the first place?

2013
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
Well, here's why.

2014
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:44,000
Initially, when the Amiibo was announced, there was nothing really to be said about Animal Crossing Amiibos or any of the plans for that matter.

2015
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:50,000
But, as Animal Crossing team, we were confident that if there was one, it would be really cute.

2016
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:53,000
And honestly, we just wanted Animal Crossing Amiibo.

2017
02:31:53,000 --> 02:32:00,000
We wanted the company to make Animal Crossing Amiibos, so that's why we made a game that works with them.

2018
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:05,000
So you put that shit together just to make some fucking Amiibos for Animal Crossing.

2019
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:09,000
You could have put a little bit more effort into that.

2020
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:13,000
This is why I'm really worried the bubble's about to burst on Amiibo.

2021
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Things like that where it's just not even about the game anymore.

2022
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:21,000
It's like you could have said, oh, well, we just wanted to put a...

2023
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:28,000
That's why we made our Animal Crossing game that's super fucking awesome support Amiibo in this really unique way.

2024
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:33,000
No one said they took these away and, eh, we just kind of pieced together something that uses Amiibos.

2025
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Because that's the only way we get Animal Crossing Amiibos.

2026
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Alright. I got nothing. I'm not pre-ordering that game. That's all I have to say on that.

2027
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:54,000
I do want that NES sprite Mario thing, though, which will probably do something in Mario Maker.

2028
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
That I do want, but...

2029
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:00,000
It would be cool if it unlocked, like, the first Mario game or something.

2030
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:08,000
Or, hey, if we're feeling really generous, the first, second, third, maybe lost levels, and Super Mario World games.

2031
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:12,000
Well, I think... I don't know if the original levels are in there, but...

2032
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:18,000
You know, like, the template for Mario Bros. 1 and Mario World, that's all in there, so...

2033
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
That'll be interesting.

2034
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,000
I do kind of want that game.

2035
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:27,000
YYR says the Mario sprite Amiibo will likely be exclusive to eight Best Buy locations.

2036
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Bite your tongue.

2037
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
I'm sorry, eight GameStop locations.

2038
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:33,000
And there will only be eight of them in each location.

2039
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Anyhow, all that aside, last week we had some laughs during a segment called Match Game, right?

2040
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:44,000
And the epic question had to do with Splatoon's Splatfest.

2041
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:48,000
And I'll just leave it to you to go back and listen to last week's show.

2042
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:49,000
That's all I'm going to say.

2043
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
However, we also got into it a little bit.

2044
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:56,000
ActDeaf and I may have had some words about Team Cat versus Team Dog.

2045
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:59,000
So we talked about what should the next Splatfest be.

2046
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:08,000
Well, clearly, the powers that be at Nintendo right now, the powers that be decided something different.

2047
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,000
They were not listening to the show.

2048
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:13,000
And they have announced what the next Splatfest theme will be.

2049
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:20,000
So on July 17th, which is when the next Splatfest will be from 9 p.m. Pacific time to July 18th at 9 p.m. Pacific time,

2050
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:28,000
it will be Team Roller Coasters versus Team Water Slides.

2051
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Not water sports, people.

2052
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Water Slides.

2053
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Roller Coasters and Water Slides.

2054
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:36,000
How does Roller Coasters not win this?

2055
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Especially when you know that it's based on participation as well.

2056
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Aren't Water Slides roller coasters?

2057
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:44,000
I mean, technically, I guess not.

2058
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:49,000
But I sort of see Water Slides as just roller coasters where you're the vehicle.

2059
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,000
It's as easy.

2060
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Water Slides, you got to walk your ass up to the top of that water slide.

2061
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:57,000
It's involving waiting lines and shit like that.

2062
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,000
That's fucking effort.

2063
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Roller Coaster does a lot of shit for you.

2064
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
There's no fucking walking to the top of the hill.

2065
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
That's what the chain's for.

2066
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Or even now, it's magnets.

2067
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,000
How do they work?

2068
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:10,000
It's all magnets now.

2069
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Exactly.

2070
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:14,000
If you ride a California Xtreme or the Roller Coasters.

2071
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Now, you showed me a water park that has an elevator that goes up to the top.

2072
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Maybe on even playing field here.

2073
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
But so far, they're not willing to install that kind of shit.

2074
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:26,000
I like the Water Slides where you get to the top and you're standing on the thing and then they pull the lever.

2075
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
Pull the lever. Wrong lever.

2076
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:29,000
And then you fall.

2077
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:30,000
So, awesome.

2078
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Anyhow, actually, what team is Deft on?

2079
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Because I'm going to be on the other team.

2080
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
I'm just kidding.

2081
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:38,000
No, Deft has already proclaimed Team Roller Coaster.

2082
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
I think we can agree.

2083
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
We can agree on that one, Team Roller Coaster.

2084
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
So, I'm going to do that one.

2085
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:47,000
I mean, they have Roller Coaster of Love.

2086
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Do they have any sort of water slide songs?

2087
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,000
No.

2088
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Let's see, SSG100Matt says there's water slides where water jets push you up hills.

2089
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Really?

2090
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Yeah. And you know where they got the idea from?

2091
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Roller Coasters.

2092
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:07,000
They actually do have the water jet ones over at Sunsplash over here.

2093
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
I've never been to Sunsplash. I feel too old.

2094
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Who wants to see this old fat man at the water?

2095
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
But granted, there's probably a ton of them.

2096
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
It's Golf Land Sunsplash already, so whatever.

2097
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:23,000
Alright, 1877GameOLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2098
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:27,000
If you have something you'd like to talk about tonight, please give us a call.

2099
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
We will chat about whatever is on your mind tonight.

2100
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:35,000
That's 1877GameOLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2101
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Meanwhile, while we wait, do you have any last minute stories?

2102
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:45,000
No, but I'd like to mention though, since it hasn't been mentioned, that Ernie Cline's new book comes out this week, Armada.

2103
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Which is sort of kind of based off of Last Starfighter.

2104
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:54,000
So, if you're into that whole 80's homage crap, then you might want to check that out.

2105
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Alright, I have a call on the line waiting, sorry. Let's get to it.

2106
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2107
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:01,000
This is YYR.

2108
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Hey, YYR, buddy. How you doing?

2109
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Oh, not too bad, not too bad. Managed to survive.

2110
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:12,000
We just went through all the trash in our apartment building.

2111
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Our landlord was like, you're keeping too much stuff in the garage to all the residents of this building.

2112
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
And he was basically like, get it out now.

2113
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Which makes the job of going through the trash much more difficult and time consuming.

2114
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:26,000
But we survived.

2115
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:27,000
You did it.

2116
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Just imagine that you're playing the old Nickelodeon game show, Finders Keepers.

2117
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:36,000
Which the whole object was to dig through the trash.

2118
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Oh, but you don't want to keep any of this stuff.

2119
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:40,000
That's true.

2120
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:41,000
Trust me.

2121
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Well, what's on your mind, my friend?

2122
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Well, actually, I just called because I wanted to mention something that, a new story that I thought was very interesting.

2123
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:55,000
But if you look at all the major gaming sites, they basically don't talk about it at all.

2124
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:03,000
And basically what this is, is there's a site out there, it's called rollolo.net.

2125
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:08,000
And these people, honestly, I don't know what the heck the site is for.

2126
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:11,000
But there's this one guy on there and his name is Yifan Lu.

2127
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:21,000
And he announced a couple of months ago that there's an exploit for the PlayStation Vita and TV.

2128
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Because it's essentially a PlayStation Vita.

2129
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:29,000
That is forthcoming and will allow people to play homebrew.

2130
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:33,000
You know, some sort of exploit, hack, whatever.

2131
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:40,000
That, you know, it's already been possible to run PSP homebrew on Vita.

2132
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Because there's essentially a PSP in the Vita.

2133
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:48,000
But native actual Vita homebrew hadn't been possible up until now.

2134
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:52,000
And basically he said, this involves PlayStation Mobile.

2135
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:56,000
So you really should sign up to be a PlayStation Mobile developer.

2136
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:02,000
And specifically he also mentioned the PlayStation Mobile Development Assistant.

2137
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:07,000
And said that we should all download it and further details are forthcoming.

2138
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:12,000
So back on June 14th, he announced Rejuvenate.

2139
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Which was basically his name for this development kit and exploit allowing native homebrew on Vita.

2140
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:28,000
And, you know, he explained how it directly involves the development assistant.

2141
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:35,000
And then I guess Sony just kind of shit a brick and said, oh god, oh god, what do we do now?

2142
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:42,000
So eight days later, on the 22nd of June, Sony posted an announcement on the PlayStation Mobile site.

2143
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:49,000
And mind you, right before this happened, I submitted an update to Pixel Poops.

2144
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Which went through and is for sale.

2145
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
It just makes the game a little easier.

2146
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:58,000
The joggers don't cross the Taco Bell rows and columns before a certain point.

2147
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:05,000
And then, you know, they don't cross the Taco Bell eating space until a little after that.

2148
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
I thought you had to give it a different name.

2149
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
I thought it was a different name.

2150
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:12,000
I thought you had to give it a different name to avoid copyright issues.

2151
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Is it like Taco Place or something? I don't know.

2152
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
Oh, actually I don't name it at all within the game.

2153
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
It's just assumed that it's Taco Bell.

2154
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Alright, fair enough.

2155
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:26,000
So anyway, the announcement that Sony posted on a page, I think this is pretty interesting.

2156
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:31,000
It says, it's titled, please stop using and delete PSM development assistant.

2157
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:35,000
And they say, a software issue was found in the development assistant.

2158
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:41,000
For those developers using it, we kindly ask you to stop using the application and delete it from your PlayStation Vita.

2159
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:44,000
We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

2160
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:48,000
I need to go download this and sign up.

2161
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:55,000
If you go to the PlayStation dev portal, which is at PSM.PlayStation.net,

2162
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:00,000
in the bottom left corner you'll see there's like recent announcements and that's right at the top.

2163
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Does it cost anything to sign up for a dev kit?

2164
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:11,000
It's been a while since I watched PushyPixels and their whole team in Cooking Unity sign up on that.

2165
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:16,000
I just don't remember if it costs anything to sign up as a PlayStation dev.

2166
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:19,000
Well you know what, it's too late now anyway. They're not accepting Play...

2167
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Because PlayStation Mobile is shutting down sales in three days anyway.

2168
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:26,000
So it's too late for that now.

2169
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:34,000
But here's the thing, the development assistant was actually necessary to test things out on the Vita before you try to release.

2170
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:44,000
So basically from that day forward, two days after that on the 24th, they released a new firmware for the Vita, 3.52.

2171
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:53,000
And the sole change was they plugged the hole and they basically stopped the dev assistant from working because it requires the latest firmware.

2172
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:57,000
So now there's absolutely no way to test your things on Vita.

2173
02:41:57,000 --> 02:42:01,000
So anyone who was trying to get an update through at the last second, they basically were screwed.

2174
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:04,000
Oh my gosh.

2175
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:20,000
And meanwhile, they posted an update on this WoLolo.net saying, well, Sony didn't take kindly to what we were doing, so if you want to be able to run Homebrew on your Vita at some point, do not update past 3.51.

2176
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:26,000
And it's still in beta, but they're going to be announcing more details soon.

2177
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:36,000
But if you actually want to use your Vita to play current games and play online or do whatever, then it's just like the previous gen consoles, you have to make a choice.

2178
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Do you want to use it for hacks or do you want to use it for games?

2179
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:45,000
I would have still thought that they would try to somehow transition this a little better.

2180
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:51,000
You know, there's people out there that want to develop, that want to do things on the Vita, and the Vita kind of needs a little love.

2181
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:55,000
I hope they do come up with something to roll it right over onto the Vita.

2182
02:42:55,000 --> 02:43:01,000
I hope they do something to replace that or even have it just as easy to do that for PlayStation 4.

2183
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:08,000
I mean, I understand they don't want it to turn out to be some sort of Xbox Indies or whatever where there's a ton of stuff on there.

2184
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
I actually kind of don't care about that.

2185
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:16,000
From what I've heard, there was a little bit of a developer backlash when Xbox Indies came out and they're like,

2186
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Well, you know, we pay a lot of money and we put a lot of effort into releasing games on console and now you have these people and they can just release games on the console with very little expense and very little effort.

2187
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:37,000
So I think there was some kind of pushback and that's why I think maybe Xbox Live indie games aren't going to be part of the backwards compatibility on one.

2188
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Man, too bad. I'm sorry that they're upset that their games are competing against other things.

2189
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:51,000
I mean, a lot of them aren't selling as well as an Xbox Live arcade game. Plus, the exposure wasn't as good.

2190
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:59,000
They're behind another curtain. A lot of people always said the indie games weren't really ever featured. They were hard to find stuff. So, I don't know. Anyway.

2191
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Well, YYR, I appreciate you bringing this to the forefront, especially if other places aren't covering it. I think it's good to know.

2192
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:10,000
I'm sorry to hear that mobile is going to be taking its last breath in a couple days here.

2193
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
God, I've got to download that game quickly.

2194
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:15,000
Yeah, you better get on it.

2195
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:20,000
If you already downloaded something, you'll be able to re-download it until, I believe, mid-August.

2196
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:21,000
I've got to do it tonight then.

2197
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Or was it September? I can't remember. It's on the site. And then after that, you won't be able to re-download. You won't be able to do anything. It's all gone.

2198
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:31,000
I was backing up to my PC or something.

2199
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Fifth Dream says, I couldn't find Pixel Poops. Quickly, for the Monday crowd hearing this and for our live crowd, how can you find Pixel Poops easy?

2200
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:47,000
You can't do it from the web store. It's not accessible there. PlayStation Store on the web, PlayStation Mobile is invisible.

2201
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:54,000
You have to go on the Vita or PlayStation TV itself, go into the PlayStation Store, and then along the top you'll see a few tabs.

2202
02:44:54,000 --> 02:45:03,000
The rightmost one is PlayStation Mobile. If you go there and then you click on New Releases, you'll find it somewhere towards the top.

2203
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:04,000
Alright.

2204
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:16,000
And I appreciate anyone who goes and decides to spend the 79 cents on it. Thank you. I'll be about 49 cents a day when they pay me in November.

2205
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:20,000
I'm glad we could at least hopefully get you a beer out of this.

2206
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:31,000
That would be fantastic. And whoever bought it, if I see you in person, maybe I'll treat you to 49 cents out of a beer also.

2207
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:36,000
There it goes. There it goes. I love it. Alright. Alright, have a good one my friend. You take care.

2208
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Have a great week.

2209
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:39,000
Alright.

2210
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:40,000
Take care.

2211
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Bye bye now.

2212
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:47,000
Alright, phone lines are lighting up over at 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, but we have another call right now. Let's get to it.

2213
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2214
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Hey guys, it's Jason.

2215
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Hey Jason. How you doing?

2216
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,000
Doing pretty good yourself.

2217
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Good. Sorry we missed you in the intro tonight, but you know, we had the rough news at the top of the show, but I'm glad we can hear from you now.

2218
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Completely understandable. Besides, I just kind of have to get my 13 seconds in, so bye guys.

2219
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Ah, stop. Stop. What's on your mind tonight?

2220
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:15,000
I just wanted to drop two little trivia bombs that were touched on in some of the nostalgia, but didn't really go anywhere that kind of caught my ear.

2221
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:16,000
Please.

2222
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:24,000
You pointed out to Loki, he was talking about Takeshi's Castle game and MXC as we know it in America, and you said that it did exist.

2223
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:44,000
I don't know how many people know this, but Takeshi's Castle, I assume emulators have evolved since I first tried to play it, but I actually got a hold of a ROM for that and tried playing it in the late 90s, early 2000s, and nothing was working, and me and my friend were just completely stumped.

2224
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:55,000
Fast forward a couple of years later in just complete and total circumstance, Takeshi's Castle was a game that required the second player Famicom controller because of the microphone.

2225
02:46:55,000 --> 02:47:08,000
It was a game that took place entirely by song, rhythm, and pitch. I don't even know how detailed those microphones were back in the day, but it's something that you had to sing.

2226
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:15,000
My understanding is basically something along the lines of Japanese folk songs in order to progress your character through the game.

2227
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:24,000
And so as it comes to emulators that would have implemented support for that kind of thing back in the day, as far as I was aware, that was practically non-existent.

2228
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:35,000
Yeah, you're right, because those microphones were used in some other crazy things too, but one of the other well-known ones is Legend of Zelda. There's the pole's voice or whatever they were called.

2229
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:46,000
You were supposed to be able to stun them or kill them or something by using the microphone. When they ported it over to the US, you didn't have that at all, so I think it's just used an arrow to kill them or something a little simpler.

2230
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Yeah, definitely a lot more rudimentary for the American crowd. Fun bout of trivia. The other one is that I know the connotation, I think also something that Loki pointed out.

2231
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:08,000
The connotation was something that you could do playing in your home since cameras are evolving so much as they are, but he brought up a Nick arcade game that you could actually play.

2232
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:17,000
I'm not fairly certain. I know it was covered on this show. Did anybody ever pay attention to the Nth level Kickstarter?

2233
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Was that the one where they were trying to bring back the show?

2234
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Yep.

2235
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Yeah, I do remember talking about it. I feel like it might have been a rapid fire thing, because usually unless we have the Kickstarter person on the show, we don't spend a lot of time about Kickstarters.

2236
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Unless it's really huge, like blood stained or whatever. But yeah, I feel like we addressed it briefly on the show. I remember hearing about it. Did they ever make the money?

2237
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:58,000
No. Nth level was asking for something, I think it was either $300,000 or $400,000 or something along those lines, and they only got backed for like $30,000. So they didn't even get to six figures, not even close to even half back or anything like that.

2238
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Yikes.

2239
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Yeah.

2240
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:04,000
But that was more to bring back the show, not to make an actual game of it, right?

2241
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Correct. It is to do the show as a production with the original cast. I mean, Kickstarter has all of their projects up, so you can still go search for ENTH level and still see everything that they were bringing together, which sounded pretty solid and may still happen if they get funding otherwise.

2242
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:36,000
It just may not be as, you know, backer, consumer oriented as the show may have been with individual contributors' money.

2243
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Yeah, Estes Show and her mat actually dug up that Kickstarter and linked it in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. They made $30,000, they made $3,000.

2244
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:50,000
Oh, Jesus. Even I screwed up until wow.

2245
02:49:50,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Yeah, I mean, it's just, I think it was a hard thing to probably get, you know, a lot of people want to preorder the game or, you know, they usually get a tangible reward, and I think that's really hard to do with a TV show.

2246
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Oh, yeah.

2247
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:17,000
And, you know, what were they giving away? For $5 wallpaper, for $10, the access to Facebook and Google groups and all this, you know, you didn't really get a lot of like really tangible stuff until you were talking a lot of money.

2248
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:22,000
Like a guaranteed contestant spot or something like that probably would have really driven the point home.

2249
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Yeah.

2250
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Of course, the problem is that you probably still slanted towards like pre-teens and teens and not exactly the child in all of us today with fond memories of that show and the games and sports and all that kind of stuff.

2251
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:45,000
Exactly. Well, all right. Well, maybe we'll see video game game shows make a comeback in another fashion one way or another.

2252
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:46,000
That'd be nice.

2253
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:57,000
I would think with the cameras being a thing, there ought to be a way through PlayStation or Microsoft or even maybe who knows what Nintendo has in store where I can do something in my living room and somebody else can see it.

2254
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:07,000
And like, you know, 1 versus 100, again, a game that's hugely ahead of its time because you could have somebody that's actually playing that game live in front of all these other people.

2255
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Now, granted, you didn't see them on the camera, but what they were doing was influencing the game for the thousands of people that were playing along.

2256
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:26,000
I think it's a little funny that you're talking hypotheticals like this when you yourself have been in the situation to be able to interview a celebrity just with a webcam and headset.

2257
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,000
True.

2258
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:43,000
And the sheer number like I seem to remember that even like ESPN will Skype in sports, sports, celebrity sports stars and all those kinds of things because, you know, fuck the improbability of a satellite link with inherent delays and all of that other nonsense.

2259
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:55,000
Talk to somebody on Skype, Google Hangouts, anything and the connectedness of near real time communication from from site to site, even across the world is fucking magnificent today.

2260
02:51:55,000 --> 02:52:02,000
That's that's very true. And, you know, you reference the whole like interviewing celebrity and it was on my Twitter. So, I mean, it was it was the Huffington Post that did it.

2261
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:09,000
And they actually found me through Twitter because I had tweeted about the celebrity and they they contacted me and they asked me to do the interview thing.

2262
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:14,000
And so they had me, I think, on Google Plus and they had this other girl who is a fan on Skype. And so they were.

2263
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Yeah, we and it was like we were part of that because they basically run a TV network. It's just all online.

2264
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:22,000
We were a part of that TV network through Skype.

2265
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:29,000
Exactly. Yeah, it's kind of crazy. Anyway. All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go because our phone's been lighting up tonight, but good to hear from you as always.

2266
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:30,000
As always. Thanks, guys.

2267
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Take care, my friend. Bye bye.

2268
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Bye.

2269
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:39,000
All right. My God, the phones tonight. I'll try to squeeze in a couple more calls. I see a few coming in, so I want to I want to try and get them all.

2270
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:40,000
Hi, on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2271
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
Hey, everyone. It's Rama.

2272
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:47,000
Hey, Rama. I love this. You're wearing your Luigi hat in tribute, I assume. Black Luigi tonight.

2273
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:48,000
And your shirt.

2274
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:49,000
And the matching shirt.

2275
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:54,000
The L does not stand for loser. I love it. What's on your mind, my friend?

2276
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:06,000
I'm just kind of at a loss of words because I'm just thinking about all the good times I had playing Nintendo growing up and my cousin coming over.

2277
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:16,000
We would sit there and play. See, what will we play? Play the Goonies, Gradius, Contra, all the great ones, you know?

2278
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:23,000
Oh, yeah. I mean, it's just it's just a huge like reality check about mortality and all that.

2279
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:31,000
I don't want to go too dark on the show, but, you know, it's just like it is a huge reality check for a lot of us that like, oh, my God, like we're all getting older.

2280
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:38,000
And I get that. I do have like one more quick memory to actually have a bit of news that I think everyone would like to hear.

2281
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:47,000
I remember growing up, I spent my time between my parents house and my great grandmother's house and then back and forth, I would take my Nintendo.

2282
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:53,000
And what was awesome was my mother had a big screen, 32 inch floor model TV.

2283
02:53:53,000 --> 02:54:01,000
I remember staying at her place for the summer and Super Mario Brothers 3 just had happened to come out.

2284
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:02,000
Oh, boy.

2285
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:05,000
I think you know where I spent most of my summertime.

2286
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Heck, yeah.

2287
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Yes.

2288
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:16,000
In that world four where all the monsters were huge and it just blew our minds like, oh, my God, huge goombas and Koopas.

2289
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:22,000
You know, I didn't discover world four later because I end up more or less short cutting through it half the time.

2290
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
But then I went back and started going through it.

2291
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:27,000
I was just like, oh, I missed all of this.

2292
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:31,000
Let me get through this real quick, you know?

2293
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:32,000
Nice.

2294
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:38,000
When was the last time you played Super Mario Brothers 3 all the way through without warping?

2295
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Um, God, it's been so long and the actual I think the cartridge is actually sitting on my shelf back there.

2296
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Yes, it is.

2297
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:56,000
But I have this like wish list of things I want to live stream someday, you know, when I have a rainy day because I'm not six months behind on any live stream projects or anything.

2298
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
But I will say this much.

2299
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:06,000
I have actually sat down with Super Mario World because my old roommate and I talked about how he had the highest score in the house and no one could beat him.

2300
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Got up one Saturday morning, put on a pot of coffee, pop the game in.

2301
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:23,000
I went through every single level, opened up the star road, went through a special zone, went through every single level, beat the game.

2302
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:30,000
And the best part is he was just coming in from work as I finished the game and he just saw my final score.

2303
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:35,000
I just looked at him, put the controller down and goes, your turn.

2304
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:41,000
I love it. Oh man, Super Mario World. How cool was that?

2305
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:46,000
Not only did they have that star world where, you know, it was kind of like a warp zone of sorts, right?

2306
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:57,000
But then they had that super secret one where you had all the gnarly, cool, awesome, basically asshole Mario stages but not quite that big of an asshole.

2307
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Like, you know, Canadian level asshole. You're not that big of an asshole. You're just kind of an asshole.

2308
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:11,000
And if you didn't touch the level, if you let it sit there, I think for about two minutes it will play an updated version of the Super Mario Brothers theme.

2309
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Hmm. That's right. You would leave it there forever. Yes, I remember that. It's crazy.

2310
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:22,000
All right. Warama, my friend, thank you for the memories. I appreciate them tonight.

2311
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Take care and anime jam session, of course, Tuesday nights here on the network.

2312
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
But I never gave you my news.

2313
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
Oh, yeah, yeah. What's up?

2314
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:39,000
Okay. There is an upcoming anime convention in New York City coming up called Waku Waku and they're having a variety of Japanese guests there.

2315
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:46,000
One of the guests that they have announced is Keiji Inafune.

2316
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
Nice.

2317
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:57,000
And they are selling VIP tickets and if you purchase one of these VIP tickets, you will get to play Mighty No. 9 with the man.

2318
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:02,000
That's awesome. Oh, man, I wish I didn't already have a bunch of travel set for the year.

2319
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,000
I'm really overdue for a trip to New York. I'd love to come hang.

2320
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:13,000
But I'm going to have to figure out, like, when I finally do have the money to come out to New York and the time, when a good time for me to do it.

2321
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:16,000
Because I've got to come out for a con or something. I've got to do it the right way, right?

2322
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Well, I am switching jobs soon, but I will say this much. Just give me three weeks notice.

2323
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:27,000
I can do that. I'd need that much notice for myself, so, yeah.

2324
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:32,000
All right. All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls, but thank you so much.

2325
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
No problem, y'all. Take care.

2326
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:35,000
You, too. Bye.

2327
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Bye.

2328
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:42,000
All right, 1877 Game O.L.R. using him on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, and again, they're just coming in back to back tonight, so let's get to it.

2329
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2330
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Hey, this is Akdef.

2331
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
Hey, Akdef, my friend. How are you?

2332
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Really great, especially since you're now considered the best team, to pick the best team in Splatoon.

2333
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
I've finally seen the lights.

2334
02:57:57,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Because roller coasters are way better than water slides, and it's also as awesome as dogs.

2335
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:08,000
Also, water slides are only good for, like, a few months out of the year, whereas roller coasters, man, you can enjoy those any time of the year.

2336
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:20,000
Yeah, that's what I tweeted that exact thing a few days ago, that, oh, my God, who could vote about, who could vote water slides, because, yeah, that's only in the summer.

2337
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Roller coasters are available all the year.

2338
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,000
That's right.

2339
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:24,000
All year long.

2340
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:31,000
Unless you unfortunately live by one of those theme parks that closes in the winter, like they do in the Northeast, but, see, in California, you know, a place like Magic Mountain, they don't ever close.

2341
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:39,000
I don't know why you would close in the winter, either, because apparently the winter air is supposed to be, like, the perfect, you know, the air pressure is the perfect density for roller coaster riding.

2342
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Well, you know, riding a roller coaster in the snow isn't that much fun.

2343
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Whatever.

2344
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Or safe.

2345
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:47,000
Yeah, probably.

2346
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Safe.

2347
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
Uh, yeah.

2348
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Good times, good times.

2349
02:58:54,000 --> 02:59:00,000
But, yeah, I wanted to talk about the, well, the death of history water.

2350
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,000
Of course.

2351
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:04,000
It really, it really, it was shocking news.

2352
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:13,000
I was on an amiibo event today that I helped organize, and we were having a lot of fun.

2353
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:20,000
We were having a training day, basically, for people that were new to the amiibos and all that stuff.

2354
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:27,000
And, yeah, that's surprising that we heard the news, and I was like, nah, not really?

2355
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:36,000
I couldn't believe it at first, then I checked my Facebook, I checked Twitter, and, yeah, all the news was freaking out, and it was pretty shocking.

2356
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:41,000
Though, it was pretty cool that everyone kept playing.

2357
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:48,000
We all kept playing, we all kept training our amiibos and all that stuff.

2358
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:50,000
And...

2359
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:56,000
Well, yeah, I mean, Mr. Iwata loved to make games for people to play, and enjoyed seeing people having fun.

2360
02:59:56,000 --> 03:00:01,000
So, I don't think he would want us to sit around, you know, boo-hooing what's happened.

2361
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:04,000
You know, we've had our moment, now let's go play some games.

2362
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:07,000
I think that's what Iwata truly would want.

2363
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:12,000
Yeah, and it was organized in a local gaming cafe, so.

2364
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:20,000
In one room we had little Smash Brothers, in another one they had Star Fox on the Super Nintendo.

2365
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:36,000
So it was pretty cool that, even though it was a sad thing to hear, and it still is, that everyone still enjoyed and reminisces about how great the man was.

2366
03:00:36,000 --> 03:00:46,000
Because, really, even though he, you can't blame him for mistakes that Nintendo has done in the past, but still, he was a really, really great man.

2367
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:51,000
Really great designer, programmer, and a pretty good person overall.

2368
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:54,000
Everybody makes mistakes. We make mistakes.

2369
03:00:54,000 --> 03:01:00,000
And, you know, when it comes to, you know, gaming culture and a lot of the stuff we've covered on this show, like, let's not forget.

2370
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:07,000
You know, nine, eight, nine years ago, we would razz Sony every single week for something that came out of their mouths.

2371
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
You know, when that PlayStation 3 was first announced.

2372
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:12,000
And my how times can change, you know?

2373
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:21,000
So, you know, even though we've certainly said some critical things about Nintendo, and I'm not going to try to hide that or sweep that under the rug with the news that's been going on.

2374
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:28,000
I just, you know, reiterate that comes from a place of fandom and respect and wanting to see the very best.

2375
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:31,000
And sometimes not always feeling like they're on a course for the best.

2376
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:34,000
But, anyway, just reiterating that.

2377
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:43,000
Yeah. And, yeah, also in respect to Iwata, I'm renaming my curvy amiibo to Iwata.

2378
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:47,000
Just for respect and admiration for the guy.

2379
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:52,000
Like I said, he was a great person, a great developer, programmer.

2380
03:01:52,000 --> 03:02:00,000
So, yeah, that's the least I can do in terms of what paying respects it can be.

2381
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,000
I think that's a great gesture.

2382
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:06,000
All right. All right, my friend, I'm going to let you go so we can start to wrap up.

2383
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:07,000
But thank you so much for the call.

2384
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:08,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

2385
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
All right. Take care, my friend.

2386
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:14,000
1877 game OLR, username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2387
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:17,000
I'm going to see if we can squeeze in one more call.

2388
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:21,000
But that's the first call I've hung up and there hasn't immediately been something else on the line.

2389
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:24,000
So I think we are starting to wrap up.

2390
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:25,000
But I'll give it one more shout out.

2391
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:29,000
1877 game OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2392
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:32,000
I already checked in with you, Loki.

2393
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:33,000
You say you didn't have any last minute stories, right?

2394
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:34,000
No, I didn't see anything.

2395
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:39,000
I did have something I wanted to address because I know when I was looking at all the potential stories for tonight,

2396
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
there was a few things we just didn't have time for.

2397
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:47,000
One of them was the news about Crypt of the NecroDancer, apparently, is coming to the PlayStation 4.

2398
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:48,000
That'd be cool.

2399
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:49,000
Yeah, that is pretty awesome.

2400
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:50,000
That's a fun game.

2401
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:55,000
So that's coming to there and the Vita as well, actually, coming out there as well.

2402
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
Let's see.

2403
03:02:57,000 --> 03:03:02,000
Also, Yoshinori Ono revealed a Brazil stage in Street Fighter V.

2404
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:05,000
And there will also be another upcoming character announcement.

2405
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:08,000
So talking some more about some of the stages there in the game.

2406
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:10,000
So I think that's kind of cool.

2407
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:20,000
And then Google Japan did a WarioWare-esque minigame around Godzilla and Ultraman in kind of a celebration of that.

2408
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:23,000
So there you go.

2409
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:28,000
Fifth Dream in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com says Hatiful Boyfriend on PS4 has a new path.

2410
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:33,000
Well, Hatiful Boyfriend on PS4 is coming out really soon, isn't it?

2411
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
We're getting a lot of stuff this week.

2412
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:36,000
I think it's coming out soon. I'm not sure when.

2413
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
I think it's this month.

2414
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:40,000
Very cool.

2415
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:41,000
All right.

2416
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
Well, it sounds like no other calls are coming in.

2417
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
So we're going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

2418
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:48,000
But, hey, if you want to call us in a future week, get us added on Skype.

2419
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
Orange, Laundry, all one word.

2420
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:52,000
If you want to connect with us another way, you can always send us a tweet.

2421
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:54,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2422
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Or you can hit us up on Facebook as well.

2423
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:01,000
And, of course, we love emails, especially the fact we heard from some new people this week.

2424
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:05,000
I love hearing from the vets, too, and the people that email us regularly.

2425
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
But I really love to hear from new people.

2426
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:10,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2427
03:04:10,000 --> 03:04:14,000
If you've been listening for, like, three years and you've never sent us an email, come on, do it this week.

2428
03:04:14,000 --> 03:04:15,000
Do it this week.

2429
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
Share with us a Nintendo memory.

2430
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:22,000
We've been having a lot of reminiscing this week, and I'd love to hear some more because, you know,

2431
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:27,000
video games have impacted all of us in one way or another, or I don't think you'd be here listening to this program.

2432
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
So there you go.

2433
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:33,000
Anyhow, that's about going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2434
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:37,000
As I say at the end of every week's episode, you know, if you enjoyed what you heard on the show,

2435
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:41,000
please consider giving us a nice review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio.

2436
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:44,000
Those five-star reviews go a long way.

2437
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:49,000
With so, so, so many things out there that people can choose to pick from, it's sometimes hard to be noticed.

2438
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:55,000
So all we ask, tell a friend or five or several about the show and help spread the word about our little show

2439
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
where every gamer has a voice.

2440
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
Support independent broadcasting.

2441
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:03,000
You know, we've got a lot of friends at the Voice Geeks Network, vog and network.com,

2442
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
that also work very hard on their shows and what they do.

2443
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
So check them out.

2444
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:08,000
Really appreciate it.

2445
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:09,000
All right.

2446
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:10,000
It's time to wrap up.

2447
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:18,000
Go around and get everybody's final thought for the night as we exit from this very, very somber show tonight.

2448
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:25,000
But we've had some good, I'm glad we've had some good laughs in spite of all the not-so-hilarious things that have happened today.

2449
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
Going around and get everybody's final thought tonight.

2450
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight?

2451
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:32,000
I need luck.

2452
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:36,000
My final thought is I'm going to go rub Dark Sakura for good luck.

2453
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
No.

2454
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Rub, rub, rub.

2455
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:45,000
Last but not least, Loki.

2456
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
I don't know.

2457
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:51,000
I don't have to answer the phones for two weeks.

2458
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:52,000
Vacation.

2459
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:53,000
That's not vacation.

2460
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
Training.

2461
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:56,000
All right.

2462
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:57,000
That's it.

2463
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:58,000
That's going to do it for another episode of the show.

2464
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
Thank you so much for listening to the show.

2465
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:01,000
We really appreciate it.

2466
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:04,000
And I don't know what else to say.

2467
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
It's been a really crazy day.

2468
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:09,000
But, you know, go play some games.

2469
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:10,000
That's what it's all about.

2470
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
Have fun.

2471
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
Stop being a jerk to each other online.

2472
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
Although I don't think anybody listens to this show as a jerk.

2473
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:21,000
But just in general, if you know jerks, tell them to stop being such.

2474
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
And that's it.

2475
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:24,000
Have fun.

2476
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:25,000
That's what it's all about.

2477
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:28,000
Iwata wanted us to have fun, so go have fun.

2478
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:29,000
Have a good night.

2479
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:59,000
But you know they were all still true.

2480
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
See you next week.

2481
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:27,000
Thank you.
