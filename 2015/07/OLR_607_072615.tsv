7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	This week, although P.T. and Silent Hills are no more, Del Toro and Kojima keep in touch and still appear to be making plans for their own production.
19000	23000	The duo appears to have a cerebral thriller in mind and still want to create an amazing experience for gamers.
23000	27000	All this and your comment starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio with our 607th episode for this July the 26th of 2015.
44000	50000	Here in studios, I am Rob Roberts, also known as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E.
50000	53000	And joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
53000	54000	Sup.
54000	55000	Hey, welcome back.
55000	56000	Hi.
56000	57000	Are you much more sober this week?
57000	58000	Very.
58000	64000	One of my friends commented online that he was listening to last week's show and that you were an adorable hot mess.
64000	65000	Yes, I was.
65000	69000	I drink a lot.
69000	72000	You know how those crack and rum bottles?
72000	77000	For the record, crack and rum specifically makes everything taste like cookies.
77000	79000	That's a quote from George and it's true.
79000	80000	Cookie kraken.
80000	81000	Cookies.
81000	83000	Instead of cookie clicker, it's cookie kraken.
83000	84000	Delicious cookies.
84000	86000	Don't worry, kraken mama will fix it.
86000	94000	It's great when you're low-carbing and whatnot because then it's like having cookies that you can drink and then make you not give a fuck.
94000	99000	So I had my, I had about half a bottle by myself.
99000	102000	Well, I'm glad you got to spend time with the girls.
102000	106000	I know you had a girlfriend visiting from Japan, so that's not something you get to do every day.
106000	111000	Yeah, I think Krista's heading back later, but it was good to hang out with her.
111000	112000	Excellent.
112000	116000	It was good to hear from you and you did the responsible thing and didn't like drink and drive.
116000	122000	I was like a whole like mile away or two miles, but I was way too drunk.
122000	129000	I was in Reno this weekend, which is where you would expect that kind of debauchery to happen, and I was a sober little guy.
129000	131000	I didn't do anything like that.
131000	133000	You're being a responsible adult by gambling.
133000	136000	I think I'm just saving it for Dragon Con, so look out Atlanta.
136000	139000	Get a bottle of kraken when you're there. Trust me.
139000	144000	I don't drink very often, but Dragon Con, you know, exceptions.
144000	146000	I've discovered that I really like gin.
146000	150000	Alright, Dark Soccer's gonna get a liquor podcast pretty soon.
150000	151000	I probably am.
151000	154000	In the meantime, let's say hello to Tech Master Loki.
154000	155000	Hello.
155000	156000	Hey, Loki, how you doing?
156000	157000	I'm doing fine.
157000	162000	Hey, I got to see some progress on your game, It's Time to Car, that you've been working on.
162000	163000	Yes.
163000	167000	Which at this point, you know, some of our listeners and frequent chatters are joking that it's vaporware.
167000	169000	It's the next Duke Nukem Forever.
169000	173000	But I actually got to see it, and now I totally understand why you're taking so fucking long.
173000	176000	Because it's the attention to detail that you have.
176000	177000	Can I talk about what I saw?
177000	178000	Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
178000	180000	So, Loki showed me this level.
180000	183000	I wasn't sure if I was under NDA or anything.
183000	184000	No, no.
184000	186000	I didn't want to, you know, get on your blacklist.
186000	192000	No, no. I had recorded the level, the entire gameplay through the level, but as I was telling you,
192000	196000	I have, like, originally on the top of the cart is a turret that fires cats.
196000	201000	Exactly, exactly. So it fires cats, right? So you fire cats out of this turret.
201000	208000	But then it's not enough that you just have a thing that fires cats and you interact with objects as you're racing around or whatever.
208000	213000	No, no, no. Not only does it fire cats, it has to make a variety of noises when you fire the cats.
213000	217000	Yeah, it has random noises for the cats, and random cats. I don't know if you know this, but each of those cats is random.
217000	221000	Yes, random cats. And then, I guess something your son had suggested.
221000	227000	Yes, so they hop around for a little bit. After they're done ragdolling, and, like, they ragdoll for a long time,
227000	230000	they kind of just roll and tumble, because they're just really terrible looking cats.
230000	237000	And then they hop around, kind of like the South Park walking, and then after about, like, 20 seconds or so,
237000	242000	a jetpack appears on the back along with a harness, and they fly up into space.
242000	243000	They just fly up into space.
243000	245000	Just for no reason whatsoever, other than that's the way that this spawned them.
245000	247000	Because it's a Loki game. That's why.
247000	252000	And then, not only that, but then, like, if you fire cats at houses, it actually makes noises.
252000	258000	Like, if you're doing, like, Paperboy style, and you aim for the door, it'll actually go ding dong if you hit the door.
258000	260000	And if you hit the window, it'll make a glass-shattering noise.
260000	265000	And then, like, they don't just jetpack away. Like, they start to climb up the route.
265000	271000	Like, it's so, like, your level of detail is kind of disgusting, and it's, no, I mean that in the best possible way.
271000	273000	But now I understand why you're taking so long.
273000	276000	And I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that would be like, just let it go.
276000	282000	Well, this is the last level that I was going to make before I released a demo for it.
282000	289000	So, once I'm done with this, because what I'm fixing now is I didn't like how the turret was.
289000	292000	It was just a fixed direction. You kind of had to drive the car up in there.
292000	298000	Now I'm having it where, since you can kind of rotate the camera around the car anyways to look around, that that moves the turret as well.
298000	303000	And you can aim it up and down. So it's a little bit, so you don't have to drive up every single sidewalk and do that.
303000	309000	Because it wasn't very fast. It was just kind of tedious. So I wanted to remove that.
309000	310000	And then...
310000	314000	Now, are you worried about Peeta coming after your game? Are you going to have a disclaimer in the opening?
314000	318000	Not that cats get hurt. You can run into them. You can drive over them. Nothing happens to them.
318000	321000	They just rocket away. That's it. They do not get hurt at all.
321000	325000	So no matter what you do, the cats will rocket into space.
325000	329000	You can launch millions of cats in front of you and just drive right through them, and they'll just kind of tumble away.
329000	333000	And then eventually, once they stop rolling, they'll pop back up and just start hopping around.
333000	340000	All right. Excellent. Excellent. Of course, we could not do this show without the help of our live participants.
340000	345000	So if you are listening live to our program, head on over to our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com,
345000	352000	where we do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network. That's vognetwork.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,
352000	354000	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
354000	360000	And Fifth Dream in our chatroom saying, so no more cats. Remember cats, everyone? Cats with a Z.
360000	366000	If I remember right, that was a horrible DS series of games. It was like their answer to the...
366000	370000	Well, it's not just DS. It's Ubisoft's Pets series.
370000	371000	Oh, that's right.
371000	379000	So they've got cats and dogs and all sorts of pets. Hamsters. Seriously.
380000	386000	Well, remember when that first came out, it was because Nintendogs didn't have cats in the beginning.
386000	389000	I know they got it much later when they did the 3DS version, right?
389000	392000	But in the original DS version of Nintendogs, there were no cats.
392000	396000	And that was the number one thing people wanted. So here come the knockoff game that does the cats.
396000	400000	Which, by the way, everyone, have you checked on your Nintendog lately?
400000	404000	Have you abandoned your Nintendog, you mean, mean person?
404000	410000	You need to go show your dog a little bit of love. If you didn't sell the cartridge back or anything like that, I don't know.
410000	414000	Tigerclaw pointing out they also have birds and monsters.
414000	419000	So they bet that they have birds and monsters. I'm not sure about birds and monsters.
419000	425000	Maybe birds, but I know that they did, like, pets fashion. So you would dress up your animals and stuff.
425000	433000	And they didn't just have regular animals. They had lizards and stuff. So there's lizards with tiaras and stuff. It's just really strange.
433000	438000	Uh, Joosten's in our chat room tonight saying, imagine babies with a Z.
438000	444000	Was that the Wii one that actually had the baby controller where you would put the Wii in it and it would come up with the screen like, do not shake the baby?
444000	448000	No, that's baby saving mama. And, no, imagine babies was the one that I got for her.
448000	450000	That's right!
450000	454000	Have you checked on your babies, Dark Sakura?
454000	457000	There's a reason I don't have any.
457000	462000	Because she hasn't checked on them in about seven years.
462000	470000	And Tychoplasm says, don't be surprised if they did zombies. Yes, Majesco, if I remember correctly, it was Majesco that did a zombie raising game.
470000	473000	Somebody did. There's one out there on the 3DS or DS, I know.
473000	475000	You're not even joking.
475000	476000	It's 3DS, actually.
476000	483000	Alright, well, let's get into tonight's show. We usually do a kickoff topic here to start off the show before we get into our gaming week.
483000	490000	But this week, instead of like one kickoff topic, we kind of have like a hodgepodge of a few things we want to get out there at the top of the show this week.
490000	501000	First off, if you are listening live to us at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, you probably heard before our show, as he does every week for many, many years, the Bobby Blackwell show.
501000	505000	And he always starts his show at five o'clock Pacific, eight o'clock Eastern, about an hour before we go live.
505000	512000	And tonight was special for Bobby because he celebrated ten years. He hit his ten year mark in podcasting.
512000	514000	Yay, Bobby, applause, applause.
515000	525000	So congratulations to Bobby on ten years of podcasting and, you know, it takes an incredible amount of dedication to do even one year of podcasting, let alone ten.
525000	531000	I mean, if you look at the gaming podcasts that have been going for ten years, it's a very, very small group right now.
531000	534000	And there's maybe like five, I don't even know.
534000	538000	But yeah, I mean, the fact that Bobby has had that kind of dedication is amazing.
538000	542000	And it's really cool that we've kind of been able to do it together in many ways.
542000	545000	I know at the very beginning of Bobby's show, we weren't really in the picture yet.
545000	551000	But I mean, it was probably only about a year or two after he started where we started doing that whole our show is live after his show.
551000	553000	And we always do that throw over call.
553000	556000	He's always been great about promoting us and like every single show that he does.
556000	559000	And so just congratulations to Bobby.
559000	563000	You know, it's a very different vibe than what we do here at OLR because Bobby's just one guy.
563000	570000	But it's amazing how he can still kind of perpetuate that with his chat room and it just being him.
570000	573000	And Bobby's done many great things for this show.
573000	579000	A lot of the opportunities we've had would not be possible without Bobby, including the fact that we're live on the air.
579000	591000	You know, when Live 365's costs got too prohibitively expensive, it was Bobby who brokered that deal for us to continue on at All Games Radio where we were for several years.
591000	595000	And obviously, we continued on with Bobby into this venture that we have at VOG Network now.
595000	598000	So, you know, Bobby's to thank for an awful lot of that.
598000	607000	And, you know, if you were listening to Bobby's show tonight, you heard him talk about how for a while there were Xbox 360 gamer pics that you could download.
607000	609000	They're not there anymore, sadly.
609000	619000	But, you know, a few years ago, you could actually get a group of gamer pics for podcasts that at the time were on All Games, which was Bobby.
619000	621000	And there's actually a little OLR icon.
621000	622000	I designed it.
622000	625000	You did it, yeah. And it actually has little DDR arrows and little cute things in the back.
625000	627000	And I still have it set as my icon to this day.
627000	631000	You can delist it all you want, Microsoft, but you can't take it off my profile.
631000	634000	I will not replace it with one of those cheesy little avatar pictures.
634000	635000	I will not.
635000	638000	I will have that OLR badge until the end of time.
638000	644000	So, yeah, you know, Bobby was a huge part of making that happen for us, among other things.
644000	649000	So, you know, just a big thank you and congratulations to Mr. Bobby Blackwell.
649000	658000	Now, at my workplace, when people celebrate anniversaries, when they hit like 10 years, 15 years, whatever ungodly amount of time,
658000	667000	what they like to do is they like to have the manager talk a little bit about what life was like when that person was hired at the company.
667000	678000	So, thanks to my pal, Melody, who, via Jamie and California Extreme last week, she actually found me some E3 loot from what year? 2005.
678000	684000	So, I'm looking at a book called Gamer Metrics Guide, the E3 2005.
684000	692000	And so, this is kind of talking about what gaming culture was like then and what all was going on on the different consoles.
692000	695000	So, there's a chart in here.
695000	701000	Overall, top titles releasing in Q3, Q4, 2005.
701000	705000	So, the games that had the most buzz in 2005.
705000	713000	So, I thought we could play a little bit of Family Feud and see if you guys can name 10 games and I'll let the chat rooms participate too.
713000	718000	I won't carry this out too long. If they're not guessing any, I'll let them give up.
718000	725000	But here we go. The top 10 overall titles releasing in 2005 when the Bobby Blackwell show started.
725000	732000	We ourselves were, I guess, would have been in our third year at that point, but that was that year we were transitioning into the podcast for the first time and all that.
732000	734000	So, it was a big year for us too.
734000	741000	So, who wants to make a guess? How about you, DarkSakura? What was one of the top 10 most anticipated games in the year 2005?
741000	743000	Just take a crazy guess.
747000	750000	Don't forget the microphone, DarkSakura. It's important.
750000	758000	Sorry, brains. I'm trying to think about what came out in 2005 and the only thing I can think of is like maybe...
761000	762000	Didn't Postal come out?
762000	767000	Didn't Postal come out? I'm sorry, Postal is not in the top 10.
767000	768000	I didn't think it would be.
768000	769000	I'm pretty sure Postal would have been banned from E3.
769000	770000	Oh, I know. It did come out that year.
770000	772000	All right. All right. She's going to get another chance.
772000	773000	Tekken 5.
773000	777000	Tekken 5. Surprisingly not even in the top 25.
777000	778000	Really?
778000	780000	Maybe it wasn't that year. I'll have to look at the PlayStation list.
780000	783000	Buttholes. And I think it came out earlier in the year.
783000	785000	Yeah, it's not even on the PS2. Yeah, it might have been earlier in the year.
785000	790000	All right. Loki, what do you think? 1 through 10. Top 10 titles.
790000	795000	Gosh. Well, this was anticipated for that time period.
795000	796000	Yes.
796000	805000	2005, that was the year that the Xbox 360 launched. I'm going to say Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion before they knew it was going to be delayed.
805000	811000	Actually, funny enough, not on the list. And what's weird about this, they don't have any Xbox 360 titles on the list.
811000	815000	So I will get that out of the system right now. There are no Xbox 360 titles on this list. I'm not sure why.
815000	820000	Maybe, had they announced that they were coming out that year by E3? Or was that later?
820000	821000	Maybe it was later.
821000	827000	No, because this thing covers the original Xbox and the PSP and everything. I don't even know if it has 360 in here.
827000	832000	You know what else came out that year? GTA Liberty City Stories.
832000	834000	GTA Liberty City Stories.
834000	835000	That's 2006.
835000	843000	There are two, no, I'm sorry, there's one Grand Theft Auto title on here. But it's Grand Theft Auto for the PSP at number 5.
843000	845000	Well, that's kind of close.
845000	848000	Grand Theft Auto for the PSP was Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.
848000	854000	Oh, they renamed? Oh, okay. So there you go. I don't re- if it's not written down here, I forget these things.
854000	856000	I know Grand Theft Auto, so...
856000	860000	Alright, fair enough. Alright, take one more guess, Logie.
860000	865000	Call of Duty 2.
865000	868000	No, it's not even on the list. Can you believe it?
868000	869000	That's another Xbox game, though.
869000	871000	It did come out that year, though. The Windows release did.
872000	878000	Alright. I should have said this at the beginning. This date is as of April 14th, 2005. Alright, here we go. I'm gonna go down the top 10.
878000	880000	Oh, that might have been before-
880000	882000	I bet Soul Calibur 3's on there.
882000	886000	Number 10. Soul Calibur 3 is number 19 on the list.
886000	887000	Oh, okay.
887000	891000	Alright, number 10. WWE Smackdown vs. Raw for the PS2.
891000	892000	That was a fun game.
892000	895000	Raw 2 by THQ. Whatever happened to them?
895000	897000	Number 9. This is what-
897000	898000	We went with Hulk Hogan.
898000	903000	This is hilarious. Number 9. Shadow the Hedgehog was number 9 on the list.
903000	905000	Balls, that game was awful.
905000	909000	Number 8. Gran Turismo 4 for the PSP.
909000	911000	Wait, that never came out.
916000	918000	As of April 14th, 2005.
918000	925000	Number 7. Here's the one Dark Soccer's gonna kick herself for forgetting. Animal Crossing DS was out.
925000	926000	I just gave that away.
926000	929000	Number 6. Kingdom Hearts 2.
929000	932000	Number 5. Grand Theft Auto for the PSP.
932000	936000	Number 4. Final Fantasy XII for the PS2.
936000	938000	Of course. I was just talking about that.
938000	943000	Number 3. The Godfather, which was on all the various systems.
943000	947000	Wasn't that the first game that had the whole, like, you have to do DLC online?
947000	951000	Oh, hey! You like cheats in your PlayStation and Xbox games?
951000	956000	Well, that's fine. There are button codes here, but on Xbox 360, it's paid DLC land.
956000	959000	No more up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right for you.
959000	963000	Number 2. Madden NFL 2006.
963000	965000	Of course a Madden game is in the list, people.
965000	966000	It's always in the list.
966000	967000	Of course.
967000	968000	Should have guessed.
968000	970000	Always bet on Madden being in the list.
970000	973000	And lastly, number 1, y'all. Come on.
973000	976000	The Legend of Zelda for the GameCube.
976000	980000	And for some reason, it's listed as the DS here.
980000	982000	Yes, I know. The game didn't come out in 2005.
982000	984000	The Mish Cap came out at the beginning of that year.
984000	988000	But it was still listed as the number 1 most anticipated title.
988000	990000	Because they ended up bumping it back for the Wii.
990000	993000	But they had that whole, wasn't the trailer reveal at E3 2005?
993000	994000	It was, yeah.
994000	996000	Yeah, there it is.
996000	998000	So there it is. Thank you again to, uh...
998000	1003000	Well, you know, I don't know why anyone was not anticipating Call of Duty 2, because it was fantastic.
1003000	1005000	You want to hear something else hilarious?
1005000	1008000	So this game metrics or whatever, which I think is part of IGN, by the way.
1008000	1009000	There's, um...
1009000	1011000	Uh, yes.
1011000	1013000	Well, seeing as it has a little logo on the bottom.
1013000	1014000	IGN.
1014000	1018000	So, again, my friend Melody, thank you to her for getting me this from E3.
1018000	1019000	But this is hilarious.
1019000	1021000	The sources of gamer metrics data.
1021000	1023000	IGN.com game channels.
1023000	1025000	GameSpy.com.
1025000	1027000	Rest in peace.
1027000	1029000	And FilePlanet.com.
1029000	1030000	Is that still a thing?
1030000	1031000	Maybe.
1031000	1033000	Maybe.
1033000	1039000	So there you go. A little glimpse to what gaming life was like ten years ago when...
1039000	1045000	I remember back in the day when they actually used game metrics as an actual metric for the industry.
1045000	1046000	Yeah.
1046000	1047000	That was a while ago.
1047000	1049000	That was a while ago, huh?
1049000	1053000	I want to give a shout out to the Reno Game Expo, which I went to this weekend.
1053000	1055000	Just kind of on a whim.
1055000	1069000	Our pals, Gabe from Nascent Games, he's working on Crumple is a big game he's doing, as well as Kinship is his other game that he's working on right now.
1069000	1073000	And he actually trekked up to the Reno Game Show and was talking about it on Twitter.
1073000	1078000	And I was kind of like, you know, Alan and I have been talking about doing a random Reno trip ever since the 4th of July.
1078000	1082000	He gives us an excuse to go to Steak and Shake, gamble a little bit.
1082000	1083000	So what the hell?
1083000	1087000	So we went up to Reno and went to the Reno Game Expo. So we checked that out a little bit.
1087000	1093000	And there was a lot of vendor tables, different people set up there at the expo.
1093000	1097000	And then if you walk down the hall towards the back, they had some panels going on throughout the day.
1097000	1102000	A lot of music because I believe the Reno Video Game Symphony is kind of the people that put it all on.
1102000	1106000	And then they had just a tournament room and a big free play room.
1106000	1109000	So yeah, it was kind of a smaller show.
1109000	1112000	And I was there in the morning, so I don't know if it filled out more at the end of the day.
1112000	1117000	But I think they also had to relocate at the last minute, which probably kind of hurt them a little bit.
1117000	1121000	They weren't inside the Silver Legacy this year. I guess as they were last year, they were across the street.
1121000	1125000	But you know, there still obviously was a lot of love put out in that show.
1125000	1131000	And lots of fun, cute little vendors and some indie game developers showing off what they were working on.
1131000	1135000	So I finally got to sit Alan down and play through Gabe's game a little bit.
1135000	1138000	And yeah, so there was actually some boost there.
1138000	1143000	So, do you remember Dark Sakura? What did you ask me before I went to Reno? What did you say to me?
1143000	1146000	Uh, do you want to hang out?
1146000	1148000	No, well, and then I said, no, I'm going to Reno, lol.
1148000	1151000	And then you said, bring me back a thing.
1151000	1152000	Oh yeah, I just said a thing.
1152000	1154000	She said, bring me back a thing.
1154000	1160000	So I saw something at, you know, this gal had an Etsy table set up.
1160000	1164000	So a shout out to a Not Your Grammys Etsy shop.
1164000	1166000	That's spelled Grammy, G-R-A-M-M-I-E.
1166000	1169000	It's NYG, Nerdy and Inappropriate.
1169000	1175000	And so I got Dark Sakura a thing from the expo. Close your eyes.
1175000	1177000	Wait, where is it? This makes great radio, doesn't it?
1177000	1183000	As I'm digging through this bag to get Dark Sakura this thing that I'm going to give her.
1183000	1186000	Okay, open your eyes.
1186000	1189000	I love it. Oh my God, this is the best.
1189000	1192000	I'm going to put a picture up like in a minute.
1192000	1194000	So there it is. It's a little...
1194000	1196000	This is going in my cube.
1196000	1198000	When I saw that, I instantly thought of you.
1198000	1203000	It's a little cross stitch of a flying unicorn that looks like Nyan Cat style.
1203000	1207000	And it says, later bitch, on it.
1207000	1212000	And it just, the fact that it was cross stitched just definitely made me think of Dark Sakura.
1212000	1216000	There was all sorts of inappropriate cross stitch that was available there.
1216000	1223000	So again, shout out to Not Your Grammys, who probably had no idea she was selling that to a radio guy, but there you go.
1223000	1230000	A couple other shout outs from the convention I want to give, because I thought these guys were really cool.
1230000	1236000	And I know they're based in Reno, so if you have any listeners in the area, I thought what these guys were doing was really cool.
1236000	1238000	Oh, here it is. I found my flyer.
1238000	1240000	It's the Great Basin Geeks.
1240000	1251000	And it's a group for Jedi, Trekkies, Browncoats, Whovians, Scapers, B5ers, Cylons, Wizards, Rangers, Paladins, Elves, Orcs, and any other geeky guys and gals in or near Northern Nevada.
1251000	1255000	I think they didn't leave anybody out. I think they did cover everybody.
1255000	1260000	For the record, it's now on my Instagram. And my Instagram is DarkSakura.
1260000	1268000	So, shout out to Great Basin Geeks. It sounds like they do a lot of get togethers and things, and they were really cool enough to listen to what we were doing at VOG.
1268000	1273000	We just kind of were talking a little bit, and they even took some of my business cards and were putting those out on the table.
1273000	1277000	So shout out to those guys if any of them are listening. You can check out more information on those guys.
1277000	1283000	GreatBasinGeeks.com, and I thought this was really interesting. They're doing a free convention.
1283000	1286000	Who's ever heard of a free convention? I sure haven't.
1286000	1292000	October 17th and 18th at the Reno Town Mall, the Great Basin Geek Con is going on that weekend.
1292000	1295000	So, congrats to those guys there.
1295000	1299000	And good time at the Reno Game Expo. I will definitely try to go back next year.
1299000	1303000	Also, I have to say I was a little bit inspired.
1303000	1307000	There was definitely a part of me after seeing a con kind of done on a smaller scale like that.
1307000	1311000	I don't go to a lot of smaller cons, because usually I just don't know about them.
1311000	1313000	I'm happy to go if there's one nearby.
1313000	1317000	But I was definitely like, you know, everybody kind of always jokes.
1317000	1321000	When's there going to be a VOG con? When's there going to be an OLR con?
1321000	1326000	And I have to admit, there's a part of me that's like, maybe we should do something.
1326000	1329000	Maybe it's not as hard as we think it is.
1329000	1331000	I'm sure it's harder than we think it is.
1331000	1337000	It probably is in reality, but I mean, you know, we know people that could help us out a little bit, I think.
1337000	1341000	So, I don't know. Just know that that's an idea that's simmering a little bit.
1341000	1344000	Would any of our listeners actually come out to that?
1344000	1348000	I'm not talking like, and Rama's going, no. Rob Roberts, no.
1348000	1352000	I'm not talking like a three-day convention or any like crazy thing.
1352000	1356000	I'm talking about like a day con. Something like that.
1356000	1358000	Just a little like couple hours.
1358000	1359000	I'll tell you what.
1359000	1362000	We'll rent a ballroom somewhere, get some old school video games, and just have a good old time.
1362000	1364000	I'm not telling you like major stuff.
1364000	1371000	We'll rent out some time, and bounce you, and we'll just have like a party, and they'll be bouncing.
1371000	1373000	And they'll have pizza.
1377000	1380000	So you're saying that our con would have a ball pit.
1380000	1382000	Yes, they do have a ball pit there.
1382000	1388000	So, it's not only a ball pit, it's like a ball pit with cannons that fire balls at you.
1388000	1390000	Oh my god, that's a deluxe ball pit.
1390000	1391000	It is a deluxe ball pit.
1391000	1392000	Holy shit.
1392000	1398000	Okay. Well, let's see. We'll have to go to Kickstarter with that. We'll see about that in the future.
1398000	1407000	Alright. Also, one other SSG100 Matt in chat says, cake and pie? Your decision will reflect my decision.
1407000	1409000	I'm sure we could do something where there's cake and pie.
1409000	1413000	And maybe like something that's both, like a Boston cream pie or something.
1414000	1421000	Hey, I want to give one more shout out here because I know a lot of people have their attention diverted tonight
1421000	1425000	and throughout the week to Summer Games Done Quick.
1425000	1430000	I feel like it was just yesterday we were talking about the Awesome Games Done Quick,
1430000	1432000	but that's because they do these things several times a year.
1432000	1433000	Twice.
1433000	1437000	Twice. Well, don't they even do like just like a day or something in like spring?
1437000	1439000	Well, I think they also have their channel games done quick.
1439000	1440000	Yeah.
1440000	1442000	So they may do stuff in between that.
1442000	1445000	But they're running Summer Games Done Quick right now.
1445000	1452000	And last I checked, they were doing Donkey Kong Country 3, I believe was what we were watching being speedrun on that.
1452000	1454000	We were looking at that before the show tonight.
1454000	1458000	So, you know, shout out to those guys raising money for a good cause.
1458000	1461000	And I know a lot of you guys are checking that out on Twitch.
1461000	1465000	But just a reminder, that's going on if you had no idea that that was happening right now.
1465000	1466000	So there you go.
1466000	1473000	Maybe at the VOGCON we could do bad games played really slowly.
1473000	1476000	Maybe. I don't know. Just throwing it out there.
1476000	1481000	Really hard games played by someone that doesn't have the skill to quite complete this in a fashion that's entertaining.
1481000	1484000	Let's have Loki play it.
1484000	1485000	Exactly.
1485000	1488000	A guy who swears easily when he gets easily frustrated with the games.
1488000	1492000	I don't swear when I get easily frustrated.
1492000	1494000	I get really frustrated.
1494000	1498000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, so in other words, me playing games.
1498000	1499000	There you go.
1499000	1504000	Alright, that's all the hodgepodge I had for kicking us off our show tonight and all those shout outs and things.
1504000	1506000	So there you go. Let's get into our gaming week.
1506000	1512000	Before we get into the gaming news for the week, we're going to talk about what types of video games we have been playing this week.
1512000	1514000	So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1514000	1516000	Played some Final Fantasy XIV.
1516000	1520000	I have nothing but duties to do now. Duty.
1521000	1526000	Been playing Dragon Age Origins with some pretty risque mods on them.
1526000	1530000	Dragon Age Inquisition at the same time.
1530000	1532000	Well, not both at the same time.
1534000	1536000	I started playing Words with Friends again.
1536000	1538000	I'm embarrassed.
1540000	1542000	Oh yeah, Five Nights at Freddy's 4.
1542000	1544000	I still suck at it and I screamed.
1544000	1548000	I actually fell off of my chair and landed on the cat.
1548000	1550000	That was a little bit embarrassing.
1550000	1552000	Actually, it was a lot embarrassing.
1552000	1555000	But I will tell you all listeners because it's a night of honesty.
1555000	1559000	Okay, so I heard about the Five Nights at Freddy's 4 stealth release this week.
1559000	1561000	I'm sure it came early.
1561000	1565000	Yeah, I know. It was just kind of one of those like, you know what, I'm done, so fuck it, here it is on Steam, which I think is great.
1565000	1567000	You know what? More companies need to do that.
1567000	1568000	Right?
1568000	1571000	That's like the total anti-AAA company right there.
1571000	1573000	The fuck it, we're done release.
1573000	1574000	Hey, we're done early.
1574000	1575000	What?
1575000	1577000	Done early?
1577000	1578000	That doesn't happen in gaming.
1578000	1580000	What? And it's not broken?
1580000	1581000	So there it goes.
1581000	1586000	ActDeafed in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Happy Summerween.
1586000	1589000	SG100Matt says, I watched a few streams of Five Nights at Freddy's 4.
1589000	1592000	That's as far as I will go because nope.
1592000	1593000	So what's the deal?
1593000	1598000	Honestly, I haven't looked up a lot on Five Nights at Freddy's this time around just because I am weak.
1598000	1600000	But what's like the story this time?
1600000	1602000	It's in your house now or something?
1602000	1604000	You're a little kid.
1604000	1608000	You basically start off with like the little pixel animation and you're the little crying kid.
1608000	1612000	And it's like you have a Freddy Fazbear doll on your bed.
1612000	1616000	And a medical IV dripper next to the bed.
1616000	1619000	And you're in your room scared of the dark.
1619000	1622000	And I haven't really gotten too far into it, mind you.
1622000	1628000	All you have is the ability to run to a door, shut the door that you're in front of, and you have your flashlight.
1628000	1631000	So like you have your closet door.
1631000	1634000	And you have the door leading out into the hallway.
1634000	1637000	And you can look either direction.
1637000	1639000	And then you keep flashing back to your thing.
1639000	1641000	And like Chica got me once.
1641000	1644000	I still haven't gotten what the pattern is to it.
1644000	1647000	But yeah, it's like...
1647000	1650000	I was just crazy. I only made, you know, did like the first night.
1650000	1653000	And I was like, okay, done. I'm just gonna wait for the online.
1653000	1655000	But I still bought it to support it.
1655000	1659000	Because I even bought you one of them.
1659000	1661000	You bought me Five Nights at Freddy's 4?
1661000	1663000	No, you bought me like two or three.
1663000	1666000	I got you two, I think. But I'll get you four if you want it.
1666000	1668000	Because I want to watch you play it and see you scream.
1668000	1670000	Yeah, I know. Everybody's asking about that live stream.
1670000	1673000	And well, I've got to do the vlog jam one still, which is far behind.
1673000	1677000	Rob, if you did it, if you streamed it after me buying you the game.
1677000	1679000	Because I'm offering.
1679000	1681000	I would even get you cheesecake.
1681000	1684000	That is really good incentive.
1684000	1686000	And somewhere Bobby Blackwell is sitting there going,
1686000	1689000	That's all I had to do is offer cheesecake.
1689000	1694000	You and I will go to the Cheesecake Factory and I will buy you whatever the fuck cheesecake you want.
1694000	1698000	Whatever piece of cheesecake you want.
1698000	1699000	Or cake.
1699000	1702000	What if pumpkin cheesecake's out of season and I can't really get what I want?
1702000	1704000	That they have on the menu.
1704000	1707000	I will eat my low carb cheesecake and cry.
1707000	1713000	And you can have the Godiva shit and balls ice cream.
1713000	1715000	Is that a real flavor?
1715000	1717000	I don't know.
1717000	1722000	Rob Robert's Five Nights of Cheesecake presents Rob Robert Plays Five Nights at Freddy's.
1722000	1724000	Shit and Balls Edition.
1724000	1726000	Shit and Balls Edition.
1728000	1732000	I offer that challenge to you, Rob. We must make this happen.
1732000	1736000	Bobby Blackwell in chat is going, I will order a damn cheesecake.
1736000	1740000	And I will also give you this limitation.
1740000	1741000	Saturday.
1741000	1743000	You have to do it.
1743000	1749000	If I do this before the VoG Jam thing, I will never hear the end of it from Bobby Blackwell. Never.
1749000	1751000	I know that's a strong word.
1751000	1753000	I'll play the VoG Jam games.
1753000	1756000	So that means I have to do the VoG Jam games and the Five Nights at Freddy's thing before Saturday.
1756000	1758000	How about do it on Saturday?
1758000	1759000	On Saturday.
1759000	1760000	On Saturday.
1760000	1762000	I could probably do that. We'll see.
1762000	1765000	I will come over and I will get you cheesecake.
1765000	1768000	Will you play the VoG Jam games with me? Because I think it would be more fun if you did.
1768000	1769000	Sure, I could do that.
1769000	1770000	There you go.
1770000	1771000	We'll make a day of it.
1771000	1776000	Okay. But we cap it off with a livestream of Five Nights at Freddy's 4.
1776000	1777000	Alright, fair enough.
1777000	1780000	And then there will be cheesecake. And then you will be baked.
1780000	1783000	And we'll do a periscope at the cheesecake.
1783000	1784000	Yes we will.
1784000	1787000	I'll put a fucking candle on that shit.
1787000	1789000	Just lie and tell him it's my birthday.
1789000	1793000	It's Rob's birthday. I mouth the word un.
1794000	1799000	Is it possible to like, because I'm sure you record your face when you're doing the livestreams and stuff,
1799000	1804000	can you have a second camera that could be facing the cheesecake and you can have cheesecake camera in the corner?
1804000	1807000	No, we're going to go out for the cheesecake afterwards because Rob has to actually sit down and play it.
1807000	1808000	Probably.
1808000	1815000	SSJ100Matt says, going against USL Travis will be pissed. No, we'll be done before USL because I want cheesecake.
1815000	1819000	Hell yeah. I say we do this at noon.
1819000	1822000	But we close off all the doors.
1822000	1825000	Our buddy John from Critical Myth told me already there's no new episodes this week.
1825000	1828000	So it's a repeat marathon. So it's okay if we go against that.
1828000	1832000	So we're like the pre-show to USL.
1832000	1834000	There you go, yes. There you go.
1834000	1838000	We have to set aside enough time for, what, at least three nights, right?
1838000	1841000	I guess. However far you think I'm going to actually be able to get.
1841000	1842000	Hey Rob.
1842000	1843000	What?
1843000	1847000	Rob is going to play Five Nights at Freddy's 4.
1847000	1849000	Anyway, alright.
1849000	1851000	Hey, I win at everything.
1851000	1853000	Your gaming week evolved into cheesecake.
1853000	1856000	I know. Cheesecake is the best motivator.
1856000	1857000	It brings people together.
1857000	1858000	Yeah, I love cheesecake.
1858000	1859000	Ever since the Golden Girls.
1859000	1861000	Alright. And Bobby.
1861000	1862000	That's it.
1862000	1865000	When we stream the cheesecake, we have to play the Golden Girls theme.
1865000	1869000	I still expect cheesecake at Dragon Con.
1869000	1873000	But for you, you can get me liquor that tastes like cheesecake.
1873000	1874000	Alright.
1876000	1878000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1879000	1881000	So this week I did play a few things.
1881000	1885000	I tried, well, I had to download Journey and try a little bit of that.
1885000	1890000	It's mainly showing games to my son to try to give him the place on the other than Lego Marvel superheroes.
1890000	1892000	Because I'm really getting tired of watching him play that game.
1892000	1895000	So I tried introducing him to Journey.
1895000	1897000	I'm like, it's cool. Look how pretty it is.
1897000	1899000	And he's like, I don't like the thing with the glowing eyes.
1899000	1902000	And so, I was like, ah, but it's so pretty.
1902000	1904000	And he's like, I don't care. The thing has glowing eyes.
1904000	1907000	So I stopped playing that after about a couple minutes.
1907000	1910000	But it is gorgeous. I like the update on PlayStation 4.
1910000	1914000	The next game I tried was Minecraft on PlayStation 4.
1914000	1916000	I was like, hey, you can play Minecraft.
1916000	1919000	And he's actually into that idea.
1919000	1922000	He got really excited about it.
1922000	1928000	But he doesn't understand how to work first person shooter style controls.
1928000	1930000	So that may be a little bit difficult.
1930000	1932000	So I have to work with him on that.
1932000	1935000	And he doesn't like the fact that it turns night time.
1935000	1938000	So I'm like, eh, we'll see.
1938000	1941000	I'm like, we can play it without zombies on. That's fine.
1941000	1946000	And then I tried playing DJ Hero 2 today.
1946000	1950000	But the universe decided that it didn't want me to play DJ Hero 2.
1950000	1952000	So it started off, I got this idea.
1952000	1956000	Because my wife is taking the kids out of the house a few hours earlier than our woman.
1956000	1958000	Because I've had to watch them all weekend.
1958000	1961000	And so I was like, I'm going to play some DJ Hero 2.
1961000	1963000	I've been talking about doing it. I'm going to do it.
1963000	1968000	Set everything up. Set up my demo unit DJ Hero controller.
1968000	1970000	It's wired and everything.
1970000	1974000	I pop it in. I go to turn my Xbox on.
1974000	1976000	And it keeps pushing a button.
1976000	1977000	I'm like, what the hell?
1977000	1980000	And the green button stuck because my sister was borrowing the controller.
1980000	1981000	I'm like, shit.
1981000	1984000	So I had to take the whole thing apart to fix the button.
1984000	1985000	And I did that.
1985000	1987000	And put it all back together.
1987000	1989000	I go to play the game. Can't find the disc.
1989000	1991000	God damn it.
1991000	1996000	So I was like, fine. I will go buy another copy at GameStop used.
1996000	1998000	Because it's like a dollar.
1998000	1999000	So whatever.
1999000	2001000	So I run the GameStop.
2001000	2004000	Go grab DJ Hero 1 and 2.
2004000	2006000	Because I think I sold one a long time ago.
2006000	2009000	And if not, who cares? It's a dollar.
2009000	2011000	So I picked those up.
2011000	2013000	I came back home.
2013000	2016000	And DJ Hero 2, the disc will not read.
2016000	2019000	So I played DJ Hero 1 for a little bit.
2019000	2023000	And I got another copy of DJ Hero 2 on the way to the show today.
2023000	2025000	So hopefully that one works.
2025000	2027000	But DJ Hero 1 is pretty good.
2027000	2031000	Except the audio sync on my TV is kind of off.
2031000	2034000	And I even tried recalibering and it's still off.
2034000	2037000	The button presses are synced now.
2037000	2040000	But it seems like when I did the crossfades it's still off by a little bit.
2040000	2041000	I miss them.
2041000	2044000	First off, you're throwing it back with a pick like DJ Hero 2.
2044000	2047000	I mean those games were really underrated and kind of missed.
2047000	2049000	Those games were great.
2049000	2053000	But I wonder, now that you bring up the whole music games and everything.
2053000	2059000	With these new TVs that have insane refresh rates and things compared to what we had 10 years ago.
2059000	2063000	I wonder how that plays into some of these music games you're trying to play.
2063000	2065000	It wasn't even laggy.
2065000	2067000	It was actually my TV because I had calibrated.
2067000	2069000	It had been so long.
2069000	2072000	So the last time I had it calibrated was when I was playing it on my work TV.
2072000	2076000	And the delay was less.
2076000	2079000	So I had to recalibrate, but it still seems off.
2079000	2081000	I may need to do it again.
2081000	2085000	Or try using maybe component cables instead of HDMI or something like that and see if that works.
2085000	2091000	I had my component cables hooked up, but I had my audio split so I could wear my headphones on it.
2091000	2094000	And I was like, I just don't feel like fucking hooking this back up again.
2094000	2096000	Even though it'll take a few seconds.
2096000	2099000	So, I don't know, DJ Hero was fun.
2099000	2104000	I played a little bit of it and then I was like, shit, I better go run some errands.
2105000	2108000	Aside from that, I've been working on my game tirelessly.
2108000	2115000	I've been doing a lot of one-eighth in the morning nights to work on it.
2115000	2120000	I was trying to get it to the point where I could film it and put it up this weekend.
2120000	2124000	But even that was kind of the software that I used, which was free.
2124000	2128000	I had cracked it at one point and it just stopped working.
2128000	2130000	So I did the right thing and bought it.
2130000	2133000	But they took hours to send me the key.
2133000	2138000	So I was pissed off that I went to record this and it has a big old watermark on it and shit.
2138000	2144000	But anyways, I had to tweak the gun on it so that it could rotate it around and stuff.
2144000	2146000	So I'm going to film it once it's done.
2146000	2151000	And once this level's done, which it is pretty much done now, I have to go back and do menus.
2151000	2156000	Go to my actual website that I have the domain purchased for.
2156000	2158000	It's been just sitting there for months.
2158000	2165000	And actually build the website, build the global leaderboards for it, and hook it all together so I can release a demo finally.
2165000	2168000	Wow. So maybe about six months? No, I'm kidding.
2168000	2172000	You joke, but yes, that's probably the time frame.
2172000	2179000	Alright. My gaming week. Like Loki, I also played Journey on PlayStation 4 with the release this week.
2179000	2182000	And it was really great to experience that game again.
2183000	2191000	I have to admit, the game is gorgeous on PlayStation 4, but I kind of thought it was already gorgeous on PlayStation 3.
2191000	2198000	So I actually didn't really notice that big of a graphical upgrade because I already thought the game looked amazing.
2198000	2200000	So, I mean, whatever there.
2200000	2208000	But I just more appreciate that it made me take another look at this game, which really is just one of the greatest games in the past ten years.
2208000	2213000	I mean, undoubtedly. And if for whatever reason you still haven't played Journey, I think now is the time to do it.
2213000	2220000	And, you know, it's just, I don't even know if you can put into words the experience when somebody else,
2220000	2226000	because everybody knows the twist by now, that somebody else will end up there on your journey that is also playing the game.
2226000	2232000	But you have no way of being able to talk to them except through these little chirps that you make with the button.
2232000	2241000	And those chirps will also replenish the flight ribbon or whatever it's called that allows you to do jumps for distances,
2241000	2244000	depending on how many different little symbols you've collected and so forth.
2247000	2255000	And it's really amazing, because you can't talk to that person, the different ways of non-verbal communication that develops.
2255000	2264000	And the person I ended up getting paired with for the majority of the Journey that I played the other night when I downloaded the game was being very helpful.
2264000	2268000	It was actually directing me, basically, where all the secrets are.
2268000	2279000	I would just slightly walk behind him or her in all the levels, and they would kind of lead to wherever all the different secret stuff was.
2279000	2286000	And then I kind of came up with this system where I would chirp twice to say thank you or something, and then they would chirp twice back.
2286000	2288000	And every time I collected a thing.
2288000	2292000	So I don't know, just something like that, even though it sounds silly the way I'm describing it,
2292000	2298000	just kind of the emotional impact that has with such a gorgeous game, with such a gorgeous soundtrack,
2298000	2304000	is just something you just have to experience, because there's really not a lot else like it in gaming right now.
2304000	2313000	So, again, if you have an experienced Journey, now's the time to do it on the PlayStation 4 with the, I'm assuming will be, definitive version of the game.
2313000	2317000	I can't see the game re-releasing again, but I guess you never know.
2317000	2322000	You can't really get, the graphics were simple enough to where I don't know if you could get it looking any better than it was.
2322000	2327000	Right, but I mean, that almost makes it sound like it looks bad, which it doesn't. It's gorgeous.
2327000	2330000	You can't really add more detail to it.
2331000	2336000	I was going to mention, I forgot to mention, I did play another game, Shadow of the Colossus HD.
2336000	2340000	I went back and played that, and that game is frustrating now.
2340000	2345000	Like, I remember having no trouble with it on PlayStation 2, but now when I play it on PlayStation 3,
2345000	2350000	it just seems like a lot harder than I remember, which is kind of odd.
2350000	2353000	Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says,
2353000	2357000	What you'd notice is the frame rate. It's a much smoother experience on PlayStation 4.
2357000	2363000	You know what? I kind of credited that to the TV I'm playing on now, but you're probably right. It is very, very smooth.
2363000	2369000	See, I didn't even think about it. I just remembered it being that smooth. I didn't even remember the frame rate being an issue.
2369000	2373000	And Bobby also says, I only did one playthrough on the PS3. I'm looking forward to revisiting it.
2373000	2377000	I remember being sad when I got separated from my first journey partner.
2377000	2382000	I was really sad, too, because it was starting to be like 1230 in the morning, and I had to go to bed.
2382000	2385000	I was not going to be able to finish a playthrough of the game. I really had to go to bed.
2385000	2392000	So I did that thing where you, I guess when you hit pause or whatever, your character kneels, and they did it, too, like right in front of me.
2392000	2395000	And I'm trying to figure out, like, how do I quit out of the game?
2395000	2398000	And for some reason, I couldn't remember, like, how to, like, bring up the menu to quit.
2398000	2401000	I think I ended up just turning off my PlayStation 4.
2401000	2406000	But they sat down after I sat down, and I ended up getting the trophy, because I guess there's actually a trophy.
2406000	2411000	If you can get two people to sit down and, like, contemplate or whatever for, like, 15 seconds, you get a trophy.
2411000	2414000	So who knows if that person was trying to get it, too. I don't know.
2414000	2418000	But I ended up getting that trophy before I signed out, so I thought that was kind of neat.
2418000	2421000	EnrageNator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2421000	2424000	Don't stop believin' the journey's fun.
2424000	2427000	Of course. Of course there has to be a reference there.
2427000	2430000	All right. So I did play Journey.
2430000	2435000	I also played, of course, more Final Fantasy XIV, because, hello, this is me we're talking about, and I play a lot of that game.
2435000	2440000	And a free company I'm in right now is really into running Alexander, which is the raid.
2440000	2443000	So I've been trying to help out there, and just other random things.
2443000	2449000	Like, another guy in my free company just got to level 50, so I've been trying to help him clear some stuff, and that's it.
2449000	2454000	Otherwise, I kind of think I've hit that point of, I really think I've done everything I can do right now on Final Fantasy XIV.
2454000	2459000	And then I remember, oh yeah, I should probably work on crafting.
2459000	2462000	And then it's like, oh shit, I'm going to fall down the rabbit hole all over again.
2462000	2468000	Well, I did be, I was sure, though, to make time for other games this week, and not let Final Fantasy XIV dominate my entire week.
2468000	2474000	And I will say, the last game I checked out this week that was new was a game that I said last week,
2474000	2477000	you know, everybody's talking about this game, I really need to check it out already.
2477000	2485000	So I played Rocket League on the PlayStation 4, which is, of course, free with PlayStation Plus, as you've probably heard.
2485000	2492000	And you've probably also heard that this game is probably turning out to be way more popular than most people assumed it was going to be.
2493000	2503000	And the concept behind it is that you're basically playing soccer, or I would say it almost feels like air hockey a little bit, but with a ball that can fly up.
2503000	2508000	And then instead of little like, you know, what do they call those things?
2508000	2509000	Paddles.
2509000	2512000	Paddles or whatever you grab onto in air hockey, you're driving a car.
2512000	2521000	And the car controls like, probably like a fast, like arcade racer style car where you can just instantly throw into reverse,
2521000	2529000	you can hit X and do like a quick, or sorry, a square and you can do a quick spin, you can do X to jump or even double jump and do all this crazy stuff.
2529000	2536000	So yeah, I mean, it's one of those things that sounds really simply stupid in concept, but some of the best games are.
2536000	2540000	Go back and look at what was great on the Atari 2600, it was extraordinarily simple games.
2540000	2543000	And it's simple concept, it's a ton of fun.
2543000	2551000	And I haven't even really played online. I'm scared to, because I have no sense of control over the ball.
2551000	2558000	Like I will always try to like jump to intercept the ball and I find myself jumping right over the ball, or I'm just under it, like I just.
2558000	2566000	And then I even went so far as to watch people playing the game on Twitch, because you know on the Playstation it's all built in, it's really easy to see people playing the game, right?
2566000	2570000	And I'm watching these people do crazy shit and I'm just like, I could never.
2570000	2575000	Like they know exactly how high to jump to like intercept the ball and all this stuff, like I can't do that.
2575000	2576000	I'm not that good.
2576000	2592000	But it's just fun to play and I'm playing against the computer, there's a whole like season mode where you are on a team and you do all these other fights for teams all the way to the season final and I guess the Super Bowl of Rocket League or whatever.
2592000	2594000	And I've just been having fun playing that, so.
2594000	2604000	I think if you have Playstation Plus, like seriously, go get Rocket League now, like flag it to your account before it's gone, because it's great.
2604000	2607000	And it's just, it's really simple.
2607000	2611000	There is a tutorial that will help get you situated, but it's not.
2611000	2617000	I mean, it's kind of like, here's how you drive, here's how you boost, here's how you turn, now go play.
2617000	2619000	It's very, very simple.
2619000	2633000	But there are also like drills. I found like there was a, like further within the tutorial you could actually do a mode where like you are in a goalie type position and it just keeps firing balls at you that you just deflect.
2633000	2638000	So like you have to be able to like, I'm going to drive and intercept the ball before it hits the goal.
2638000	2642000	And there's like little drills and things like that that kind of can help you be better, I guess.
2642000	2643000	So, there you go.
2643000	2648000	Justin's in chat saying, Rob, please play Rocket League with me, it's way more fun online.
2648000	2653000	Okay, I will, as long as you promise not to get mad that I'm terrible at it.
2653000	2656000	If you don't mind that I suck, that's fine.
2656000	2657000	There you go.
2657000	2663000	Let's see, Raginator in chat says, I saw a stream of Rocket League on Steam and it looks fun as fuck.
2663000	2665000	That's right, it's on PC as well.
2665000	2667000	But I don't think cross play is a thing.
2667000	2669000	At least I haven't heard if it is.
2669000	2672000	I think it's separate, but I'm sure there's tons of players on both.
2672000	2675000	So it's whatever, whatever.
2676000	2679000	Black Wolf says, advanced tutorial shows you the trick shot.
2679000	2682000	Yeah, that's right, you do like the double tap or whatever.
2682000	2688000	Orange Riot says, Rocket League is way more fun online, most of the people have trouble hitting the ball too.
2688000	2693000	And Justin says, we're all terrible at Rocket League, that's why it's fun.
2693000	2699000	And lastly, Brad from Pod Culture says, Rob will only play if you give him cheesecake.
2700000	2705000	That's why I'm going to name my team, the Sacramento Cheesecakes.
2707000	2709000	That'll be my name in Rocket League.
2709000	2711000	Dungeon Buster says, I should really try Rocket League.
2711000	2712000	Yes you should.
2712000	2716000	It is on Steam, for whatever reason you don't have PS4 yet, it is on Steam as well.
2716000	2718000	So you can check it out wherever.
2718000	2720000	Anyway, there you go.
2720000	2722000	That was my gaming week.
2722000	2724000	So let's get into housekeeping for tonight.
2724000	2728000	There actually is something really important and I probably should have said this earlier in the show.
2728000	2730000	So hopefully you guys have been listening this long.
2730000	2733000	We're actually going to do something a little different next week.
2733000	2735000	We're going to tape early next week.
2735000	2737000	We're going to do an early show next week.
2737000	2739000	This is a good thing for our folks overseas.
2739000	2743000	If you've ever wanted to participate with our show live, you'll have the ability to.
2743000	2751000	And if you're used to listening to this show live at 6 o'clock, don't worry, it will still repeat at its usual time after Bobby Black Wolf.
2751000	2754000	But we are going to tape early next week.
2754000	2756000	I think we're still working out the time.
2756000	2759000	It's probably going to be like 11 a.m. or noon Pacific.
2759000	2762000	Stay tuned to our Twitter feed for all the latest.
2762000	2764000	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2764000	2766000	We are going to do an early show next week.
2766000	2770000	The reason why I don't usually like to change things up too bad on you guys,
2770000	2777000	but a good friend of Dark Soccer and I is actually moving away from San Francisco away.
2777000	2779000	So a long time friend of ours.
2779000	2782000	I think she was on OLR once like years ago.
2782000	2784000	Victoria.
2784000	2787000	She doesn't play a lot of games so I don't know if she had a lot to talk about.
2787000	2790000	But yeah, she's been a good friend of the show.
2790000	2792000	And she's moving.
2792000	2796000	So she's having like a last hurrah goodbye dinner type of thing in the city.
2796000	2800000	So we're going to try to do that on Sunday instead of OLR that night.
2800000	2802000	So I hope you all understand.
2802000	2804000	It's for an occasion that doesn't happen every day.
2804000	2806000	So we're going to do an early show.
2806000	2808000	For overseas people, they're probably thrilled to hear this news.
2808000	2810000	Because you can call in and participate.
2810000	2812000	It'll be at like 8 o'clock in the evening your time.
2812000	2815000	It'll be a much, much better time than it usually is.
2815000	2817000	And SHO 100 Matt in Chat says, Grandpa's wife?
2817000	2821000	Yes, it's Grandpa's legally separated wife at this point.
2821000	2823000	Because Grandpa moved.
2823000	2825000	They live in separate places now and she's moving.
2825000	2828000	So yes, it's Grandpa's wife for those of you that were listening to Hoard House.
2828000	2831000	So there you go.
2831000	2837000	As SHO 100 Matt in Chat also says, Rob will end up with a huge ass after all these cheesecake game invites.
2837000	2840000	You know what? Worth it.
2840000	2842000	Totally worth it.
2842000	2844000	You could get low carb cheesecake if you wanted.
2844000	2846000	Now what's the fucking point of that?
2846000	2850000	I could. I could also, I don't know, rip my fingernails off one by one.
2850000	2852000	But why would I do that?
2852000	2855000	Because you're eating low carb cheesecake, of course.
2855000	2857000	It's actually delicious.
2858000	2860000	I've had it before. It's okay.
2860000	2863000	It's okay, but I don't think they make pumpkin low carb cheesecake. I'm just saying.
2863000	2865000	I know how to.
2866000	2870000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight, you guys.
2870000	2874000	Traveling around, talking about what's been happening in our fun little industry this week.
2874000	2876000	Loki, start us off.
2876000	2883000	Alright, so everybody that's pre-ordered Street Fighter V was all set and excited to play the Street Fighter V beta.
2884000	2891000	Well, hope you keep that excitement because the beta was shut down pretty quickly.
2891000	2894000	Unfortunately, they were running into issues with it.
2894000	2902000	And they had to perform some maintenance, or extended maintenance, during which the beta will not be available.
2902000	2909000	And unfortunately, they will reopen that again later on once they've fixed whatever problems there are.
2909000	2911000	But that's why it's a beta test.
2911000	2914000	It's a beta test. Gotta get all your bugs out now.
2917000	2919000	There's a part of me that kind of agrees.
2919000	2923000	Like, okay, yeah, it's a beta test. This shit's gonna happen.
2923000	2926000	When you agree to do a beta test, this is part of what you sign up for.
2926000	2931000	You know, they're testing their online so that this shit won't happen when the quote unquote real game comes out.
2931000	2936000	The only part that kind of doesn't, like, it sits in an awkward place with me
2936000	2943000	is the fact that they're basically selling this beta with preorders for Street Fighter V.
2943000	2947000	So, people that are trying to get into the beta, they did pay for it, right?
2947000	2951000	Am I incorrect? Is there a free way to get into the beta without preordering?
2951000	2952000	I don't think so.
2952000	2961000	So, that's the only thing that kind of sits kind of with me is that you are paying to get into it, so it probably should work.
2961000	2964000	But I kind of feel like, again, at the end of the day...
2964000	2965000	Like, if you're buying a game to play a beta...
2965000	2966000	Yeah, I know.
2966000	2972000	...and you're dropping $5, you know, a year before the, you know, six months before it comes out, then...
2972000	2976000	And you know there's people out there, though, that are like rage...
2976000	2981000	You know there's the rage post out there about, I'm not gonna buy the full game now because it's beta, so...
2981000	2985000	Whatever. You know what? They're gonna reopen the beta at a later date.
2985000	2990000	Be glad that this is now and, you know, they didn't just do it sans beta and like,
2990000	2993000	oh, well fuck, all of our online play's fucked, so sorry.
2993000	2999000	And that's the part of it where I'm okay with it, so at least if they're seeing, like, Meltdown Supreme happen right now,
2999000	3002000	then they can fix that before the game goes live.
3002000	3004000	No one will remember when the game comes out.
3004000	3009000	Yeah. There's that whole Miyamoto thing, right? A bad game's bad forever.
3009000	3014000	But a good game, you know, people will forget the delays. So...
3014000	3020000	Yeah, it's like Zelda on the DS and GameCube.
3020000	3027000	Speaking of delays, of sorts, not really, but I know there's some people that may delay their decisions
3027000	3031000	to buy Rise of the Tomb Raider when they hear this news.
3031000	3035000	Because, you know, Rise of the Tomb Raider, it's going to be a Xbox One exclusive.
3035000	3038000	It's this big thing that they were trumpeting at E3 and so forth.
3038000	3039000	Yeah, it's exclusive.
3039000	3041000	And they're... It is.
3041000	3044000	It is exclusive to them.
3044000	3045000	For now.
3045000	3046000	That's a huge deal.
3046000	3048000	For now. But guess what's going to happen?
3048000	3054000	In early 2016, Rise of the Tomb Raider will launch for Windows 10 on the PC.
3054000	3057000	But it was exclusive. This isn't supposed to happen.
3057000	3059000	No, no, no, no. It's timed exclusive.
3059000	3060000	Timed exclusive.
3060000	3066000	But that's impossible. They totally convinced me that it was never coming to other platforms.
3066000	3071000	I mean, we were so confident when they announced that at E3 that, like,
3071000	3074000	we knew that there was no possible way that this was ever happening.
3074000	3081000	Well, Loki, it gets better. Because Square Enix also announced PlayStation 4 in Holiday 2016.
3081000	3085000	So there it is. PlayStation 4 is locked out for one year.
3085000	3088000	Wow. No one's going to give a shit about that game in a year's time.
3088000	3091000	Well, hold on. Hold up. Put the car in park.
3091000	3097000	Because I seem to recall, wasn't there this whole thing about the first Tomb Raider
3097000	3102000	and there was a lot of crap going around because Tomb Raider didn't sell,
3102000	3106000	and I'm using my quote-y fingers, enough copies, that Square Enix was,
3106000	3110000	and I'm using my quote-y fingers, disappointed with Tomb Raider and that whole thing,
3110000	3114000	with the sales or whatever, even though it had sold, like, millions, right?
3114000	3116000	Because I remember we were all sitting here going,
3116000	3120000	how is this game because A, it's a great fucking game,
3120000	3123000	and B, it's selling, like, seven million or something,
3123000	3125000	and Square Enix said that was a disappointment.
3125000	3130000	But then, and my point is that then later, because of all these deep discounts,
3130000	3134000	you know, PlayStation sales, Microsoft sales, Steam sales,
3134000	3137000	they were selling way more copies of the game.
3137000	3139000	Like, it was 11 billion copies at this point.
3139000	3141000	Exactly. Like, I was looking through my PlayStation library and I'm like,
3141000	3144000	I don't even remember bringing this in here, but there it is.
3144000	3147000	And then that doesn't even count the fact that they remastered it
3147000	3151000	and did it again for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and probably still made money off it.
3151000	3154000	Well, I'm sure everyone on PlayStation 4 will enjoy picking up the Game of the Year edition
3154000	3157000	with all the DLC when it comes out a year later.
3157000	3159000	You know, that's what's going to fucking happen.
3159000	3163000	It sucks for you Xbox people that are going to be picking it up a year early.
3163000	3169000	Well, I don't, I mean, you say that, but I'm probably still going to buy it on Xbox One this holiday
3169000	3172000	because I really want to play it because the last Tomb Raider game was so good, so.
3172000	3175000	Yeah, I'm feeding the system.
3175000	3183000	Don't we all? I mean, what, I don't understand the logic of just waiting a whole year to buy it
3183000	3186000	for, you know, the other platform. I don't know.
3186000	3190000	Is it going to be cheaper or something? Maybe? I don't know.
3190000	3195000	I don't get the logic either, but also the logic doesn't make any sense where,
3195000	3199000	oh, I'm going to buy a system for Tomb Raider. I don't think anybody's going to do that.
3199000	3202000	People like Tomb Raider, but it's not going to sell systems.
3202000	3207000	It's not usually one game, Loki, but a handful of games will do it, of which Tomb Raider could be one of.
3207000	3211000	And, you know, a lot of the Microsoft marketing stuff has been showing, like, you know,
3211000	3217000	this is our exclusive lineup, and they've got, you know, Halo 5 right next to the Rare Replay,
3217000	3222000	right next to the Gears of War, I don't have Gears of War remasters in that,
3222000	3225000	and then the Tomb Raider's there, and then, you know.
3225000	3227000	Crackdown, Forza.
3227000	3228000	Yeah, Forza.
3228000	3229000	Motorsport 6.
3229000	3233000	Yeah, 6 or whatever they're on now. So, you know, and that's their little thing is that, you know,
3233000	3238000	we've got all these games, so when you look at that, I think it's not necessarily one game,
3238000	3242000	but maybe, like, oh, there's a handful of games I want to play on it.
3242000	3248000	Alright, I'm just saying, you know, it's going to come out later, and you'll be able to get cheaper,
3248000	3250000	and it'll have more content in it.
3250000	3251000	Well, I mean, it's not like-
3251000	3255000	Or if it's not cheaper, it'll just have more content in it.
3255000	3261000	I don't know. I guess we'll see. I guess you pay a premium to have the game a little early,
3261000	3265000	but isn't that true of every single game? I mean, because if you wait long enough,
3265000	3270000	a game is going to be on discount, be it, again, one of these PlayStation Flash sales,
3270000	3273000	or a Steam sale, or Humble Bundle, or something, you know?
3273000	3278000	Games are always going to go on sale eventually, and probably after about a year.
3278000	3283000	I'm just worried, like, you know, because it's- I think people are going to lose interest in it, maybe?
3283000	3288000	You know, because when games get delayed for a long time, like, especially a year is a long time,
3288000	3291000	there's going to be a lot of stuff that's going to come out between now and then.
3291000	3295000	You know, people might be excited about Tomb Raider now, on Xbox One,
3295000	3300000	but in a year's time, maybe they won't care about, you know, Tomb Raider,
3300000	3306000	because Uncharted 4 will have come out, and all these other games that hopefully Sony will release.
3306000	3307000	Well, I do-
3307000	3308000	Aside from Uncharted 4.
3308000	3314000	I do think you're right that Square will do something to the game to get it to be re-noticed on PlayStation 4,
3314000	3318000	because you're right, at that point, now it has to compete against Uncharted,
3318000	3325000	which is, you know, which will probably be a huge holiday game, or maybe not summer game, next year for Sony.
3325000	3327000	You know, it's going to be huge.
3327000	3330000	So yeah, it'll be weird if the two games are competing against each other.
3330000	3336000	I would think Square Enix would do something to say, but this is the You Gotta Have It edition.
3336000	3340000	Let's just hope it gets good reviews too, because I mean, the last one did get good reviews,
3340000	3346000	but let's just- I mean, Arkham Knight got, you know, could have had some good reviews too on PC,
3347000	3354000	but like, I'm talking like other platforms, there's a lot of like, assumptions being made here.
3354000	3359000	I don't know, I'm sure that whatever money that they are getting from this exclusive deal,
3359000	3362000	they made a cost-benefit analysis on it, and they're like,
3362000	3366000	okay, this is the best course of action for us to be profitable in this game,
3366000	3370000	and fine, this isn't what they chose. Whatever.
3370000	3375000	Alright, well we'll see what happens. At least they have a few extra months to make that PC version, you know.
3375000	3381000	Yeah, or the PlayStation 4 version, yeah. I'm looking forward to seeing that hopefully be better.
3381000	3384000	Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
3384000	3388000	Well, it would help if it would load. Okay.
3388000	3395000	So, there has been a bunch of talk about the ending of Silent Hills, how that project fell apart,
3395000	3398000	because Konami is being a butthole.
3398000	3402000	Okay, maybe there's more technical to it than that, but I'm not gonna go into it.
3402000	3412000	Anyway, it actually has been stated by Del Toro that he actually keeps in touch with Kojima,
3412000	3418000	and the two of them still plan on collaborating in the future on a game,
3418000	3423000	and it did say specifically on a game, but he specified it would not be a Silent Hill game.
3423000	3428000	In fact, his quote is that, says, I love working with Kojima-san.
3428000	3435000	We are still in touch, we are still friends, and looking into doing something together, but that's not going to be Silent Hills.
3435000	3444000	He had mentioned before too that he was done with games, but I have a feeling that what they're working on is definitely gonna be a game.
3444000	3448000	Maybe something along the line of Silent Hill, who knows.
3448000	3450000	Please look forward to the Kickstarter.
3450000	3452000	We will.
3452000	3458000	Well, even if Guillermo Del Toro is done with games, you know, maybe they could still collaborate,
3458000	3463000	and what happens is that Kojima does the game, and Guillermo Del Toro can maybe do a movie or a TV show.
3463000	3469000	Yeah, here's an idea, hmm, I don't know, we could have another giant mech movie that Del Toro made,
3469000	3473000	and hmm, Kojima did work on a mech game.
3473000	3475000	Metal Gear the movie?
3475000	3478000	No, no, didn't he do...
3478000	3480000	Arizona of the Enders, no.
3480000	3481000	Yeah, Arizona of the Enders.
3481000	3486000	So are you thinking that possibly Kojima could do something with Pacific Rim? Is that...
3486000	3489000	Maybe, I don't know, that'd be kinda cool. Like a Pacific Rim game.
3489000	3491000	They already said they're working on the sequel.
3491000	3496000	I know that is a thing that's happening, but is Guillermo Del Toro doing the sequel?
3496000	3501000	I thought I heard he wasn't doing the sequel. I mean, he's probably involved in a production story capacity, but I don't think he's doing it.
3501000	3510000	Or how about we merge the two together? It'll be Pacific Rim style mechs fighting like evil things in Silent Hill.
3510000	3512000	Call it deep silent.
3512000	3518000	I still think there's a lot of people out there that would really like to see the P.T. thing kind of realized.
3518000	3527000	And to be honest, there wasn't that much Silent Hill really in what they showed on that P.T.
3527000	3532000	So they could still kind of take that, and probably, I mean, besides the obvious trailer at the end,
3532000	3536000	but you know, they could probably still take a lot of those same concepts and put them into a game.
3537000	3545000	Of course, if Konami funded P.T., then they can't exactly, technically, Konami owns all that shit in P.T.
3545000	3547000	So I don't think you're gonna be able to-
3547000	3551000	They can have the little rooms and trailer.
3551000	3557000	Whatever characters or things you saw couldn't really come to a full game, but I think if Guillermo Del Toro and Kojima are like,
3557000	3561000	we have this different idea for a scary game, I think the entire internet's gonna be like,
3561000	3570000	Yes! Take my money. Shenmue money, Kickstarter, biggest of all time could probably be challenged by whatever they would come out and announce.
3570000	3572000	So, we'll see.
3572000	3582000	But I think that would be really neat if they worked together to maybe build a franchise where Guillermo Del Toro has the Netflix show that goes with the Kojima game,
3582000	3586000	and they kind of help each other out a little bit, but it's still kind of separated, if that makes sense.
3586000	3588000	That'd be kind of cool. I don't know.
3589000	3591000	Let's see, Tigerclaw in chat says,
3591000	3595000	You know how developers leave the company and make a game that's a spiritual successor to a previous game?
3595000	3597000	Well, yeah. I mean, you're seeing that with-
3597000	3601000	Yes, Mighty No. 9 is totally not Mega Man. Totally different.
3601000	3604000	It's different enough, Wink Nudge.
3607000	3609000	Anyway, Dungeon Buster in chat says,
3609000	3612000	May still be considered proprietary tech for Konami.
3612000	3618000	And you know, there's some people out there saying, and again, this could just be a bunch of hot air, and it probably is,
3618000	3622000	that Capcom is just waiting for Mighty No. 9 to come out and then they're gonna sue.
3622000	3631000	Which would be such a dick thing to do this late along, but that way they could get all the money from it without ever having to have done work.
3631000	3634000	Well, you know what? I'd like to see them do that.
3634000	3638000	And you know why I'd like to see them do that? Because then I can write them off even faster.
3638000	3642000	It would be very- yeah, the backlash would be significant, I think.
3642000	3649000	You think people are pissed off at Konami? I mean, at least Konami's not making any more games, I mean, that people are gonna buy.
3649000	3655000	I'm not trying to fear Monger. I'm not saying that is gonna happen. I'm just saying it's not off the table. It could.
3655000	3656000	No, it's not off the table.
3656000	3658000	But I could get hit by a car when I go walk down the street too.
3658000	3664000	That anniversary collection's coming around the corner and no one has to buy that either, so, you know, keep that in mind, Capcom.
3664000	3669000	You know, maybe you shouldn't have fucking, um, I don't know, gotten rid of the person doing Mega Man because you said,
3669000	3674000	oh, Mega Man doesn't sell, or whatever the fucking reasons were. I'm sure they were bullshit.
3674000	3679000	Yeah, we remember- we've seen the prototype footage of what you wanted Mega Man to be.
3679000	3684000	Or, like, I would like to call it, uh, the Bomberman Act Zero of Mega Man.
3686000	3691000	Alright, well, TigerCall on chat says Capcom sent enough shit as it is with the Street Fighter V beta, not worrying.
3691000	3692000	Well, that's-
3692000	3693000	I think people will get past that, though.
3693000	3694000	I mean, it's not like-
3694000	3696000	That's more hot water than, you know.
3696000	3702000	If you want to be mad at Capcom, you can be mad at Capcom for, like, you know, putting, you know, for canceling Mega Man Legends 3,
3702000	3709000	uh, for insulting everybody by putting box art Mega Man in fucking Marvel vs. Capcom 3.
3709000	3711000	Like, that's a big troll move right there.
3711000	3718000	Um, now presenting Loki's list of things that should piss you off more than the Street Fighter V beta.
3718000	3720000	DLC on disc? I mean, I don't know.
3721000	3725000	Alright, Loki, let's- let's shift gears. Let's do a different topic.
3725000	3728000	Alright, so let's talk about Dave & Busters.
3728000	3739000	And Dave & Busters, once again, kind of in the news here, because they're maybe gonna be the way that Pokken Tournament comes to the North American market.
3740000	3750000	And, um, you know, right now, they- I guess there was a Reddit AMA with, um, Dave & Busters Senior Vice President, um, Kevin Bacchus,
3750000	3758000	and he's basically saying that, you know, there's a possibility, you know, that they may be bringing this game to their chain.
3758000	3762000	Um, you know, saying, you know, you guys are on good terms with Nintendo Namco, right?
3762000	3767000	Pokken fighters would be likely, um, to at least get a location test of the operator, right?
3767000	3770000	And he says, yes, we will be testing Pokken.
3770000	3777000	Candidly, both Namco and I are more optimistic about that title than our typical guests at, um, than Tekken.
3777000	3781000	So, that would be kind of cool. It looks like a weird game.
3781000	3782000	Might check it out.
3782000	3789000	Yeah, it looks, uh, it looks kind of crazy, but, um, that whole, like, Q&A that was going on with the Dave & Busters guy on Reddit,
3789000	3794000	that was, um, really interesting, because, uh, a lot of the music game fans found that and stormed on that,
3794000	3801000	and were asking questions about, like, all these different music games, and, you know, compared to most executives, you would think,
3801000	3806000	like, this guy was pretty well educated on, like, what the Bomani series was and what games were out there,
3806000	3808000	so I just thought, I thought that whole thing was an interesting read.
3808000	3812000	Well, I would think that you would have to be up in your, you know, market and stuff.
3812000	3816000	I mean, if you're selling video games, then you know the video game market.
3816000	3820000	Um, if you're running an arcade, you know the arcade market.
3820000	3826000	I mean, that only makes sense that you would know that. If you don't know it, then how are you going to survive in that business?
3826000	3831000	I thought it was, I thought it was very interesting, too, especially in talk about a lot of those Bomani games, you know,
3831000	3836000	having, having been in that fandom for years and years, and really still am to an extent,
3836000	3843000	but, um, I thought it was very interesting, just the very frank talk of, if it doesn't make money, we can't put it in the store.
3843000	3848000	You know, like, these games have to perform to a certain standard, or, you know, we can't, we can't really do it.
3848000	3856000	I just thought there was some very frank dialogue that, you know, I don't know, maybe also says something about the state of arcades on a bigger level,
3856000	3861000	but, you know, if you want these games to stay, you have to go play them, essentially, right?
3861000	3863000	Who would have thought?
3863000	3871000	Alright, well, shifting gears here to another rumor that's going around, but this one's, this one's worth talking about,
3871000	3881000	because, you know, Universal had that agreement with Nintendo not that long ago that had to do with doing Nintendo things in theme parks.
3881000	3887000	So, Universal and Nintendo signed this agreement where, you know, Nintendo characters could be in the theme parks and so on.
3887000	3889000	This happened probably just a couple months ago.
3889000	3897000	Well, there's a rumor gaining steam out there around different blogs, take it with a grain of salt, because it is a rumor, but imagine the possibilities.
3897000	3906000	Universal apparently planning to create a third park as a part of Universal Orlando that is a video game heavy park.
3906000	3910000	It would not just have Nintendo rides.
3910000	3916000	Apparently, rumor is that there are other publishers and developers such as Activision Blizzard on board.
3916000	3923000	A World of Warcraft attraction is apparently in development, along with a Mario Kart ride,
3923000	3927000	because you have to fucking have a Mario Kart ride if you're going to do a Nintendo theme park.
3927000	3930000	A Pokemon ride and a Zelda ride.
3930000	3937000	Now, of course, this is a heavy rumor, but this would make a lot of sense that, of course, you're going to try to leverage some other brands and not just Nintendo.
3937000	3939000	You're not just going to have Nintendo World.
3939000	3942000	You might have something for other age ranges as well.
3942000	3944000	That would be pretty cool.
3944000	3946000	I hope they do it, obviously.
3946000	3952000	The gamer in me would love to see this actually become a reality, as long as they do it right.
3952000	3963000	That would be so fucking amazing, as if by the time that park came about that we had AR technology good enough to where you could wear AR goggles while driving the Mario Kart to actually play Mario Kart.
3963000	3966000	That probably could be a thing. Who knows?
3966000	3972000	ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com suggests Pokemon Snap the ride.
3972000	3976000	Why not? It was on rails. They could totally have a Pokemon Snap ride.
3976000	3981000	Every theme park has a little kid section, and I could totally see that being a little kid ride.
3982000	3985000	I would just ride it. I don't care about little kids.
3985000	3989000	But I ride the little kid stuff at Disneyland once in a while, too.
3989000	3991000	It's all about Bugsland.
3991000	3995000	Yeah, the little Bugsland has some cute stuff in it, so why not?
3995000	4001000	It also has some really stupid stuff in it, too, like that movie they do for Bugs Life.
4001000	4003000	Like, no, go away. It's bad.
4003000	4005000	Well, I do have some disappointing news, though.
4005000	4012000	You know, the early rumors are that this park is actually going to be based entirely around Metroid Prime Federation Force.
4012000	4014000	So, I hope you enjoy that.
4014000	4017000	That's why it's so important to Nintendo.
4017000	4020000	Oh, we need to start a petition. Can't have that.
4020000	4022000	I'm going to change .org right now.
4022000	4028000	No Metroid Federation Force allowed at the Universal Theme Park.
4030000	4032000	Oh, you troll. I love it.
4032000	4036000	All right, speaking of Nintendo, Dark Soccer, you got something else for us before release dates?
4036000	4038000	I do indeed.
4038000	4040000	Nintendo's getting weird with their patents.
4040000	4050000	I mean, I guess kind of not weird, but they have this patent out for a wireless sleep monitor.
4050000	4060000	Basically, what it is, it looks like it's kind of a digital alarm clock with a charging station for, like, an iPhone or something.
4060000	4065000	It has speakers on the front and then the rear of it has a ceiling projector on it.
4065000	4072000	So, you can, like, their patent says, and I'm just going to read it on here.
4072000	4078000	This information processing system comprises a portable terminal.
4078000	4083000	The portable terminal detects sensor information for assessing a user's emotions.
4083000	4089000	It would be permissible, as an example, for the sensor information to be sound information,
4089000	4094000	which is detected by a microphone, or image information, which is captured by a camera.
4094000	4099000	No idea what this is for, but, like, there's pictures.
4099000	4104000	It has images being directly put up on the ceiling.
4104000	4109000	I mean, the patent came out last year.
4109000	4113000	They actually did reveal it to their investors.
4114000	4123000	But it was supposed to be, I think, just something for an arm other than games development, like, for another business arm as the company expanded.
4123000	4131000	Well, we are seeing that Nintendo's getting into other things, such as, you know, the Amiibo is a very, you know, physical, huge market for them now.
4131000	4135000	And I thought we heard something a while ago about Nintendo exploring some of these other avenues.
4135000	4141000	And I think Nintendo's always taken an interest in this whole, like, mind and body type of stuff.
4141000	4146000	I mean, look at some of the stuff that's done very well for Nintendo. Wii Fit, Brain Training.
4146000	4151000	You know, these were all things that were rooted in taking a game experience beyond maybe just a game.
4151000	4164000	Well, the other thing on here is that it talks about having sensors, remote sensors, to detect pulse rate, temperature, humidity, that would bring this in through the camera, or microphone, or another input of some sort.
4165000	4169000	And that it also did reflect the Wii Balance Board being used to measure weight.
4169000	4177000	All of it's supposed to be uploaded to Nintendo servers and giving you a sleep score that you would get on the ceiling. That was part of it.
4177000	4179000	I could see Nintendo doing something like this.
4179000	4180000	Competitive sleeping.
4180000	4182000	Well, yeah, like a sleep training type of thing.
4182000	4183000	I'm gonna win that one.
4185000	4187000	Finally, a video game I can be good at.
4187000	4198000	But, you know, like, one of the reasons people buy Fitbits is to monitor, like, their sleep activity, but there's only, like, does the Apple Watch do that too?
4198000	4202000	No, but I'm hoping for there to be an app for it. The thing is, I put mine on my charger overnight.
4202000	4204000	But the thing charges in, like, 20 minutes anyway.
4204000	4205000	Yeah.
4205000	4211000	But I'm wondering if there isn't something there Nintendo is sensing that they're maybe trying to get ahead of the game a little bit, which is what they need to do, right?
4211000	4215000	They need to, instead of playing catch up, they need to be ahead of the curve.
4215000	4220000	So maybe they're sensing, like, people might have an interest in getting better sleep at night.
4220000	4225000	Like, who doesn't wake up crabby sometimes because they didn't sleep well enough at night?
4225000	4232000	Maybe Nintendo is trying to do something to that experience, and I could totally see a huge marketing thing with that, you know, about.
4232000	4235000	Yeah. It looks like marketing, but you know what they're doing.
4235000	4236000	What?
4236000	4241000	Because this is the only way they're gonna stay ahead of the competition. By stealing your dreams.
4242000	4249000	They are going in there with this device, and they are stealing your dreams. It's being beamed straight to Nintendo. That is how they're gonna get ahead.
4249000	4259000	They're actually par- it's- that was the plot of Super Mario 2. That's how Wart is gonna come back. He's gonna actually be stealing dreams. Wart will be in this device somehow.
4259000	4261000	What do you think Reggie is? In disguise.
4264000	4268000	It was a warning. We didn't even see it. And now we're too late.
4272000	4278000	Oh god, I feel like it's an episode of Scooby-Doo. It was Wart the whole time. We all wondered what happened to him.
4280000	4282000	Why isn't he in Smash Brothers?
4282000	4287000	That's a good- I asked this question like a year ago. Like, what the fuck ever happened to Wart?
4287000	4295000	Like, and a lot of those characters in Mario 2 were kind of infamous. I know the Shy Guys have come back, and I think there were a couple others as well.
4295000	4302000	Like Birdo I think we've seen again in some places. But there were a lot of cool characters in Mario 2 that just really kind of fucking disappeared.
4302000	4310000	And maybe a part of that was because of the fact that it wasn't really Mario 2 to begin with in Japan. It was that whole TV tie-in.
4310000	4315000	For Mario Maker, did they have a Mario 2 style in there, or was it just-
4315000	4324000	I don't think so, because that's A, it's either probably DLC later on, or B, remember Mario 2 didn't really play like the other Marios because the characters could all do different things.
4325000	4326000	The Princess float-
4326000	4331000	Whatever, you can do shit in Mario Maker that you can't do in a normal- I mean there's not Chain Chomps in Super Mario Brothers.
4331000	4332000	Yeah, so-
4332000	4337000	So, I think it's just Super Mario 1, 3, and World, and-
4337000	4338000	The Wii version.
4338000	4340000	Yeah, new Super Mario.
4340000	4346000	I would imagine too, they're probably just saving for DLC or something. They'll probably be a Game Boy one at some point too.
4346000	4349000	You can make your own Super Mario Land. I don't know.
4350000	4354000	Let's see, Tigerclaw points out the Shy Guys were in Doki Doki Panic.
4354000	4356000	And Dark Tetsuya said,
4356000	4361000	I know there was an episode of Gaming Historian on YouTube where he talked in depth about the Super Mario 2 thing.
4361000	4364000	So, there you go.
4364000	4365000	DungeonBuster in chat says,
4365000	4370000	We need an idea for new Mario levels. Bring up Dream number 3324-552.
4371000	4380000	Alright, let's travel around the world and see what dreams are becoming a reality as we check out this week's release dates around the world, starting in the US. Loki?
4380000	4386000	There's a Legend of K anniversary edition coming out on Wii U and Playstation 4.
4386000	4392000	Last I remembered, this was a Wii game, so I guess it's being ported over to those systems.
4392000	4397000	BlazBlue Chronofantasma Extend on Playstation Vita.
4397000	4399000	Lost Dimension on the Vita.
4400000	4405000	King's Quest, Chapter 1, that's going to be coming out as a download.
4405000	4406000	I'm excited about that.
4406000	4412000	Playstation 4, Playstation 3, I'm guessing PC and Xbox 360 and Xbox One.
4412000	4416000	They also are selling the complete collection for that as well.
4416000	4420000	So, if you don't want to wait, you can purchase everything for 40 bucks.
4420000	4426000	Along with that, let's see, that'll be it actually.
4427000	4431000	Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out some releases over there on the Playstation 4.
4431000	4437000	F1 2015 is out this week from Ubisoft as well as Fushigi no Chronicle.
4437000	4444000	Furikari Masen Katsu Madewa comes out from Spike this week on the Playstation 4.
4444000	4448000	On the Wii U this week, haha, there's nothing.
4448000	4450000	I don't even know when the next game comes out in Japan.
4450000	4454000	I think it's probably Mario Maker. I think they get it on the 10th of September.
4454000	4457000	But, yeah, nothing coming out there on the Wii U.
4457000	4460000	Playstation Vita still gets a lot of love over in Japan.
4460000	4463000	And there is a ton coming out on the Vita this week.
4463000	4470000	Dyson Ryaku Exceed 2, date a live twin edition, Rio reincarnation.
4470000	4472000	Well, it's better than Davey and a dead twin.
4475000	4478000	In regular and limited edition.
4478000	4481000	And it looks like it's based off an anime or something.
4481000	4483000	I'm not, because of course it is.
4483000	4484000	You don't say.
4484000	4486000	Who else would you be dating besides anime girls?
4486000	4492000	Follow the protagonist, Shido Itsuka, a second year student from the Ryzen High School,
4492000	4495000	to conduct his mission to save spirits of girls.
4495000	4500000	Mysterious existences coming from bordering dimensions containing unpredictable evil powers.
4500000	4505000	Players will have to balance the time in order to keep the balance of affection points with various characters.
4505000	4511000	While rescuing girls seems not that easy, Shindo has to date the girls for the sake of sealing the power.
4512000	4516000	I must save them by having sex with each of them.
4516000	4519000	Dates do not always have to involve copulation, thank you.
4519000	4521000	I understand that, but he's sealing the power.
4521000	4523000	But they better involve cheesecake.
4523000	4525000	They better involve cheesecake.
4526000	4530000	Date a live twin, Rio reincarnation, out this week in Japan.
4530000	4532000	From compile.
4532000	4534000	Of course it's compile.
4535000	4544000	Heart no Kunen no Alice, new version, regular and limited edition coming out this week on the PlayStation Vita.
4544000	4554000	A game called Clap! Kind Love and Punish comes out, also in a regular and limited edition this week.
4554000	4558000	And that one looks like it's also based on an anime, but this one looks like it has a lot of dudes.
4558000	4562000	Clap! Kind Love and Punish. Is that an anime I don't know about?
4563000	4566000	It's Clap! with a K. Clap your hands.
4567000	4572000	Natsumegu comes out on the Vita, as well as Prince of Stride.
4572000	4579000	And Zetai Meikyu Himitsu no Oyayube Hime comes out this week in Japan.
4579000	4581000	That is a ton of shit on the PlayStation Vita.
4581000	4585000	That's like all the games we're getting in an entire year here in the US.
4585000	4586000	They're getting in like one week in Japan.
4586000	4593000	That reminds me, when did they ever come up with as far as the voting goes for whether you're going to continue on doing Japanese release dates?
4593000	4599000	We postponed that because Dark Sakura was out for a few weeks. We're going to have to bring that back. We'll set a time for that.
4599000	4602000	Maybe in like two weeks we'll do it.
4602000	4603000	Eventually.
4603000	4607000	Yeah, eventually. Because next week's the early show. Maybe in two weeks we'll do that.
4608000	4612000	Lastly on the Nintendo 3DS. Oh, here you go Loki.
4613000	4616000	If the live twin game wasn't up your alley, you ready for this one?
4619000	4620000	I can't even read it without laughing.
4621000	4630000	Nintendo 3DS presents Corpse Party! Blood-Covered Repeated Fear comes out this week on the 3DS.
4632000	4633000	It's actually a pretty popular game.
4634000	4635000	Is it?
4635000	4636000	Yeah, Corpse Party.
4636000	4637000	I don't know the series at all.
4637000	4639000	It came out I think on the Wii.
4639000	4640000	Oh.
4640000	4641000	I think it was the Wii title.
4641000	4647000	It may have been a Wii eShop title. I thought it was the Wii. It was Wii or Vita or something like that.
4647000	4651000	All these ghosts are making this girl cry in this picture. It's not very nice.
4652000	4653000	So there you go.
4653000	4658000	Dark Tetsuya says, that's an old one. I think it goes back to the PC-98, one of those old Japanese PC games.
4658000	4664000	Wow, okay. I was not familiar with this series. This is why I like having a live audience.
4664000	4669000	But that is the antithesis to your date a live twin. Otherwise you would have a Corpse Party.
4669000	4670000	That's right.
4671000	4673000	Monster Hunter 4G gets a price reduction.
4674000	4683000	There's Princess... God, I read this wrong at first. I thought it said Princess Precure, Sugar Kingdom and the Sex Princesses, but it's actually the Six Princesses.
4683000	4686000	Look what this show has done to me. It's disgusting.
4687000	4694000	And last but not least, a little game you might have heard of before called Dobuso no Mori, Happy Home Designer.
4695000	4696000	You know what that game is, right?
4697000	4698000	Overpriced is what it is.
4699000	4700000	Animal Forest.
4700000	4705000	That is Animal Crossing in Japan. The Happy Home Designer comes out this week in Japan on the 3DS.
4706000	4710000	I urge you not to buy it because it's overpriced. You don't need Animal Crossing amiibo.
4711000	4717000	I thought I saw a rumor or whatever, I don't know what weight it has, but that the cards are... they can't keep them in stock in Japan.
4720000	4721000	I'm not even going to get you started. Just shut up.
4722000	4723000	Because printing cards is so difficult.
4724000	4725000	Just shut up.
4725000	4732000	Those import fees in Japan. Holy crap. How do they keep it from the import-export? It literally doesn't have to leave the company.
4733000	4734000	Where's Mike? There it is. He's done.
4735000	4737000	Dark Sakura. What's coming out in the UK?
4739000	4740000	Children.
4741000	4746000	Okay. On the 28th, the swindle for PC. On the 29th, the swindle for everything else.
4747000	4748000	That's it.
4750000	4751000	That's it?
4752000	4753000	Yeah.
4753000	4754000	There's three Wii games in Japan and there's like two?
4755000	4756000	Yeah.
4757000	4758000	Alright. Moving on.
4759000	4760000	Yeah.
4761000	4762000	Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
4763000	4765000	You know what's not coming out though? It's Project Cars on the Wii.
4766000	4771000	Because apparently... or I'm sorry. The Wii. Well, definitely not on the Wii. And also definitely not on Wii U.
4772000	4775000	And this is funny because this game is really hyped up for the Wii U.
4776000	4792000	And like they said, despite much perseverance on the Wii U version of the Project Cars, we will no longer be actively pursuing development on it as the quality does not meet our own high standards nor the intended vision for the title and platform.
4793000	4801000	Basically saying that it was simply too much for the system to handle. That's disappointing.
4802000	4803000	This is just too much.
4806000	4808000	So the system couldn't handle it. You can't handle the cars.
4809000	4824000	But with that though, they are going to be looking at other systems that may be coming in. So I'm thinking that they're going to be looking at maybe the next Nintendo system that will be coming out if it's going to be powerful. Maybe they'll pour it over to that.
4825000	4831000	But now we are still going to get the F-Zero clone that's not really an F-Zero clone but it is an F-Zero clone. Wink wink.
4832000	4833000	We're still getting that, right?
4833000	4835000	Yes, we're getting the mighty number F-Zero or whatever that is.
4836000	4837000	Alright.
4839000	4840000	Mighty number zero.
4841000	4853000	Alright. Well one thing that you'll not be getting on the Wii U after next month is TV. That's right. Do you remember that the Wii U has a service called TV and it's actually going to be shutting down on August 11th.
4854000	4861000	This was of course a service that was on the Wii U. If you have a Wii U right now you can actually check this out until August 11th.
4862000	4868000	Where the gamepad is like a second screen that you use when you watch TV and you can have like little Miiverse style chats.
4869000	4879000	For some services they actually do live updates. I remember seeing football games on this where the scores and some of the plays would come through. I thought it was kind of cool actually.
4880000	4881000	Which is why it needs to be taken care of.
4881000	4883000	Yeah, which is why they're getting rid of it apparently.
4884000	4886000	One versus 100. That's awesome. Get rid of it.
4887000	4888000	Game room. Get rid of it.
4889000	4902000	I think people just didn't know about it. Or maybe the fact that Nintendo didn't really hype this thing up too much. I guess they did when the system first came out but then they had to really focus on the game issue without the third parties there.
4902000	4913000	They all abandoned ship or whatever. So I think they kind of had to just give up on TV. Which I thought was an interesting idea but I also get why it didn't really work.
4914000	4918000	Because it was a little clunky. I think things like this have to be instantaneous.
4919000	4926000	You know, TV. You press the power button, on comes the television. That's it. Right? And you change the channel to whatever you want to watch.
4926000	4933000	Like TV on the Wii U, not as fast. And I think that's part of the problem with some of this stuff. So I don't know.
4934000	4948000	But anyway, of course this is just not long after the news that TV would not be coming to Europe due to the extremely complex nature of localizing multiple television services across a diverse range of countries with varied licensing systems.
4948000	4956000	So there you go. It's going away. So if you want to check it out before it's gone, check it out by August 11th.
4957000	4964000	Hey, by the way, Miiverse is also going to be renovated on July 29th. Miiverse is going to be given an overhaul. That's just a little later this week.
4965000	4973000	There will be some new features. It will also change how game specific communities work. And there's going to be a posting limit on all users.
4973000	4981000	You will be limited to making 30 posts a day. And I think they're saying this is to keep Miiverse chat game centered.
4982000	4993000	And that there will not be like roleplay stuff and some of the weird stuff that's shown up on, I shouldn't call roleplay weird, but there has been some weird stuff beyond just roleplay that showed up on Miiverse.
4994000	5001000	Just check out, what's that Twitter? Bad Miiverse posts or something like that? You can see a lot of hilarity over on Miiverse. So check that out.
5001000	5008000	I just hope that, you know, some of the coolest stuff we see in Splatoon has nothing to do with Splatoon.
5009000	5020000	Like when Iwata passed away, there were all those like really great tributes that were showing up in Splatoon because that's where people went because that's what the Nintendo fans, most of them are playing right now.
5021000	5030000	So I hope that even though they're going to be doing some of these limits and these other things that they don't try to like filter out organic conversation, if that makes sense.
5031000	5042000	So we'll see. TigerConChat talking about the TV button on the Wii U saying the TV button actually opens a remote to control your TV.
5043000	5050000	That's right. When they shut down the TV service, it's not the remote control that you get with the TV button. That will still work because that's just a remote control.
5051000	5058000	But it's the actual like you can actually log into this app and it will turn your Wii U gamepad into a bit more of a second screen thing.
5058000	5067000	So there you go. Kaijuto says bye bye fun times on Miiverse. They're going to fuck it up big time. I hope not, but I don't know. We'll see.
5068000	5080000	Alright, well before people were asking on Miiverse how babies were made, we had other types of video games that we were playing and you couldn't post on social media about them.
5080000	5084000	You could take a Polaroid and show it to your friends. That was about it.
5085000	5096000	Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault and find a classic video game that she thinks, hey, brats, you kids out there, you should be playing this game this week.
5097000	5103000	And this is one of my very, very, very favorite classic games, I must say. You were going to do this game last week, but then, you know.
5104000	5107000	Yeah, this needs to be in my vault, but Dan says it sucks and I'm going to kick him in the shin.
5107000	5110000	You should kick him in the shin. I want to get one. Allen knows that I want to get one.
5111000	5113000	They were selling one at California Extreme.
5114000	5118000	What? Oh my god, honestly, I am dopey enough, I would have bought it.
5119000	5123000	Oh god, I forgot to mention all the stuff I played there. They had a Castlevania vs.
5124000	5129000	Oh my god, anyway, alright, so let's get to it. What is the classic game of the week and the first arcade game I won in my house?
5130000	5140000	Baby Pac-Man. It is a hybrid arcade pinball table that was put out by Bally Midway October 11th, 1982.
5141000	5152000	It is a 13-inch video screen that's over a small pinball table and basically it fits into the same, basically the same space as a regular arcade machine.
5152000	5161000	Namco, of course, did not authorize this. This was totally done by Bally Midway, just like all of some of the other weird ones were.
5162000	5171000	Like Pac-Man Plus, Junior Pac-Man, and Professor Pac-Man. Basically, this is why Namco is like, okay, we're done with you Bally Midway.
5172000	5174000	There are 7,000 of them produced.
5174000	5182000	So basically, you have like your whole maze area up at the top and you go around and the ghosts are kind of bastards.
5183000	5188000	And they look very Atari, like maybe 5200-ish, you know.
5189000	5199000	So anyway, you go around and you have no energizers, but you do have chutes that are at the bottom of the screen, so when you go down there, you go to pinball table land.
5199000	5211000	And so basically, you just have to hit the targets with the pinball, you have two flippers, and you can earn different power pills- well, the energizer pills.
5212000	5220000	Get different fruit bonuses, get better tunnel speed, all the stuff that you do in the video mode. So basically, you're building power-ups by using the pinball mode.
5220000	5234000	And then when you lose the ball in play, you go back to video mode, and then the chutes close, so you have to either eat all of the remaining everything else up there, or get caught by a ghost to reopen them, and then of course you run out of lives.
5235000	5236000	We were on like a 5 life machine, it was great.
5237000	5245000	And that's really Baby Pac-Man, but it was so unique, and I think people are stupid if they don't like it. I'm kidding.
5245000	5251000	Well, Alan Alchemy in chat says it's incredible for the concept in cabinet, but honestly, it's a pinball table, it's kind of bad.
5252000	5262000	Well, it's not meant to be just pinball, it's the combination. So, the little pinball mode is really just sort of like, oh my god, the ghosts are about to get me, run, and go down the chute.
5263000	5268000	So, I'm actually kind of decent at this one, I can get a lot of power-ups.
5268000	5279000	The pinball table is plain. I think that's the problem with it, there's not a lot of action going on in the center of the board, like in most machines that you see. It's nothing but lights, with the little bumpers at the top.
5280000	5285000	And I think that's part of why this board feels really plain, because there's nothing in the center of it. They don't even have kickers.
5286000	5296000	Yeah, but the whole point is to hit the targets. And you can do all the old tricks, like the ball toss and everything, the flippers are lined up just right.
5297000	5306000	I think it's a good, I would call it almost an introductory pinball table for some people, because it helps you really build up those targeting skills.
5307000	5308000	True.
5308000	5314000	Which, I mean, would come into play in a much bigger table like Twilight Zone. By the way, you know what's going to be at my house when I get there?
5314000	5315000	What?
5315000	5316000	A Black Knight 2000.
5316000	5317000	Really?
5317000	5318000	Yep.
5318000	5319000	You guys doing, uh...
5319000	5320000	We're expanding again.
5320000	5322000	I was going to say, you haven't had pinball games in a while.
5322000	5323000	We have three in the garage.
5323000	5324000	Do you?
5324000	5326000	Yeah. World Cup, Twilight Zone, and Jackbot.
5326000	5328000	Sorry, you never got rid of them.
5328000	5335000	Nope, we used to have like 13, but yeah, we were getting a Black Knight 2000 because we lucked into a really solid deal, on a really nice one.
5335000	5338000	Are the pinball addictions happening again at Casa de Dark Sakura?
5338000	5343000	You better watch, I might just do Black Knight 2000. I think I've done Black Knight 2000, actually.
5344000	5351000	Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week, Baby Pac-Man. And I don't care how crappy it is as a pinball table, I still want one.
5351000	5359000	Because I just love the whole fusion idea. It's got that rarity factor, you know? Whenever I see one of these machines, I can't pass up playing it.
5359000	5362000	So, thank you Dark Sakura for that great pick, Baby Pac-Man.
5362000	5363000	I'm awesome.
5363000	5374000	Alright, when we come back with more Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break, we're going to get into some rapid fire news, as well as the FUGL question of the week, your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
5374000	5386000	And some more news, including, we're going to talk about the Minecraft movie, and we'll also talk about an update on that Kickstarter for Red Ash and how things are going without Mighty No. 9 being out yet.
5386000	5393000	So, we'll check in on that when we come back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
5399000	5409000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Episode number 607 for this, July the 26th of 2015, already in progress.
5409000	5417000	If you missed the first half of the show, well, the good news is we have a podcast feed and you can go check it out a little later tonight when the show uploads.
5417000	5430000	And you can check out what you missed, including us talking about, oh, Street Fighter V beta, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Loki making jokes during the release date segment, and me talking about Reno Game Expo and Summer Games Done Quick and all that stuff.
5430000	5439000	It's been a very busy show so far. We've got plenty more to come, including your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
5439000	5447000	We'll take those a little later on in the program. And we'll get through your emails, if we have any this week, because I'm not sure we had any, but we'll do a last-minute check here.
5447000	5456000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Let's do some rapid-fire news. Quickly, some other things that happened this week without too much discussion. Loki?
5457000	5465000	So, you're not going to have to wait too much longer if you want to get in on the Fallout Shelter action and you don't have a device that's made by Apple.
5465000	5474000	The Android version will be coming out in August on the 13th, and once again it will also be free. So, check it out then.
5476000	5483000	Also with that, there has been some new information about Fallout 4 coming from QuakeCon, which actually happened this week.
5483000	5496000	With that, they were able to see a presentation of Fallout 4, and there's going to be 12 companions in the game that can join you, and you can romance them, regardless of their gender.
5496000	5509000	And then with that, going back to what they were saying during the E3 presentation, where they were talking about how the robot butler will call you by your name.
5509000	5521000	They have a thousand names that are included as part of the voiceovers, both common real names and as well as names that Bethesda believes its players may even use in jest.
5521000	5529000	So, like, you know, Stupid Asshole is your name. The game may recognize Stupid Asshole and call you Stupid Asshole.
5529000	5539000	I'm down with that, so that's pretty awesome. Hopefully we'll see that in a few months.
5539000	5554000	And then Disney Interactive is trying to poll its players to see who you want to see next as the next Disney Infinity figure.
5555000	5576000	Now, Nintendo's kind of doing something similar with Smash Brothers, but right now you can vote. There's a link that you can follow on Disney.com's blog, and they have various characters that are up for voting for who you want to see as the next figure.
5576000	5585000	So let me read off real quickly who they have so far. In the lead, Darkwing Duck is number one in the lead, and I fully approve that.
5585000	5604000	In the running, Baloo, Alice from the live-action Alice in the Wonderland, Mad Hatter, Dory, Belle, Beast, Cinderella, Ariel, Goofy, Peter Pan, Captain Hook, Mabel, Hercules, Kim Possible, Wally, Wally would be awesome.
5604000	5606000	There's no fucking Tron in there, is there?
5606000	5610000	Well, they already have... I think they're already going to do Tron characters.
5610000	5618000	More than just... what did they have? They had Sam, Flynn, and Korra, right? But that was it. There's more characters in Tron. They could do actual Tron.
5618000	5627000	They usually do the villains as well, so maybe Tron and maybe... you know, like, was it the copy of... yeah.
5628000	5634000	Cruella de Vil, Ursula, Pocahontas, and Robin Hood. So, I'm hoping Darkwing Duck.
5634000	5640000	That's a pretty good one. I can't be mad at Darkwing Duck. I love Dory, though. There's a part of me that would like to see that one.
5640000	5642000	Dory would be awesome. I'm surprised.
5642000	5644000	I feel like they'll do Dory anyway when the movie comes out.
5644000	5646000	I want to see fucking gargoyles in there.
5646000	5648000	That would have been awesome.
5648000	5656000	Or can I get... if I want blue, can I get Tailspin Blue? Because that's way better than Jungle King... or Blue.
5657000	5667000	That's awesome. Alright, let me take over here and talk about Devil's Third, which is going to be actually, yes, Nintendo of America is bringing it to the US.
5667000	5674000	It will release on the Wii U eShop in the fourth quarter, this being confirmed by Nintendo of America and Valhalla Game Studios.
5675000	5685000	So, yeah, that's pretty cool. There's also going to be a PC version, but sadly, no cross-play between the two. It's just not really going to be possible.
5685000	5687000	I didn't know it was multiplayer.
5687000	5693000	It is multiplayer and free to start. So, there's no reason not to at least give it a try.
5693000	5700000	It can't be any worse than Tank Tank Tank as far as free-to-play things go, because, I mean, that was a fun game in the arcades.
5700000	5702000	Yeah, it's too bad. That's a game that was awesome.
5703000	5705000	I was not a fan, personally. Not a fan.
5706000	5713000	Speaking of Nintendo, a victory for them as they've won a patent case that was filed against the 3DS.
5713000	5725000	Nintendo won a patent case in federal court in Oakland. Judge Sondra Armstrong found that the Nintendo 3DS, the DSi, the DS, and the Game Boy Advance did not infringe on a patent
5725000	5733000	asserted on those products by Quintal Research Group. Quintal is a patent-assertion company.
5733000	5740000	You read between the lines what that really means, and hooray for another victory against those sorts of companies.
5742000	5751000	Also, in Nintendo World, there is a Splatoon update coming, revealed in a Japanese trailer for the game that showed some new maps,
5751000	5757000	some weapons like an ink-powered gatling gun, and a paint bucket. So, that's pretty cool.
5757000	5764000	Also, another new weapon, the Rainmaker. That will probably only be available in the Rainmaker mode of the game.
5764000	5775000	Also, Camp Triggerfish is viewable in this video with the Splatoon teaser, so nice to see the content is still being pumped over into Splatoon. That's pretty cool.
5775000	5776000	Dark Sakura!
5777000	5787000	Well, Stephen Colbert's done it again. Again. And again. Basically, he's got a text-based game that is out.
5787000	5798000	I'm actually trying to find the link to the game where you play as Stephen Colbert. And there is the link.
5798000	5804000	It is on ColbertLateShow.com, and you can go there to play it.
5805000	5813000	Next up, in SEGA news, SEGA is not going to be doing any more 3D classics, so at least they have no more plans for it right now.
5815000	5824000	They said they have no additional plans for it, but that they wanted to do more in the future. So, there goes that one.
5824000	5831000	There's a lot of fun stuff in that series. That's kind of too bad, but at the same time, they've done a lot of the big classics at this point.
5831000	5835000	They're having to dig deep into the vault at this point to do more.
5835000	5850000	And then, there's supposed to be something about Metal Gear Solid 2 Solid Snake, which was the MSX sequel to Metal Gear Solid 2 about it having an anniversary as of last Monday, but all I see is the Wikipedia.
5850000	5854000	I think that's just a shout-out for the game having its 25th anniversary. I think that's really all it is.
5854000	5858000	It's also far better than the excuse for a Metal Gear game we got in the US.
5858000	5859000	What was it, Snake's Revenge here?
5859000	5860000	Snake's Revenge.
5860000	5867000	Yeah, which was not, again, many of you out there probably already know this, but Snake's Revenge was not truly Metal Gear 2.
5867000	5878000	That was a cash-in because Metal Gear did so well here in the US, I think better than Konami or Ultra Games as they were publishing to get around the three-carts-a-rule year.
5879000	5884000	They had Snake's Revenge, they kind of hastily made that, because didn't that piss Kojima off?
5884000	5888000	Like, boy, the drama started early between those two, didn't it?
5888000	5889000	I think so.
5889000	5894000	But Metal Gear was originally an MSX game, and we didn't even get that system here in the States.
5894000	5896000	The MSX version's pretty nice.
5896000	5912000	Yeah, and there's some big differences with the NES version, because even the final boss, the final boss is an actual Metal Gear in the original MSX game, but because of NES limitations, it's like a supercomputer or whatever it is here.
5912000	5919000	And so, as a kid, you think that the supercomputer is Metal Gear, so I don't even know how that game makes any sense in retrospect.
5919000	5926000	Everyone owes it to themselves to find an MSX, or a means of playing said games.
5926000	5932000	It also gave us Gartic, even though Gartic wasn't very good. Gartic gave us Gartic Gaiden.
5932000	5933000	That's right.
5933000	5934000	The Guardian Legend. Hello!
5934000	5936000	Which is a very important game.
5936000	5937000	Very important.
5937000	5940000	But Guardian Legend was not on the MSX.
5940000	5941000	Gartic was.
5941000	5943000	Gartic was, of course.
5944000	5951000	Okay, let's go to our Facebook and our Google Plus pages for a segment we call The Fugal Question of the Week.
5958000	5966000	Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and ask a question, and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program.
5966000	5975000	We're going to start off with our Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, where the question this week is about TV, which we talked about in the first half of the show.
5975000	5981000	The Wii U's television social channel is being cancelled next month. Will you miss it? Did you ever use it or try it?
5981000	5986000	Do you think there's a place in gaming technology for such a social television experience?
5986000	5990000	Starting off on Facebook with Bryce H. who said, I used it twice, maybe.
5990000	5999000	It was a little confusing for me. Really, especially if you had a basic cable package. You end up not being able to use half the channels on there.
5999000	6004000	The one thing I did like is during a sporting event they had trivia and such that could socialize with other fans.
6004000	6010000	Other than that, I'm not going to miss it much. Maybe losing this will add something else. Hopefully.
6010000	6016000	Chad B. replied on Facebook and said simply, I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've heard of it.
6016000	6022000	Silent Tom replied saying to be honest, might have used it maybe a dozen times. I usually forget it was a service on the Wii U.
6022000	6026000	The remote control feature on the other hand, I use that bad boy all the time.
6026000	6034000	Our pal Critical Myth from the Critical Myth show says, I think the problem is exactly what many around here said from the start.
6034000	6040000	That there were and are too many existing ways to do most of what TV was supposed to do.
6041000	6048000	Jesus Z. replied on Facebook saying honestly, I've just about had it with social interaction invading every form of media ever.
6048000	6058000	It's become almost impossible to talk on Twitter or a public Facebook account without being called a racist, sexist, homo transphobe because you liked this or that game or movie.
6058000	6062000	Having people harass me while I'm watching TV, I pass.
6062000	6067000	Wasn't the Nintendo stuff moderated though? Because I think it's in line with Miiverse.
6067000	6075000	I don't think, like I don't recall any instances of like comments section gone wild.
6075000	6079000	And believe me, we've seen plenty of places on the internet where comments go wild.
6079000	6083000	And I don't know if that's because Nintendo moderated it or because nobody was using it.
6083000	6089000	And so maybe, maybe the internet filth was just staying away from it. I don't know. I don't know. Anyway.
6089000	6096000	Lastly over on Facebook, Veronica S. Oh, thank you. Act deaf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com confirming TV was moderated.
6096000	6105000	Veronica S. last but not least on Facebook saying I used it once just to try it out but found it inconvenient to use so I never used it.
6105000	6109000	The guide and the search features on the cable box were easier to use.
6109000	6114000	And over on Google Plus, I think we got just one answer there about TV.
6114000	6121000	I'm also looking at it in chat saying bonds006 says I don't know Rob, I saw a lot of crap in the DS chat rooms.
6121000	6130000	And yeah. Anyway, over on Google Plus at our Google Plus page, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
6130000	6135000	We just have a couple of answers here. First, Redertainment says I don't own a Wii U.
6135000	6139000	The basic problem I have with social networking apps on any TV is the input interface.
6140000	6149000	Why should I sit on my couch and fight with a less than adequate on-screen keyboard when I can pull out my phone or tablet and have access to a keyboard I am significantly more comfortable with using?
6149000	6154000	And lastly, act deaf said it was never available in Mexico so I can't really comment on it.
6154000	6159000	But I do love having the gamepad be a substitute remote control for my TV.
6159000	6164000	You know, I've heard some people that really swear by that remote control. So good thing I guess that's not going away.
6164000	6171000	It does sure come in handy when you can't find the regular remote control for your television as long as you've configured everything accurately.
6171000	6175000	Alright, that does it for the Fugu question of the week. Thank you everybody for participating.
6175000	6182000	And you know, for me personally, I did use TV once or twice but for me, I think it was just the whole fact it was kind of clunky to get into.
6182000	6188000	Like, if it could come up as fast as TV does otherwise, I might have found more use for it.
6188000	6195000	Or maybe if there was a little more advertising or social media awareness like, hey, this event is happening.
6195000	6198000	Although most big television events happen on a Sunday night.
6198000	6209000	But maybe if they had actually said, you know, hey, while the finale of Survivor, I don't know, is going on, boot up TV, we're going to have a conversation or something, you know, with quizzes and trivia.
6209000	6211000	You know, I think that would have been a lot more fun thing to do.
6211000	6214000	But I guess, I don't know, I guess phone apps can do the same thing.
6215000	6220000	I don't know if there are phone apps that kind of do this. Are there phone apps out there that interact with television like that?
6220000	6222000	You would think there would be.
6222000	6223000	I don't know.
6223000	6226000	Maybe some folks in our chat room know. Live.vognetwork.com.
6226000	6231000	Are there phone apps that you can play along with like Wheel of Fortune or something like that?
6231000	6236000	Kind of like a second screen TV experience basically. Basically what TV was doing on the phone.
6236000	6245000	I don't know, but I thought, you know, that whole experience that we were supposed to getting with, what was that, the second screen stuff from Microsoft, this was to interact with Game of Thrones.
6245000	6247000	Did that ever fucking happen?
6247000	6251000	Not yet. I don't think so.
6251000	6260000	I don't know, but that would be so rad though if you could play along with Wheel of Fortune while it was on air and like have like leaderboards and stuff for how quick people are guessing the puzzle.
6260000	6265000	I mean, who doesn't do that? Watch Wheel of Fortune and yell out the answers to the puzzle when they figure it out.
6265000	6272000	I thought they have that like on certain shows. I don't know. I've seen shows. I think they have that actually.
6272000	6281000	Because I know, I thought I've watched Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy or something like that and they show like a leaderboard or something like for people playing at home.
6281000	6285000	Let's see. Kaijuto in chat says, no social TV apps. We just love tweets.
6285000	6294000	Darktitsvia says, I think AMC has, I think it's called StorySync. I know Walking Dead supports it. I think Halt and Catch Fire does too.
6294000	6304000	Darktitsia says, some companies do apps like that to supplement their TV shows. Tigerclaw said, whatever happened to that second screen experience which was supposed to be a rear view mirror on a racing game?
6304000	6312000	Remember when Sony pitched that idea? That was, if memory serves me right, that was the PSP interacting with the PS3.
6312000	6318000	Yeah, that was the PSP interacting with Gran Turismo 5, I think.
6318000	6322000	Because I think that was one of the things they showed at that infamous press conference.
6322000	6330000	Yeah, because it was like, ooh, we could use a second screen. It's like, who gives a shit about using it as a rear view mirror when you have a rear view mirror in the game?
6330000	6337000	Well, it was kind of one of those things that it sounded like a good idea, but it's kind of really hard to glance at two screens at the same time.
6337000	6346000	Which might be part of the problem we use having. I don't know. I find when I play Mario Kart, it's really hard for me to glance down at the second screen that has the map.
6346000	6355000	Especially on like 250cc or 200cc or whatever it is. Alright, anyway. Let's move on with some more news. Loki.
6355000	6362000	Yeah, I was trying to see if they had a way to play with different... I think maybe Game Show Network does that. Maybe. I don't know.
6363000	6376000	Anyways, so there's a director. Apparently, we've got a new director for the Minecraft movie. None other than It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob McElhenny.
6376000	6386000	And I don't know about him directing, since he's only done apparently just a few episodes of the show.
6387000	6399000	I guess this independent movie that's coming, a TV movie called Pariah. But we also forget that his character Mac in the show did direct quite a few movies.
6399000	6410000	In fact, there's quite a few in the Project Badass series. And also sequels to Lethal Weapon. So I think he's fully capable of creating a Minecraft movie.
6410000	6413000	But he didn't direct Night Man, right?
6413000	6415000	He didn't, but you know.
6415000	6424000	Okay. Well, it's an interesting choice. I guess you can kind of tell that that probably means that Minecraft is going to be very light-hearted, kind of funny.
6424000	6429000	But it's got to be a kid-safe film. And It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is not always kid-safe.
6429000	6434000	I don't care. I would love a Minecraft movie that wasn't kid-safe.
6434000	6439000	I don't think that's going to happen. Minecraft is huge for kids. They're going to make it a kid's movie.
6439000	6447000	But it would be awesome if they could do what Animaniacs and Tiny Toons used to do back in the day.
6447000	6452000	It was definitely for kids, but there was humor that adults would get.
6452000	6454000	That would kind of go over the kids' heads?
6454000	6463000	Exactly. If you could master that art, that is a funny movie. You know what I mean? But we'll see. We'll see how that goes.
6463000	6470000	And please, can we get Dan? Hell, let's just get the whole cast of It's Always Sunny in the movie. I'm fine with them just all playing different roles.
6470000	6476000	I still want to know, how do you make a fucking movie out of Minecraft? How do you do it? Like, is it going to be blocky?
6476000	6483000	Yeah, it's going to be blocky, probably just like the Lego movie. But it'll be just, you know, like that. They'll make a story out of it.
6483000	6485000	I guess, all right, we'll see.
6485000	6488000	I don't know.
6488000	6492000	Kaijuto in chat says, this movie is so going to suck.
6492000	6495000	It won't suck. I mean, look at the Lego movie. The Lego movie is amazing.
6495000	6499000	That's exactly what Bonds 006 says. Look at the Lego movie.
6499000	6505000	And that's why I'm kind of disappointed, because originally, you know, it was supposed to be the guys that did the Lego movie doing the Minecraft movie.
6505000	6509000	I was like, damn, you know, that's going to be amazing.
6509000	6517000	I want to know why we don't have a Lego Minecraft game. Because, like, put it this way, I know that Lego has their own Minecraft thing, but it's fucking terrible.
6517000	6520000	I know, I thought you kind of read that to filth on a previous episode.
6520000	6525000	You know, it's like, I seriously, I play it, I'm like, this is going to be amazing. There's no way this is not going to be amazing.
6525000	6530000	It's Lego, but it's Minecraft. It's going to be amazing. It was garbage. It was so terrible.
6530000	6532000	Isn't it, like, still in development, though?
6532000	6536000	Yeah, Lego Worlds, but it's terrible. It's so goddamn terrible.
6536000	6542000	But, like, an actual Lego, I seriously, I went to Walgreens again today to get some medicine from a kid, because he's sick again.
6542000	6549000	And I keep passing by, and there's, like, this $20 Lego Minecraft set that's sitting there, and I'm like, I want to buy it. I want to buy it.
6549000	6550000	I want to buy it so bad.
6550000	6555000	I'm thinking about buying it. I may buy it, but I don't. One of these days, I'm going to buy it.
6555000	6560000	Kaishudo in chat wants to know, when are they going to make a Minecraft porn movie, Mind Shaft?
6560000	6567000	I'm surprised that hasn't already happened, honestly. What was that? It was floating around Facebook or Twitter.
6567000	6575000	One of those places this week was some type of porn that was a take on Jurassic World, but it was, like, an Asian gay porn film or something like that.
6575000	6578000	I don't know what it was, but it had people in dinosaur costumes.
6578000	6581000	Please tell me that there's a scene in there where they're just, like, holding their hands up.
6581000	6584000	Yes! That was the picture of the dude holding his hands up.
6584000	6585000	That's awesome.
6585000	6591000	With the guys, and who knows what he was going to do with those hands. But, you know, just, yeah, it was a take on that whole thing.
6591000	6593000	So, I don't know why.
6593000	6594000	How do you do that?
6594000	6599000	It could have been an Onion article, for all I know, because you know those will show up on your Facebook feed, and you're scrolling so fast, you think it's real.
6599000	6603000	Or ClickHole. That's my other favorite thing ever.
6603000	6606000	You're laughing over there, Dr. Sagra?
6606000	6607000	I'm snorting.
6607000	6609000	That website's hilarious.
6609000	6610000	Yeah.
6610000	6611000	Anyway.
6611000	6613000	Yeah, it is.
6613000	6617000	Embreon in our chat room, who says this is his first time listening. Welcome.
6617000	6625000	Says, you can find it on the shelf next to Dragon Ass, Enquizinme, and Buttborn.
6625000	6629000	Oh, DarkSakra's looking at her brain. Look at that. Her eyes.
6629000	6632000	What? DarkSakra? I know you do this.
6632000	6636000	Did she not mention earlier that she was playing Dragon Quest Inquisition with some-
6636000	6639000	Dragon Quest? That would be a fun crossover.
6639000	6645000	Okay, Dragon Age- whatever. Dragon Age Inquisition with some mature mods on. I mean-
6645000	6648000	No, I was playing Dragon Age Origins with mature mods.
6648000	6651000	Oh, okay. I'm sorry.
6651000	6656000	Keep in mind, I've already played the game before, so I was trying out different mods.
6656000	6664000	That's- you know what? That's okay. That's what Alan does. He'll play through Skyrim, and then once he beats the game, he's like, alright, it's dong time. Gets all the mods, you know?
6664000	6665000	Pretty much.
6665000	6666000	Alright.
6666000	6671000	There's some very interesting ones. The funniest one is actually the one that changes all the underwear to being naked.
6671000	6678000	Because then you have this one scene where you're going into a dream, and like, all these really important people, it's this big serious time, but they're all naked.
6678000	6680000	With just, like, junk hanging out.
6680000	6688000	Now, DarkSakra, I know you follow some of the, like, the fanfic writing and all that stuff. Are you to tell me that nobody has tried to write Dragon Ass Enquizinme?
6688000	6694000	I'm sh- well, there's plenty that just aren't titled that.
6694000	6696000	But that definitely happened.
6696000	6698000	Yeah.
6701000	6705000	The dark parts of Tumblr. Alright. Anyhow.
6705000	6711000	Moving on. Not- god, I gotta- how am I supposed to follow that with this story? This is heavy.
6711000	6715000	Alright, so I apologize for this really awkward transition, but it's just how the stories fell this week.
6715000	6723000	But obviously the internet is still really reeling from, you know, what happened with Satoru Iwata's sudden passing.
6723000	6727000	And a lot of folks, though, you know, trying to look to Nintendo's future.
6727000	6734000	You know, Nintendo right now has interim folks leading it, but what's going to happen? Who's going to be the next person in charge?
6734000	6739000	And we were talking about this a little bit on last week's show, and Bobby, I know, was talking about this on his show as well.
6739000	6749000	And there's been a lot of buzz, and when I say buzz, I mean the Wall Street Journal actually reporting on the possibility that Miyamoto could actually be the one that leads Nintendo.
6749000	6758000	And I know that there's a lot of buzz around that, but some of us last week were saying, well, wait a minute, if Miyamoto has to do managing as a full-time job, Miyamoto's great at designing.
6758000	6768000	He's the one they call on to make games that are going to incorporate the Wii U's vision and all this, so it would be a little weird if he's taken away from that to manage the company.
6768000	6780000	Well, now some news going around this week, and analysts and folks are now looking at that the likely candidate that will lead Nintendo in the future is going to be Genyo Takeda.
6780000	6790000	Which, if you've been following, is the other person with Miyamoto that is currently leading Nintendo while they're all still reeling from this news.
6790000	6798000	And if you're unfamiliar with Takeda's work, you've probably played one of his games seeing as, you know, and this is one of the really cool things about the Nintendo executives.
6798000	6806000	You know, when we were talking about Iwata and the real impact he had on games, it wasn't just about the fact that he led the company, but the fact that, you know, he was in the trenches.
6806000	6812000	He was coding Balloon Fight. He was coding Earthbound. He was fixing Smash Brothers before the thing's releases.
6812000	6818000	He caused there to be more to Pokemon with the compression technology. I mean, dude knew what he was doing.
6818000	6831000	So, what's really cool is that if Takeda is who they choose to lead in the future, well, again, he's somebody who spent a lot of time working his way from the very bare levels of game design on the way up.
6831000	6842000	Because, of course, he was Punch Out. He was Star Tropics, which was a late NES game, but if you've never played Star Tropics, it's a great, like, kinda like a Zelda-ish follow-up.
6842000	6848000	I get that kind of vibe from it, but, I mean, that is a, that's a real classic that I think a lot of people missed, because it was really late in the NES.
6848000	6852000	Not as late as the sequel, because there was a Star Tropics 2, but anyway.
6852000	6858000	So, yeah, there you go. They're definitely looking at him, and it obviously makes a lot of sense.
6858000	6867000	They kinda don't think that they're going to bring somebody in from the outside to lead the company, that they tend to recruit from within, and they like these folks that have really grown up on the game design.
6868000	6870000	So, it makes a lot of sense.
6870000	6884000	So, well, good luck. Whoever they pick, hopefully will have a great vision for, you know, the NX, although I'm sure Iwata, his legacy will definitely be felt in whatever the NX is.
6884000	6893000	You know, it's a lot like Steve Jobs, and when, you know, and I was making a lot of those comparisons a couple weeks ago when the news came in about Iwata's passing,
6893000	6905000	but Steve Jobs, his impact was felt at Apple for years and years, and I think the first product to come out that Steve Jobs did not directly have a hand in was the watch, if I'm not mistaken.
6905000	6916000	I could be wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure this Apple Watch is like the first thing that Steve Jobs did not really directly evolve with, but you know, the upgrades of the phone that we've seen throughout the years and so forth,
6916000	6919000	you know, he had had a hand in all of that long before he passed.
6919000	6929000	So, I think the same is going to be true with Iwata and NX, and it'll be who can best execute that vision and maybe enhance it to make it very, very competitive. We will see.
6929000	6933000	Anyhow, moving on to another story, Dark Sakura.
6933000	6944000	Well, for folks who have been watching over Red Ash, you might have been aware that there was a stretch goal put out for doing a console port for the PS4.
6944000	6958000	Well, they reached their stretch goal. So, guess what? There's going to be a PS4 version, and I'm actually seeing if there's any other type of thing, because I know that they haven't quite hit their final goal for this.
6958000	6976000	Yeah, they've got seven days to go, and they're at $470,171 of $800,000. Seven days left. So, get on it if you want it.
6976000	6979000	So, they did make at least that first stretch goal.
6979000	6980000	They did.
6980000	6988000	Because there was some worry that they weren't going to make it. Just like last week, I think we were talking about it a little bit. So, it looks like the internet's kind of rallied around it, so it'll happen.
6988000	6994000	But it's just not going to be the runaway huge $40 billion stretch goal thing that Mighty No. 9 was.
6994000	6995000	Indeed.
6996000	7006000	Alright. Well, I think it'll be cool to see what they come up with with Red Ash. Best of luck to them. Maybe when Mighty No. 9 starts selling, maybe this money for Red Ash can really be the seed money.
7006000	7020000	And if Mighty No. 9 does very, very well in the post-Kickstarter sales, you know, once they fulfill all their commitments to people who've already bought it, if Mighty No. 9 does very well with these post-sales, maybe that money can be used to help fund and make Red Ash even a bigger thing.
7020000	7022000	That's how these things work, right?
7022000	7023000	Indeed it does.
7023000	7025000	Indeed. Alright, moving on. Loki.
7025000	7041000	So, you know, the 2015 EVO Championship Series just recently wrapped up. And with that, they had a record viewership for one of the matches for Ultra Street Fighter IV, the finals between Momochi and Gamerbee.
7042000	7055000	And it drew 250,000 viewers. That's just ridiculous. So maybe with that, you know, they will take esports a little bit more seriously. Because that's pretty good viewership.
7055000	7061000	I don't have the numbers in front of me, but isn't that more people than watch the Heroes of the Storm thing on ESPN?
7061000	7063000	I don't know.
7063000	7067000	Because I think it was only like 120,000 or something on ESPN. I could be wrong. I don't have the numbers in front of me.
7067000	7074000	I mean, just think about it. Different events are drawing more and more people. I mean, it's presumably millions.
7074000	7081000	Oh, yeah. Well, and especially, you know, that Street Fighter IV, you know, I didn't watch it live, but I saw some of the talk on Twitter.
7081000	7089000	And, you know, there were GIFs and there were Vines and there was, you know, eventually links to YouTubes about some of the different things that had happened with that.
7089000	7100000	And even, you know, now they're even talking about it in the chat room. Rama's saying, I can't believe that EVO was on ESPN. Bob Coffey says, those finals, them feels.
7100000	7113000	So, yeah. And I even remember seeing a moment, I don't think it was during the Street Fighter, but it was the, I think it was Marvel vs. Capcom 3, where the guy executed a move and he thought he won and he jumped up and he was like celebrating.
7114000	7116000	No, it was Blaze Blue, I think.
7116000	7117000	Oh, was it? Okay.
7117000	7119000	Is Blaze Blue or Guilty Gear or something like that?
7119000	7125000	Yeah. Oh my gosh. That's just got to be like, you know, on one hand, you got to kind of go like, ha ha, that's what you get.
7125000	7131000	But at the same time, it's like when the adrenaline takes over, sometimes you're just not in control of some of those types of reactions.
7131000	7137000	You almost have to feel bad for the guy a little bit that he, he kind of like, I don't want to say made an ass out of himself, but he's got to not be feeling too hot.
7137000	7138000	Well, make that mistake again.
7138000	7139000	It's devastating. Huh?
7139000	7141000	He said, I won't make that mistake again.
7141000	7149000	Well, probably a lot of people will be mindful of that in the future. They don't want to become a gift for that reason.
7149000	7154000	Remember, beat the dead corpse into the ground. That's the only way you'll know that you've won.
7154000	7163000	Bobby Blackwolf making a funny observation in chat saying, well, Colin Coward did say he'd quit ESPN if he had to cover esports.
7163000	7166000	He has quit. Then they fired him. And now he's going to Fox Sports.
7167000	7174000	Apparently they're saying that, you know, there's a little note here that says that League of Legends finals drew 27 million viewers last year.
7174000	7175000	Wow.
7175000	7181000	So it's not the biggest, but I mean, it is a smaller community, so I don't know.
7181000	7192000	Wow. Well, I'm sure also when you get into things like League of Legends, probably has more international appeal because, you know, those games do not underestimate how huge those games are in Asia.
7192000	7198000	I mean, not even just China, but like just Asian regions. It's huge. Thank you. It's huge.
7198000	7204000	Kaijuto says Splatoon is next, baby. One billion viewers. We'll see.
7204000	7208000	Maybe EVO 2016? I don't know if Splatoon would fit in with that, but you never know.
7208000	7216000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Challenge Radio at VoGnetwork.com, use the passphrase CREDIT.
7216000	7225000	Hey, we got an update on the Xbox One and the dashboard is going to be reinvented. The dashboard getting a major revision this holiday season.
7225000	7229000	And you can actually see a little preview is out now on the Internet, thanks to Major Nelson.
7230000	7238000	And I, for one, as an Xbox One owner am happy to see this because the original dashboard was very much designed with Kinect in mind.
7238000	7246000	And ever since they unbundled Kinect from the Xbox One, those of us that don't have Kinect yet are kind of like, it does feel weird.
7246000	7251000	It feels a little weird the way it works. So I'm kind of glad to hear they're going back and reinventing it a little bit.
7251000	7259000	But that, I mean, with the 360, they completely change, I mean, they completely change the 360 a couple years into it as well.
7259000	7265000	So it's not like you have to go, oh, the Xbox One is failing or floundering, that's why they're doing it.
7265000	7270000	Sometimes you just kind of reinvent things to fit, you know, whatever future vision you have.
7270000	7275000	And they definitely did that on the 360. Who knows? Maybe the PlayStation will do something similar in the future.
7275000	7279000	I kind of doubt it because that crossbar thing really works for them, but you never know. You never know.
7279000	7286000	Anyhow, also being added in this update, Cortana, who is the Windows 10, of course, voice-based assistant.
7286000	7295000	Don't call her Siri because she's kind of Siri. But anyway, you can use Cortana and actually use her in some of the games and ask questions.
7295000	7302000	So that's kind of neat. So we'll see what happens. Also, supposedly faster performance. Menus will be more vertical instead of horizontal.
7303000	7314000	So we'll see. Avatars also making a comeback, and Modernized. So we will see when the dashboard is unveiled in the coming months before the holidays.
7314000	7319000	And I'm assuming that update will also be the big backwards compatibility update. That's an assumption.
7319000	7327000	I don't know if that'll be two separate things, but I don't see why we wouldn't get that out around the same time.
7328000	7334000	Alright, let's go to our mailbag. Every week, I think you guys send us emails. Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
7334000	7340000	DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first and pulls out whatever emails you might find. Did we get anything this week?
7340000	7341000	Nope.
7341000	7342000	No?
7342000	7343000	Nope.
7344000	7348000	You guys let me down. No emails. Not a one.
7348000	7349000	No emails.
7349000	7351000	Let's make one up.
7351000	7357000	Dear DarkSakura, I think that you should do a solo career and... No. Not happening.
7357000	7359000	Buy Rob off with cheesecake.
7360000	7361000	Alright.
7361000	7362000	You know what?
7362000	7366000	Fair enough. It's the show where every gamer has a voice, but you have to use it.
7366000	7370000	One of our episodes would be like, listen to us eat.
7370000	7373000	Isn't that every week in the opening minutes of the show?
7373000	7375000	I didn't eat anything.
7375000	7378000	Loki! Loki always brings food to the show with him.
7378000	7379000	Yeah, I bring dinner.
7379000	7380000	There he is.
7380000	7381000	Alright.
7381000	7382000	It's a sandwich.
7384000	7388000	Moving on, let's get to the FUs of the week. An appropriate time to transition.
7388000	7393000	When we don't get emails, then we will fill time with our FUs of the week. Why?
7393000	7394000	Because we mad.
7410000	7412000	FU to stuff.
7413000	7415000	Nothing in particular. Just...
7415000	7416000	Yeah.
7416000	7417000	General things.
7418000	7419000	Alright.
7419000	7424000	A very vague FU. That's alright. Sometimes they have to be.
7424000	7425000	Loki.
7426000	7431000	I guess an FU to stuff taking a lager in my game. I wanted to.
7433000	7436000	For me, an FU to the fact that I don't have cheesecake right now.
7436000	7438000	And a FU to the fact that...
7438000	7439000	You can fix that.
7439000	7440000	Yeah, that's true.
7440000	7446000	A FU to the fact that I have to get up really early tomorrow because I literally have to be two places at once at work tomorrow.
7446000	7451000	Which, you know, I love my job, not complaining, but sometimes it's very, very, very draining.
7451000	7453000	So I have to be up very early tomorrow.
7457000	7458000	It's a paycheck.
7459000	7462000	Because lord knows this show isn't paying the bills.
7463000	7467000	Alright. Anyhow. Let's move on. We've got a couple more stories for you guys.
7467000	7471000	And then we're going to open up the Skype line for you guys to call and participate.
7471000	7474000	Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. All one word, but we encourage.
7474000	7477000	Please test your connection at Echo 1-2-3 first.
7477000	7483000	But with all them smart phones and Skype apps and so forth, it's so easy to call us on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio.
7483000	7488000	But you can also use the old school phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7488000	7490000	We'll be taking those calls in just a minute. But first, Loki.
7491000	7496000	Alright, so this is kind of, I don't know, I'm surprised that they did this.
7496000	7507000	But apparently now there's going to be a patch being done or an update to the WWE 2K15 store that's removing the Hulk Hogan DLC.
7507000	7516000	Which I understand because of the whole drama and everything and WWE kind of firing him that, you know, obviously there's a little bit of a fallout there.
7517000	7525000	But along with that though, not only is he being removed from the store, he's being removed from the WWE 2K16.
7525000	7534000	And if you have purchased the DLC to add him to the game, that is being removed from the store.
7534000	7539000	So if you did buy it, you can no longer download it.
7540000	7542000	So they are PTing it?
7542000	7544000	They are PTing it, yeah.
7544000	7545000	Wow.
7548000	7551000	Let's see here, I just want to make sure that's correct here.
7552000	7555000	That's what some folks in chat were saying just a minute ago during the break.
7555000	7559000	So I guess this is all developing as our show is going on tonight.
7559000	7563000	But I think that news about the fact that you can't even re-download it I think just came out.
7563000	7566000	Yeah, I don't think, I've been hearing a little bit conflicting stuff.
7566000	7570000	But basically it is being removed from the store if they're PTing it or not.
7570000	7572000	We're going to use that from now on.
7573000	7578000	Then that kind of sucks because especially if you paid money for that, then you can't download it again.
7579000	7583000	But it's not too surprising, I mean they made him disappear from the website like that.
7583000	7590000	It probably has to do with, I mean without delving into the controversy because I don't even want to go there.
7590000	7596000	But it's sometimes interesting to see the effects that these sorts of controversies can have on these types of legal arrangements.
7596000	7601000	And I wonder if because the WWE terminated their contract with Hulk Hogan.
7601000	7603000	They probably don't have the rights to license it anymore.
7603000	7608000	Exactly, the likeness rights go away and so they have to pull all that shit immediately.
7608000	7614000	Because technically if it were to stay up, Hulk Hogan could sue.
7614000	7616000	So that's probably why they have to do it.
7616000	7618000	Yeah, that's too bad.
7618000	7620000	Just interesting, very interesting.
7621000	7624000	Some folks in chat saying refund their money.
7624000	7627000	Bonds006 says, do buyers get their money back?
7627000	7629000	How dare me mention a refund?
7629000	7634000	But it's a fair question to ask in this digital goods day and age.
7634000	7639000	You know, like why can't I get a refund if I'm no longer going to be able to use this?
7639000	7644000	Well I guess you could technically use it in the game, but you just have to be sure you never delete it.
7644000	7653000	Well yeah, you better hope that your system doesn't crash or anything or you need to redownload everything because then you're hosed.
7653000	7658000	I really think they should have kept it up anyways, like at least have that up on the server.
7658000	7666000	Like they've done that with games that have been discontinued because of licensing issues, but now they're just kind of wiping them off the servers altogether.
7666000	7668000	I think it's a little much.
7668000	7670000	Yeah, but again the legal part of it, who knows.
7670000	7678000	Yeah, but you're not necessarily, it's not that you're reselling it, you're just allowing people to redownload something they've already purchased.
7678000	7684000	I mean I don't think that's a bad thing. That's just good customer service.
7684000	7690000	Alright, let's see, Xanos, I hope I'm saying that right in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,
7690000	7697000	It's like Rockstar updating Grand Theft Auto San Andreas to remove some songs last year after the license was up.
7699000	7704000	Let's see, I think they did that through a patch. That's kind of fucked up because you own the game.
7704000	7705000	Right?
7705000	7706000	You purchased with those songs on it.
7706000	7711000	So if you just unplugged the internet though, it could never, it will never, or uninstall, can't you delete patch data?
7711000	7718000	You could, but it was for like, you know, San Andreas and you probably don't need the latest version of San Andreas.
7718000	7726000	I mean you could just revert back to whatever it was prior to that or, I mean, shit, it's just stupid.
7726000	7735000	It's stupid, like if you want to do that, you know, all going forward then you can do that, but just don't like affect the games that are already out there.
7735000	7741000	Like I remember LittleBigPlanet did that, remember they had a game that offended, the music offended somebody.
7741000	7748000	Oh yeah, it was reciting the Quran, I think, or something in one of the songs.
7748000	7749000	This song was so great.
7749000	7751000	Yeah, so.
7751000	7754000	I wonder if, I still have my copy of that too, that version of LittleBigPlanet.
7754000	7755000	Yeah, you just delete patch data.
7755000	7758000	Because I managed to get my copy before it came out.
7759000	7762000	And then lastly, Rama clarifying about the Hulk Hogan thing.
7762000	7768000	Hogan himself owns the rights to his trademark and whatnot, it was under license to WWE.
7768000	7772000	So, this is definitely for the legal end of things, I'm sure.
7772000	7777000	Anyhow, one more story for you guys before we get to the free-for-all that is the Skype line.
7777000	7784000	And actually, I don't know why I'm doing this last, because this could actually end up being some pretty huge news for the future of gaming.
7784000	7789000	I guess we'll see what develops with this, but the Wall Street Journal is reporting,
7789000	7794000	China will be ending their ban on video game consoles.
7794000	7800000	This is going to make way for companies like Sony and Microsoft to expand in China.
7800000	7805000	Now, when I originally read this, I thought I read something about the Xbox One launching in China.
7805000	7810000	Like, I thought there was a big to-do, but then I also thought, like, didn't it get pushed back?
7810000	7818000	I don't know. So, I kind of feel like maybe it was extremely restricted and now those restrictions are easing.
7818000	7825000	These rules are going to apply to foreign and domestic console makers, allowing them to manufacture and sell anywhere in the country.
7825000	7830000	Previously, foreign console could only operate in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone.
7830000	7834000	Oh, maybe that's what it is. Maybe the Xbox One was only out in that particular region.
7834000	7842000	And of course, that means when you're only in one particular area, it makes it hard to really sell, you know, all across China.
7842000	7846000	So, Sony commenting on this, this is great news for us.
7846000	7851000	And they added, the company remains committed to the console business in China.
7851000	7857000	There was no comment from Nintendo or Microsoft in the Wall Street Journal article, probably because they couldn't be immediately reached.
7857000	7861000	Just so you know, gaming companies have been restricted since the year 2000,
7861000	7868000	when Chinese regulators enacted a console ban to prevent what they said were potential adverse effects on China's youth.
7868000	7876000	What was the, like, I'm curious to see what the market was prior to 2000 then, if, like, they were a pretty large market for them.
7876000	7883000	Well, and it's not like they don't have games at all, because I know World of Warcraft is out in China.
7883000	7892000	It runs under a different administrator, and I think they're an expansion behind, and they had to do things like, the undead are not the undead.
7892000	7899000	They're forsaken, and they don't have the skin falling off, because that's considered against society in China.
7899000	7903000	It's a social faux pas to have that type of stuff in China, so that's not there.
7903000	7906000	You know, so there's those types of localization things.
7906000	7910000	I thought, I remember hearing Final Fantasy XIV was coming out in China as well.
7910000	7912000	But again, these are all PC-based things.
7912000	7915000	You know, yes, XIV is on the PlayStation 4, but it's also a big PC game.
7915000	7918000	World of Warcraft's on PC, League of Legends is on PC.
7918000	7921000	So this would be huge for China to get these consoles.
7921000	7924000	What's been happening since 2000? Do you remember the V?
7924000	7930000	That was the Chinese console that was like, well, it's not a Nintendo Wii, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
7930000	7935000	But it's the Chinese bootleg Wii, essentially, with very, very similar types of games.
7936000	7939000	So it's going to be interesting.
7939000	7942000	You know, China is not a small place.
7942000	7945000	It's actually much more populated than the U.S.
7945000	7950000	So, I mean, the sales potential over there could be huge.
7950000	7951000	So it's going to be very interesting.
7951000	7958000	I mean, if it really, truly becomes like a free-for-all, like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo can sell their stuff anywhere they want in China,
7958000	7960000	I mean, this could be huge.
7960000	7969000	You know, if something like Wii U considered tepid in the States and, you know, overseas, just, you know,
7969000	7974000	I know some of you might argue me on that fact, but just hear me out for a minute.
7974000	7978000	What if the Wii U were to do phenomenally well in China?
7978000	7980000	It would be a game changer. You know what I mean?
7980000	7987000	Like, if a console does extremely well in China, but maybe not as well in the U.S. or even Japan, it wouldn't really matter,
7987000	7990000	because it would still be making all that money in China.
7990000	7993000	Well, good. I'm glad they don't need to innovate any further.
7993000	7996000	Well, we'll see. I mean, I have no idea what's going to happen.
7996000	8002000	I have a feeling like it's going to probably really impact even probably more so the next wave of consoles,
8002000	8006000	but we'll see how these systems are received in China.
8006000	8011000	And I wonder how much the games are going to be scrutinized.
8011000	8016000	One thing is for the console to come out, but you would imagine that the games are going to have to go through some intense localization procedures,
8016000	8025000	not just for language purposes, but again, like I was just talking about how World of Warcraft had to be really changed to prevent offending Chinese people.
8025000	8030000	You know, there's probably a lot of games that have things in it that might have to be reexamined or changed.
8030000	8034000	So, it'll just be interesting. See what happens with all that.
8034000	8036000	So there you go.
8036000	8039000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
8039000	8042000	Dungeon Buster says you can bet the censors are going to be all over the games.
8042000	8046000	They are just as with other media such as movies.
8046000	8051000	I'm sure that will be a thing, so it'll be interesting to see like who's going to play along and who's not.
8051000	8056000	But that's a lot of people to open up the business to.
8056000	8058000	All right, let's go to the phone lines. It's your turn.
8058000	8062000	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, so give us yours right now.
8062000	8067000	You can call us at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
8068000	8069000	If you want to give us a call.
8069000	8071000	Some further comments in our chat room.
8071000	8075000	Bonds006 saying, so all three companies have to make a big push on China.
8075000	8081000	It's a huge market, and I don't see how Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony can ignore the China market.
8081000	8084000	I don't think they'll be ignoring it, but then again, who knows?
8084000	8088000	Microsoft gets away with ignoring Japan, so anything is possible.
8088000	8091000	Anyhow, let's get to the phone lines. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8091000	8093000	Hey, hey, it's Rama.
8093000	8094000	Hey Rama, how you doing?
8094000	8097000	I'm pretty good. I'm actually enjoying my late, late dinner.
8097000	8101000	That is a very late dinner, because you're three hours ahead. That's almost midnight.
8101000	8104000	Yeah, what can I say? I'm a night owl.
8104000	8108000	That's all right. I hear you. Yeah, like, I have sent you messages.
8108000	8116000	Like, don't you get up at like 5 a.m., and I've sent you messages at like 11 o'clock over here, which is like 2 a.m. over there, and you'll respond like, okay.
8116000	8128000	Yeah, because my old job, I used to get up at like 6.30, so I was in bed by 1.30, so usually when you send me the message, I'd probably be at work and I'll respond with, got it.
8128000	8137000	Now with this new job, because of the time difference, I'm usually at my computer checking Facebook real quick for a hop in the shower, start the day, so I'm able to get the message.
8137000	8142000	Wow, that's amazing. I'm usually up late too, unless I have like busy stuff.
8142000	8148000	Like, tonight I've got to be in bed by midnight, because I have to be up at like 6 a.m. tomorrow for work, no joke. There's just so much going on, but anyway.
8148000	8156000	We're not here to talk about sleep schedules, unless Nintendo is going to be putting out that patented thing sooner rather than later. What did you call in to talk about tonight?
8156000	8157000	Pixels.
8157000	8158000	Oh, the movie.
8158000	8159000	Yes.
8159000	8161000	Yeah, how, did you go see it?
8161000	8162000	Yes, I did.
8162000	8169000	Good, because, you know, I know a lot of us are making decisions based on the trailer and all that, and I'm kind of looking at it very side-eyed.
8170000	8183000	I get out to the movies so rarely, Rama. I still haven't seen Jurassic World. I never saw the Avengers sequel. I haven't seen Ant-Man. Like, the last movie I saw was like, I think, no, Interstellar was the last movie I saw. I just never get out to the movies.
8183000	8185000	Ant-Man was really good.
8185000	8193000	Yeah, I know. I need to see all this stuff, so we'll see. But anyway, so how did you like Pixels? I want to hear it from a listener themselves. How did you like Pixels?
8193000	8198000	Before I get into it, I would like to say, Rob, I see maybe four movies a year, if that.
8198000	8199000	Wow.
8199000	8204000	And I saw Avengers in theaters. Maybe because it's me. I could have waited for home video for that.
8204000	8205000	Hmm.
8205000	8206000	But that's just me.
8206000	8210000	That's a pretty strong statement. But what about Pixels?
8210000	8212000	I thought it was great.
8212000	8213000	Really?
8213000	8227000	A lot of people are hating on the movie because it's Adam Sandler. He is a lot more toned down in this film than his last few titles he's put out. We're talking toned down, like Mr. Deeds toned down.
8227000	8228000	Hmm.
8229000	8252000	And as I said on my Facebook, Pixels was not meant for the Xbox generation. And by the Xbox generation, I'm talking about the kids who would rather sit in front of the computer, in front of the consoles, playing Halo, and cursing each other out, as opposed to what we did when we were done with homework or after school, go to the arcade and play games with each other.
8252000	8259000	This movie was designed for older people, like over 30. That's what this movie is for.
8259000	8268000	You know a lot of critics are really skating this. And even the chat room, there's a lot of surprise in the chat, like either they're saying, I don't believe them, or I'm genuinely surprised to hear that somebody liked it.
8268000	8279000	Yeah. Now, as for the whole Xbox generation, there are some in that generation who understand the classic arcade games, who still go to the arcades and so forth.
8279000	8289000	But, I mean, this is what it seems, this is how it looks to me, and there were a couple of inconsistencies in the film, but I'll let that slide for the time being.
8289000	8295000	Let me ask, Kaijuto says, ask him if he was sober when he saw the movie.
8295000	8300000	Kaijuto, I was sober and I also saw it in 3D.
8300000	8312000	Wow, okay. You have to admit that was a funny question. Let me ask this question though, because this was my big concern with Pixels, genuinely.
8312000	8328000	Especially classic arcade games are sacred to me. I have a deep respect for classic games. I love to listen to game makers from the 80s and 90s just talk about the crazy shit that went on when making those games.
8328000	8338000	I have a huge respect for that culture, and my concern is that Adam Sandler's sense of humor tends to be dick fart butt jokes, which there's a time and a place for that, that's fine.
8338000	8350000	I did Hoard House for years and years for God's sake, but I was worried that it was going to show a lack of respect for the culture and diminish it into poopy jokes.
8351000	8370000	Oh no, no, believe it or not, they are very little poop fart dick jokes from Adam Sandler. He is more or less an adult. He is one of us. He grew up playing these games. He knows the gaming patterns and so forth. He's actually one of us and actually being good about it.
8371000	8385000	Alright, well, you know what, Rama? I have no reason to distrust your opinion. I know you and you're a stand-up guy and definitely not on their payroll, so if you say that, I have to weigh that considerably. I think personally I'll still kind of wait for Blu-ray.
8386000	8407000	Well, you can do that, but I'm just saying personally, to me, this was worth seeing in the theaters. I thoroughly enjoyed it. And as one person said, it's like this, Wreck-It Ralph was for the kids and family. Pixels is for the older generation and the family. It's like that, like the Venn diagram of sorts.
8407000	8414000	Interesting. Now, folks in chat juiced in our chat room saying, technically they're voxels.
8415000	8424000	Close enough, but not to truly spoil the movie, I'll say this much, I do want a Qbert sidekick.
8425000	8427000	Alright, fair enough, fair enough.
8428000	8429000	Well, when you see the movie, you'll understand.
8429000	8445000	I'm glad that they're bringing Qbert back, because he kind of disappeared for a while and that Steam, Playstation 4, Qbert game is a fucking mess. I'm sorry, that's like the worst game I've played in the past year, easily, is that horrible excuse of a Qbert reboot game. So, I hope that maybe...
8446000	8450000	Well, if you thought that Qbert was bad, there's something out there on TV that's much, much worse.
8451000	8452000	On TV?
8453000	8456000	Yes, you know there was a game called Pac-Man, the Ghostly Adventures?
8457000	8458000	Yeah.
8458000	8460000	There's an animated TV show.
8461000	8483000	Okay, no, no, no, hold on, hold on. I would have been in agreement with you on that. My son, however, I did show it to him, and it actually wasn't that bad. It was actually pretty good. Which I was surprised, because the game looks like shit, and I just thought, oh, we're just trying to cash in on Sonic and stuff. But it wasn't actually that bad. So, I can't give you that.
8483000	8484000	The game's okay.
8485000	8490000	Alright, that's fine, that's fine. I'll wait for you to jump in and come after me for saying that Pixels was good. I was waiting for that.
8491000	8494000	Well, I mean, it's interesting when it comes to movies.
8495000	8512000	And some people are setting their standards too high. It's Adam Sandler, you have to set your standards to Adam Sandler. If you go to see Billy Madison in Happy Gilmore Works of Art, it's just like, you know, it's an Adam Sandler movie. You go see it because of that. I'm sad that a lot of his movies aren't like Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore.
8513000	8520000	But, you know, I guess as we get older, you know, the tastes change, because, you know, that last movie we did with Jack and Jill was god-awful.
8521000	8523000	Yes, but that's Norbert Betts, so I mean, whatever.
8524000	8531000	And I'm not, you know, everybody's entitled to their opinion, and, you know, admittedly I'm making a judgment based on the trailer, which maybe I shouldn't do.
8532000	8540000	And we have this stuff with games all the time. Like, isn't there a game that you love that everybody else hates, and everybody's like, why do you play that shit?
8540000	8542000	But it's like, I like it, okay? Shut up.
8543000	8544000	Yeah, it's called Duke Nukem Forever.
8545000	8546000	Oh, shots fired.
8547000	8550000	No, I like that game. I bought that. That was a day one purchase for me.
8551000	8552000	See? That game is terrible, I'm sorry.
8553000	8561000	I love Duke Nukem. I wanted to love Duke Nukem Forever, but it was so broken and bad that, like, it's not that, like, it's not that it was-
8562000	8563000	Here's the fight y'all wanted.
8563000	8571000	No, no, I'm just saying, it's not that it's, like, it's a bad Duke Nukem game, it's just it was literally broken. Like, I couldn't play the game because it was broken.
8572000	8576000	That's why it was a bad game. Not because they were trying to be funny and they weren't funny.
8577000	8587000	You know, bonds006 has a great point in chat saying, I can take a shot at Adam, meaning Adam Sandler, but Uwe Boll will never get one second of my life watching anything he makes.
8588000	8590000	It could always get worse.
8591000	8592000	What?
8593000	8594000	You can't get a shot on that, testify.
8595000	8597000	Exactly. Pixels, at least it wasn't Uwe Boll.
8599000	8601000	Alright, Ram, on that note, I'm gonna let you go.
8602000	8603000	Alright, thanks a lot, man.
8604000	8605000	Thanks for the call.
8606000	8607000	You got it.
8608000	8609000	Bye.
8609000	8610000	I have been very tempted to watch Grandma's Boy because I haven't seen it yet, and they do it on Netflix now.
8611000	8613000	That's right, this is not Sandler's first game-related movie, huh?
8614000	8615000	Grandma's Boy apparently was pretty good.
8616000	8617000	187-
8618000	8619000	From their depiction of gamers, I guess.
8619000	8623000	1877 Game O.L.R. or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8624000	8629000	Tigerclaw pointing out that the movie's directed by Chris Columbus, who's done, you know, a lot of big Hollywood movies.
8630000	8632000	Like Mrs. Doubtfire was a Chris Columbus movie, right?
8633000	8636000	And the original Harry Potter, the very first one, I think.
8637000	8640000	If my Hollywood trivia is correct.
8641000	8642000	1877 Game O.L.R.
8643000	8644000	And I'm giving props to Grandma's Boy because they had DDR in it.
8645000	8647000	So, it gets props.
8647000	8652000	At least there's that. All right, we got a call coming in, let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8653000	8654000	Hi, this is Ragingator.
8655000	8656000	Hey, Ragingator, buddy, what's on your mind tonight?
8657000	8659000	Not a whole lot.
8660000	8668000	I have to agree with looking at one point where you said that Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore are not works of art.
8668000	8675000	Yeah, they're probably like the whole opposite of that. They're probably like works of art.
8676000	8678000	Or diary or whatever.
8679000	8691000	It reminds me of the scene of Billy Madison. I don't remember the entire line, but it's like, we are all now stupider for having listened to that entire monologue of yours.
8692000	8696000	It's kind of like his movies, you know, it's like we are all now dumber for having watched them.
8696000	8704000	Honestly, the scene in Happy Madison where Adams, what? No, no, but I'm talking about a different movie. Oh, sorry, Happy Gilmore.
8705000	8712000	The scene in Happy Gilmore where Adam Sandler punches Bob Barker in the face and says the price is wrong, bitch. Like, that's gonna go down in cinematic history.
8713000	8714000	It is.
8715000	8719000	You know, that's just one of those scenes you're never gonna forget as long as she lived, for better or for worse. So, I don't know.
8719000	8728000	But then you look at shit like Jack and Jill and you're like, oh god, remember when he was in his prime? Remember when he wrote good albums? So, anyway.
8730000	8744000	I'm more serious though, the main reason I was calling. As you, the three of you know all too well, I'm a bit of a steam fanboy. No surprise there.
8745000	8746000	Just a slight bit.
8746000	8763000	Yeah, but I would like to just bet you a little bit about Steam. It's not so much Steam itself, it's just that some of the companies selling their games I'm seeing more so.
8763000	8787000	We're talking about companies like Capcom and Konami and so on and so forth. While, sure enough, we got companies like Sega and whatnot, and to some degree Capcom, putting the classic games out on Steam, like the old Sega Genesis games, and a handful of games out on Steam.
8788000	8808000	Like the old Sega Genesis games, and a handful of the Dreamcast games, and of course we also got games like Ikaruga and whatnot on Steam. Even some of the Metal Slug games on Steam.
8809000	8811000	Sure, there's a lot of nostalgia on Steam, sure.
8812000	8830000	Yeah, why the holy cow can't we get the Gally Legends on Steam? Why can't we get some of the old economic classics on Steam? Like Contra and so on and so forth.
8830000	8848000	Or even Russian Cact on Steam. Why can't we get Fatal Fury on Steam, or even better yet, the Samurai Showdown series on Steam?
8849000	8862000	So you're talking about like, so if I'm understanding right, it's not that you take issue with the nostalgia that's on Steam now, you're just wondering why isn't there more of it? Like Sega puts these games out, why can't we get more?
8863000	8877000	You know, I think some of it is a tricky licensing thing. I think when you bring up a game like the Guardian Legend, we were trying to sit here and put our heads together, like who actually owns the right to the Guardian Legend right now? Do we ever even figure it out?
8878000	8891000	No, because I think at some point, I don't even know, like Broderbund published it here in the States, and then Broderbund was acquired at some point I think by like THQ, and lord knows where it went in that right shovel, so I don't know.
8892000	8905000	Anyway, I'm sure somebody out there has the correct answer, and I'm not thinking of it right now. But some of the rights to those things are so tricky, and I think we even heard a couple weeks ago on the show about, or maybe, oh I think this was a conversation I was having with somebody,
8905000	8920000	where I think it was Sony and Qbert, like Sony didn't even realize they had the rights to Qbert, like because sometimes when companies acquire other companies, like maybe they don't even know that they have, you know, these particular things.
8921000	8935000	As far as like Contra, if memory serves me right, Konami had a few of these retro collections that actually were on PC, because I think GameTap had them.
8936000	8945000	I want to say Contra was on GameTap, as was Castlevania, and some of those Konami games were actually there, those PC versions.
8945000	8963000	So why they haven't released those on Steam is anybody's guess. It could just be that they feel like it's not worth the effort to put all the description and the art and pay whatever fees to Steam for the distribution or whatever, maybe they just feel like it's not worth it.
8964000	8980000	I don't know. As far as Nintendo classics go, Nintendo's not going to put their stuff anywhere besides Nintendo products, that's how they're going to get you to buy them. So Nintendo stuff is never going to come out on PC. Well, and then again, I was going to say something about mobile phones a couple years ago, so who knows, never say never.
8981000	9004000	Yeah, I realize that Nintendo will never have their stuff on Steam, that's pretty much a given. But my feeling is, as far as all the third-party companies go, it shouldn't be too hard. Sure, there will be a cost involved, like you said, paying fees and all that.
9005000	9028000	But the thing is, at the same time, there's a lot of people out here, like me, they have love for these old arcade games and whatnot, and you guys know me, I'm a total Steam whore. I buy shit on their left and right, unless, hell, that doesn't sound like a bragging or anything like that.
9028000	9048000	Last time I checked, I had over 700 games on Steam, and I've only been on Steam for two and a half years, so come on, companies, give me a chance to buy your stuff and I will buy it up in a heartbeat. I'm sure there's a lot of other people that would love to buy your classic stuff.
9058000	9071000	There's a lot of what you're talking about right here, like it was a lot of nostalgia classics, Konami was involved, because a lot of Konami's games were on there, I think Sunset Riders was the big last release the gamer had before it, pardon the pun, rode off into the sunset.
9071000	9094000	There was a lot of Konami releases on there, especially their early stuff was there, and then for whatever reason, Microsoft pulled the plug on that shit after nine months. I still don't forgive them for it, and I'm cautious with new Microsoft shit because of it, but you have to kind of wonder, maybe it just wasn't making the kind of money they were hoping for to make it worth it.
9094000	9113000	If it was rolling in dollars, they clearly wouldn't have cancelled it, so I have nothing to assume, but it just wasn't making the type of money they needed it to make. But it's so weird that Retro takes that much to pour it over, but I guess there is more to it than we realize.
9113000	9132000	For what it's worth, at least in regards to Game Room, I was buying content for that, way up to the lowest hour on there where you just couldn't buy content for that anymore, where they took down all the servers and whatnot.
9132000	9148000	And I wouldn't say I got everything that was available for it, but at least I do get good sizable amounts, and every now and then I do fire it up just for shits and giggles.
9148000	9166000	Right now, my primary platform is Steam. I don't like really touching games where the wind's alive all that much, naturally, but still, with that being said, Game Room is fun. I'm sorry to see that go.
9166000	9176000	Yeah, me too. Maybe it'll come back someday, who knows. We'll just have to give it time for Retro to be cool again. Anyway, Ragenator, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thanks for your call. I appreciate it.
9176000	9178000	Sure. Have a good one.
9206000	9210000	You don't like teenagers who don't know how to behave in public.
9237000	9260000	When everybody was still in school. That's what I did. I don't know, my honest-to-god answer, I don't watch a lot of TV either. If it's not like RuPaul's Drag Race, or stuff on Netflix, I watch a lot of the Netflix stuff, like Sense8 was the last thing I watched start to finish that I just loved.
9261000	9278000	So if it's not one of those things, I play a lot of games. I play MMOs. That's the stuff that ends up filling my time. That's just how I choose to do my entertainment. And I realize a lot of you do both, and just probably wonder why I don't make time for both, but I don't know if I have an easy answer for that.
9278000	9291000	You know, it's kind of like, well, I could get out to movies on a weeknight, but Alan works most weeknights, and then when it comes to the weekend, it's like, well, we have other stuff we do on the weekend, so maybe part of that's a scheduling thing. I don't know.
9291000	9301000	But, funny enough, it's funny this whole conversation is happening because Shane and I are talking about going to the movies tomorrow, just randomly. We were talking about like, oh, let's go to the movies tomorrow. We're trying to figure out what we're gonna see still.
9302000	9314000	I will pretty much see anything, because I haven't seen anything, but I wanted to see Jurassic World, because I still haven't seen that, and the Pixar movie Inside Out. I still really want to see that.
9314000	9317000	Inside Out was really cute, but I want to see Jurassic World 2.
9317000	9325000	And then I said I would see the Amy Schumer comedy, because I think she's really funny. What is it, Trainwreck or whatever? So, I don't know. We're trying to figure out what it is we're going to see.
9325000	9334000	And I'm sure many of you are like, go see Pixels, but I'm like, I've got like two months of movies to catch up on, so there's literally like ten things on the list.
9334000	9335000	Anyway.
9336000	9345000	S2100Matt says, Rob, seriously, go to the Alamo Drafthouse. It will change how you see movies. I have heard a lot of great things about them, and I would love to go see a movie there.
9345000	9350000	They don't have them where I live, except I guess San Francisco is opening one.
9350000	9351000	No. They do.
9351000	9352000	They do?
9352000	9357000	There's one in Rockland. It's not an Alamo Drafthouse. It's a new Drafthouse type place, so.
9358000	9367000	Do they have the harsh rules that the Alamo Drafthouse has? Because the Alamo Drafthouse has like that whole list of rules, like basically if you act like an asshole or if you text during the movie, we're kicking you out type of thing.
9367000	9369000	I don't know about that, but they have food.
9369000	9372000	Yeah, I've heard about that place in Rockland, The Grill or whatever.
9372000	9376000	I drove by it the other day. I haven't really seen a movie there yet.
9377000	9382000	But apparently we are getting an Alamo in San Francisco, if it hasn't already opened.
9382000	9388000	But, you know, driving to San Francisco is still like a good two-hour drive one way, and that's if I don't run into traffic.
9388000	9394000	I'm a little afraid, because that's Dark Soccer Night's plan next Sunday when the show would usually be live, would be to San Francisco.
9394000	9399000	And I'm a little afraid about that traffic, and especially parking. Oh my God.
9399000	9400000	Lift.
9400000	9403000	Parking? Yeah, no kidding. That's true.
9403000	9410000	That's how we got around during GamerX, is we would just park way in the middle of nowhere in San Francisco and then just take a lift where we needed to go.
9410000	9411000	Totally.
9411000	9412000	Kind of sad, but it works.
9412000	9419000	Alright, one last call for calls. This is the last call for calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9419000	9421000	All one word.
9421000	9425000	I'm getting some mini reviews in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
9425000	9429000	Justin says you can skip Jurassic World. Definitely see Inside Out.
9430000	9440000	AkumaJP says Sky wants to call your parents for being teenagers. I don't care if somebody's a teenager, although this show might be a little bit two-hour rated, but I don't know.
9440000	9445000	If you're like 16 or 17, whatever, it's not like you don't hear the same stuff at high school.
9445000	9449000	Dungeonbuster says see Mad Max if you haven't yet. Yeah, that was on my list.
9449000	9450000	I really want to see that.
9450000	9454000	I don't think it's in theaters near here anymore. Maybe out in Roseville where they have so many screens.
9454000	9456000	I think it's still playing at the Palladium.
9456000	9457000	Is it?
9457000	9458000	I think I could find out.
9458000	9460000	Yeah, because I would still see Mad Max because I didn't see that.
9460000	9465000	And that, you know, which is funny, because again, and we talked about this on the show previously.
9465000	9469000	I had no interest in Mad Max because I still, like, I can't break that.
9469000	9470000	It's a sunrise.
9470000	9473000	I can't break that mental block with Mel Gibson.
9473000	9476000	Oh, sunrise is the discount theaters. Hell yeah.
9478000	9479000	You gonna go?
9479000	9481000	Maybe. Maybe. We'll have to see.
9481000	9486000	I keep forgetting about the discount theaters because you want to talk about a loud time at the movies.
9487000	9490000	I will never forget the time I saw The Matrix at the Dollar Theaters.
9490000	9493000	That was like going to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
9493000	9496000	I don't mind loud movies when it's cult movies.
9496000	9498000	When it's supposed to be like that.
9498000	9500000	I just don't like it with new movies.
9500000	9502000	It's a total double standard. I admit it.
9503000	9504000	Alright.
9504000	9506000	Phones are not going off, so I'm going to shut them down.
9506000	9510000	If you were just shy and you want to say something to us a little later, remember you can always email us.
9511000	9516000	Participate at OrangeLawnTrady.com or you can always tweet us as well.
9516000	9518000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
9518000	9521000	I didn't check in with Loki. You have to see if there's any last minute stories.
9522000	9524000	We want to squeeze in before we're done with the show tonight.
9526000	9538000	Don't think I had anything other than there was someone that actually had reached out to one of the developers at Valve for Half-Life 3 and basically saying the rumor is that it's not in full development.
9538000	9542000	Shocker! It's not in full development and coming out tomorrow?
9542000	9548000	Well then what's Valve doing right now? They're not really talking about whatever it is they're working on.
9548000	9549000	I don't know.
9549000	9556000	I mean, besides maybe Dota, but I don't think that's what everybody in the company is dedicated to, so I guess there's secrets.
9556000	9557000	There's secrets.
9557000	9560000	I think by the time it comes out, no one's going to care anymore.
9560000	9562000	I wouldn't go that far.
9563000	9565000	Don't Duke Nukem Forever it.
9565000	9566000	Please don't.
9567000	9572000	Alright, well if that is it from Loki, then I think it's time to wrap up the show.
9572000	9576000	And hey, we want to thank you guys for tuning into our show tonight and listening to the whole thing.
9576000	9580000	Whether you were here live or on the podcast feed, we appreciate you being here.
9580000	9582000	Thank you so much for participating with the show.
9582000	9585000	And if you like what you heard, please help spread the word.
9585000	9588000	You know, we don't have a gigantic website.
9588000	9590000	Oh wait, I did want to mention one thing. I'm sorry.
9590000	9592000	Right in the middle of my spiel, Loki.
9592000	9594000	Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
9595000	9601000	There is a spot on a, there's a website called PSPminis.com.
9601000	9602000	They have a forum there.
9602000	9609000	And with that, they have links to different games that are part of PlayStation Mobile
9609000	9614000	that you can still click on those links and purchase those games even though they've shut it down.
9614000	9619000	So if you're missing out and haven't gotten a chance to pick up some of the games, you can do that.
9619000	9620000	And that's only some of the games on there.
9620000	9621000	They have a list.
9621000	9623000	You can do a search on there or check out NeoGaf.
9623000	9625000	They've got a list of the different...
9625000	9627000	Did somebody dig up Pixel Poops?
9627000	9629000	I was just trying to check to see if that's on there.
9629000	9632000	Because if I can find that, then...
9632000	9635000	Let's just do control search here.
9635000	9637000	Pixel...
9638000	9639000	Somebody find the poop.
9639000	9641000	Somebody find Pixel Poops.
9642000	9643000	Alright.
9643000	9644000	Yeah, I didn't see it.
9644000	9648000	So even though they've delisted it, they haven't really erased all traces.
9648000	9650000	It's basically, they give you the...
9650000	9652000	Maybe Aaron can help out with this.
9652000	9656000	Because if you know, if you have the developer's ID number.
9656000	9658000	So they give you a URL.
9658000	9664000	It's this long URL, then the developer's ID, the game ID, and then some other numbers on there.
9664000	9669000	So YYR, if you know your developer ID and game ID, you can let us know.
9669000	9674000	And then we can post a direct link where you can still purchase that information.
9674000	9676000	So you do that by...
9677000	9678000	Let's see.
9678000	9680000	If you click the links on your Vita.
9680000	9687000	So if you go on your Vita to the web browser and click on those links, it'll take you directly to the store to purchase them.
9689000	9693000	Alright, nice little interesting back door into the store for now.
9693000	9695000	But who knows how long it's gonna work.
9695000	9699000	Because they could go in there Monday morning and hit the big red button that deletes everything.
9699000	9700000	Exactly.
9700000	9701000	Who knows.
9701000	9702000	Alright, anyhow.
9702000	9704000	As I was saying before, I was so rudely interrupted.
9704000	9707000	But at least it was a story that...
9707000	9710000	It was indirectly related to Pixel Poop, so I forget it.
9710000	9711000	Forgive it.
9711000	9718000	Anyhow, as I was saying, if you enjoyed the show, please leave a five star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever it was that you found this program.
9718000	9720000	Remember to tell a friend or five about this show.
9720000	9726000	Because again, we don't have a huge website or a million dollar marketing campaign or whatever behind our show.
9726000	9728000	So we appreciate all of that word of mouth.
9728000	9730000	It goes a very, very long way.
9730000	9732000	And that's really it.
9732000	9735000	Thank you so much for being here and participating with the show tonight.
9735000	9737000	We will be back next week.
9737000	9741000	Remember, live folks, we will be live early next week.
9741000	9745000	Probably 11 AM, I think is the time we're aiming for on the West Coast.
9745000	9747000	So we can be done with plenty of time to get to San Francisco.
9747000	9751000	So that will be 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern.
9751000	9753000	That will be 7 PM in the UK.
9753000	9758000	So this is the chance for you guys overseas to participate live with our show.
9758000	9763000	Again, live listeners, if you forget that, we will repeat the show in our usual live time slot.
9763000	9766000	So at least you'll get a new live OLR.
9766000	9768000	But for now, that's going to do it.
9768000	9771000	Thank you so much for participating with our show and being a part of it tonight.
9771000	9772000	We will see you next week.
9772000	9774000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
9774000	9776000	Dark Sakura, ladies first, your final thought tonight.
9776000	9778000	Words.
9778000	9781000	My final thought tonight is, later bitch.
9781000	9783000	I love that.
9783000	9785000	The minute I saw that, I was like, it's Dark Sakura.
9785000	9786000	It's going in my cube.
9786000	9787000	It's her.
9787000	9789000	And last but not least, Loki.
9789000	9793000	Ideally I would have a demo up for my game this week, but we'll see.
9793000	9795000	That's the sound of me holding my breath.
9795000	9796000	I know.
9796000	9797000	I want to.
9797000	9798000	I want to.
9798000	9802000	It takes me three times as long to do anything.
9802000	9803000	Right, good luck my friend.
9803000	9805000	But I will stay up late again to work on this.
9805000	9807000	Alright, have a great week everybody.
9807000	9808000	We'll see you in seven days.
9808000	9810000	Good night and thanks for playing.
