00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This week, although P.T. and Silent Hills are no more, Del Toro and Kojima keep in touch and still appear to be making plans for their own production.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The duo appears to have a cerebral thriller in mind and still want to create an amazing experience for gamers.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
All this and your comment starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio with our 607th episode for this July the 26th of 2015.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here in studios, I am Rob Roberts, also known as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And joining me, as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sup.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hey, welcome back.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you much more sober this week?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Very.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
One of my friends commented online that he was listening to last week's show and that you were an adorable hot mess.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes, I was.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I drink a lot.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You know how those crack and rum bottles?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For the record, crack and rum specifically makes everything taste like cookies.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's a quote from George and it's true.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Cookie kraken.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Cookies.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Instead of cookie clicker, it's cookie kraken.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Delicious cookies.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't worry, kraken mama will fix it.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's great when you're low-carbing and whatnot because then it's like having cookies that you can drink and then make you not give a fuck.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So I had my, I had about half a bottle by myself.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, I'm glad you got to spend time with the girls.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I know you had a girlfriend visiting from Japan, so that's not something you get to do every day.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, I think Krista's heading back later, but it was good to hang out with her.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Excellent.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It was good to hear from you and you did the responsible thing and didn't like drink and drive.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I was like a whole like mile away or two miles, but I was way too drunk.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I was in Reno this weekend, which is where you would expect that kind of debauchery to happen, and I was a sober little guy.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I didn't do anything like that.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're being a responsible adult by gambling.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I think I'm just saving it for Dragon Con, so look out Atlanta.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Get a bottle of kraken when you're there. Trust me.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't drink very often, but Dragon Con, you know, exceptions.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I've discovered that I really like gin.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Alright, Dark Soccer's gonna get a liquor podcast pretty soon.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I probably am.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In the meantime, let's say hello to Tech Master Loki.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hello.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hey, Loki, how you doing?

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm doing fine.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hey, I got to see some progress on your game, It's Time to Car, that you've been working on.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Which at this point, you know, some of our listeners and frequent chatters are joking that it's vaporware.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's the next Duke Nukem Forever.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But I actually got to see it, and now I totally understand why you're taking so fucking long.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Because it's the attention to detail that you have.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Can I talk about what I saw?

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So, Loki showed me this level.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I wasn't sure if I was under NDA or anything.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No, no.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I didn't want to, you know, get on your blacklist.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, no. I had recorded the level, the entire gameplay through the level, but as I was telling you,

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I have, like, originally on the top of the cart is a turret that fires cats.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Exactly, exactly. So it fires cats, right? So you fire cats out of this turret.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But then it's not enough that you just have a thing that fires cats and you interact with objects as you're racing around or whatever.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, no, no. Not only does it fire cats, it has to make a variety of noises when you fire the cats.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, it has random noises for the cats, and random cats. I don't know if you know this, but each of those cats is random.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes, random cats. And then, I guess something your son had suggested.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes, so they hop around for a little bit. After they're done ragdolling, and, like, they ragdoll for a long time,

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
they kind of just roll and tumble, because they're just really terrible looking cats.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And then they hop around, kind of like the South Park walking, and then after about, like, 20 seconds or so,

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
a jetpack appears on the back along with a harness, and they fly up into space.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They just fly up into space.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Just for no reason whatsoever, other than that's the way that this spawned them.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Because it's a Loki game. That's why.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And then, not only that, but then, like, if you fire cats at houses, it actually makes noises.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Like, if you're doing, like, Paperboy style, and you aim for the door, it'll actually go ding dong if you hit the door.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And if you hit the window, it'll make a glass-shattering noise.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And then, like, they don't just jetpack away. Like, they start to climb up the route.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Like, it's so, like, your level of detail is kind of disgusting, and it's, no, I mean that in the best possible way.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But now I understand why you're taking so long.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that would be like, just let it go.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, this is the last level that I was going to make before I released a demo for it.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So, once I'm done with this, because what I'm fixing now is I didn't like how the turret was.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It was just a fixed direction. You kind of had to drive the car up in there.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Now I'm having it where, since you can kind of rotate the camera around the car anyways to look around, that that moves the turret as well.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And you can aim it up and down. So it's a little bit, so you don't have to drive up every single sidewalk and do that.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Because it wasn't very fast. It was just kind of tedious. So I wanted to remove that.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And then...

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Now, are you worried about Peeta coming after your game? Are you going to have a disclaimer in the opening?

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Not that cats get hurt. You can run into them. You can drive over them. Nothing happens to them.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
They just rocket away. That's it. They do not get hurt at all.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So no matter what you do, the cats will rocket into space.

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You can launch millions of cats in front of you and just drive right through them, and they'll just kind of tumble away.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And then eventually, once they stop rolling, they'll pop back up and just start hopping around.

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
All right. Excellent. Excellent. Of course, we could not do this show without the help of our live participants.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So if you are listening live to our program, head on over to our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com,

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
where we do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network. That's vognetwork.com every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern,

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And Fifth Dream in our chatroom saying, so no more cats. Remember cats, everyone? Cats with a Z.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If I remember right, that was a horrible DS series of games. It was like their answer to the...

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, it's not just DS. It's Ubisoft's Pets series.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, that's right.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So they've got cats and dogs and all sorts of pets. Hamsters. Seriously.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Well, remember when that first came out, it was because Nintendogs didn't have cats in the beginning.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I know they got it much later when they did the 3DS version, right?

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But in the original DS version of Nintendogs, there were no cats.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And that was the number one thing people wanted. So here come the knockoff game that does the cats.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Which, by the way, everyone, have you checked on your Nintendog lately?

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Have you abandoned your Nintendog, you mean, mean person?

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You need to go show your dog a little bit of love. If you didn't sell the cartridge back or anything like that, I don't know.

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Tigerclaw pointing out they also have birds and monsters.

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So they bet that they have birds and monsters. I'm not sure about birds and monsters.

112
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Maybe birds, but I know that they did, like, pets fashion. So you would dress up your animals and stuff.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
And they didn't just have regular animals. They had lizards and stuff. So there's lizards with tiaras and stuff. It's just really strange.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Uh, Joosten's in our chat room tonight saying, imagine babies with a Z.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Was that the Wii one that actually had the baby controller where you would put the Wii in it and it would come up with the screen like, do not shake the baby?

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No, that's baby saving mama. And, no, imagine babies was the one that I got for her.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's right!

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Have you checked on your babies, Dark Sakura?

119
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
There's a reason I don't have any.

120
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Because she hasn't checked on them in about seven years.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And Tychoplasm says, don't be surprised if they did zombies. Yes, Majesco, if I remember correctly, it was Majesco that did a zombie raising game.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Somebody did. There's one out there on the 3DS or DS, I know.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're not even joking.

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's 3DS, actually.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Alright, well, let's get into tonight's show. We usually do a kickoff topic here to start off the show before we get into our gaming week.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But this week, instead of like one kickoff topic, we kind of have like a hodgepodge of a few things we want to get out there at the top of the show this week.

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:21,000
First off, if you are listening live to us at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, you probably heard before our show, as he does every week for many, many years, the Bobby Blackwell show.

128
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And he always starts his show at five o'clock Pacific, eight o'clock Eastern, about an hour before we go live.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And tonight was special for Bobby because he celebrated ten years. He hit his ten year mark in podcasting.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yay, Bobby, applause, applause.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So congratulations to Bobby on ten years of podcasting and, you know, it takes an incredible amount of dedication to do even one year of podcasting, let alone ten.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I mean, if you look at the gaming podcasts that have been going for ten years, it's a very, very small group right now.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And there's maybe like five, I don't even know.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But yeah, I mean, the fact that Bobby has had that kind of dedication is amazing.

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And it's really cool that we've kind of been able to do it together in many ways.

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I know at the very beginning of Bobby's show, we weren't really in the picture yet.

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But I mean, it was probably only about a year or two after he started where we started doing that whole our show is live after his show.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And we always do that throw over call.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He's always been great about promoting us and like every single show that he does.

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And so just congratulations to Bobby.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You know, it's a very different vibe than what we do here at OLR because Bobby's just one guy.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But it's amazing how he can still kind of perpetuate that with his chat room and it just being him.

143
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And Bobby's done many great things for this show.

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
A lot of the opportunities we've had would not be possible without Bobby, including the fact that we're live on the air.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You know, when Live 365's costs got too prohibitively expensive, it was Bobby who brokered that deal for us to continue on at All Games Radio where we were for several years.

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And obviously, we continued on with Bobby into this venture that we have at VOG Network now.

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So, you know, Bobby's to thank for an awful lot of that.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And, you know, if you were listening to Bobby's show tonight, you heard him talk about how for a while there were Xbox 360 gamer pics that you could download.

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They're not there anymore, sadly.

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But, you know, a few years ago, you could actually get a group of gamer pics for podcasts that at the time were on All Games, which was Bobby.

151
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And there's actually a little OLR icon.

152
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I designed it.

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You did it, yeah. And it actually has little DDR arrows and little cute things in the back.

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And I still have it set as my icon to this day.

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You can delist it all you want, Microsoft, but you can't take it off my profile.

156
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I will not replace it with one of those cheesy little avatar pictures.

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I will not.

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I will have that OLR badge until the end of time.

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So, yeah, you know, Bobby was a huge part of making that happen for us, among other things.

160
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So, you know, just a big thank you and congratulations to Mr. Bobby Blackwell.

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Now, at my workplace, when people celebrate anniversaries, when they hit like 10 years, 15 years, whatever ungodly amount of time,

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:07,000
what they like to do is they like to have the manager talk a little bit about what life was like when that person was hired at the company.

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:18,000
So, thanks to my pal, Melody, who, via Jamie and California Extreme last week, she actually found me some E3 loot from what year? 2005.

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So, I'm looking at a book called Gamer Metrics Guide, the E3 2005.

165
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And so, this is kind of talking about what gaming culture was like then and what all was going on on the different consoles.

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So, there's a chart in here.

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Overall, top titles releasing in Q3, Q4, 2005.

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So, the games that had the most buzz in 2005.

169
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So, I thought we could play a little bit of Family Feud and see if you guys can name 10 games and I'll let the chat rooms participate too.

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I won't carry this out too long. If they're not guessing any, I'll let them give up.

171
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But here we go. The top 10 overall titles releasing in 2005 when the Bobby Blackwell show started.

172
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We ourselves were, I guess, would have been in our third year at that point, but that was that year we were transitioning into the podcast for the first time and all that.

173
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So, it was a big year for us too.

174
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So, who wants to make a guess? How about you, DarkSakura? What was one of the top 10 most anticipated games in the year 2005?

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Just take a crazy guess.

176
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't forget the microphone, DarkSakura. It's important.

177
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Sorry, brains. I'm trying to think about what came out in 2005 and the only thing I can think of is like maybe...

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Didn't Postal come out?

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Didn't Postal come out? I'm sorry, Postal is not in the top 10.

180
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I didn't think it would be.

181
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm pretty sure Postal would have been banned from E3.

182
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, I know. It did come out that year.

183
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
All right. All right. She's going to get another chance.

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Tekken 5.

185
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Tekken 5. Surprisingly not even in the top 25.

186
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Really?

187
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Maybe it wasn't that year. I'll have to look at the PlayStation list.

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Buttholes. And I think it came out earlier in the year.

189
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, it's not even on the PS2. Yeah, it might have been earlier in the year.

190
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
All right. Loki, what do you think? 1 through 10. Top 10 titles.

191
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Gosh. Well, this was anticipated for that time period.

192
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes.

193
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:25,000
2005, that was the year that the Xbox 360 launched. I'm going to say Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion before they knew it was going to be delayed.

194
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Actually, funny enough, not on the list. And what's weird about this, they don't have any Xbox 360 titles on the list.

195
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So I will get that out of the system right now. There are no Xbox 360 titles on this list. I'm not sure why.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Maybe, had they announced that they were coming out that year by E3? Or was that later?

197
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Maybe it was later.

198
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No, because this thing covers the original Xbox and the PSP and everything. I don't even know if it has 360 in here.

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You know what else came out that year? GTA Liberty City Stories.

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
GTA Liberty City Stories.

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's 2006.

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There are two, no, I'm sorry, there's one Grand Theft Auto title on here. But it's Grand Theft Auto for the PSP at number 5.

203
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, that's kind of close.

204
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Grand Theft Auto for the PSP was Grand Theft Auto Liberty City Stories.

205
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, they renamed? Oh, okay. So there you go. I don't re- if it's not written down here, I forget these things.

206
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I know Grand Theft Auto, so...

207
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Alright, fair enough. Alright, take one more guess, Logie.

208
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Call of Duty 2.

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No, it's not even on the list. Can you believe it?

210
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's another Xbox game, though.

211
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It did come out that year, though. The Windows release did.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Alright. I should have said this at the beginning. This date is as of April 14th, 2005. Alright, here we go. I'm gonna go down the top 10.

213
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, that might have been before-

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I bet Soul Calibur 3's on there.

215
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Number 10. Soul Calibur 3 is number 19 on the list.

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, okay.

217
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Alright, number 10. WWE Smackdown vs. Raw for the PS2.

218
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That was a fun game.

219
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Raw 2 by THQ. Whatever happened to them?

220
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Number 9. This is what-

221
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We went with Hulk Hogan.

222
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This is hilarious. Number 9. Shadow the Hedgehog was number 9 on the list.

223
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Balls, that game was awful.

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Number 8. Gran Turismo 4 for the PSP.

225
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Wait, that never came out.

226
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
As of April 14th, 2005.

227
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Number 7. Here's the one Dark Soccer's gonna kick herself for forgetting. Animal Crossing DS was out.

228
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I just gave that away.

229
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Number 6. Kingdom Hearts 2.

230
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Number 5. Grand Theft Auto for the PSP.

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Number 4. Final Fantasy XII for the PS2.

232
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Of course. I was just talking about that.

233
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Number 3. The Godfather, which was on all the various systems.

234
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Wasn't that the first game that had the whole, like, you have to do DLC online?

235
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, hey! You like cheats in your PlayStation and Xbox games?

236
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Well, that's fine. There are button codes here, but on Xbox 360, it's paid DLC land.

237
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No more up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right for you.

238
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Number 2. Madden NFL 2006.

239
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Of course a Madden game is in the list, people.

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's always in the list.

241
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Of course.

242
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Should have guessed.

243
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Always bet on Madden being in the list.

244
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And lastly, number 1, y'all. Come on.

245
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The Legend of Zelda for the GameCube.

246
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And for some reason, it's listed as the DS here.

247
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes, I know. The game didn't come out in 2005.

248
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The Mish Cap came out at the beginning of that year.

249
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But it was still listed as the number 1 most anticipated title.

250
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Because they ended up bumping it back for the Wii.

251
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But they had that whole, wasn't the trailer reveal at E3 2005?

252
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It was, yeah.

253
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yeah, there it is.

254
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So there it is. Thank you again to, uh...

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Well, you know, I don't know why anyone was not anticipating Call of Duty 2, because it was fantastic.

256
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You want to hear something else hilarious?

257
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
So this game metrics or whatever, which I think is part of IGN, by the way.

258
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There's, um...

259
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Uh, yes.

260
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, seeing as it has a little logo on the bottom.

261
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
IGN.

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So, again, my friend Melody, thank you to her for getting me this from E3.

263
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But this is hilarious.

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The sources of gamer metrics data.

265
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
IGN.com game channels.

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
GameSpy.com.

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Rest in peace.

268
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And FilePlanet.com.

269
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Is that still a thing?

270
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Maybe.

271
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Maybe.

272
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So there you go. A little glimpse to what gaming life was like ten years ago when...

273
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I remember back in the day when they actually used game metrics as an actual metric for the industry.

274
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yeah.

275
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That was a while ago.

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That was a while ago, huh?

277
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I want to give a shout out to the Reno Game Expo, which I went to this weekend.

278
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Just kind of on a whim.

279
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Our pals, Gabe from Nascent Games, he's working on Crumple is a big game he's doing, as well as Kinship is his other game that he's working on right now.

280
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And he actually trekked up to the Reno Game Show and was talking about it on Twitter.

281
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And I was kind of like, you know, Alan and I have been talking about doing a random Reno trip ever since the 4th of July.

282
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He gives us an excuse to go to Steak and Shake, gamble a little bit.

283
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So what the hell?

284
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So we went up to Reno and went to the Reno Game Expo. So we checked that out a little bit.

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And there was a lot of vendor tables, different people set up there at the expo.

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And then if you walk down the hall towards the back, they had some panels going on throughout the day.

287
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
A lot of music because I believe the Reno Video Game Symphony is kind of the people that put it all on.

288
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And then they had just a tournament room and a big free play room.

289
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So yeah, it was kind of a smaller show.

290
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And I was there in the morning, so I don't know if it filled out more at the end of the day.

291
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But I think they also had to relocate at the last minute, which probably kind of hurt them a little bit.

292
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
They weren't inside the Silver Legacy this year. I guess as they were last year, they were across the street.

293
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But you know, there still obviously was a lot of love put out in that show.

294
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And lots of fun, cute little vendors and some indie game developers showing off what they were working on.

295
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So I finally got to sit Alan down and play through Gabe's game a little bit.

296
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
And yeah, so there was actually some boost there.

297
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So, do you remember Dark Sakura? What did you ask me before I went to Reno? What did you say to me?

298
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Uh, do you want to hang out?

299
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
No, well, and then I said, no, I'm going to Reno, lol.

300
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
And then you said, bring me back a thing.

301
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh yeah, I just said a thing.

302
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
She said, bring me back a thing.

303
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So I saw something at, you know, this gal had an Etsy table set up.

304
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So a shout out to a Not Your Grammys Etsy shop.

305
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's spelled Grammy, G-R-A-M-M-I-E.

306
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's NYG, Nerdy and Inappropriate.

307
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And so I got Dark Sakura a thing from the expo. Close your eyes.

308
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Wait, where is it? This makes great radio, doesn't it?

309
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
As I'm digging through this bag to get Dark Sakura this thing that I'm going to give her.

310
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay, open your eyes.

311
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I love it. Oh my God, this is the best.

312
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm going to put a picture up like in a minute.

313
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
So there it is. It's a little...

314
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
This is going in my cube.

315
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
When I saw that, I instantly thought of you.

316
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's a little cross stitch of a flying unicorn that looks like Nyan Cat style.

317
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And it says, later bitch, on it.

318
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And it just, the fact that it was cross stitched just definitely made me think of Dark Sakura.

319
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
There was all sorts of inappropriate cross stitch that was available there.

320
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So again, shout out to Not Your Grammys, who probably had no idea she was selling that to a radio guy, but there you go.

321
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
A couple other shout outs from the convention I want to give, because I thought these guys were really cool.

322
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And I know they're based in Reno, so if you have any listeners in the area, I thought what these guys were doing was really cool.

323
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Oh, here it is. I found my flyer.

324
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's the Great Basin Geeks.

325
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And it's a group for Jedi, Trekkies, Browncoats, Whovians, Scapers, B5ers, Cylons, Wizards, Rangers, Paladins, Elves, Orcs, and any other geeky guys and gals in or near Northern Nevada.

326
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I think they didn't leave anybody out. I think they did cover everybody.

327
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
For the record, it's now on my Instagram. And my Instagram is DarkSakura.

328
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So, shout out to Great Basin Geeks. It sounds like they do a lot of get togethers and things, and they were really cool enough to listen to what we were doing at VOG.

329
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We just kind of were talking a little bit, and they even took some of my business cards and were putting those out on the table.

330
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So shout out to those guys if any of them are listening. You can check out more information on those guys.

331
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
GreatBasinGeeks.com, and I thought this was really interesting. They're doing a free convention.

332
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Who's ever heard of a free convention? I sure haven't.

333
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
October 17th and 18th at the Reno Town Mall, the Great Basin Geek Con is going on that weekend.

334
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
So, congrats to those guys there.

335
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And good time at the Reno Game Expo. I will definitely try to go back next year.

336
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Also, I have to say I was a little bit inspired.

337
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
There was definitely a part of me after seeing a con kind of done on a smaller scale like that.

338
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I don't go to a lot of smaller cons, because usually I just don't know about them.

339
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm happy to go if there's one nearby.

340
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But I was definitely like, you know, everybody kind of always jokes.

341
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
When's there going to be a VOG con? When's there going to be an OLR con?

342
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And I have to admit, there's a part of me that's like, maybe we should do something.

343
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Maybe it's not as hard as we think it is.

344
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sure it's harder than we think it is.

345
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It probably is in reality, but I mean, you know, we know people that could help us out a little bit, I think.

346
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So, I don't know. Just know that that's an idea that's simmering a little bit.

347
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Would any of our listeners actually come out to that?

348
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm not talking like, and Rama's going, no. Rob Roberts, no.

349
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm not talking like a three-day convention or any like crazy thing.

350
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm talking about like a day con. Something like that.

351
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Just a little like couple hours.

352
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'll tell you what.

353
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
We'll rent a ballroom somewhere, get some old school video games, and just have a good old time.

354
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm not telling you like major stuff.

355
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
We'll rent out some time, and bounce you, and we'll just have like a party, and they'll be bouncing.

356
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And they'll have pizza.

357
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So you're saying that our con would have a ball pit.

358
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes, they do have a ball pit there.

359
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So, it's not only a ball pit, it's like a ball pit with cannons that fire balls at you.

360
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Oh my god, that's a deluxe ball pit.

361
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It is a deluxe ball pit.

362
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Holy shit.

363
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay. Well, let's see. We'll have to go to Kickstarter with that. We'll see about that in the future.

364
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Alright. Also, one other SSG100 Matt in chat says, cake and pie? Your decision will reflect my decision.

365
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm sure we could do something where there's cake and pie.

366
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And maybe like something that's both, like a Boston cream pie or something.

367
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Hey, I want to give one more shout out here because I know a lot of people have their attention diverted tonight

368
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
and throughout the week to Summer Games Done Quick.

369
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I feel like it was just yesterday we were talking about the Awesome Games Done Quick,

370
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
but that's because they do these things several times a year.

371
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Twice.

372
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Twice. Well, don't they even do like just like a day or something in like spring?

373
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Well, I think they also have their channel games done quick.

374
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah.

375
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So they may do stuff in between that.

376
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But they're running Summer Games Done Quick right now.

377
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And last I checked, they were doing Donkey Kong Country 3, I believe was what we were watching being speedrun on that.

378
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We were looking at that before the show tonight.

379
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
So, you know, shout out to those guys raising money for a good cause.

380
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And I know a lot of you guys are checking that out on Twitch.

381
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But just a reminder, that's going on if you had no idea that that was happening right now.

382
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So there you go.

383
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Maybe at the VOGCON we could do bad games played really slowly.

384
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Maybe. I don't know. Just throwing it out there.

385
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Really hard games played by someone that doesn't have the skill to quite complete this in a fashion that's entertaining.

386
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Let's have Loki play it.

387
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Exactly.

388
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
A guy who swears easily when he gets easily frustrated with the games.

389
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't swear when I get easily frustrated.

390
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I get really frustrated.

391
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom says, so in other words, me playing games.

392
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
There you go.

393
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Alright, that's all the hodgepodge I had for kicking us off our show tonight and all those shout outs and things.

394
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So there you go. Let's get into our gaming week.

395
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Before we get into the gaming news for the week, we're going to talk about what types of video games we have been playing this week.

396
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
So Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

397
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Played some Final Fantasy XIV.

398
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I have nothing but duties to do now. Duty.

399
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Been playing Dragon Age Origins with some pretty risque mods on them.

400
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Dragon Age Inquisition at the same time.

401
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Well, not both at the same time.

402
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I started playing Words with Friends again.

403
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm embarrassed.

404
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Oh yeah, Five Nights at Freddy's 4.

405
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I still suck at it and I screamed.

406
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I actually fell off of my chair and landed on the cat.

407
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
That was a little bit embarrassing.

408
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Actually, it was a lot embarrassing.

409
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But I will tell you all listeners because it's a night of honesty.

410
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Okay, so I heard about the Five Nights at Freddy's 4 stealth release this week.

411
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I'm sure it came early.

412
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Yeah, I know. It was just kind of one of those like, you know what, I'm done, so fuck it, here it is on Steam, which I think is great.

413
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
You know what? More companies need to do that.

414
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Right?

415
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
That's like the total anti-AAA company right there.

416
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
The fuck it, we're done release.

417
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Hey, we're done early.

418
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What?

419
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Done early?

420
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
That doesn't happen in gaming.

421
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What? And it's not broken?

422
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
So there it goes.

423
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
ActDeafed in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Happy Summerween.

424
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
SG100Matt says, I watched a few streams of Five Nights at Freddy's 4.

425
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
That's as far as I will go because nope.

426
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
So what's the deal?

427
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Honestly, I haven't looked up a lot on Five Nights at Freddy's this time around just because I am weak.

428
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But what's like the story this time?

429
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It's in your house now or something?

430
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You're a little kid.

431
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You basically start off with like the little pixel animation and you're the little crying kid.

432
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And it's like you have a Freddy Fazbear doll on your bed.

433
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
And a medical IV dripper next to the bed.

434
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And you're in your room scared of the dark.

435
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
And I haven't really gotten too far into it, mind you.

436
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
All you have is the ability to run to a door, shut the door that you're in front of, and you have your flashlight.

437
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
So like you have your closet door.

438
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And you have the door leading out into the hallway.

439
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And you can look either direction.

440
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And then you keep flashing back to your thing.

441
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And like Chica got me once.

442
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I still haven't gotten what the pattern is to it.

443
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But yeah, it's like...

444
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I was just crazy. I only made, you know, did like the first night.

445
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
And I was like, okay, done. I'm just gonna wait for the online.

446
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
But I still bought it to support it.

447
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Because I even bought you one of them.

448
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You bought me Five Nights at Freddy's 4?

449
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
No, you bought me like two or three.

450
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I got you two, I think. But I'll get you four if you want it.

451
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Because I want to watch you play it and see you scream.

452
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yeah, I know. Everybody's asking about that live stream.

453
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And well, I've got to do the vlog jam one still, which is far behind.

454
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Rob, if you did it, if you streamed it after me buying you the game.

455
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Because I'm offering.

456
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I would even get you cheesecake.

457
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
That is really good incentive.

458
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And somewhere Bobby Blackwell is sitting there going,

459
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
That's all I had to do is offer cheesecake.

460
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
You and I will go to the Cheesecake Factory and I will buy you whatever the fuck cheesecake you want.

461
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Whatever piece of cheesecake you want.

462
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Or cake.

463
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
What if pumpkin cheesecake's out of season and I can't really get what I want?

464
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
That they have on the menu.

465
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I will eat my low carb cheesecake and cry.

466
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And you can have the Godiva shit and balls ice cream.

467
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Is that a real flavor?

468
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I don't know.

469
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Rob Robert's Five Nights of Cheesecake presents Rob Robert Plays Five Nights at Freddy's.

470
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Shit and Balls Edition.

471
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Shit and Balls Edition.

472
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I offer that challenge to you, Rob. We must make this happen.

473
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Bobby Blackwell in chat is going, I will order a damn cheesecake.

474
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And I will also give you this limitation.

475
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Saturday.

476
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You have to do it.

477
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
If I do this before the VoG Jam thing, I will never hear the end of it from Bobby Blackwell. Never.

478
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I know that's a strong word.

479
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I'll play the VoG Jam games.

480
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So that means I have to do the VoG Jam games and the Five Nights at Freddy's thing before Saturday.

481
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
How about do it on Saturday?

482
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
On Saturday.

483
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
On Saturday.

484
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I could probably do that. We'll see.

485
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I will come over and I will get you cheesecake.

486
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Will you play the VoG Jam games with me? Because I think it would be more fun if you did.

487
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Sure, I could do that.

488
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
There you go.

489
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
We'll make a day of it.

490
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Okay. But we cap it off with a livestream of Five Nights at Freddy's 4.

491
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Alright, fair enough.

492
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
And then there will be cheesecake. And then you will be baked.

493
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
And we'll do a periscope at the cheesecake.

494
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Yes we will.

495
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I'll put a fucking candle on that shit.

496
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Just lie and tell him it's my birthday.

497
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It's Rob's birthday. I mouth the word un.

498
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Is it possible to like, because I'm sure you record your face when you're doing the livestreams and stuff,

499
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
can you have a second camera that could be facing the cheesecake and you can have cheesecake camera in the corner?

500
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
No, we're going to go out for the cheesecake afterwards because Rob has to actually sit down and play it.

501
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Probably.

502
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
SSJ100Matt says, going against USL Travis will be pissed. No, we'll be done before USL because I want cheesecake.

503
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Hell yeah. I say we do this at noon.

504
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But we close off all the doors.

505
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Our buddy John from Critical Myth told me already there's no new episodes this week.

506
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
So it's a repeat marathon. So it's okay if we go against that.

507
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
So we're like the pre-show to USL.

508
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
There you go, yes. There you go.

509
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
We have to set aside enough time for, what, at least three nights, right?

510
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I guess. However far you think I'm going to actually be able to get.

511
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Hey Rob.

512
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
What?

513
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Rob is going to play Five Nights at Freddy's 4.

514
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Anyway, alright.

515
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Hey, I win at everything.

516
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Your gaming week evolved into cheesecake.

517
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I know. Cheesecake is the best motivator.

518
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It brings people together.

519
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah, I love cheesecake.

520
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Ever since the Golden Girls.

521
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Alright. And Bobby.

522
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That's it.

523
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
When we stream the cheesecake, we have to play the Golden Girls theme.

524
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I still expect cheesecake at Dragon Con.

525
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
But for you, you can get me liquor that tastes like cheesecake.

526
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Alright.

527
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

528
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So this week I did play a few things.

529
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I tried, well, I had to download Journey and try a little bit of that.

530
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
It's mainly showing games to my son to try to give him the place on the other than Lego Marvel superheroes.

531
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Because I'm really getting tired of watching him play that game.

532
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
So I tried introducing him to Journey.

533
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm like, it's cool. Look how pretty it is.

534
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
And he's like, I don't like the thing with the glowing eyes.

535
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And so, I was like, ah, but it's so pretty.

536
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
And he's like, I don't care. The thing has glowing eyes.

537
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
So I stopped playing that after about a couple minutes.

538
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But it is gorgeous. I like the update on PlayStation 4.

539
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The next game I tried was Minecraft on PlayStation 4.

540
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I was like, hey, you can play Minecraft.

541
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And he's actually into that idea.

542
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He got really excited about it.

543
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But he doesn't understand how to work first person shooter style controls.

544
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
So that may be a little bit difficult.

545
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
So I have to work with him on that.

546
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And he doesn't like the fact that it turns night time.

547
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
So I'm like, eh, we'll see.

548
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I'm like, we can play it without zombies on. That's fine.

549
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And then I tried playing DJ Hero 2 today.

550
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But the universe decided that it didn't want me to play DJ Hero 2.

551
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So it started off, I got this idea.

552
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Because my wife is taking the kids out of the house a few hours earlier than our woman.

553
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Because I've had to watch them all weekend.

554
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And so I was like, I'm going to play some DJ Hero 2.

555
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I've been talking about doing it. I'm going to do it.

556
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Set everything up. Set up my demo unit DJ Hero controller.

557
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
It's wired and everything.

558
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I pop it in. I go to turn my Xbox on.

559
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And it keeps pushing a button.

560
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm like, what the hell?

561
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And the green button stuck because my sister was borrowing the controller.

562
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I'm like, shit.

563
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So I had to take the whole thing apart to fix the button.

564
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And I did that.

565
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And put it all back together.

566
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I go to play the game. Can't find the disc.

567
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
God damn it.

568
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
So I was like, fine. I will go buy another copy at GameStop used.

569
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Because it's like a dollar.

570
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So whatever.

571
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So I run the GameStop.

572
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Go grab DJ Hero 1 and 2.

573
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Because I think I sold one a long time ago.

574
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
And if not, who cares? It's a dollar.

575
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
So I picked those up.

576
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I came back home.

577
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And DJ Hero 2, the disc will not read.

578
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So I played DJ Hero 1 for a little bit.

579
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And I got another copy of DJ Hero 2 on the way to the show today.

580
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
So hopefully that one works.

581
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
But DJ Hero 1 is pretty good.

582
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Except the audio sync on my TV is kind of off.

583
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
And I even tried recalibering and it's still off.

584
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
The button presses are synced now.

585
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But it seems like when I did the crossfades it's still off by a little bit.

586
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I miss them.

587
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
First off, you're throwing it back with a pick like DJ Hero 2.

588
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I mean those games were really underrated and kind of missed.

589
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Those games were great.

590
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
But I wonder, now that you bring up the whole music games and everything.

591
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
With these new TVs that have insane refresh rates and things compared to what we had 10 years ago.

592
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I wonder how that plays into some of these music games you're trying to play.

593
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It wasn't even laggy.

594
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
It was actually my TV because I had calibrated.

595
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
It had been so long.

596
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
So the last time I had it calibrated was when I was playing it on my work TV.

597
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
And the delay was less.

598
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So I had to recalibrate, but it still seems off.

599
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I may need to do it again.

600
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Or try using maybe component cables instead of HDMI or something like that and see if that works.

601
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I had my component cables hooked up, but I had my audio split so I could wear my headphones on it.

602
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And I was like, I just don't feel like fucking hooking this back up again.

603
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Even though it'll take a few seconds.

604
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So, I don't know, DJ Hero was fun.

605
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I played a little bit of it and then I was like, shit, I better go run some errands.

606
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Aside from that, I've been working on my game tirelessly.

607
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I've been doing a lot of one-eighth in the morning nights to work on it.

608
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I was trying to get it to the point where I could film it and put it up this weekend.

609
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
But even that was kind of the software that I used, which was free.

610
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I had cracked it at one point and it just stopped working.

611
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So I did the right thing and bought it.

612
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But they took hours to send me the key.

613
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So I was pissed off that I went to record this and it has a big old watermark on it and shit.

614
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,000
But anyways, I had to tweak the gun on it so that it could rotate it around and stuff.

615
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So I'm going to film it once it's done.

616
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
And once this level's done, which it is pretty much done now, I have to go back and do menus.

617
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Go to my actual website that I have the domain purchased for.

618
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
It's been just sitting there for months.

619
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
And actually build the website, build the global leaderboards for it, and hook it all together so I can release a demo finally.

620
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Wow. So maybe about six months? No, I'm kidding.

621
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You joke, but yes, that's probably the time frame.

622
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Alright. My gaming week. Like Loki, I also played Journey on PlayStation 4 with the release this week.

623
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And it was really great to experience that game again.

624
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I have to admit, the game is gorgeous on PlayStation 4, but I kind of thought it was already gorgeous on PlayStation 3.

625
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
So I actually didn't really notice that big of a graphical upgrade because I already thought the game looked amazing.

626
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So, I mean, whatever there.

627
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:48,000
But I just more appreciate that it made me take another look at this game, which really is just one of the greatest games in the past ten years.

628
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I mean, undoubtedly. And if for whatever reason you still haven't played Journey, I think now is the time to do it.

629
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And, you know, it's just, I don't even know if you can put into words the experience when somebody else,

630
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,000
because everybody knows the twist by now, that somebody else will end up there on your journey that is also playing the game.

631
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,000
But you have no way of being able to talk to them except through these little chirps that you make with the button.

632
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And those chirps will also replenish the flight ribbon or whatever it's called that allows you to do jumps for distances,

633
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
depending on how many different little symbols you've collected and so forth.

634
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And it's really amazing, because you can't talk to that person, the different ways of non-verbal communication that develops.

635
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:44,000
And the person I ended up getting paired with for the majority of the Journey that I played the other night when I downloaded the game was being very helpful.

636
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It was actually directing me, basically, where all the secrets are.

637
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I would just slightly walk behind him or her in all the levels, and they would kind of lead to wherever all the different secret stuff was.

638
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And then I kind of came up with this system where I would chirp twice to say thank you or something, and then they would chirp twice back.

639
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And every time I collected a thing.

640
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
So I don't know, just something like that, even though it sounds silly the way I'm describing it,

641
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,000
just kind of the emotional impact that has with such a gorgeous game, with such a gorgeous soundtrack,

642
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
is just something you just have to experience, because there's really not a lot else like it in gaming right now.

643
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So, again, if you have an experienced Journey, now's the time to do it on the PlayStation 4 with the, I'm assuming will be, definitive version of the game.

644
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I can't see the game re-releasing again, but I guess you never know.

645
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
You can't really get, the graphics were simple enough to where I don't know if you could get it looking any better than it was.

646
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Right, but I mean, that almost makes it sound like it looks bad, which it doesn't. It's gorgeous.

647
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
You can't really add more detail to it.

648
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I was going to mention, I forgot to mention, I did play another game, Shadow of the Colossus HD.

649
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I went back and played that, and that game is frustrating now.

650
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Like, I remember having no trouble with it on PlayStation 2, but now when I play it on PlayStation 3,

651
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,000
it just seems like a lot harder than I remember, which is kind of odd.

652
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Bobby Blackwolf in our chat over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says,

653
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
What you'd notice is the frame rate. It's a much smoother experience on PlayStation 4.

654
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You know what? I kind of credited that to the TV I'm playing on now, but you're probably right. It is very, very smooth.

655
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,000
See, I didn't even think about it. I just remembered it being that smooth. I didn't even remember the frame rate being an issue.

656
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And Bobby also says, I only did one playthrough on the PS3. I'm looking forward to revisiting it.

657
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I remember being sad when I got separated from my first journey partner.

658
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I was really sad, too, because it was starting to be like 1230 in the morning, and I had to go to bed.

659
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I was not going to be able to finish a playthrough of the game. I really had to go to bed.

660
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,000
So I did that thing where you, I guess when you hit pause or whatever, your character kneels, and they did it, too, like right in front of me.

661
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
And I'm trying to figure out, like, how do I quit out of the game?

662
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And for some reason, I couldn't remember, like, how to, like, bring up the menu to quit.

663
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I think I ended up just turning off my PlayStation 4.

664
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
But they sat down after I sat down, and I ended up getting the trophy, because I guess there's actually a trophy.

665
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
If you can get two people to sit down and, like, contemplate or whatever for, like, 15 seconds, you get a trophy.

666
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So who knows if that person was trying to get it, too. I don't know.

667
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
But I ended up getting that trophy before I signed out, so I thought that was kind of neat.

668
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
EnrageNator in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

669
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Don't stop believin' the journey's fun.

670
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Of course. Of course there has to be a reference there.

671
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
All right. So I did play Journey.

672
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
I also played, of course, more Final Fantasy XIV, because, hello, this is me we're talking about, and I play a lot of that game.

673
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And a free company I'm in right now is really into running Alexander, which is the raid.

674
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
So I've been trying to help out there, and just other random things.

675
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Like, another guy in my free company just got to level 50, so I've been trying to help him clear some stuff, and that's it.

676
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Otherwise, I kind of think I've hit that point of, I really think I've done everything I can do right now on Final Fantasy XIV.

677
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And then I remember, oh yeah, I should probably work on crafting.

678
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
And then it's like, oh shit, I'm going to fall down the rabbit hole all over again.

679
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Well, I did be, I was sure, though, to make time for other games this week, and not let Final Fantasy XIV dominate my entire week.

680
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And I will say, the last game I checked out this week that was new was a game that I said last week,

681
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
you know, everybody's talking about this game, I really need to check it out already.

682
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So I played Rocket League on the PlayStation 4, which is, of course, free with PlayStation Plus, as you've probably heard.

683
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
And you've probably also heard that this game is probably turning out to be way more popular than most people assumed it was going to be.

684
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And the concept behind it is that you're basically playing soccer, or I would say it almost feels like air hockey a little bit, but with a ball that can fly up.

685
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And then instead of little like, you know, what do they call those things?

686
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Paddles.

687
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Paddles or whatever you grab onto in air hockey, you're driving a car.

688
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And the car controls like, probably like a fast, like arcade racer style car where you can just instantly throw into reverse,

689
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:09,000
you can hit X and do like a quick, or sorry, a square and you can do a quick spin, you can do X to jump or even double jump and do all this crazy stuff.

690
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So yeah, I mean, it's one of those things that sounds really simply stupid in concept, but some of the best games are.

691
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Go back and look at what was great on the Atari 2600, it was extraordinarily simple games.

692
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
And it's simple concept, it's a ton of fun.

693
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:31,000
And I haven't even really played online. I'm scared to, because I have no sense of control over the ball.

694
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Like I will always try to like jump to intercept the ball and I find myself jumping right over the ball, or I'm just under it, like I just.

695
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And then I even went so far as to watch people playing the game on Twitch, because you know on the Playstation it's all built in, it's really easy to see people playing the game, right?

696
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
And I'm watching these people do crazy shit and I'm just like, I could never.

697
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Like they know exactly how high to jump to like intercept the ball and all this stuff, like I can't do that.

698
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm not that good.

699
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:12,000
But it's just fun to play and I'm playing against the computer, there's a whole like season mode where you are on a team and you do all these other fights for teams all the way to the season final and I guess the Super Bowl of Rocket League or whatever.

700
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And I've just been having fun playing that, so.

701
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I think if you have Playstation Plus, like seriously, go get Rocket League now, like flag it to your account before it's gone, because it's great.

702
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And it's just, it's really simple.

703
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
There is a tutorial that will help get you situated, but it's not.

704
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I mean, it's kind of like, here's how you drive, here's how you boost, here's how you turn, now go play.

705
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's very, very simple.

706
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But there are also like drills. I found like there was a, like further within the tutorial you could actually do a mode where like you are in a goalie type position and it just keeps firing balls at you that you just deflect.

707
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So like you have to be able to like, I'm going to drive and intercept the ball before it hits the goal.

708
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And there's like little drills and things like that that kind of can help you be better, I guess.

709
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So, there you go.

710
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Justin's in chat saying, Rob, please play Rocket League with me, it's way more fun online.

711
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Okay, I will, as long as you promise not to get mad that I'm terrible at it.

712
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
If you don't mind that I suck, that's fine.

713
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
There you go.

714
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Let's see, Raginator in chat says, I saw a stream of Rocket League on Steam and it looks fun as fuck.

715
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
That's right, it's on PC as well.

716
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
But I don't think cross play is a thing.

717
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
At least I haven't heard if it is.

718
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I think it's separate, but I'm sure there's tons of players on both.

719
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So it's whatever, whatever.

720
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Black Wolf says, advanced tutorial shows you the trick shot.

721
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Yeah, that's right, you do like the double tap or whatever.

722
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Orange Riot says, Rocket League is way more fun online, most of the people have trouble hitting the ball too.

723
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And Justin says, we're all terrible at Rocket League, that's why it's fun.

724
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
And lastly, Brad from Pod Culture says, Rob will only play if you give him cheesecake.

725
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
That's why I'm going to name my team, the Sacramento Cheesecakes.

726
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
That'll be my name in Rocket League.

727
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Dungeon Buster says, I should really try Rocket League.

728
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yes you should.

729
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
It is on Steam, for whatever reason you don't have PS4 yet, it is on Steam as well.

730
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So you can check it out wherever.

731
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Anyway, there you go.

732
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That was my gaming week.

733
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
So let's get into housekeeping for tonight.

734
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
There actually is something really important and I probably should have said this earlier in the show.

735
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
So hopefully you guys have been listening this long.

736
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
We're actually going to do something a little different next week.

737
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
We're going to tape early next week.

738
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
We're going to do an early show next week.

739
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
This is a good thing for our folks overseas.

740
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
If you've ever wanted to participate with our show live, you'll have the ability to.

741
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And if you're used to listening to this show live at 6 o'clock, don't worry, it will still repeat at its usual time after Bobby Black Wolf.

742
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
But we are going to tape early next week.

743
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I think we're still working out the time.

744
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
It's probably going to be like 11 a.m. or noon Pacific.

745
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Stay tuned to our Twitter feed for all the latest.

746
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Twitter.com slash OLR.

747
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
We are going to do an early show next week.

748
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
The reason why I don't usually like to change things up too bad on you guys,

749
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
but a good friend of Dark Soccer and I is actually moving away from San Francisco away.

750
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
So a long time friend of ours.

751
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
I think she was on OLR once like years ago.

752
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Victoria.

753
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
She doesn't play a lot of games so I don't know if she had a lot to talk about.

754
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But yeah, she's been a good friend of the show.

755
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And she's moving.

756
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
So she's having like a last hurrah goodbye dinner type of thing in the city.

757
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So we're going to try to do that on Sunday instead of OLR that night.

758
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
So I hope you all understand.

759
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
It's for an occasion that doesn't happen every day.

760
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
So we're going to do an early show.

761
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
For overseas people, they're probably thrilled to hear this news.

762
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Because you can call in and participate.

763
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It'll be at like 8 o'clock in the evening your time.

764
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It'll be a much, much better time than it usually is.

765
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And SHO 100 Matt in Chat says, Grandpa's wife?

766
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Yes, it's Grandpa's legally separated wife at this point.

767
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Because Grandpa moved.

768
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
They live in separate places now and she's moving.

769
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So yes, it's Grandpa's wife for those of you that were listening to Hoard House.

770
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
So there you go.

771
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
As SHO 100 Matt in Chat also says, Rob will end up with a huge ass after all these cheesecake game invites.

772
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You know what? Worth it.

773
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Totally worth it.

774
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You could get low carb cheesecake if you wanted.

775
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Now what's the fucking point of that?

776
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I could. I could also, I don't know, rip my fingernails off one by one.

777
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But why would I do that?

778
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Because you're eating low carb cheesecake, of course.

779
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
It's actually delicious.

780
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I've had it before. It's okay.

781
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It's okay, but I don't think they make pumpkin low carb cheesecake. I'm just saying.

782
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I know how to.

783
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news tonight, you guys.

784
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Traveling around, talking about what's been happening in our fun little industry this week.

785
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Loki, start us off.

786
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Alright, so everybody that's pre-ordered Street Fighter V was all set and excited to play the Street Fighter V beta.

787
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Well, hope you keep that excitement because the beta was shut down pretty quickly.

788
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Unfortunately, they were running into issues with it.

789
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And they had to perform some maintenance, or extended maintenance, during which the beta will not be available.

790
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And unfortunately, they will reopen that again later on once they've fixed whatever problems there are.

791
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But that's why it's a beta test.

792
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It's a beta test. Gotta get all your bugs out now.

793
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
There's a part of me that kind of agrees.

794
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Like, okay, yeah, it's a beta test. This shit's gonna happen.

795
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
When you agree to do a beta test, this is part of what you sign up for.

796
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You know, they're testing their online so that this shit won't happen when the quote unquote real game comes out.

797
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
The only part that kind of doesn't, like, it sits in an awkward place with me

798
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:03,000
is the fact that they're basically selling this beta with preorders for Street Fighter V.

799
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
So, people that are trying to get into the beta, they did pay for it, right?

800
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Am I incorrect? Is there a free way to get into the beta without preordering?

801
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I don't think so.

802
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:21,000
So, that's the only thing that kind of sits kind of with me is that you are paying to get into it, so it probably should work.

803
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
But I kind of feel like, again, at the end of the day...

804
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Like, if you're buying a game to play a beta...

805
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah, I know.

806
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,000
...and you're dropping $5, you know, a year before the, you know, six months before it comes out, then...

807
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And you know there's people out there, though, that are like rage...

808
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,000
You know there's the rage post out there about, I'm not gonna buy the full game now because it's beta, so...

809
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Whatever. You know what? They're gonna reopen the beta at a later date.

810
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Be glad that this is now and, you know, they didn't just do it sans beta and like,

811
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
oh, well fuck, all of our online play's fucked, so sorry.

812
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And that's the part of it where I'm okay with it, so at least if they're seeing, like, Meltdown Supreme happen right now,

813
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
then they can fix that before the game goes live.

814
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
No one will remember when the game comes out.

815
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Yeah. There's that whole Miyamoto thing, right? A bad game's bad forever.

816
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
But a good game, you know, people will forget the delays. So...

817
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah, it's like Zelda on the DS and GameCube.

818
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Speaking of delays, of sorts, not really, but I know there's some people that may delay their decisions

819
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
to buy Rise of the Tomb Raider when they hear this news.

820
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Because, you know, Rise of the Tomb Raider, it's going to be a Xbox One exclusive.

821
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
It's this big thing that they were trumpeting at E3 and so forth.

822
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Yeah, it's exclusive.

823
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And they're... It is.

824
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It is exclusive to them.

825
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
For now.

826
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
That's a huge deal.

827
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
For now. But guess what's going to happen?

828
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
In early 2016, Rise of the Tomb Raider will launch for Windows 10 on the PC.

829
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
But it was exclusive. This isn't supposed to happen.

830
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
No, no, no, no. It's timed exclusive.

831
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Timed exclusive.

832
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But that's impossible. They totally convinced me that it was never coming to other platforms.

833
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I mean, we were so confident when they announced that at E3 that, like,

834
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
we knew that there was no possible way that this was ever happening.

835
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Well, Loki, it gets better. Because Square Enix also announced PlayStation 4 in Holiday 2016.

836
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So there it is. PlayStation 4 is locked out for one year.

837
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Wow. No one's going to give a shit about that game in a year's time.

838
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Well, hold on. Hold up. Put the car in park.

839
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Because I seem to recall, wasn't there this whole thing about the first Tomb Raider

840
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
and there was a lot of crap going around because Tomb Raider didn't sell,

841
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
and I'm using my quote-y fingers, enough copies, that Square Enix was,

842
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
and I'm using my quote-y fingers, disappointed with Tomb Raider and that whole thing,

843
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
with the sales or whatever, even though it had sold, like, millions, right?

844
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Because I remember we were all sitting here going,

845
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
how is this game because A, it's a great fucking game,

846
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
and B, it's selling, like, seven million or something,

847
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
and Square Enix said that was a disappointment.

848
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
But then, and my point is that then later, because of all these deep discounts,

849
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,000
you know, PlayStation sales, Microsoft sales, Steam sales,

850
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
they were selling way more copies of the game.

851
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Like, it was 11 billion copies at this point.

852
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Exactly. Like, I was looking through my PlayStation library and I'm like,

853
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I don't even remember bringing this in here, but there it is.

854
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
And then that doesn't even count the fact that they remastered it

855
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
and did it again for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and probably still made money off it.

856
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Well, I'm sure everyone on PlayStation 4 will enjoy picking up the Game of the Year edition

857
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
with all the DLC when it comes out a year later.

858
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
You know, that's what's going to fucking happen.

859
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It sucks for you Xbox people that are going to be picking it up a year early.

860
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Well, I don't, I mean, you say that, but I'm probably still going to buy it on Xbox One this holiday

861
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
because I really want to play it because the last Tomb Raider game was so good, so.

862
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Yeah, I'm feeding the system.

863
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Don't we all? I mean, what, I don't understand the logic of just waiting a whole year to buy it

864
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,000
for, you know, the other platform. I don't know.

865
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Is it going to be cheaper or something? Maybe? I don't know.

866
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I don't get the logic either, but also the logic doesn't make any sense where,

867
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
oh, I'm going to buy a system for Tomb Raider. I don't think anybody's going to do that.

868
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
People like Tomb Raider, but it's not going to sell systems.

869
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,000
It's not usually one game, Loki, but a handful of games will do it, of which Tomb Raider could be one of.

870
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,000
And, you know, a lot of the Microsoft marketing stuff has been showing, like, you know,

871
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
this is our exclusive lineup, and they've got, you know, Halo 5 right next to the Rare Replay,

872
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
right next to the Gears of War, I don't have Gears of War remasters in that,

873
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
and then the Tomb Raider's there, and then, you know.

874
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Crackdown, Forza.

875
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Yeah, Forza.

876
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Motorsport 6.

877
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Yeah, 6 or whatever they're on now. So, you know, and that's their little thing is that, you know,

878
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
we've got all these games, so when you look at that, I think it's not necessarily one game,

879
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
but maybe, like, oh, there's a handful of games I want to play on it.

880
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Alright, I'm just saying, you know, it's going to come out later, and you'll be able to get cheaper,

881
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
and it'll have more content in it.

882
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Well, I mean, it's not like-

883
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,000
Or if it's not cheaper, it'll just have more content in it.

884
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I don't know. I guess we'll see. I guess you pay a premium to have the game a little early,

885
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
but isn't that true of every single game? I mean, because if you wait long enough,

886
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:30,000
a game is going to be on discount, be it, again, one of these PlayStation Flash sales,

887
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,000
or a Steam sale, or Humble Bundle, or something, you know?

888
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Games are always going to go on sale eventually, and probably after about a year.

889
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I'm just worried, like, you know, because it's- I think people are going to lose interest in it, maybe?

890
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
You know, because when games get delayed for a long time, like, especially a year is a long time,

891
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
there's going to be a lot of stuff that's going to come out between now and then.

892
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,000
You know, people might be excited about Tomb Raider now, on Xbox One,

893
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
but in a year's time, maybe they won't care about, you know, Tomb Raider,

894
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,000
because Uncharted 4 will have come out, and all these other games that hopefully Sony will release.

895
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Well, I do-

896
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Aside from Uncharted 4.

897
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I do think you're right that Square will do something to the game to get it to be re-noticed on PlayStation 4,

898
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
because you're right, at that point, now it has to compete against Uncharted,

899
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:25,000
which is, you know, which will probably be a huge holiday game, or maybe not summer game, next year for Sony.

900
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
You know, it's going to be huge.

901
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
So yeah, it'll be weird if the two games are competing against each other.

902
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I would think Square Enix would do something to say, but this is the You Gotta Have It edition.

903
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Let's just hope it gets good reviews too, because I mean, the last one did get good reviews,

904
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:46,000
but let's just- I mean, Arkham Knight got, you know, could have had some good reviews too on PC,

905
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:54,000
but like, I'm talking like other platforms, there's a lot of like, assumptions being made here.

906
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I don't know, I'm sure that whatever money that they are getting from this exclusive deal,

907
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
they made a cost-benefit analysis on it, and they're like,

908
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
okay, this is the best course of action for us to be profitable in this game,

909
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
and fine, this isn't what they chose. Whatever.

910
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Alright, well we'll see what happens. At least they have a few extra months to make that PC version, you know.

911
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yeah, or the PlayStation 4 version, yeah. I'm looking forward to seeing that hopefully be better.

912
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

913
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Well, it would help if it would load. Okay.

914
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:35,000
So, there has been a bunch of talk about the ending of Silent Hills, how that project fell apart,

915
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
because Konami is being a butthole.

916
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Okay, maybe there's more technical to it than that, but I'm not gonna go into it.

917
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Anyway, it actually has been stated by Del Toro that he actually keeps in touch with Kojima,

918
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and the two of them still plan on collaborating in the future on a game,

919
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
and it did say specifically on a game, but he specified it would not be a Silent Hill game.

920
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
In fact, his quote is that, says, I love working with Kojima-san.

921
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,000
We are still in touch, we are still friends, and looking into doing something together, but that's not going to be Silent Hills.

922
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:24,000
He had mentioned before too that he was done with games, but I have a feeling that what they're working on is definitely gonna be a game.

923
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Maybe something along the line of Silent Hill, who knows.

924
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Please look forward to the Kickstarter.

925
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
We will.

926
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Well, even if Guillermo Del Toro is done with games, you know, maybe they could still collaborate,

927
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
and what happens is that Kojima does the game, and Guillermo Del Toro can maybe do a movie or a TV show.

928
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Yeah, here's an idea, hmm, I don't know, we could have another giant mech movie that Del Toro made,

929
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
and hmm, Kojima did work on a mech game.

930
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Metal Gear the movie?

931
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
No, no, didn't he do...

932
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Arizona of the Enders, no.

933
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Yeah, Arizona of the Enders.

934
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
So are you thinking that possibly Kojima could do something with Pacific Rim? Is that...

935
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Maybe, I don't know, that'd be kinda cool. Like a Pacific Rim game.

936
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
They already said they're working on the sequel.

937
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,000
I know that is a thing that's happening, but is Guillermo Del Toro doing the sequel?

938
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I thought I heard he wasn't doing the sequel. I mean, he's probably involved in a production story capacity, but I don't think he's doing it.

939
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Or how about we merge the two together? It'll be Pacific Rim style mechs fighting like evil things in Silent Hill.

940
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Call it deep silent.

941
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I still think there's a lot of people out there that would really like to see the P.T. thing kind of realized.

942
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:47,000
And to be honest, there wasn't that much Silent Hill really in what they showed on that P.T.

943
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So they could still kind of take that, and probably, I mean, besides the obvious trailer at the end,

944
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
but you know, they could probably still take a lot of those same concepts and put them into a game.

945
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Of course, if Konami funded P.T., then they can't exactly, technically, Konami owns all that shit in P.T.

946
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
So I don't think you're gonna be able to-

947
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
They can have the little rooms and trailer.

948
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Whatever characters or things you saw couldn't really come to a full game, but I think if Guillermo Del Toro and Kojima are like,

949
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
we have this different idea for a scary game, I think the entire internet's gonna be like,

950
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yes! Take my money. Shenmue money, Kickstarter, biggest of all time could probably be challenged by whatever they would come out and announce.

951
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So, we'll see.

952
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:42,000
But I think that would be really neat if they worked together to maybe build a franchise where Guillermo Del Toro has the Netflix show that goes with the Kojima game,

953
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,000
and they kind of help each other out a little bit, but it's still kind of separated, if that makes sense.

954
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
That'd be kind of cool. I don't know.

955
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw in chat says,

956
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
You know how developers leave the company and make a game that's a spiritual successor to a previous game?

957
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Well, yeah. I mean, you're seeing that with-

958
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Yes, Mighty No. 9 is totally not Mega Man. Totally different.

959
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It's different enough, Wink Nudge.

960
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Anyway, Dungeon Buster in chat says,

961
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
May still be considered proprietary tech for Konami.

962
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,000
And you know, there's some people out there saying, and again, this could just be a bunch of hot air, and it probably is,

963
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
that Capcom is just waiting for Mighty No. 9 to come out and then they're gonna sue.

964
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Which would be such a dick thing to do this late along, but that way they could get all the money from it without ever having to have done work.

965
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Well, you know what? I'd like to see them do that.

966
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And you know why I'd like to see them do that? Because then I can write them off even faster.

967
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It would be very- yeah, the backlash would be significant, I think.

968
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:49,000
You think people are pissed off at Konami? I mean, at least Konami's not making any more games, I mean, that people are gonna buy.

969
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I'm not trying to fear Monger. I'm not saying that is gonna happen. I'm just saying it's not off the table. It could.

970
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
No, it's not off the table.

971
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But I could get hit by a car when I go walk down the street too.

972
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
That anniversary collection's coming around the corner and no one has to buy that either, so, you know, keep that in mind, Capcom.

973
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
You know, maybe you shouldn't have fucking, um, I don't know, gotten rid of the person doing Mega Man because you said,

974
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
oh, Mega Man doesn't sell, or whatever the fucking reasons were. I'm sure they were bullshit.

975
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Yeah, we remember- we've seen the prototype footage of what you wanted Mega Man to be.

976
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Or, like, I would like to call it, uh, the Bomberman Act Zero of Mega Man.

977
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Alright, well, TigerCall on chat says Capcom sent enough shit as it is with the Street Fighter V beta, not worrying.

978
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Well, that's-

979
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
I think people will get past that, though.

980
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I mean, it's not like-

981
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
That's more hot water than, you know.

982
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,000
If you want to be mad at Capcom, you can be mad at Capcom for, like, you know, putting, you know, for canceling Mega Man Legends 3,

983
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,000
uh, for insulting everybody by putting box art Mega Man in fucking Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

984
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Like, that's a big troll move right there.

985
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Um, now presenting Loki's list of things that should piss you off more than the Street Fighter V beta.

986
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
DLC on disc? I mean, I don't know.

987
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Alright, Loki, let's- let's shift gears. Let's do a different topic.

988
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Alright, so let's talk about Dave & Busters.

989
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:19,000
And Dave & Busters, once again, kind of in the news here, because they're maybe gonna be the way that Pokken Tournament comes to the North American market.

990
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And, um, you know, right now, they- I guess there was a Reddit AMA with, um, Dave & Busters Senior Vice President, um, Kevin Bacchus,

991
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:38,000
and he's basically saying that, you know, there's a possibility, you know, that they may be bringing this game to their chain.

992
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Um, you know, saying, you know, you guys are on good terms with Nintendo Namco, right?

993
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Pokken fighters would be likely, um, to at least get a location test of the operator, right?

994
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And he says, yes, we will be testing Pokken.

995
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Candidly, both Namco and I are more optimistic about that title than our typical guests at, um, than Tekken.

996
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
So, that would be kind of cool. It looks like a weird game.

997
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Might check it out.

998
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah, it looks, uh, it looks kind of crazy, but, um, that whole, like, Q&A that was going on with the Dave & Busters guy on Reddit,

999
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
that was, um, really interesting, because, uh, a lot of the music game fans found that and stormed on that,

1000
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:21,000
and were asking questions about, like, all these different music games, and, you know, compared to most executives, you would think,

1001
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,000
like, this guy was pretty well educated on, like, what the Bomani series was and what games were out there,

1002
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
so I just thought, I thought that whole thing was an interesting read.

1003
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Well, I would think that you would have to be up in your, you know, market and stuff.

1004
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I mean, if you're selling video games, then you know the video game market.

1005
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Um, if you're running an arcade, you know the arcade market.

1006
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I mean, that only makes sense that you would know that. If you don't know it, then how are you going to survive in that business?

1007
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
I thought it was, I thought it was very interesting, too, especially in talk about a lot of those Bomani games, you know,

1008
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
having, having been in that fandom for years and years, and really still am to an extent,

1009
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:03,000
but, um, I thought it was very interesting, just the very frank talk of, if it doesn't make money, we can't put it in the store.

1010
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You know, like, these games have to perform to a certain standard, or, you know, we can't, we can't really do it.

1011
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I just thought there was some very frank dialogue that, you know, I don't know, maybe also says something about the state of arcades on a bigger level,

1012
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
but, you know, if you want these games to stay, you have to go play them, essentially, right?

1013
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Who would have thought?

1014
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Alright, well, shifting gears here to another rumor that's going around, but this one's, this one's worth talking about,

1015
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:41,000
because, you know, Universal had that agreement with Nintendo not that long ago that had to do with doing Nintendo things in theme parks.

1016
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:47,000
So, Universal and Nintendo signed this agreement where, you know, Nintendo characters could be in the theme parks and so on.

1017
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
This happened probably just a couple months ago.

1018
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Well, there's a rumor gaining steam out there around different blogs, take it with a grain of salt, because it is a rumor, but imagine the possibilities.

1019
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Universal apparently planning to create a third park as a part of Universal Orlando that is a video game heavy park.

1020
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
It would not just have Nintendo rides.

1021
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Apparently, rumor is that there are other publishers and developers such as Activision Blizzard on board.

1022
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:23,000
A World of Warcraft attraction is apparently in development, along with a Mario Kart ride,

1023
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
because you have to fucking have a Mario Kart ride if you're going to do a Nintendo theme park.

1024
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
A Pokemon ride and a Zelda ride.

1025
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Now, of course, this is a heavy rumor, but this would make a lot of sense that, of course, you're going to try to leverage some other brands and not just Nintendo.

1026
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
You're not just going to have Nintendo World.

1027
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
You might have something for other age ranges as well.

1028
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
That would be pretty cool.

1029
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I hope they do it, obviously.

1030
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:52,000
The gamer in me would love to see this actually become a reality, as long as they do it right.

1031
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:03,000
That would be so fucking amazing, as if by the time that park came about that we had AR technology good enough to where you could wear AR goggles while driving the Mario Kart to actually play Mario Kart.

1032
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
That probably could be a thing. Who knows?

1033
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:12,000
ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com suggests Pokemon Snap the ride.

1034
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Why not? It was on rails. They could totally have a Pokemon Snap ride.

1035
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Every theme park has a little kid section, and I could totally see that being a little kid ride.

1036
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
I would just ride it. I don't care about little kids.

1037
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
But I ride the little kid stuff at Disneyland once in a while, too.

1038
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
It's all about Bugsland.

1039
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Yeah, the little Bugsland has some cute stuff in it, so why not?

1040
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:41,000
It also has some really stupid stuff in it, too, like that movie they do for Bugs Life.

1041
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Like, no, go away. It's bad.

1042
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Well, I do have some disappointing news, though.

1043
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:52,000
You know, the early rumors are that this park is actually going to be based entirely around Metroid Prime Federation Force.

1044
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
So, I hope you enjoy that.

1045
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
That's why it's so important to Nintendo.

1046
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Oh, we need to start a petition. Can't have that.

1047
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
I'm going to change .org right now.

1048
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:08,000
No Metroid Federation Force allowed at the Universal Theme Park.

1049
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Oh, you troll. I love it.

1050
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
All right, speaking of Nintendo, Dark Soccer, you got something else for us before release dates?

1051
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I do indeed.

1052
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Nintendo's getting weird with their patents.

1053
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:30,000
I mean, I guess kind of not weird, but they have this patent out for a wireless sleep monitor.

1054
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Basically, what it is, it looks like it's kind of a digital alarm clock with a charging station for, like, an iPhone or something.

1055
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
It has speakers on the front and then the rear of it has a ceiling projector on it.

1056
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,000
So, you can, like, their patent says, and I'm just going to read it on here.

1057
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:58,000
This information processing system comprises a portable terminal.

1058
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
The portable terminal detects sensor information for assessing a user's emotions.

1059
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,000
It would be permissible, as an example, for the sensor information to be sound information,

1060
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
which is detected by a microphone, or image information, which is captured by a camera.

1061
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
No idea what this is for, but, like, there's pictures.

1062
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,000
It has images being directly put up on the ceiling.

1063
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
I mean, the patent came out last year.

1064
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
They actually did reveal it to their investors.

1065
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:43,000
But it was supposed to be, I think, just something for an arm other than games development, like, for another business arm as the company expanded.

1066
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Well, we are seeing that Nintendo's getting into other things, such as, you know, the Amiibo is a very, you know, physical, huge market for them now.

1067
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
And I thought we heard something a while ago about Nintendo exploring some of these other avenues.

1068
01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:01,000
And I think Nintendo's always taken an interest in this whole, like, mind and body type of stuff.

1069
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
I mean, look at some of the stuff that's done very well for Nintendo. Wii Fit, Brain Training.

1070
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
You know, these were all things that were rooted in taking a game experience beyond maybe just a game.

1071
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Well, the other thing on here is that it talks about having sensors, remote sensors, to detect pulse rate, temperature, humidity, that would bring this in through the camera, or microphone, or another input of some sort.

1072
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
And that it also did reflect the Wii Balance Board being used to measure weight.

1073
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:37,000
All of it's supposed to be uploaded to Nintendo servers and giving you a sleep score that you would get on the ceiling. That was part of it.

1074
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
I could see Nintendo doing something like this.

1075
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Competitive sleeping.

1076
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Well, yeah, like a sleep training type of thing.

1077
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I'm gonna win that one.

1078
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Finally, a video game I can be good at.

1079
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:58,000
But, you know, like, one of the reasons people buy Fitbits is to monitor, like, their sleep activity, but there's only, like, does the Apple Watch do that too?

1080
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
No, but I'm hoping for there to be an app for it. The thing is, I put mine on my charger overnight.

1081
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
But the thing charges in, like, 20 minutes anyway.

1082
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Yeah.

1083
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:11,000
But I'm wondering if there isn't something there Nintendo is sensing that they're maybe trying to get ahead of the game a little bit, which is what they need to do, right?

1084
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:15,000
They need to, instead of playing catch up, they need to be ahead of the curve.

1085
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,000
So maybe they're sensing, like, people might have an interest in getting better sleep at night.

1086
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Like, who doesn't wake up crabby sometimes because they didn't sleep well enough at night?

1087
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Maybe Nintendo is trying to do something to that experience, and I could totally see a huge marketing thing with that, you know, about.

1088
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Yeah. It looks like marketing, but you know what they're doing.

1089
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
What?

1090
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Because this is the only way they're gonna stay ahead of the competition. By stealing your dreams.

1091
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:49,000
They are going in there with this device, and they are stealing your dreams. It's being beamed straight to Nintendo. That is how they're gonna get ahead.

1092
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:59,000
They're actually par- it's- that was the plot of Super Mario 2. That's how Wart is gonna come back. He's gonna actually be stealing dreams. Wart will be in this device somehow.

1093
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
What do you think Reggie is? In disguise.

1094
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
It was a warning. We didn't even see it. And now we're too late.

1095
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Oh god, I feel like it's an episode of Scooby-Doo. It was Wart the whole time. We all wondered what happened to him.

1096
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Why isn't he in Smash Brothers?

1097
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
That's a good- I asked this question like a year ago. Like, what the fuck ever happened to Wart?

1098
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Like, and a lot of those characters in Mario 2 were kind of infamous. I know the Shy Guys have come back, and I think there were a couple others as well.

1099
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Like Birdo I think we've seen again in some places. But there were a lot of cool characters in Mario 2 that just really kind of fucking disappeared.

1100
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And maybe a part of that was because of the fact that it wasn't really Mario 2 to begin with in Japan. It was that whole TV tie-in.

1101
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:55,000
For Mario Maker, did they have a Mario 2 style in there, or was it just-

1102
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:04,000
I don't think so, because that's A, it's either probably DLC later on, or B, remember Mario 2 didn't really play like the other Marios because the characters could all do different things.

1103
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
The Princess float-

1104
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Whatever, you can do shit in Mario Maker that you can't do in a normal- I mean there's not Chain Chomps in Super Mario Brothers.

1105
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Yeah, so-

1106
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,000
So, I think it's just Super Mario 1, 3, and World, and-

1107
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
The Wii version.

1108
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Yeah, new Super Mario.

1109
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I would imagine too, they're probably just saving for DLC or something. They'll probably be a Game Boy one at some point too.

1110
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
You can make your own Super Mario Land. I don't know.

1111
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw points out the Shy Guys were in Doki Doki Panic.

1112
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
And Dark Tetsuya said,

1113
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I know there was an episode of Gaming Historian on YouTube where he talked in depth about the Super Mario 2 thing.

1114
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
So, there you go.

1115
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
DungeonBuster in chat says,

1116
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
We need an idea for new Mario levels. Bring up Dream number 3324-552.

1117
01:12:51,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and see what dreams are becoming a reality as we check out this week's release dates around the world, starting in the US. Loki?

1118
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:06,000
There's a Legend of K anniversary edition coming out on Wii U and Playstation 4.

1119
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Last I remembered, this was a Wii game, so I guess it's being ported over to those systems.

1120
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,000
BlazBlue Chronofantasma Extend on Playstation Vita.

1121
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Lost Dimension on the Vita.

1122
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
King's Quest, Chapter 1, that's going to be coming out as a download.

1123
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,000
I'm excited about that.

1124
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Playstation 4, Playstation 3, I'm guessing PC and Xbox 360 and Xbox One.

1125
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
They also are selling the complete collection for that as well.

1126
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
So, if you don't want to wait, you can purchase everything for 40 bucks.

1127
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Along with that, let's see, that'll be it actually.

1128
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out some releases over there on the Playstation 4.

1129
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:57,000
F1 2015 is out this week from Ubisoft as well as Fushigi no Chronicle.

1130
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Furikari Masen Katsu Madewa comes out from Spike this week on the Playstation 4.

1131
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,000
On the Wii U this week, haha, there's nothing.

1132
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I don't even know when the next game comes out in Japan.

1133
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I think it's probably Mario Maker. I think they get it on the 10th of September.

1134
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
But, yeah, nothing coming out there on the Wii U.

1135
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Playstation Vita still gets a lot of love over in Japan.

1136
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
And there is a ton coming out on the Vita this week.

1137
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Dyson Ryaku Exceed 2, date a live twin edition, Rio reincarnation.

1138
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Well, it's better than Davey and a dead twin.

1139
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,000
In regular and limited edition.

1140
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
And it looks like it's based off an anime or something.

1141
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I'm not, because of course it is.

1142
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
You don't say.

1143
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Who else would you be dating besides anime girls?

1144
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Follow the protagonist, Shido Itsuka, a second year student from the Ryzen High School,

1145
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
to conduct his mission to save spirits of girls.

1146
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Mysterious existences coming from bordering dimensions containing unpredictable evil powers.

1147
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Players will have to balance the time in order to keep the balance of affection points with various characters.

1148
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:11,000
While rescuing girls seems not that easy, Shindo has to date the girls for the sake of sealing the power.

1149
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I must save them by having sex with each of them.

1150
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Dates do not always have to involve copulation, thank you.

1151
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I understand that, but he's sealing the power.

1152
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
But they better involve cheesecake.

1153
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
They better involve cheesecake.

1154
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Date a live twin, Rio reincarnation, out this week in Japan.

1155
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
From compile.

1156
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Of course it's compile.

1157
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Heart no Kunen no Alice, new version, regular and limited edition coming out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

1158
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:54,000
A game called Clap! Kind Love and Punish comes out, also in a regular and limited edition this week.

1159
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And that one looks like it's also based on an anime, but this one looks like it has a lot of dudes.

1160
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Clap! Kind Love and Punish. Is that an anime I don't know about?

1161
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
It's Clap! with a K. Clap your hands.

1162
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Natsumegu comes out on the Vita, as well as Prince of Stride.

1163
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:19,000
And Zetai Meikyu Himitsu no Oyayube Hime comes out this week in Japan.

1164
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
That is a ton of shit on the PlayStation Vita.

1165
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,000
That's like all the games we're getting in an entire year here in the US.

1166
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
They're getting in like one week in Japan.

1167
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:33,000
That reminds me, when did they ever come up with as far as the voting goes for whether you're going to continue on doing Japanese release dates?

1168
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,000
We postponed that because Dark Sakura was out for a few weeks. We're going to have to bring that back. We'll set a time for that.

1169
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Maybe in like two weeks we'll do it.

1170
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Eventually.

1171
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Yeah, eventually. Because next week's the early show. Maybe in two weeks we'll do that.

1172
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Lastly on the Nintendo 3DS. Oh, here you go Loki.

1173
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
If the live twin game wasn't up your alley, you ready for this one?

1174
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I can't even read it without laughing.

1175
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Nintendo 3DS presents Corpse Party! Blood-Covered Repeated Fear comes out this week on the 3DS.

1176
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,000
It's actually a pretty popular game.

1177
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Is it?

1178
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Yeah, Corpse Party.

1179
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
I don't know the series at all.

1180
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
It came out I think on the Wii.

1181
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Oh.

1182
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
I think it was the Wii title.

1183
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:27,000
It may have been a Wii eShop title. I thought it was the Wii. It was Wii or Vita or something like that.

1184
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
All these ghosts are making this girl cry in this picture. It's not very nice.

1185
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
So there you go.

1186
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Dark Tetsuya says, that's an old one. I think it goes back to the PC-98, one of those old Japanese PC games.

1187
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Wow, okay. I was not familiar with this series. This is why I like having a live audience.

1188
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,000
But that is the antithesis to your date a live twin. Otherwise you would have a Corpse Party.

1189
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
That's right.

1190
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Monster Hunter 4G gets a price reduction.

1191
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:03,000
There's Princess... God, I read this wrong at first. I thought it said Princess Precure, Sugar Kingdom and the Sex Princesses, but it's actually the Six Princesses.

1192
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Look what this show has done to me. It's disgusting.

1193
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:14,000
And last but not least, a little game you might have heard of before called Dobuso no Mori, Happy Home Designer.

1194
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
You know what that game is, right?

1195
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Overpriced is what it is.

1196
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Animal Forest.

1197
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
That is Animal Crossing in Japan. The Happy Home Designer comes out this week in Japan on the 3DS.

1198
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I urge you not to buy it because it's overpriced. You don't need Animal Crossing amiibo.

1199
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I thought I saw a rumor or whatever, I don't know what weight it has, but that the cards are... they can't keep them in stock in Japan.

1200
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:41,000
I'm not even going to get you started. Just shut up.

1201
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Because printing cards is so difficult.

1202
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Just shut up.

1203
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Those import fees in Japan. Holy crap. How do they keep it from the import-export? It literally doesn't have to leave the company.

1204
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Where's Mike? There it is. He's done.

1205
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Dark Sakura. What's coming out in the UK?

1206
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Children.

1207
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Okay. On the 28th, the swindle for PC. On the 29th, the swindle for everything else.

1208
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
That's it.

1209
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
That's it?

1210
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Yeah.

1211
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
There's three Wii games in Japan and there's like two?

1212
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Yeah.

1213
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Alright. Moving on.

1214
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Yeah.

1215
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

1216
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You know what's not coming out though? It's Project Cars on the Wii.

1217
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Because apparently... or I'm sorry. The Wii. Well, definitely not on the Wii. And also definitely not on Wii U.

1218
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And this is funny because this game is really hyped up for the Wii U.

1219
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And like they said, despite much perseverance on the Wii U version of the Project Cars, we will no longer be actively pursuing development on it as the quality does not meet our own high standards nor the intended vision for the title and platform.

1220
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Basically saying that it was simply too much for the system to handle. That's disappointing.

1221
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,000
This is just too much.

1222
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
So the system couldn't handle it. You can't handle the cars.

1223
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:24,000
But with that though, they are going to be looking at other systems that may be coming in. So I'm thinking that they're going to be looking at maybe the next Nintendo system that will be coming out if it's going to be powerful. Maybe they'll pour it over to that.

1224
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:31,000
But now we are still going to get the F-Zero clone that's not really an F-Zero clone but it is an F-Zero clone. Wink wink.

1225
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,000
We're still getting that, right?

1226
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Yes, we're getting the mighty number F-Zero or whatever that is.

1227
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Alright.

1228
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Mighty number zero.

1229
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Alright. Well one thing that you'll not be getting on the Wii U after next month is TV. That's right. Do you remember that the Wii U has a service called TV and it's actually going to be shutting down on August 11th.

1230
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:01,000
This was of course a service that was on the Wii U. If you have a Wii U right now you can actually check this out until August 11th.

1231
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Where the gamepad is like a second screen that you use when you watch TV and you can have like little Miiverse style chats.

1232
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:19,000
For some services they actually do live updates. I remember seeing football games on this where the scores and some of the plays would come through. I thought it was kind of cool actually.

1233
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Which is why it needs to be taken care of.

1234
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Yeah, which is why they're getting rid of it apparently.

1235
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
One versus 100. That's awesome. Get rid of it.

1236
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Game room. Get rid of it.

1237
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I think people just didn't know about it. Or maybe the fact that Nintendo didn't really hype this thing up too much. I guess they did when the system first came out but then they had to really focus on the game issue without the third parties there.

1238
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:53,000
They all abandoned ship or whatever. So I think they kind of had to just give up on TV. Which I thought was an interesting idea but I also get why it didn't really work.

1239
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Because it was a little clunky. I think things like this have to be instantaneous.

1240
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:06,000
You know, TV. You press the power button, on comes the television. That's it. Right? And you change the channel to whatever you want to watch.

1241
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Like TV on the Wii U, not as fast. And I think that's part of the problem with some of this stuff. So I don't know.

1242
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:28,000
But anyway, of course this is just not long after the news that TV would not be coming to Europe due to the extremely complex nature of localizing multiple television services across a diverse range of countries with varied licensing systems.

1243
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:36,000
So there you go. It's going away. So if you want to check it out before it's gone, check it out by August 11th.

1244
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Hey, by the way, Miiverse is also going to be renovated on July 29th. Miiverse is going to be given an overhaul. That's just a little later this week.

1245
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:53,000
There will be some new features. It will also change how game specific communities work. And there's going to be a posting limit on all users.

1246
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:01,000
You will be limited to making 30 posts a day. And I think they're saying this is to keep Miiverse chat game centered.

1247
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:13,000
And that there will not be like roleplay stuff and some of the weird stuff that's shown up on, I shouldn't call roleplay weird, but there has been some weird stuff beyond just roleplay that showed up on Miiverse.

1248
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Just check out, what's that Twitter? Bad Miiverse posts or something like that? You can see a lot of hilarity over on Miiverse. So check that out.

1249
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I just hope that, you know, some of the coolest stuff we see in Splatoon has nothing to do with Splatoon.

1250
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Like when Iwata passed away, there were all those like really great tributes that were showing up in Splatoon because that's where people went because that's what the Nintendo fans, most of them are playing right now.

1251
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:50,000
So I hope that even though they're going to be doing some of these limits and these other things that they don't try to like filter out organic conversation, if that makes sense.

1252
01:23:51,000 --> 01:24:02,000
So we'll see. TigerConChat talking about the TV button on the Wii U saying the TV button actually opens a remote to control your TV.

1253
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:10,000
That's right. When they shut down the TV service, it's not the remote control that you get with the TV button. That will still work because that's just a remote control.

1254
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:18,000
But it's the actual like you can actually log into this app and it will turn your Wii U gamepad into a bit more of a second screen thing.

1255
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:27,000
So there you go. Kaijuto says bye bye fun times on Miiverse. They're going to fuck it up big time. I hope not, but I don't know. We'll see.

1256
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Alright, well before people were asking on Miiverse how babies were made, we had other types of video games that we were playing and you couldn't post on social media about them.

1257
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You could take a Polaroid and show it to your friends. That was about it.

1258
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault and find a classic video game that she thinks, hey, brats, you kids out there, you should be playing this game this week.

1259
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:03,000
And this is one of my very, very, very favorite classic games, I must say. You were going to do this game last week, but then, you know.

1260
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Yeah, this needs to be in my vault, but Dan says it sucks and I'm going to kick him in the shin.

1261
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
You should kick him in the shin. I want to get one. Allen knows that I want to get one.

1262
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
They were selling one at California Extreme.

1263
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:18,000
What? Oh my god, honestly, I am dopey enough, I would have bought it.

1264
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Oh god, I forgot to mention all the stuff I played there. They had a Castlevania vs.

1265
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Oh my god, anyway, alright, so let's get to it. What is the classic game of the week and the first arcade game I won in my house?

1266
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Baby Pac-Man. It is a hybrid arcade pinball table that was put out by Bally Midway October 11th, 1982.

1267
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:52,000
It is a 13-inch video screen that's over a small pinball table and basically it fits into the same, basically the same space as a regular arcade machine.

1268
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Namco, of course, did not authorize this. This was totally done by Bally Midway, just like all of some of the other weird ones were.

1269
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Like Pac-Man Plus, Junior Pac-Man, and Professor Pac-Man. Basically, this is why Namco is like, okay, we're done with you Bally Midway.

1270
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
There are 7,000 of them produced.

1271
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:22,000
So basically, you have like your whole maze area up at the top and you go around and the ghosts are kind of bastards.

1272
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:28,000
And they look very Atari, like maybe 5200-ish, you know.

1273
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:39,000
So anyway, you go around and you have no energizers, but you do have chutes that are at the bottom of the screen, so when you go down there, you go to pinball table land.

1274
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:51,000
And so basically, you just have to hit the targets with the pinball, you have two flippers, and you can earn different power pills- well, the energizer pills.

1275
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Get different fruit bonuses, get better tunnel speed, all the stuff that you do in the video mode. So basically, you're building power-ups by using the pinball mode.

1276
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:14,000
And then when you lose the ball in play, you go back to video mode, and then the chutes close, so you have to either eat all of the remaining everything else up there, or get caught by a ghost to reopen them, and then of course you run out of lives.

1277
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
We were on like a 5 life machine, it was great.

1278
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:25,000
And that's really Baby Pac-Man, but it was so unique, and I think people are stupid if they don't like it. I'm kidding.

1279
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Well, Alan Alchemy in chat says it's incredible for the concept in cabinet, but honestly, it's a pinball table, it's kind of bad.

1280
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Well, it's not meant to be just pinball, it's the combination. So, the little pinball mode is really just sort of like, oh my god, the ghosts are about to get me, run, and go down the chute.

1281
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,000
So, I'm actually kind of decent at this one, I can get a lot of power-ups.

1282
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:59,000
The pinball table is plain. I think that's the problem with it, there's not a lot of action going on in the center of the board, like in most machines that you see. It's nothing but lights, with the little bumpers at the top.

1283
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
And I think that's part of why this board feels really plain, because there's nothing in the center of it. They don't even have kickers.

1284
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Yeah, but the whole point is to hit the targets. And you can do all the old tricks, like the ball toss and everything, the flippers are lined up just right.

1285
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I think it's a good, I would call it almost an introductory pinball table for some people, because it helps you really build up those targeting skills.

1286
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,000
True.

1287
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Which, I mean, would come into play in a much bigger table like Twilight Zone. By the way, you know what's going to be at my house when I get there?

1288
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
What?

1289
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
A Black Knight 2000.

1290
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
Really?

1291
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Yep.

1292
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
You guys doing, uh...

1293
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
We're expanding again.

1294
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I was going to say, you haven't had pinball games in a while.

1295
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,000
We have three in the garage.

1296
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Do you?

1297
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Yeah. World Cup, Twilight Zone, and Jackbot.

1298
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Sorry, you never got rid of them.

1299
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Nope, we used to have like 13, but yeah, we were getting a Black Knight 2000 because we lucked into a really solid deal, on a really nice one.

1300
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Are the pinball addictions happening again at Casa de Dark Sakura?

1301
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,000
You better watch, I might just do Black Knight 2000. I think I've done Black Knight 2000, actually.

1302
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Alright. There it is, your classic game of the week, Baby Pac-Man. And I don't care how crappy it is as a pinball table, I still want one.

1303
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Because I just love the whole fusion idea. It's got that rarity factor, you know? Whenever I see one of these machines, I can't pass up playing it.

1304
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
So, thank you Dark Sakura for that great pick, Baby Pac-Man.

1305
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I'm awesome.

1306
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Alright, when we come back with more Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break, we're going to get into some rapid fire news, as well as the FUGL question of the week, your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1307
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:46,000
And some more news, including, we're going to talk about the Minecraft movie, and we'll also talk about an update on that Kickstarter for Red Ash and how things are going without Mighty No. 9 being out yet.

1308
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:53,000
So, we'll check in on that when we come back after this quick break with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

1309
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. Episode number 607 for this, July the 26th of 2015, already in progress.

1310
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:17,000
If you missed the first half of the show, well, the good news is we have a podcast feed and you can go check it out a little later tonight when the show uploads.

1311
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:30,000
And you can check out what you missed, including us talking about, oh, Street Fighter V beta, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Loki making jokes during the release date segment, and me talking about Reno Game Expo and Summer Games Done Quick and all that stuff.

1312
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:39,000
It's been a very busy show so far. We've got plenty more to come, including your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1313
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:47,000
We'll take those a little later on in the program. And we'll get through your emails, if we have any this week, because I'm not sure we had any, but we'll do a last-minute check here.

1314
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com. Let's do some rapid-fire news. Quickly, some other things that happened this week without too much discussion. Loki?

1315
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:05,000
So, you're not going to have to wait too much longer if you want to get in on the Fallout Shelter action and you don't have a device that's made by Apple.

1316
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:14,000
The Android version will be coming out in August on the 13th, and once again it will also be free. So, check it out then.

1317
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Also with that, there has been some new information about Fallout 4 coming from QuakeCon, which actually happened this week.

1318
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:36,000
With that, they were able to see a presentation of Fallout 4, and there's going to be 12 companions in the game that can join you, and you can romance them, regardless of their gender.

1319
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:49,000
And then with that, going back to what they were saying during the E3 presentation, where they were talking about how the robot butler will call you by your name.

1320
01:31:49,000 --> 01:32:01,000
They have a thousand names that are included as part of the voiceovers, both common real names and as well as names that Bethesda believes its players may even use in jest.

1321
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:09,000
So, like, you know, Stupid Asshole is your name. The game may recognize Stupid Asshole and call you Stupid Asshole.

1322
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I'm down with that, so that's pretty awesome. Hopefully we'll see that in a few months.

1323
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:34,000
And then Disney Interactive is trying to poll its players to see who you want to see next as the next Disney Infinity figure.

1324
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Now, Nintendo's kind of doing something similar with Smash Brothers, but right now you can vote. There's a link that you can follow on Disney.com's blog, and they have various characters that are up for voting for who you want to see as the next figure.

1325
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:05,000
So let me read off real quickly who they have so far. In the lead, Darkwing Duck is number one in the lead, and I fully approve that.

1326
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:24,000
In the running, Baloo, Alice from the live-action Alice in the Wonderland, Mad Hatter, Dory, Belle, Beast, Cinderella, Ariel, Goofy, Peter Pan, Captain Hook, Mabel, Hercules, Kim Possible, Wally, Wally would be awesome.

1327
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
There's no fucking Tron in there, is there?

1328
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Well, they already have... I think they're already going to do Tron characters.

1329
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:38,000
More than just... what did they have? They had Sam, Flynn, and Korra, right? But that was it. There's more characters in Tron. They could do actual Tron.

1330
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:47,000
They usually do the villains as well, so maybe Tron and maybe... you know, like, was it the copy of... yeah.

1331
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Cruella de Vil, Ursula, Pocahontas, and Robin Hood. So, I'm hoping Darkwing Duck.

1332
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:00,000
That's a pretty good one. I can't be mad at Darkwing Duck. I love Dory, though. There's a part of me that would like to see that one.

1333
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Dory would be awesome. I'm surprised.

1334
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I feel like they'll do Dory anyway when the movie comes out.

1335
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
I want to see fucking gargoyles in there.

1336
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
That would have been awesome.

1337
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Or can I get... if I want blue, can I get Tailspin Blue? Because that's way better than Jungle King... or Blue.

1338
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:27,000
That's awesome. Alright, let me take over here and talk about Devil's Third, which is going to be actually, yes, Nintendo of America is bringing it to the US.

1339
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:34,000
It will release on the Wii U eShop in the fourth quarter, this being confirmed by Nintendo of America and Valhalla Game Studios.

1340
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:45,000
So, yeah, that's pretty cool. There's also going to be a PC version, but sadly, no cross-play between the two. It's just not really going to be possible.

1341
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I didn't know it was multiplayer.

1342
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:53,000
It is multiplayer and free to start. So, there's no reason not to at least give it a try.

1343
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:00,000
It can't be any worse than Tank Tank Tank as far as free-to-play things go, because, I mean, that was a fun game in the arcades.

1344
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Yeah, it's too bad. That's a game that was awesome.

1345
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I was not a fan, personally. Not a fan.

1346
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Speaking of Nintendo, a victory for them as they've won a patent case that was filed against the 3DS.

1347
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Nintendo won a patent case in federal court in Oakland. Judge Sondra Armstrong found that the Nintendo 3DS, the DSi, the DS, and the Game Boy Advance did not infringe on a patent

1348
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:33,000
asserted on those products by Quintal Research Group. Quintal is a patent-assertion company.

1349
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:40,000
You read between the lines what that really means, and hooray for another victory against those sorts of companies.

1350
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Also, in Nintendo World, there is a Splatoon update coming, revealed in a Japanese trailer for the game that showed some new maps,

1351
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:57,000
some weapons like an ink-powered gatling gun, and a paint bucket. So, that's pretty cool.

1352
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Also, another new weapon, the Rainmaker. That will probably only be available in the Rainmaker mode of the game.

1353
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Also, Camp Triggerfish is viewable in this video with the Splatoon teaser, so nice to see the content is still being pumped over into Splatoon. That's pretty cool.

1354
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Dark Sakura!

1355
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Well, Stephen Colbert's done it again. Again. And again. Basically, he's got a text-based game that is out.

1356
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:38,000
I'm actually trying to find the link to the game where you play as Stephen Colbert. And there is the link.

1357
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:44,000
It is on ColbertLateShow.com, and you can go there to play it.

1358
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Next up, in SEGA news, SEGA is not going to be doing any more 3D classics, so at least they have no more plans for it right now.

1359
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:04,000
They said they have no additional plans for it, but that they wanted to do more in the future. So, there goes that one.

1360
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:11,000
There's a lot of fun stuff in that series. That's kind of too bad, but at the same time, they've done a lot of the big classics at this point.

1361
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
They're having to dig deep into the vault at this point to do more.

1362
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:30,000
And then, there's supposed to be something about Metal Gear Solid 2 Solid Snake, which was the MSX sequel to Metal Gear Solid 2 about it having an anniversary as of last Monday, but all I see is the Wikipedia.

1363
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I think that's just a shout-out for the game having its 25th anniversary. I think that's really all it is.

1364
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
It's also far better than the excuse for a Metal Gear game we got in the US.

1365
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,000
What was it, Snake's Revenge here?

1366
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Snake's Revenge.

1367
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Yeah, which was not, again, many of you out there probably already know this, but Snake's Revenge was not truly Metal Gear 2.

1368
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:58,000
That was a cash-in because Metal Gear did so well here in the US, I think better than Konami or Ultra Games as they were publishing to get around the three-carts-a-rule year.

1369
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
They had Snake's Revenge, they kind of hastily made that, because didn't that piss Kojima off?

1370
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Like, boy, the drama started early between those two, didn't it?

1371
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I think so.

1372
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,000
But Metal Gear was originally an MSX game, and we didn't even get that system here in the States.

1373
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
The MSX version's pretty nice.

1374
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Yeah, and there's some big differences with the NES version, because even the final boss, the final boss is an actual Metal Gear in the original MSX game, but because of NES limitations, it's like a supercomputer or whatever it is here.

1375
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:39,000
And so, as a kid, you think that the supercomputer is Metal Gear, so I don't even know how that game makes any sense in retrospect.

1376
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Everyone owes it to themselves to find an MSX, or a means of playing said games.

1377
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:52,000
It also gave us Gartic, even though Gartic wasn't very good. Gartic gave us Gartic Gaiden.

1378
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:53,000
That's right.

1379
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
The Guardian Legend. Hello!

1380
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Which is a very important game.

1381
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Very important.

1382
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
But Guardian Legend was not on the MSX.

1383
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Gartic was.

1384
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Gartic was, of course.

1385
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Okay, let's go to our Facebook and our Google Plus pages for a segment we call The Fugal Question of the Week.

1386
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and ask a question, and we read some of our favorite answers here on the program.

1387
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:35,000
We're going to start off with our Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, where the question this week is about TV, which we talked about in the first half of the show.

1388
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:41,000
The Wii U's television social channel is being cancelled next month. Will you miss it? Did you ever use it or try it?

1389
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Do you think there's a place in gaming technology for such a social television experience?

1390
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Starting off on Facebook with Bryce H. who said, I used it twice, maybe.

1391
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:59,000
It was a little confusing for me. Really, especially if you had a basic cable package. You end up not being able to use half the channels on there.

1392
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:04,000
The one thing I did like is during a sporting event they had trivia and such that could socialize with other fans.

1393
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Other than that, I'm not going to miss it much. Maybe losing this will add something else. Hopefully.

1394
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Chad B. replied on Facebook and said simply, I'm pretty sure this is the first time I've heard of it.

1395
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Silent Tom replied saying to be honest, might have used it maybe a dozen times. I usually forget it was a service on the Wii U.

1396
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
The remote control feature on the other hand, I use that bad boy all the time.

1397
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Our pal Critical Myth from the Critical Myth show says, I think the problem is exactly what many around here said from the start.

1398
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:40,000
That there were and are too many existing ways to do most of what TV was supposed to do.

1399
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Jesus Z. replied on Facebook saying honestly, I've just about had it with social interaction invading every form of media ever.

1400
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It's become almost impossible to talk on Twitter or a public Facebook account without being called a racist, sexist, homo transphobe because you liked this or that game or movie.

1401
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Having people harass me while I'm watching TV, I pass.

1402
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Wasn't the Nintendo stuff moderated though? Because I think it's in line with Miiverse.

1403
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:15,000
I don't think, like I don't recall any instances of like comments section gone wild.

1404
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:19,000
And believe me, we've seen plenty of places on the internet where comments go wild.

1405
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
And I don't know if that's because Nintendo moderated it or because nobody was using it.

1406
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:29,000
And so maybe, maybe the internet filth was just staying away from it. I don't know. I don't know. Anyway.

1407
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Lastly over on Facebook, Veronica S. Oh, thank you. Act deaf in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com confirming TV was moderated.

1408
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Veronica S. last but not least on Facebook saying I used it once just to try it out but found it inconvenient to use so I never used it.

1409
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
The guide and the search features on the cable box were easier to use.

1410
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:54,000
And over on Google Plus, I think we got just one answer there about TV.

1411
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I'm also looking at it in chat saying bonds006 says I don't know Rob, I saw a lot of crap in the DS chat rooms.

1412
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:10,000
And yeah. Anyway, over on Google Plus at our Google Plus page, google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

1413
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:15,000
We just have a couple of answers here. First, Redertainment says I don't own a Wii U.

1414
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
The basic problem I have with social networking apps on any TV is the input interface.

1415
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Why should I sit on my couch and fight with a less than adequate on-screen keyboard when I can pull out my phone or tablet and have access to a keyboard I am significantly more comfortable with using?

1416
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:34,000
And lastly, act deaf said it was never available in Mexico so I can't really comment on it.

1417
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:39,000
But I do love having the gamepad be a substitute remote control for my TV.

1418
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:44,000
You know, I've heard some people that really swear by that remote control. So good thing I guess that's not going away.

1419
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:51,000
It does sure come in handy when you can't find the regular remote control for your television as long as you've configured everything accurately.

1420
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Alright, that does it for the Fugu question of the week. Thank you everybody for participating.

1421
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:02,000
And you know, for me personally, I did use TV once or twice but for me, I think it was just the whole fact it was kind of clunky to get into.

1422
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Like, if it could come up as fast as TV does otherwise, I might have found more use for it.

1423
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Or maybe if there was a little more advertising or social media awareness like, hey, this event is happening.

1424
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Although most big television events happen on a Sunday night.

1425
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:29,000
But maybe if they had actually said, you know, hey, while the finale of Survivor, I don't know, is going on, boot up TV, we're going to have a conversation or something, you know, with quizzes and trivia.

1426
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
You know, I think that would have been a lot more fun thing to do.

1427
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
But I guess, I don't know, I guess phone apps can do the same thing.

1428
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I don't know if there are phone apps that kind of do this. Are there phone apps out there that interact with television like that?

1429
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
You would think there would be.

1430
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I don't know.

1431
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Maybe some folks in our chat room know. Live.vognetwork.com.

1432
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Are there phone apps that you can play along with like Wheel of Fortune or something like that?

1433
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Kind of like a second screen TV experience basically. Basically what TV was doing on the phone.

1434
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:05,000
I don't know, but I thought, you know, that whole experience that we were supposed to getting with, what was that, the second screen stuff from Microsoft, this was to interact with Game of Thrones.

1435
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Did that ever fucking happen?

1436
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Not yet. I don't think so.

1437
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:20,000
I don't know, but that would be so rad though if you could play along with Wheel of Fortune while it was on air and like have like leaderboards and stuff for how quick people are guessing the puzzle.

1438
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:25,000
I mean, who doesn't do that? Watch Wheel of Fortune and yell out the answers to the puzzle when they figure it out.

1439
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:32,000
I thought they have that like on certain shows. I don't know. I've seen shows. I think they have that actually.

1440
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Because I know, I thought I've watched Wheel of Fortune or Jeopardy or something like that and they show like a leaderboard or something like for people playing at home.

1441
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Let's see. Kaijuto in chat says, no social TV apps. We just love tweets.

1442
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Darktitsvia says, I think AMC has, I think it's called StorySync. I know Walking Dead supports it. I think Halt and Catch Fire does too.

1443
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Darktitsia says, some companies do apps like that to supplement their TV shows. Tigerclaw said, whatever happened to that second screen experience which was supposed to be a rear view mirror on a racing game?

1444
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Remember when Sony pitched that idea? That was, if memory serves me right, that was the PSP interacting with the PS3.

1445
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Yeah, that was the PSP interacting with Gran Turismo 5, I think.

1446
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Because I think that was one of the things they showed at that infamous press conference.

1447
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:30,000
Yeah, because it was like, ooh, we could use a second screen. It's like, who gives a shit about using it as a rear view mirror when you have a rear view mirror in the game?

1448
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Well, it was kind of one of those things that it sounded like a good idea, but it's kind of really hard to glance at two screens at the same time.

1449
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Which might be part of the problem we use having. I don't know. I find when I play Mario Kart, it's really hard for me to glance down at the second screen that has the map.

1450
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Especially on like 250cc or 200cc or whatever it is. Alright, anyway. Let's move on with some more news. Loki.

1451
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Yeah, I was trying to see if they had a way to play with different... I think maybe Game Show Network does that. Maybe. I don't know.

1452
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Anyways, so there's a director. Apparently, we've got a new director for the Minecraft movie. None other than It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob McElhenny.

1453
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:26,000
And I don't know about him directing, since he's only done apparently just a few episodes of the show.

1454
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:39,000
I guess this independent movie that's coming, a TV movie called Pariah. But we also forget that his character Mac in the show did direct quite a few movies.

1455
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:50,000
In fact, there's quite a few in the Project Badass series. And also sequels to Lethal Weapon. So I think he's fully capable of creating a Minecraft movie.

1456
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:53,000
But he didn't direct Night Man, right?

1457
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
He didn't, but you know.

1458
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Okay. Well, it's an interesting choice. I guess you can kind of tell that that probably means that Minecraft is going to be very light-hearted, kind of funny.

1459
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:09,000
But it's got to be a kid-safe film. And It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is not always kid-safe.

1460
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I don't care. I would love a Minecraft movie that wasn't kid-safe.

1461
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I don't think that's going to happen. Minecraft is huge for kids. They're going to make it a kid's movie.

1462
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:27,000
But it would be awesome if they could do what Animaniacs and Tiny Toons used to do back in the day.

1463
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
It was definitely for kids, but there was humor that adults would get.

1464
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
That would kind of go over the kids' heads?

1465
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Exactly. If you could master that art, that is a funny movie. You know what I mean? But we'll see. We'll see how that goes.

1466
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:50,000
And please, can we get Dan? Hell, let's just get the whole cast of It's Always Sunny in the movie. I'm fine with them just all playing different roles.

1467
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:56,000
I still want to know, how do you make a fucking movie out of Minecraft? How do you do it? Like, is it going to be blocky?

1468
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Yeah, it's going to be blocky, probably just like the Lego movie. But it'll be just, you know, like that. They'll make a story out of it.

1469
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I guess, all right, we'll see.

1470
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I don't know.

1471
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Kaijuto in chat says, this movie is so going to suck.

1472
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,000
It won't suck. I mean, look at the Lego movie. The Lego movie is amazing.

1473
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,000
That's exactly what Bonds 006 says. Look at the Lego movie.

1474
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:25,000
And that's why I'm kind of disappointed, because originally, you know, it was supposed to be the guys that did the Lego movie doing the Minecraft movie.

1475
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I was like, damn, you know, that's going to be amazing.

1476
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I want to know why we don't have a Lego Minecraft game. Because, like, put it this way, I know that Lego has their own Minecraft thing, but it's fucking terrible.

1477
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I know, I thought you kind of read that to filth on a previous episode.

1478
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:45,000
You know, it's like, I seriously, I play it, I'm like, this is going to be amazing. There's no way this is not going to be amazing.

1479
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:50,000
It's Lego, but it's Minecraft. It's going to be amazing. It was garbage. It was so terrible.

1480
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Isn't it, like, still in development, though?

1481
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Yeah, Lego Worlds, but it's terrible. It's so goddamn terrible.

1482
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:02,000
But, like, an actual Lego, I seriously, I went to Walgreens again today to get some medicine from a kid, because he's sick again.

1483
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:09,000
And I keep passing by, and there's, like, this $20 Lego Minecraft set that's sitting there, and I'm like, I want to buy it. I want to buy it.

1484
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I want to buy it so bad.

1485
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:15,000
I'm thinking about buying it. I may buy it, but I don't. One of these days, I'm going to buy it.

1486
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Kaishudo in chat wants to know, when are they going to make a Minecraft porn movie, Mind Shaft?

1487
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:27,000
I'm surprised that hasn't already happened, honestly. What was that? It was floating around Facebook or Twitter.

1488
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:35,000
One of those places this week was some type of porn that was a take on Jurassic World, but it was, like, an Asian gay porn film or something like that.

1489
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:38,000
I don't know what it was, but it had people in dinosaur costumes.

1490
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Please tell me that there's a scene in there where they're just, like, holding their hands up.

1491
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Yes! That was the picture of the dude holding his hands up.

1492
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
That's awesome.

1493
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:51,000
With the guys, and who knows what he was going to do with those hands. But, you know, just, yeah, it was a take on that whole thing.

1494
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
So, I don't know why.

1495
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
How do you do that?

1496
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:59,000
It could have been an Onion article, for all I know, because you know those will show up on your Facebook feed, and you're scrolling so fast, you think it's real.

1497
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Or ClickHole. That's my other favorite thing ever.

1498
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:06,000
You're laughing over there, Dr. Sagra?

1499
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,000
I'm snorting.

1500
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
That website's hilarious.

1501
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Yeah.

1502
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Anyway.

1503
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Yeah, it is.

1504
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Embreon in our chat room, who says this is his first time listening. Welcome.

1505
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Says, you can find it on the shelf next to Dragon Ass, Enquizinme, and Buttborn.

1506
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Oh, DarkSakra's looking at her brain. Look at that. Her eyes.

1507
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
What? DarkSakra? I know you do this.

1508
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Did she not mention earlier that she was playing Dragon Quest Inquisition with some-

1509
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Dragon Quest? That would be a fun crossover.

1510
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Okay, Dragon Age- whatever. Dragon Age Inquisition with some mature mods on. I mean-

1511
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
No, I was playing Dragon Age Origins with mature mods.

1512
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

1513
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Keep in mind, I've already played the game before, so I was trying out different mods.

1514
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:04,000
That's- you know what? That's okay. That's what Alan does. He'll play through Skyrim, and then once he beats the game, he's like, alright, it's dong time. Gets all the mods, you know?

1515
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Pretty much.

1516
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Alright.

1517
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:11,000
There's some very interesting ones. The funniest one is actually the one that changes all the underwear to being naked.

1518
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Because then you have this one scene where you're going into a dream, and like, all these really important people, it's this big serious time, but they're all naked.

1519
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
With just, like, junk hanging out.

1520
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Now, DarkSakra, I know you follow some of the, like, the fanfic writing and all that stuff. Are you to tell me that nobody has tried to write Dragon Ass Enquizinme?

1521
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I'm sh- well, there's plenty that just aren't titled that.

1522
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
But that definitely happened.

1523
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Yeah.

1524
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:45,000
The dark parts of Tumblr. Alright. Anyhow.

1525
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Moving on. Not- god, I gotta- how am I supposed to follow that with this story? This is heavy.

1526
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Alright, so I apologize for this really awkward transition, but it's just how the stories fell this week.

1527
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:03,000
But obviously the internet is still really reeling from, you know, what happened with Satoru Iwata's sudden passing.

1528
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:07,000
And a lot of folks, though, you know, trying to look to Nintendo's future.

1529
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:14,000
You know, Nintendo right now has interim folks leading it, but what's going to happen? Who's going to be the next person in charge?

1530
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:19,000
And we were talking about this a little bit on last week's show, and Bobby, I know, was talking about this on his show as well.

1531
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:29,000
And there's been a lot of buzz, and when I say buzz, I mean the Wall Street Journal actually reporting on the possibility that Miyamoto could actually be the one that leads Nintendo.

1532
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:38,000
And I know that there's a lot of buzz around that, but some of us last week were saying, well, wait a minute, if Miyamoto has to do managing as a full-time job, Miyamoto's great at designing.

1533
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:48,000
He's the one they call on to make games that are going to incorporate the Wii U's vision and all this, so it would be a little weird if he's taken away from that to manage the company.

1534
01:52:48,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Well, now some news going around this week, and analysts and folks are now looking at that the likely candidate that will lead Nintendo in the future is going to be Genyo Takeda.

1535
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Which, if you've been following, is the other person with Miyamoto that is currently leading Nintendo while they're all still reeling from this news.

1536
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:18,000
And if you're unfamiliar with Takeda's work, you've probably played one of his games seeing as, you know, and this is one of the really cool things about the Nintendo executives.

1537
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:26,000
You know, when we were talking about Iwata and the real impact he had on games, it wasn't just about the fact that he led the company, but the fact that, you know, he was in the trenches.

1538
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:32,000
He was coding Balloon Fight. He was coding Earthbound. He was fixing Smash Brothers before the thing's releases.

1539
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:38,000
He caused there to be more to Pokemon with the compression technology. I mean, dude knew what he was doing.

1540
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:51,000
So, what's really cool is that if Takeda is who they choose to lead in the future, well, again, he's somebody who spent a lot of time working his way from the very bare levels of game design on the way up.

1541
01:53:51,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Because, of course, he was Punch Out. He was Star Tropics, which was a late NES game, but if you've never played Star Tropics, it's a great, like, kinda like a Zelda-ish follow-up.

1542
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I get that kind of vibe from it, but, I mean, that is a, that's a real classic that I think a lot of people missed, because it was really late in the NES.

1543
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Not as late as the sequel, because there was a Star Tropics 2, but anyway.

1544
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:18,000
So, yeah, there you go. They're definitely looking at him, and it obviously makes a lot of sense.

1545
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:27,000
They kinda don't think that they're going to bring somebody in from the outside to lead the company, that they tend to recruit from within, and they like these folks that have really grown up on the game design.

1546
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
So, it makes a lot of sense.

1547
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:44,000
So, well, good luck. Whoever they pick, hopefully will have a great vision for, you know, the NX, although I'm sure Iwata, his legacy will definitely be felt in whatever the NX is.

1548
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:53,000
You know, it's a lot like Steve Jobs, and when, you know, and I was making a lot of those comparisons a couple weeks ago when the news came in about Iwata's passing,

1549
01:54:53,000 --> 01:55:05,000
but Steve Jobs, his impact was felt at Apple for years and years, and I think the first product to come out that Steve Jobs did not directly have a hand in was the watch, if I'm not mistaken.

1550
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:16,000
I could be wrong on that, but I'm pretty sure this Apple Watch is like the first thing that Steve Jobs did not really directly evolve with, but you know, the upgrades of the phone that we've seen throughout the years and so forth,

1551
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
you know, he had had a hand in all of that long before he passed.

1552
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:29,000
So, I think the same is going to be true with Iwata and NX, and it'll be who can best execute that vision and maybe enhance it to make it very, very competitive. We will see.

1553
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Anyhow, moving on to another story, Dark Sakura.

1554
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Well, for folks who have been watching over Red Ash, you might have been aware that there was a stretch goal put out for doing a console port for the PS4.

1555
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Well, they reached their stretch goal. So, guess what? There's going to be a PS4 version, and I'm actually seeing if there's any other type of thing, because I know that they haven't quite hit their final goal for this.

1556
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Yeah, they've got seven days to go, and they're at $470,171 of $800,000. Seven days left. So, get on it if you want it.

1557
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
So, they did make at least that first stretch goal.

1558
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
They did.

1559
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Because there was some worry that they weren't going to make it. Just like last week, I think we were talking about it a little bit. So, it looks like the internet's kind of rallied around it, so it'll happen.

1560
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:34,000
But it's just not going to be the runaway huge $40 billion stretch goal thing that Mighty No. 9 was.

1561
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Indeed.

1562
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Alright. Well, I think it'll be cool to see what they come up with with Red Ash. Best of luck to them. Maybe when Mighty No. 9 starts selling, maybe this money for Red Ash can really be the seed money.

1563
01:56:46,000 --> 01:57:00,000
And if Mighty No. 9 does very, very well in the post-Kickstarter sales, you know, once they fulfill all their commitments to people who've already bought it, if Mighty No. 9 does very well with these post-sales, maybe that money can be used to help fund and make Red Ash even a bigger thing.

1564
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
That's how these things work, right?

1565
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Indeed it does.

1566
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Indeed. Alright, moving on. Loki.

1567
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:21,000
So, you know, the 2015 EVO Championship Series just recently wrapped up. And with that, they had a record viewership for one of the matches for Ultra Street Fighter IV, the finals between Momochi and Gamerbee.

1568
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:35,000
And it drew 250,000 viewers. That's just ridiculous. So maybe with that, you know, they will take esports a little bit more seriously. Because that's pretty good viewership.

1569
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:41,000
I don't have the numbers in front of me, but isn't that more people than watch the Heroes of the Storm thing on ESPN?

1570
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
I don't know.

1571
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Because I think it was only like 120,000 or something on ESPN. I could be wrong. I don't have the numbers in front of me.

1572
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I mean, just think about it. Different events are drawing more and more people. I mean, it's presumably millions.

1573
01:57:54,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Oh, yeah. Well, and especially, you know, that Street Fighter IV, you know, I didn't watch it live, but I saw some of the talk on Twitter.

1574
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:09,000
And, you know, there were GIFs and there were Vines and there was, you know, eventually links to YouTubes about some of the different things that had happened with that.

1575
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:20,000
And even, you know, now they're even talking about it in the chat room. Rama's saying, I can't believe that EVO was on ESPN. Bob Coffey says, those finals, them feels.

1576
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:33,000
So, yeah. And I even remember seeing a moment, I don't think it was during the Street Fighter, but it was the, I think it was Marvel vs. Capcom 3, where the guy executed a move and he thought he won and he jumped up and he was like celebrating.

1577
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
No, it was Blaze Blue, I think.

1578
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Oh, was it? Okay.

1579
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Is Blaze Blue or Guilty Gear or something like that?

1580
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Yeah. Oh my gosh. That's just got to be like, you know, on one hand, you got to kind of go like, ha ha, that's what you get.

1581
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:51,000
But at the same time, it's like when the adrenaline takes over, sometimes you're just not in control of some of those types of reactions.

1582
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:57,000
You almost have to feel bad for the guy a little bit that he, he kind of like, I don't want to say made an ass out of himself, but he's got to not be feeling too hot.

1583
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Well, make that mistake again.

1584
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
It's devastating. Huh?

1585
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
He said, I won't make that mistake again.

1586
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Well, probably a lot of people will be mindful of that in the future. They don't want to become a gift for that reason.

1587
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Remember, beat the dead corpse into the ground. That's the only way you'll know that you've won.

1588
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Bobby Blackwolf making a funny observation in chat saying, well, Colin Coward did say he'd quit ESPN if he had to cover esports.

1589
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,000
He has quit. Then they fired him. And now he's going to Fox Sports.

1590
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Apparently they're saying that, you know, there's a little note here that says that League of Legends finals drew 27 million viewers last year.

1591
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Wow.

1592
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:41,000
So it's not the biggest, but I mean, it is a smaller community, so I don't know.

1593
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Wow. Well, I'm sure also when you get into things like League of Legends, probably has more international appeal because, you know, those games do not underestimate how huge those games are in Asia.

1594
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:58,000
I mean, not even just China, but like just Asian regions. It's huge. Thank you. It's huge.

1595
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Kaijuto says Splatoon is next, baby. One billion viewers. We'll see.

1596
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Maybe EVO 2016? I don't know if Splatoon would fit in with that, but you never know.

1597
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:16,000

1598
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Hey, we got an update on the Xbox One and the dashboard is going to be reinvented. The dashboard getting a major revision this holiday season.

1599
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
And you can actually see a little preview is out now on the Internet, thanks to Major Nelson.

1600
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:38,000
And I, for one, as an Xbox One owner am happy to see this because the original dashboard was very much designed with Kinect in mind.

1601
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:46,000
And ever since they unbundled Kinect from the Xbox One, those of us that don't have Kinect yet are kind of like, it does feel weird.

1602
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
It feels a little weird the way it works. So I'm kind of glad to hear they're going back and reinventing it a little bit.

1603
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:59,000
But that, I mean, with the 360, they completely change, I mean, they completely change the 360 a couple years into it as well.

1604
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:05,000
So it's not like you have to go, oh, the Xbox One is failing or floundering, that's why they're doing it.

1605
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Sometimes you just kind of reinvent things to fit, you know, whatever future vision you have.

1606
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:15,000
And they definitely did that on the 360. Who knows? Maybe the PlayStation will do something similar in the future.

1607
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,000
I kind of doubt it because that crossbar thing really works for them, but you never know. You never know.

1608
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Anyhow, also being added in this update, Cortana, who is the Windows 10, of course, voice-based assistant.

1609
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Don't call her Siri because she's kind of Siri. But anyway, you can use Cortana and actually use her in some of the games and ask questions.

1610
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:42,000
So that's kind of neat. So we'll see what happens. Also, supposedly faster performance. Menus will be more vertical instead of horizontal.

1611
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:54,000
So we'll see. Avatars also making a comeback, and Modernized. So we will see when the dashboard is unveiled in the coming months before the holidays.

1612
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:59,000
And I'm assuming that update will also be the big backwards compatibility update. That's an assumption.

1613
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:07,000
I don't know if that'll be two separate things, but I don't see why we wouldn't get that out around the same time.

1614
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:14,000
Alright, let's go to our mailbag. Every week, I think you guys send us emails. Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

1615
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:20,000
DarkSakura dives into the mailbag head first and pulls out whatever emails you might find. Did we get anything this week?

1616
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Nope.

1617
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
No?

1618
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Nope.

1619
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,000
You guys let me down. No emails. Not a one.

1620
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
No emails.

1621
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Let's make one up.

1622
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Dear DarkSakura, I think that you should do a solo career and... No. Not happening.

1623
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Buy Rob off with cheesecake.

1624
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Alright.

1625
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
You know what?

1626
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Fair enough. It's the show where every gamer has a voice, but you have to use it.

1627
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:50,000
One of our episodes would be like, listen to us eat.

1628
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Isn't that every week in the opening minutes of the show?

1629
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
I didn't eat anything.

1630
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Loki! Loki always brings food to the show with him.

1631
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Yeah, I bring dinner.

1632
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:00,000
There he is.

1633
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Alright.

1634
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:02,000
It's a sandwich.

1635
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Moving on, let's get to the FUs of the week. An appropriate time to transition.

1636
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:13,000
When we don't get emails, then we will fill time with our FUs of the week. Why?

1637
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Because we mad.

1638
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
FU to stuff.

1639
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Nothing in particular. Just...

1640
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Yeah.

1641
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,000
General things.

1642
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Alright.

1643
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:44,000
A very vague FU. That's alright. Sometimes they have to be.

1644
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Loki.

1645
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:51,000
I guess an FU to stuff taking a lager in my game. I wanted to.

1646
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:56,000
For me, an FU to the fact that I don't have cheesecake right now.

1647
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
And a FU to the fact that...

1648
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
You can fix that.

1649
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Yeah, that's true.

1650
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:06,000
A FU to the fact that I have to get up really early tomorrow because I literally have to be two places at once at work tomorrow.

1651
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Which, you know, I love my job, not complaining, but sometimes it's very, very, very draining.

1652
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
So I have to be up very early tomorrow.

1653
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
It's a paycheck.

1654
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Because lord knows this show isn't paying the bills.

1655
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Alright. Anyhow. Let's move on. We've got a couple more stories for you guys.

1656
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,000
And then we're going to open up the Skype line for you guys to call and participate.

1657
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Orange Lounge Radio on Skype. All one word, but we encourage.

1658
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Please test your connection at Echo 1-2-3 first.

1659
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:43,000
But with all them smart phones and Skype apps and so forth, it's so easy to call us on Skype at Orange Lounge Radio.

1660
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:48,000
But you can also use the old school phone number 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1661
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
We'll be taking those calls in just a minute. But first, Loki.

1662
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Alright, so this is kind of, I don't know, I'm surprised that they did this.

1663
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:07,000
But apparently now there's going to be a patch being done or an update to the WWE 2K15 store that's removing the Hulk Hogan DLC.

1664
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Which I understand because of the whole drama and everything and WWE kind of firing him that, you know, obviously there's a little bit of a fallout there.

1665
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:25,000
But along with that though, not only is he being removed from the store, he's being removed from the WWE 2K16.

1666
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:34,000
And if you have purchased the DLC to add him to the game, that is being removed from the store.

1667
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:39,000
So if you did buy it, you can no longer download it.

1668
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
So they are PTing it?

1669
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
They are PTing it, yeah.

1670
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Wow.

1671
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Let's see here, I just want to make sure that's correct here.

1672
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:55,000
That's what some folks in chat were saying just a minute ago during the break.

1673
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:59,000
So I guess this is all developing as our show is going on tonight.

1674
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
But I think that news about the fact that you can't even re-download it I think just came out.

1675
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Yeah, I don't think, I've been hearing a little bit conflicting stuff.

1676
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:10,000
But basically it is being removed from the store if they're PTing it or not.

1677
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
We're going to use that from now on.

1678
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Then that kind of sucks because especially if you paid money for that, then you can't download it again.

1679
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:23,000
But it's not too surprising, I mean they made him disappear from the website like that.

1680
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:30,000
It probably has to do with, I mean without delving into the controversy because I don't even want to go there.

1681
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:36,000
But it's sometimes interesting to see the effects that these sorts of controversies can have on these types of legal arrangements.

1682
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:41,000
And I wonder if because the WWE terminated their contract with Hulk Hogan.

1683
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
They probably don't have the rights to license it anymore.

1684
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Exactly, the likeness rights go away and so they have to pull all that shit immediately.

1685
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Because technically if it were to stay up, Hulk Hogan could sue.

1686
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
So that's probably why they have to do it.

1687
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Yeah, that's too bad.

1688
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
Just interesting, very interesting.

1689
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Some folks in chat saying refund their money.

1690
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Bonds006 says, do buyers get their money back?

1691
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
How dare me mention a refund?

1692
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:14,000
But it's a fair question to ask in this digital goods day and age.

1693
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:19,000
You know, like why can't I get a refund if I'm no longer going to be able to use this?

1694
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Well I guess you could technically use it in the game, but you just have to be sure you never delete it.

1695
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Well yeah, you better hope that your system doesn't crash or anything or you need to redownload everything because then you're hosed.

1696
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,000
I really think they should have kept it up anyways, like at least have that up on the server.

1697
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Like they've done that with games that have been discontinued because of licensing issues, but now they're just kind of wiping them off the servers altogether.

1698
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I think it's a little much.

1699
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Yeah, but again the legal part of it, who knows.

1700
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Yeah, but you're not necessarily, it's not that you're reselling it, you're just allowing people to redownload something they've already purchased.

1701
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:04,000
I mean I don't think that's a bad thing. That's just good customer service.

1702
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Alright, let's see, Xanos, I hope I'm saying that right in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1703
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:17,000
It's like Rockstar updating Grand Theft Auto San Andreas to remove some songs last year after the license was up.

1704
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Let's see, I think they did that through a patch. That's kind of fucked up because you own the game.

1705
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Right?

1706
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,000
You purchased with those songs on it.

1707
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:31,000
So if you just unplugged the internet though, it could never, it will never, or uninstall, can't you delete patch data?

1708
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:38,000
You could, but it was for like, you know, San Andreas and you probably don't need the latest version of San Andreas.

1709
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:46,000
I mean you could just revert back to whatever it was prior to that or, I mean, shit, it's just stupid.

1710
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:55,000
It's stupid, like if you want to do that, you know, all going forward then you can do that, but just don't like affect the games that are already out there.

1711
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Like I remember LittleBigPlanet did that, remember they had a game that offended, the music offended somebody.

1712
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Oh yeah, it was reciting the Quran, I think, or something in one of the songs.

1713
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
This song was so great.

1714
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Yeah, so.

1715
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:14,000
I wonder if, I still have my copy of that too, that version of LittleBigPlanet.

1716
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Yeah, you just delete patch data.

1717
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Because I managed to get my copy before it came out.

1718
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:22,000
And then lastly, Rama clarifying about the Hulk Hogan thing.

1719
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Hogan himself owns the rights to his trademark and whatnot, it was under license to WWE.

1720
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,000
So, this is definitely for the legal end of things, I'm sure.

1721
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Anyhow, one more story for you guys before we get to the free-for-all that is the Skype line.

1722
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:44,000
And actually, I don't know why I'm doing this last, because this could actually end up being some pretty huge news for the future of gaming.

1723
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I guess we'll see what develops with this, but the Wall Street Journal is reporting,

1724
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:54,000
China will be ending their ban on video game consoles.

1725
02:09:54,000 --> 02:10:00,000
This is going to make way for companies like Sony and Microsoft to expand in China.

1726
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Now, when I originally read this, I thought I read something about the Xbox One launching in China.

1727
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Like, I thought there was a big to-do, but then I also thought, like, didn't it get pushed back?

1728
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I don't know. So, I kind of feel like maybe it was extremely restricted and now those restrictions are easing.

1729
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:25,000
These rules are going to apply to foreign and domestic console makers, allowing them to manufacture and sell anywhere in the country.

1730
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Previously, foreign console could only operate in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone.

1731
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Oh, maybe that's what it is. Maybe the Xbox One was only out in that particular region.

1732
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:42,000
And of course, that means when you're only in one particular area, it makes it hard to really sell, you know, all across China.

1733
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:46,000
So, Sony commenting on this, this is great news for us.

1734
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:51,000
And they added, the company remains committed to the console business in China.

1735
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:57,000
There was no comment from Nintendo or Microsoft in the Wall Street Journal article, probably because they couldn't be immediately reached.

1736
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Just so you know, gaming companies have been restricted since the year 2000,

1737
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:08,000
when Chinese regulators enacted a console ban to prevent what they said were potential adverse effects on China's youth.

1738
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:16,000
What was the, like, I'm curious to see what the market was prior to 2000 then, if, like, they were a pretty large market for them.

1739
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Well, and it's not like they don't have games at all, because I know World of Warcraft is out in China.

1740
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:32,000
It runs under a different administrator, and I think they're an expansion behind, and they had to do things like, the undead are not the undead.

1741
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:39,000
They're forsaken, and they don't have the skin falling off, because that's considered against society in China.

1742
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,000
It's a social faux pas to have that type of stuff in China, so that's not there.

1743
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:46,000
You know, so there's those types of localization things.

1744
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:50,000
I thought, I remember hearing Final Fantasy XIV was coming out in China as well.

1745
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
But again, these are all PC-based things.

1746
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,000
You know, yes, XIV is on the PlayStation 4, but it's also a big PC game.

1747
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
World of Warcraft's on PC, League of Legends is on PC.

1748
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,000
So this would be huge for China to get these consoles.

1749
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:04,000
What's been happening since 2000? Do you remember the V?

1750
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:10,000
That was the Chinese console that was like, well, it's not a Nintendo Wii, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

1751
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:15,000
But it's the Chinese bootleg Wii, essentially, with very, very similar types of games.

1752
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,000
So it's going to be interesting.

1753
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,000
You know, China is not a small place.

1754
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,000
It's actually much more populated than the U.S.

1755
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:30,000
So, I mean, the sales potential over there could be huge.

1756
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:31,000
So it's going to be very interesting.

1757
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:38,000
I mean, if it really, truly becomes like a free-for-all, like Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo can sell their stuff anywhere they want in China,

1758
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I mean, this could be huge.

1759
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:49,000
You know, if something like Wii U considered tepid in the States and, you know, overseas, just, you know,

1760
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:54,000
I know some of you might argue me on that fact, but just hear me out for a minute.

1761
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:58,000
What if the Wii U were to do phenomenally well in China?

1762
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
It would be a game changer. You know what I mean?

1763
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:07,000
Like, if a console does extremely well in China, but maybe not as well in the U.S. or even Japan, it wouldn't really matter,

1764
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:10,000
because it would still be making all that money in China.

1765
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Well, good. I'm glad they don't need to innovate any further.

1766
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Well, we'll see. I mean, I have no idea what's going to happen.

1767
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:22,000
I have a feeling like it's going to probably really impact even probably more so the next wave of consoles,

1768
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:26,000
but we'll see how these systems are received in China.

1769
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:31,000
And I wonder how much the games are going to be scrutinized.

1770
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:36,000
One thing is for the console to come out, but you would imagine that the games are going to have to go through some intense localization procedures,

1771
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:45,000
not just for language purposes, but again, like I was just talking about how World of Warcraft had to be really changed to prevent offending Chinese people.

1772
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:50,000
You know, there's probably a lot of games that have things in it that might have to be reexamined or changed.

1773
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:54,000
So, it'll just be interesting. See what happens with all that.

1774
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
So there you go.

1775
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1776
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Dungeon Buster says you can bet the censors are going to be all over the games.

1777
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:06,000
They are just as with other media such as movies.

1778
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:11,000
I'm sure that will be a thing, so it'll be interesting to see like who's going to play along and who's not.

1779
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:16,000
But that's a lot of people to open up the business to.

1780
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
All right, let's go to the phone lines. It's your turn.

1781
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:22,000
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, so give us yours right now.

1782
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,000
You can call us at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1783
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
If you want to give us a call.

1784
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Some further comments in our chat room.

1785
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Bonds006 saying, so all three companies have to make a big push on China.

1786
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:41,000
It's a huge market, and I don't see how Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony can ignore the China market.

1787
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:44,000
I don't think they'll be ignoring it, but then again, who knows?

1788
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Microsoft gets away with ignoring Japan, so anything is possible.

1789
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Anyhow, let's get to the phone lines. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

1790
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Hey, hey, it's Rama.

1791
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Hey Rama, how you doing?

1792
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I'm pretty good. I'm actually enjoying my late, late dinner.

1793
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:01,000
That is a very late dinner, because you're three hours ahead. That's almost midnight.

1794
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Yeah, what can I say? I'm a night owl.

1795
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
That's all right. I hear you. Yeah, like, I have sent you messages.

1796
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Like, don't you get up at like 5 a.m., and I've sent you messages at like 11 o'clock over here, which is like 2 a.m. over there, and you'll respond like, okay.

1797
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Yeah, because my old job, I used to get up at like 6.30, so I was in bed by 1.30, so usually when you send me the message, I'd probably be at work and I'll respond with, got it.

1798
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Now with this new job, because of the time difference, I'm usually at my computer checking Facebook real quick for a hop in the shower, start the day, so I'm able to get the message.

1799
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Wow, that's amazing. I'm usually up late too, unless I have like busy stuff.

1800
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Like, tonight I've got to be in bed by midnight, because I have to be up at like 6 a.m. tomorrow for work, no joke. There's just so much going on, but anyway.

1801
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:56,000
We're not here to talk about sleep schedules, unless Nintendo is going to be putting out that patented thing sooner rather than later. What did you call in to talk about tonight?

1802
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Pixels.

1803
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Oh, the movie.

1804
02:15:58,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Yes.

1805
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Yeah, how, did you go see it?

1806
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Yes, I did.

1807
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Good, because, you know, I know a lot of us are making decisions based on the trailer and all that, and I'm kind of looking at it very side-eyed.

1808
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:23,000
I get out to the movies so rarely, Rama. I still haven't seen Jurassic World. I never saw the Avengers sequel. I haven't seen Ant-Man. Like, the last movie I saw was like, I think, no, Interstellar was the last movie I saw. I just never get out to the movies.

1809
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Ant-Man was really good.

1810
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Yeah, I know. I need to see all this stuff, so we'll see. But anyway, so how did you like Pixels? I want to hear it from a listener themselves. How did you like Pixels?

1811
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Before I get into it, I would like to say, Rob, I see maybe four movies a year, if that.

1812
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Wow.

1813
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:44,000
And I saw Avengers in theaters. Maybe because it's me. I could have waited for home video for that.

1814
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Hmm.

1815
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
But that's just me.

1816
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,000
That's a pretty strong statement. But what about Pixels?

1817
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
I thought it was great.

1818
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Really?

1819
02:16:53,000 --> 02:17:07,000
A lot of people are hating on the movie because it's Adam Sandler. He is a lot more toned down in this film than his last few titles he's put out. We're talking toned down, like Mr. Deeds toned down.

1820
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Hmm.

1821
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:32,000
And as I said on my Facebook, Pixels was not meant for the Xbox generation. And by the Xbox generation, I'm talking about the kids who would rather sit in front of the computer, in front of the consoles, playing Halo, and cursing each other out, as opposed to what we did when we were done with homework or after school, go to the arcade and play games with each other.

1822
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:39,000
This movie was designed for older people, like over 30. That's what this movie is for.

1823
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:48,000
You know a lot of critics are really skating this. And even the chat room, there's a lot of surprise in the chat, like either they're saying, I don't believe them, or I'm genuinely surprised to hear that somebody liked it.

1824
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Yeah. Now, as for the whole Xbox generation, there are some in that generation who understand the classic arcade games, who still go to the arcades and so forth.

1825
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:09,000
But, I mean, this is what it seems, this is how it looks to me, and there were a couple of inconsistencies in the film, but I'll let that slide for the time being.

1826
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Let me ask, Kaijuto says, ask him if he was sober when he saw the movie.

1827
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Kaijuto, I was sober and I also saw it in 3D.

1828
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Wow, okay. You have to admit that was a funny question. Let me ask this question though, because this was my big concern with Pixels, genuinely.

1829
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Especially classic arcade games are sacred to me. I have a deep respect for classic games. I love to listen to game makers from the 80s and 90s just talk about the crazy shit that went on when making those games.

1830
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:58,000
I have a huge respect for that culture, and my concern is that Adam Sandler's sense of humor tends to be dick fart butt jokes, which there's a time and a place for that, that's fine.

1831
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:10,000
I did Hoard House for years and years for God's sake, but I was worried that it was going to show a lack of respect for the culture and diminish it into poopy jokes.

1832
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Oh no, no, believe it or not, they are very little poop fart dick jokes from Adam Sandler. He is more or less an adult. He is one of us. He grew up playing these games. He knows the gaming patterns and so forth. He's actually one of us and actually being good about it.

1833
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Alright, well, you know what, Rama? I have no reason to distrust your opinion. I know you and you're a stand-up guy and definitely not on their payroll, so if you say that, I have to weigh that considerably. I think personally I'll still kind of wait for Blu-ray.

1834
02:19:46,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Well, you can do that, but I'm just saying personally, to me, this was worth seeing in the theaters. I thoroughly enjoyed it. And as one person said, it's like this, Wreck-It Ralph was for the kids and family. Pixels is for the older generation and the family. It's like that, like the Venn diagram of sorts.

1835
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Interesting. Now, folks in chat juiced in our chat room saying, technically they're voxels.

1836
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Close enough, but not to truly spoil the movie, I'll say this much, I do want a Qbert sidekick.

1837
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Alright, fair enough, fair enough.

1838
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
Well, when you see the movie, you'll understand.

1839
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:45,000
I'm glad that they're bringing Qbert back, because he kind of disappeared for a while and that Steam, Playstation 4, Qbert game is a fucking mess. I'm sorry, that's like the worst game I've played in the past year, easily, is that horrible excuse of a Qbert reboot game. So, I hope that maybe...

1840
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Well, if you thought that Qbert was bad, there's something out there on TV that's much, much worse.

1841
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
On TV?

1842
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Yes, you know there was a game called Pac-Man, the Ghostly Adventures?

1843
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Yeah.

1844
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
There's an animated TV show.

1845
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Okay, no, no, no, hold on, hold on. I would have been in agreement with you on that. My son, however, I did show it to him, and it actually wasn't that bad. It was actually pretty good. Which I was surprised, because the game looks like shit, and I just thought, oh, we're just trying to cash in on Sonic and stuff. But it wasn't actually that bad. So, I can't give you that.

1846
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
The game's okay.

1847
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Alright, that's fine, that's fine. I'll wait for you to jump in and come after me for saying that Pixels was good. I was waiting for that.

1848
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Well, I mean, it's interesting when it comes to movies.

1849
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:52,000
And some people are setting their standards too high. It's Adam Sandler, you have to set your standards to Adam Sandler. If you go to see Billy Madison in Happy Gilmore Works of Art, it's just like, you know, it's an Adam Sandler movie. You go see it because of that. I'm sad that a lot of his movies aren't like Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore.

1850
02:21:53,000 --> 02:22:00,000
But, you know, I guess as we get older, you know, the tastes change, because, you know, that last movie we did with Jack and Jill was god-awful.

1851
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Yes, but that's Norbert Betts, so I mean, whatever.

1852
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:11,000
And I'm not, you know, everybody's entitled to their opinion, and, you know, admittedly I'm making a judgment based on the trailer, which maybe I shouldn't do.

1853
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:20,000
And we have this stuff with games all the time. Like, isn't there a game that you love that everybody else hates, and everybody's like, why do you play that shit?

1854
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
But it's like, I like it, okay? Shut up.

1855
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Yeah, it's called Duke Nukem Forever.

1856
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Oh, shots fired.

1857
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,000
No, I like that game. I bought that. That was a day one purchase for me.

1858
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
See? That game is terrible, I'm sorry.

1859
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:41,000
I love Duke Nukem. I wanted to love Duke Nukem Forever, but it was so broken and bad that, like, it's not that, like, it's not that it was-

1860
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Here's the fight y'all wanted.

1861
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:51,000
No, no, I'm just saying, it's not that it's, like, it's a bad Duke Nukem game, it's just it was literally broken. Like, I couldn't play the game because it was broken.

1862
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:56,000
That's why it was a bad game. Not because they were trying to be funny and they weren't funny.

1863
02:22:57,000 --> 02:23:07,000
You know, bonds006 has a great point in chat saying, I can take a shot at Adam, meaning Adam Sandler, but Uwe Boll will never get one second of my life watching anything he makes.

1864
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
It could always get worse.

1865
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
What?

1866
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,000
You can't get a shot on that, testify.

1867
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Exactly. Pixels, at least it wasn't Uwe Boll.

1868
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Alright, Ram, on that note, I'm gonna let you go.

1869
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Alright, thanks a lot, man.

1870
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Thanks for the call.

1871
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:27,000
You got it.

1872
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Bye.

1873
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
I have been very tempted to watch Grandma's Boy because I haven't seen it yet, and they do it on Netflix now.

1874
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
That's right, this is not Sandler's first game-related movie, huh?

1875
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Grandma's Boy apparently was pretty good.

1876
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,000
187-

1877
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
From their depiction of gamers, I guess.

1878
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:43,000
1877 Game O.L.R. or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1879
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Tigerclaw pointing out that the movie's directed by Chris Columbus, who's done, you know, a lot of big Hollywood movies.

1880
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Like Mrs. Doubtfire was a Chris Columbus movie, right?

1881
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:56,000
And the original Harry Potter, the very first one, I think.

1882
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:00,000
If my Hollywood trivia is correct.

1883
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:02,000
1877 Game O.L.R.

1884
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
And I'm giving props to Grandma's Boy because they had DDR in it.

1885
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
So, it gets props.

1886
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:12,000
At least there's that. All right, we got a call coming in, let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1887
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Hi, this is Ragingator.

1888
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:16,000
Hey, Ragingator, buddy, what's on your mind tonight?

1889
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
Not a whole lot.

1890
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:28,000
I have to agree with looking at one point where you said that Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore are not works of art.

1891
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:35,000
Yeah, they're probably like the whole opposite of that. They're probably like works of art.

1892
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Or diary or whatever.

1893
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:51,000
It reminds me of the scene of Billy Madison. I don't remember the entire line, but it's like, we are all now stupider for having listened to that entire monologue of yours.

1894
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,000
It's kind of like his movies, you know, it's like we are all now dumber for having watched them.

1895
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Honestly, the scene in Happy Madison where Adams, what? No, no, but I'm talking about a different movie. Oh, sorry, Happy Gilmore.

1896
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:12,000
The scene in Happy Gilmore where Adam Sandler punches Bob Barker in the face and says the price is wrong, bitch. Like, that's gonna go down in cinematic history.

1897
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,000
It is.

1898
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:19,000
You know, that's just one of those scenes you're never gonna forget as long as she lived, for better or for worse. So, I don't know.

1899
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:28,000
But then you look at shit like Jack and Jill and you're like, oh god, remember when he was in his prime? Remember when he wrote good albums? So, anyway.

1900
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I'm more serious though, the main reason I was calling. As you, the three of you know all too well, I'm a bit of a steam fanboy. No surprise there.

1901
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Just a slight bit.

1902
02:25:46,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Yeah, but I would like to just bet you a little bit about Steam. It's not so much Steam itself, it's just that some of the companies selling their games I'm seeing more so.

1903
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:27,000
We're talking about companies like Capcom and Konami and so on and so forth. While, sure enough, we got companies like Sega and whatnot, and to some degree Capcom, putting the classic games out on Steam, like the old Sega Genesis games, and a handful of games out on Steam.

1904
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Like the old Sega Genesis games, and a handful of the Dreamcast games, and of course we also got games like Ikaruga and whatnot on Steam. Even some of the Metal Slug games on Steam.

1905
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Sure, there's a lot of nostalgia on Steam, sure.

1906
02:26:52,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Yeah, why the holy cow can't we get the Gally Legends on Steam? Why can't we get some of the old economic classics on Steam? Like Contra and so on and so forth.

1907
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Or even Russian Cact on Steam. Why can't we get Fatal Fury on Steam, or even better yet, the Samurai Showdown series on Steam?

1908
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:42,000
So you're talking about like, so if I'm understanding right, it's not that you take issue with the nostalgia that's on Steam now, you're just wondering why isn't there more of it? Like Sega puts these games out, why can't we get more?

1909
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:57,000
You know, I think some of it is a tricky licensing thing. I think when you bring up a game like the Guardian Legend, we were trying to sit here and put our heads together, like who actually owns the right to the Guardian Legend right now? Do we ever even figure it out?

1910
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:11,000
No, because I think at some point, I don't even know, like Broderbund published it here in the States, and then Broderbund was acquired at some point I think by like THQ, and lord knows where it went in that right shovel, so I don't know.

1911
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Anyway, I'm sure somebody out there has the correct answer, and I'm not thinking of it right now. But some of the rights to those things are so tricky, and I think we even heard a couple weeks ago on the show about, or maybe, oh I think this was a conversation I was having with somebody,

1912
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:40,000
where I think it was Sony and Qbert, like Sony didn't even realize they had the rights to Qbert, like because sometimes when companies acquire other companies, like maybe they don't even know that they have, you know, these particular things.

1913
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:55,000
As far as like Contra, if memory serves me right, Konami had a few of these retro collections that actually were on PC, because I think GameTap had them.

1914
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:05,000
I want to say Contra was on GameTap, as was Castlevania, and some of those Konami games were actually there, those PC versions.

1915
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:23,000
So why they haven't released those on Steam is anybody's guess. It could just be that they feel like it's not worth the effort to put all the description and the art and pay whatever fees to Steam for the distribution or whatever, maybe they just feel like it's not worth it.

1916
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:40,000
I don't know. As far as Nintendo classics go, Nintendo's not going to put their stuff anywhere besides Nintendo products, that's how they're going to get you to buy them. So Nintendo stuff is never going to come out on PC. Well, and then again, I was going to say something about mobile phones a couple years ago, so who knows, never say never.

1917
02:29:41,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Yeah, I realize that Nintendo will never have their stuff on Steam, that's pretty much a given. But my feeling is, as far as all the third-party companies go, it shouldn't be too hard. Sure, there will be a cost involved, like you said, paying fees and all that.

1918
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:28,000
But the thing is, at the same time, there's a lot of people out here, like me, they have love for these old arcade games and whatnot, and you guys know me, I'm a total Steam whore. I buy shit on their left and right, unless, hell, that doesn't sound like a bragging or anything like that.

1919
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:48,000
Last time I checked, I had over 700 games on Steam, and I've only been on Steam for two and a half years, so come on, companies, give me a chance to buy your stuff and I will buy it up in a heartbeat. I'm sure there's a lot of other people that would love to buy your classic stuff.

1920
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:11,000
There's a lot of what you're talking about right here, like it was a lot of nostalgia classics, Konami was involved, because a lot of Konami's games were on there, I think Sunset Riders was the big last release the gamer had before it, pardon the pun, rode off into the sunset.

1921
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:34,000
There was a lot of Konami releases on there, especially their early stuff was there, and then for whatever reason, Microsoft pulled the plug on that shit after nine months. I still don't forgive them for it, and I'm cautious with new Microsoft shit because of it, but you have to kind of wonder, maybe it just wasn't making the kind of money they were hoping for to make it worth it.

1922
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:53,000
If it was rolling in dollars, they clearly wouldn't have cancelled it, so I have nothing to assume, but it just wasn't making the type of money they needed it to make. But it's so weird that Retro takes that much to pour it over, but I guess there is more to it than we realize.

1923
02:31:53,000 --> 02:32:12,000
For what it's worth, at least in regards to Game Room, I was buying content for that, way up to the lowest hour on there where you just couldn't buy content for that anymore, where they took down all the servers and whatnot.

1924
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:28,000
And I wouldn't say I got everything that was available for it, but at least I do get good sizable amounts, and every now and then I do fire it up just for shits and giggles.

1925
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Right now, my primary platform is Steam. I don't like really touching games where the wind's alive all that much, naturally, but still, with that being said, Game Room is fun. I'm sorry to see that go.

1926
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:56,000
Yeah, me too. Maybe it'll come back someday, who knows. We'll just have to give it time for Retro to be cool again. Anyway, Ragenator, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thanks for your call. I appreciate it.

1927
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Sure. Have a good one.

1928
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:30,000
You don't like teenagers who don't know how to behave in public.

1929
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:20,000
When everybody was still in school. That's what I did. I don't know, my honest-to-god answer, I don't watch a lot of TV either. If it's not like RuPaul's Drag Race, or stuff on Netflix, I watch a lot of the Netflix stuff, like Sense8 was the last thing I watched start to finish that I just loved.

1930
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:38,000
So if it's not one of those things, I play a lot of games. I play MMOs. That's the stuff that ends up filling my time. That's just how I choose to do my entertainment. And I realize a lot of you do both, and just probably wonder why I don't make time for both, but I don't know if I have an easy answer for that.

1931
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:51,000
You know, it's kind of like, well, I could get out to movies on a weeknight, but Alan works most weeknights, and then when it comes to the weekend, it's like, well, we have other stuff we do on the weekend, so maybe part of that's a scheduling thing. I don't know.

1932
02:34:51,000 --> 02:35:01,000
But, funny enough, it's funny this whole conversation is happening because Shane and I are talking about going to the movies tomorrow, just randomly. We were talking about like, oh, let's go to the movies tomorrow. We're trying to figure out what we're gonna see still.

1933
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:14,000
I will pretty much see anything, because I haven't seen anything, but I wanted to see Jurassic World, because I still haven't seen that, and the Pixar movie Inside Out. I still really want to see that.

1934
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Inside Out was really cute, but I want to see Jurassic World 2.

1935
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:25,000
And then I said I would see the Amy Schumer comedy, because I think she's really funny. What is it, Trainwreck or whatever? So, I don't know. We're trying to figure out what it is we're going to see.

1936
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:34,000
And I'm sure many of you are like, go see Pixels, but I'm like, I've got like two months of movies to catch up on, so there's literally like ten things on the list.

1937
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Anyway.

1938
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:45,000
S2100Matt says, Rob, seriously, go to the Alamo Drafthouse. It will change how you see movies. I have heard a lot of great things about them, and I would love to go see a movie there.

1939
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:50,000
They don't have them where I live, except I guess San Francisco is opening one.

1940
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,000
No. They do.

1941
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:52,000
They do?

1942
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:57,000
There's one in Rockland. It's not an Alamo Drafthouse. It's a new Drafthouse type place, so.

1943
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Do they have the harsh rules that the Alamo Drafthouse has? Because the Alamo Drafthouse has like that whole list of rules, like basically if you act like an asshole or if you text during the movie, we're kicking you out type of thing.

1944
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
I don't know about that, but they have food.

1945
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Yeah, I've heard about that place in Rockland, The Grill or whatever.

1946
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:16,000
I drove by it the other day. I haven't really seen a movie there yet.

1947
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:22,000
But apparently we are getting an Alamo in San Francisco, if it hasn't already opened.

1948
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:28,000
But, you know, driving to San Francisco is still like a good two-hour drive one way, and that's if I don't run into traffic.

1949
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:34,000
I'm a little afraid, because that's Dark Soccer Night's plan next Sunday when the show would usually be live, would be to San Francisco.

1950
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:39,000
And I'm a little afraid about that traffic, and especially parking. Oh my God.

1951
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Lift.

1952
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,000
Parking? Yeah, no kidding. That's true.

1953
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:50,000
That's how we got around during GamerX, is we would just park way in the middle of nowhere in San Francisco and then just take a lift where we needed to go.

1954
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:51,000
Totally.

1955
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:52,000
Kind of sad, but it works.

1956
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:59,000
Alright, one last call for calls. This is the last call for calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1957
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
All one word.

1958
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:05,000
I'm getting some mini reviews in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1959
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Justin says you can skip Jurassic World. Definitely see Inside Out.

1960
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:20,000
AkumaJP says Sky wants to call your parents for being teenagers. I don't care if somebody's a teenager, although this show might be a little bit two-hour rated, but I don't know.

1961
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:25,000
If you're like 16 or 17, whatever, it's not like you don't hear the same stuff at high school.

1962
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Dungeonbuster says see Mad Max if you haven't yet. Yeah, that was on my list.

1963
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:30,000
I really want to see that.

1964
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,000
I don't think it's in theaters near here anymore. Maybe out in Roseville where they have so many screens.

1965
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
I think it's still playing at the Palladium.

1966
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Is it?

1967
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:38,000
I think I could find out.

1968
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Yeah, because I would still see Mad Max because I didn't see that.

1969
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:45,000
And that, you know, which is funny, because again, and we talked about this on the show previously.

1970
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:49,000
I had no interest in Mad Max because I still, like, I can't break that.

1971
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:50,000
It's a sunrise.

1972
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:53,000
I can't break that mental block with Mel Gibson.

1973
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Oh, sunrise is the discount theaters. Hell yeah.

1974
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,000
You gonna go?

1975
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
Maybe. Maybe. We'll have to see.

1976
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:06,000
I keep forgetting about the discount theaters because you want to talk about a loud time at the movies.

1977
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:10,000
I will never forget the time I saw The Matrix at the Dollar Theaters.

1978
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,000
That was like going to see the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

1979
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:16,000
I don't mind loud movies when it's cult movies.

1980
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
When it's supposed to be like that.

1981
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
I just don't like it with new movies.

1982
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
It's a total double standard. I admit it.

1983
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Alright.

1984
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
Phones are not going off, so I'm going to shut them down.

1985
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:30,000
If you were just shy and you want to say something to us a little later, remember you can always email us.

1986
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Participate at OrangeLawnTrady.com or you can always tweet us as well.

1987
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1988
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,000
I didn't check in with Loki. You have to see if there's any last minute stories.

1989
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
We want to squeeze in before we're done with the show tonight.

1990
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:58,000
Don't think I had anything other than there was someone that actually had reached out to one of the developers at Valve for Half-Life 3 and basically saying the rumor is that it's not in full development.

1991
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,000
Shocker! It's not in full development and coming out tomorrow?

1992
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:08,000
Well then what's Valve doing right now? They're not really talking about whatever it is they're working on.

1993
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:09,000
I don't know.

1994
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:16,000
I mean, besides maybe Dota, but I don't think that's what everybody in the company is dedicated to, so I guess there's secrets.

1995
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:17,000
There's secrets.

1996
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:20,000
I think by the time it comes out, no one's going to care anymore.

1997
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I wouldn't go that far.

1998
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Don't Duke Nukem Forever it.

1999
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Please don't.

2000
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Alright, well if that is it from Loki, then I think it's time to wrap up the show.

2001
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:36,000
And hey, we want to thank you guys for tuning into our show tonight and listening to the whole thing.

2002
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Whether you were here live or on the podcast feed, we appreciate you being here.

2003
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
Thank you so much for participating with the show.

2004
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:45,000
And if you like what you heard, please help spread the word.

2005
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:48,000
You know, we don't have a gigantic website.

2006
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Oh wait, I did want to mention one thing. I'm sorry.

2007
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Right in the middle of my spiel, Loki.

2008
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

2009
02:39:55,000 --> 02:40:01,000
There is a spot on a, there's a website called PSPminis.com.

2010
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:02,000
They have a forum there.

2011
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:09,000
And with that, they have links to different games that are part of PlayStation Mobile

2012
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:14,000
that you can still click on those links and purchase those games even though they've shut it down.

2013
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:19,000
So if you're missing out and haven't gotten a chance to pick up some of the games, you can do that.

2014
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,000
And that's only some of the games on there.

2015
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:21,000
They have a list.

2016
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
You can do a search on there or check out NeoGaf.

2017
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
They've got a list of the different...

2018
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Did somebody dig up Pixel Poops?

2019
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
I was just trying to check to see if that's on there.

2020
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Because if I can find that, then...

2021
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Let's just do control search here.

2022
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
Pixel...

2023
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Somebody find the poop.

2024
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Somebody find Pixel Poops.

2025
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Alright.

2026
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Yeah, I didn't see it.

2027
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:48,000
So even though they've delisted it, they haven't really erased all traces.

2028
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
It's basically, they give you the...

2029
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
Maybe Aaron can help out with this.

2030
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Because if you know, if you have the developer's ID number.

2031
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
So they give you a URL.

2032
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:04,000
It's this long URL, then the developer's ID, the game ID, and then some other numbers on there.

2033
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:09,000
So YYR, if you know your developer ID and game ID, you can let us know.

2034
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:14,000
And then we can post a direct link where you can still purchase that information.

2035
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
So you do that by...

2036
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Let's see.

2037
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
If you click the links on your Vita.

2038
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:27,000
So if you go on your Vita to the web browser and click on those links, it'll take you directly to the store to purchase them.

2039
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Alright, nice little interesting back door into the store for now.

2040
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
But who knows how long it's gonna work.

2041
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:39,000
Because they could go in there Monday morning and hit the big red button that deletes everything.

2042
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Exactly.

2043
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Who knows.

2044
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Alright, anyhow.

2045
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
As I was saying before, I was so rudely interrupted.

2046
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:47,000
But at least it was a story that...

2047
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:50,000
It was indirectly related to Pixel Poop, so I forget it.

2048
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Forgive it.

2049
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Anyhow, as I was saying, if you enjoyed the show, please leave a five star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever it was that you found this program.

2050
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Remember to tell a friend or five about this show.

2051
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Because again, we don't have a huge website or a million dollar marketing campaign or whatever behind our show.

2052
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
So we appreciate all of that word of mouth.

2053
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
It goes a very, very long way.

2054
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
And that's really it.

2055
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:15,000
Thank you so much for being here and participating with the show tonight.

2056
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
We will be back next week.

2057
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:21,000
Remember, live folks, we will be live early next week.

2058
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Probably 11 AM, I think is the time we're aiming for on the West Coast.

2059
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
So we can be done with plenty of time to get to San Francisco.

2060
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:31,000
So that will be 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern.

2061
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
That will be 7 PM in the UK.

2062
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:38,000
So this is the chance for you guys overseas to participate live with our show.

2063
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Again, live listeners, if you forget that, we will repeat the show in our usual live time slot.

2064
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:46,000
So at least you'll get a new live OLR.

2065
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
But for now, that's going to do it.

2066
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Thank you so much for participating with our show and being a part of it tonight.

2067
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,000
We will see you next week.

2068
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2069
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Dark Sakura, ladies first, your final thought tonight.

2070
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
Words.

2071
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:01,000
My final thought tonight is, later bitch.

2072
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
I love that.

2073
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
The minute I saw that, I was like, it's Dark Sakura.

2074
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:06,000
It's going in my cube.

2075
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,000
It's her.

2076
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
And last but not least, Loki.

2077
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Ideally I would have a demo up for my game this week, but we'll see.

2078
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
That's the sound of me holding my breath.

2079
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:16,000
I know.

2080
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,000
I want to.

2081
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:18,000
I want to.

2082
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:22,000
It takes me three times as long to do anything.

2083
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Right, good luck my friend.

2084
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
But I will stay up late again to work on this.

2085
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
Alright, have a great week everybody.

2086
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:28,000
We'll see you in seven days.

2087
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Good night and thanks for playing.

2088
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:34,000
