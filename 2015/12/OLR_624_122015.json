{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki Tonight, we interview Rick of Tippy Goat Games, makers of the Super Sports Smash Up title, Super Slam Dunk Touchdown. We're back to get caught up on the last two weeks of gaming news, GamerX, your comments, and more. And it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, tonight with episode number 624 of our show, December the 20th of 2015. Our last show before the big, big holiday, right here in the midst of the holiday season. So happy holidays to all of you guys out there, and to my co-hosts here in studio. My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E. And joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. Hi. Hello, how are you Jamie Summers? Alright. Alright. Just, things happen. Did we have a fun adventure last week? We did. We did. We had a great fun adventure, and my feet are still arguing at me for those boots, but otherwise it was a great adventure. Your cosplay looked great at the show, and I know that there's pictures of you around on the interwebs. I'm on Unicorn Booty, which I laugh without to no end. It's a pretty hilarious website name, isn't it? It is. There is actually, they have like one of the, you know like those standees you see as you're walking into like big events? You know, you always see like the big wall with all the company logos, right? So there was one outside of GamerX for that company, and it looked like a unicorn that was about to like kick your ass. And I was like, I wanted to take a picture underneath it, like it was about to kick me in the face, but I didn't, I don't know. I didn't want to hold up traffic so I could have my awkward photo, so it didn't end up happening. Sorry. Well, they were stopping people to take pictures in front of that. That's good. Like I was going to look, and I feel bad because now I can't make my brain think of his name. Uh-huh. Josh? John? The Templar guy. Mmm. Who was Kayden. I don't recall his name, but he looked great if he's out there listening. Well, they got us together in front of the Unicorn Booty thing. And now my, I'm so mad at myself because like, I can't think of like hardly anyone's name today. That's okay. It's okay, but I saw Star Wars and life is good. Alright, fair enough. Uh, also say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hi. How are you doing, Loki? Um, I enjoyed half that burger and then I'm not enjoying the other half of that burger. Is your microphone on, Loki? Because I don't know if we're picking you up for some reason. I am completely on. Oh, you're just quiet tonight for some reason. I am not completely quiet. Alright, there you go. You have levels problems. We're having audio problems left and right in the studio tonight and I'll get into that in a minute. I guess I'll just have to talk louder. No, you're good. You're perfectly fine now. I don't know, I don't know what the hell's going on. For some reason, you're not looping back through the internal speakers like I'm used to, but you're picking up on the register so I know the audience can hear you. Okay. Oh my god. If it's not one thing breaking in studio, it's another. I'll get to that in a minute. But anyway, Loki, how has your couple weeks been? You weren't able to go to the show, I know, but how was your week off? Um, I don't remember what I did. I think I played Fallout, maybe. Or maybe Ingress. Probably Ingress. Probably a lot of Ingress. I think a little bit of Ingress and then I stayed home for some of that. You know, I was reading an article which didn't make our show roll tonight, but it was about Pok\u00e9mon GO. And there's some more information because there was an interview out there with Pok\u00e9mon GO. And I guess part of why the Pok\u00e9mon company wanted to team up with Niantic, who are the makers of Ingress, to make Pok\u00e9mon GO is that the head of the Pok\u00e9mon company is actually a high level Ingress player. And the president of Niantic was like, he's a higher level player than I am. So that kind of made me chuckle. But from what I understand, Ingress is really big in Japan. I don't know if that's true or just kind of something through the grapevine, but it kind of tells you why Pok\u00e9mon GO. I do think that is going to be quite the mobile game next year because it's going to be a mobile game very unlike the typical, I'm going to use my quotey fingers, mobile game. Like it's not going to be Candy Crush. I'll try it, I guess. I don't like Pok\u00e9mon, though, so we'll see. Maybe this will be it. Eh. This will be the first hit. I don't know. Anyhow, we also want to welcome the ever-present fourth guest on our show, the chat room. Hello to our chat room. We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network. Live.vognetwork.com is where you can find our chat room. And of course we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. We have folks in chat there saying, like, Dungeon Buster says, punch those audio problems with the dark side. I almost, I was like this close to going to see Star Wars before the show. But I had to cook, like, three things for my wife, and by that time I was like, I'm not going to make it there on time. I'm going to miss the new Deadpool preview, and that's going to make me sad, so I decided not to. Plus, I would have gotten here late. It's all good. It's fine. I'm hoping to get out during the week at some point. We'll see. SS2 and Hunter Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying nothing can silence Loki. You know what? The systems in here have been trying tonight. So real quick recap. First off, I want to say a big welcome to those of you. We talked to a lot of people at GX3 or GamerX that stopped by the table. So if there's any new listeners out there listening to OLR tonight who might have stopped by and said hi to us over at our table, which could include, by the way, I had a conversation with podcasting with Trixie Mattel from RuPaul's Drag Race Season 7. You missed that, Jamie, when Trixie came by the table. But turns out Trixie listens to podcasts on her flights back and forth to different shows. So shout out to Trixie if you're out there listening. Hashtag justice for Trixie or whatever it was. Anyway, so all that aside, we talked to a lot of people there at the expo, drag queens and non-drag queens. Actually, a lot of non-drag queens. And just talked about podcasting and everything that we have on the network with our variety of shows and how we have shows about like Star Trek and World of Warcraft and movies and TVs. And so I hope we got a few listeners from that. So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lawns Radio, welcome. We've been running, oh, golly, nonstop since 2002. We started as an Internet radio program dedicated to dance dance revolution and music based video games and kind of grew from that into all things video gaming because, of course, we were just fans of video games first. It just so happens we were playing at the time a lot of Parappa the Rappa and bust a groove depending on what country you were in. So we were talking about that for a while and then we did games. So we like to be very interactive. We call ourselves a show where every gamer has a voice. And we invite you guys to pull up a chair with us at our dinner table. There's one thing we used to do when we played Dance Dance Revolution is after we played some DDR, we would go to the cafe right across the street and sit down and talk some smack about video games. So that's what we do here. And order fried food because, you know, nothing better than after working out for a while to eat some fried fruits to offset it. We just burned off all those calories playing DDR. Let's have some mozzarella sticks. Let's do it right now. So, yeah, that's we've kind of kept that tradition going now for going into next year. Our 14th year is next year. Every time I say the number, I die a little inside. All right. We're entering high school. We love it. We love you guys. We love doing this. And we're going to do it for a long time. Although the computer tonight really didn't want it to happen. I come into the studio after a two week break. And again, we've been a little bit, admittedly, we've been spotty the past couple months. I can't stand it because I got sick. Then we had Thanksgiving, but I fell, had that fall and I would have been able to show anyway. And then we had GX, which admittedly was an awesome reason to miss the show. I don't apologize for that. But I don't like that we miss so many shows back to back. We like to be here every single week. But tonight, I come in the studio, computer won't power on. I'm like, what the hell? So I figured it must have tripped the breaker at some point. I'd like hold in the power button for a second, finally figured it out, got it working. I'm like, phew. Then it looks like Alan unplugged the internet at some point, which is fine. That happens. Sometimes you got to clean the hall. So the cord's got to go or whatever. And then so finally figured that out. But the cord, it's like one of those things where the cord, we have this super long cord. It's like a hundred foot cord that runs from the computer all the way to the router. Like one of those that I have it at home. It's ethernet through power. You just plug it in. Yeah, that would be cool. And you guys might be thinking, why don't you just use Wi-Fi? Because it's internet radio and we're streaming constantly. We really have to have a wired connection for that. Even if your Comcast is anything like my Comcast, it's fucking sucked. Exactly. Like I'm just like, it's seriously getting worse every day. And I'm not sure how that's possible. So finally figured out the net thing. I just had to bend the cord just right at like the 30 degree angle that'll make it get the signal. Okay, so then finally, you know, I had a moment of weakness and I clicked yes when Skype said, do you want to upgrade Skype? And now it won't work. I try to bring it up and it says, sorry, we can't find the internet while I'm running IRC and Google and everything else in the background. It's like, sorry, can't find the internet. So I'm like, all right, well, there's plenty of websites out there where I can download the old version. So download old version Skype 5.0 and still won't work. So trying to install Skype messed my settings. So I'm going to have to look into that this week. So we have this whole rig set up in studio where I've got my iPhone plugged into our mixing board. So we can hopefully take some calls later in the show. But so we can definitely tonight bring you an interview. I'm very excited. We're going to have a guest on the show tonight. One of the cool things about going to an expo like GX got to talk to a lot of indie developers that were there showing their stuff. And one of the games that we saw actually made that transition from early access to a fully fledged release game on Steam this week. So we're excited. We're going to have Rick on the show tonight from Tipping Goat Games. Love that name. Going to talk to us tonight about Super Slam Dunk Touchdown. And this is a game that kind of takes a lot of 8-bit retro sports games and it's like a giant Katamari ball that rolls them all up. And it's one game that incorporates all these elements. So we're going to have Rick on in about 15 minutes to tell us a little more about how that game works. And I think he's shown this game at some of the Penny Arcade Expos and some other places. So I know some of our listeners are actually well aware of this game that weren't even at GX. So you may not know though that it's actually out now on Steam. If you want to try it out for yourself, you can check that out. Just use that old search box in Steam and you will be happily on your way. Rick will be joining us live and you can ask your questions about the game. In fact, I see SSJ100matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm hyped about this game. And yeah, if you want to ask Rick some questions, we will be fielding questions from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. But first, we need to recap what happened while we were gone. We missed a week of show. So I think we need to do last week's news set to Holik. So while we were gone last week for GX, Minecraft finally launched on the Wii U. But if you were looking forward to that Wii U gamepad support, so you could do inventory management and stuff on Minecraft Wii U, I'm sorry, but you can do off-screen play like you can do in every Wii U game. So there you go. Also, Mercedes-Benz and Nintendo teamed up for a Super Mario Maker costume. And it's actually in the game now and you can actually play us a little race car in Super Mario Maker. And I know there was some more news on Mario Maker this week we'll get into a little bit later. And also, a new patent supposedly serviced for the Nintendo NX last week. A weird controller that actually had a video or an image screen built into the controller. I don't know, it looked a little weird to me, but I guess it's the way they could change the controller and how it looks on the fly. You mean like a touchpad where they can have signed buttons to random slots? That sounds fucking terrible. Yeah, I... It's like, jeez, you know what I really wish I had in my console gaming experience is that wonderful usability of not having buttons on a touchpad or mobile device. I have real problems with this if the buttons are fake. Because it doesn't work well for mobile gaming unless that is the way the game is meant to be controlled is with swiping and dragging. Like for some games it works fine, but when you try to take, like if you were to take Super Mario Brothers and just put it on iPhone or Android, it would be horrible. Sonic is that way on the phone, right? And it stinks. I'm sorry, I love Sonic, but it stinks on mobile devices. Because tangible controls are different than touch button controls. So now, if the whole thing with NX is that the controller is a TV, but it has tangible buttons kind of inside it, like you know what I mean, like the TV is built around those controls, then I think that's kind of weird as hell, but... I think it's stupid. We'll try it. And the reason why I think it's stupid is because my hand is on the controller, I can't see the image under my hand. So I don't... See the point. Depending on the design of the controller, like okay, I think about a controller like the Nintendo 64 controller. That thing was a fat controller, or the original Xbox controller, Jesus. That thing was a fat controller. I don't want to hold a fucking LCD screen in my hand like that, you know. But see, maybe I'm weird, but I like the Wii U gamepad controller. It doesn't bother me the way it bothers everybody else. I like it until I play Minecraft with it, and I fucking hate it. I seriously, like, it made me realize how much I hate that controller. Well anyway, now keep in mind, it's a patent. It doesn't necessarily mean anything. People like to jump to conclusions with this stuff. We won't really know anything until E3 next year, but it's very interesting nonetheless. So those are some of the big stories from the week that we were gone. Anything else we want to talk about with GX? Dark Sakura, how was your GX experience? I mean, I know you did the costume and had your picture taken a lot. You're a Grey Warden from Dragon Age, and very well received. I know they had a contest. Sadly, no trophies for Dark Sakura, but you had some stiff competition, and I think you were just doing it for fun, right? Well, I wanted to win something. Winning's nice. Winning's nice. I had a really good time. I only bonked a few people with my staff. It broke a lot, and I did repairs three nights in a row, it seemed. It's a miracle that we got this. By the way, she had this full-length staff with this intricate skull thing on the top of it, and then a metal... well, it wasn't actually a metal blade, but an illusion of a metal blade at the end. Somehow fit that thing in my car with five people in my little Civic. I think the whole thing ended up being something like six and a half feet long. So definitely another foot and a half taller than me. But we got it to fit in the car, and I carried it around the whole convention and walked in boots that I really should have had better insults for. But it was a really good time. I didn't really want to get back into the costume after dinner to go back to the cosplay dance. I heard there was drama, so I'm kind of glad I didn't go. Drama in the form of... Oh, yeah. I don't want to linger on the negative, but somebody had way too much to drink, and I think it was more than just liquor, that's all I'm going to say, and basically the ambulance was called on him and had to get taken out of the place, and it kind of shut the thing down early. But you know what? For those not involved, it was handled well. The guy got the medical attention he needed. He was fine because he was on the gurney making motions and things, so I know he's fine, but it didn't really ruin the party, if that makes sense. He added it early, but it didn't ruin the spirit or anything, so for what it's worth. Well, at any rate, I would say that I'm not the same type of congoer I used to be, but I had a really good time cosplaying. I really miss it because it's been a while since I've done any kind of serious cosplay. Victoria did a great job with the costume itself, and all the props were mine, but... Did you get to participate or see any panels or get to play games? I didn't go to any panels but our own. Yeah? How'd the Podcast Cross Zone panel go for you? It was really, really cool. It was good that we just kept moving around and got to make some good points and talk with people in the crowd. It was great. I did play fake scrabble in costume against a templar to see who could spell better, as in, haha spell, lol. We've actually got pictures up on Twitter, so I can find them and link them in the chat room. I was really tired, though, at the end of every day. I mean, that kind of goes without saying. Yeah, cons can be really draining. Yeah, but I'm hoping to break the costume back out for a day of sac anime if all goes to plan. Excellent. And other than that, yeah. Great. How's your turn? Yeah, I... Oh, and I played the sports ball game, which is what I'm naming it in my head because the name's kind of long. And I played that goggle game, not the Oculus-type game, with the Samsung headset. I was just about to ask this because they were demoing a game on Oculus, and I apologize so much to these creators because I forget the names of the games in the moment. But there was one on the Oculus, and there was one using the Gear VR. And you played the Gear VR one, right? I did because it can be adjusted to near-sighted. And you know what's funny is that I was actually speaking an email with the creators, and I think I CC'd you on my reply. I don't know if you got it. Yeah, I probably did, but trying to organize stuff for a few weeks out. Well, yeah, but I'm trying... Yeah, I've got the email right here so I can actually get the name. It was... Oh, yeah, it was Bizarre VR. Oh, okay. That was it. I knew it had something to do with Bizarre, but I wanted to make sure. But yeah, it was pretty fun, and there were great people. Her name was Teresa working there, which I would love to have them on the show too. Have her on the show. We'll make it happen. We will. Yeah. But at any rate, those were the big things that I played. I tried a few other things, but those were really my two. I gotta back up though for a minute when you talk about VR, because you have openly talked on the show about that a lot of first-person games will make you very motion sick, and you don't like to play things like Skyrim in first person, because that can really kind of mess with you. And it happens. After playing Fast Racing Neo this week, which I'll talk about later, I can totally see how that happens to people. So I can imagine there might have been some hesitation to get into VR, but how did that go for you, all things considered? I wonder if part of it was because I wasn't wearing my glasses. But I seem to do just fine. After a little while, I got a headache, which is about normal. It got a little queasy, like with some of the turns, but it was really smooth for the most part, and there is a big part of me that's wondering if it's because of my glasses. Interesting. The fact that I was pretty much using unfiltered glasses. I'm going to break down a little science here. Glasses will refract light so that your eyeballs will see it at the right magnificence. Instead of having the focal point be in a place other than where your eyes are set to look at. So in this case, it was actually being projected to me at what was fine for my eyes. And I think that something in that might have made it to where I didn't get as motion sick, because I didn't get the same kind of weird eye strain that I get with monitors and things too. It just wasn't there. I suppose this is a question worth asking. What was the game? What was the experience in there? You basically float around on a flying carpet, and you look around for missing things in each level. And you can find coins. Oh, so when you say Bazaar, it's like Aladdin's... B-A-Z-A-A-R. Not like Bazaar, Love Triangle, which is what came to my mind. Bazaar, not Bizzar. Does it play New Order? No, but the music's really good in it. I liked it. She was talking about the composer. Oh, cool. But yeah, the music was really good. Basically, you go through these different floating levels. Well, you're on the carpet, but you're over a canal. And then you have to look for the different pieces. And it's funny, if you look up, you can see the sky. And you've got constellations that match the different things that you're looking for. So you get all the pieces for that, and then you unlock the next level. And you've got a shop that you can pick up extra Turkish Delight and other things. I'm wondering if there's going to be more stuff added, like enemies and things, as you go. Well, I'm sure a lot of these games were in early development. But it was very pink. But it was a pretty good game. It was a pretty good game. I was very pleased with it. I had a lot of fun playing it. I probably could have kept going, if not for a little bit of a headache. Just the one thing that actually really helped me stay centered is keeping my hand on the table. Because my feet were rooted, right? But keeping my hand on the table kind of connected me back. Yeah, it kind of didn't let you go all in. It kept you grounded, literally, like a lightning rod or something. I would say more that it kept me oriented. Okay. So that I knew which way I was facing. And if I couldn't find the table with my hand, I knew that I was facing away from the table. Because it would have been behind me. Okay. So it really was like my anchor, in this case, kept me focused on where my directions were and where I was facing. So that I knew at any given point that if I had to take that thing off and run, for example, I know I'd be going in the right direction. I'd know which way to turn. Which is, it's actually always been a thing for me, is always knowing where my exit routes are. So Jamie survived her first Gear VR experience and didn't get sick or anything. Didn't have a panic attack. Had some ideas on how to make that experience work for you. That's great. It was a cute game and I really had a good time. I'd like to see, actually, Dan and I were talking about this today, where we were talking about how they have those VR sets and would love to see something like that for iOS. Having something like that would definitely open doors for more gamers. And honestly enough, I could see things like that really working well with Google Maps, for example, how you have that walk view. Imagine having virtual tours and whatnot. Or say people, here's a business idea. Virtual house tours if you're buying a model home. Yeah. And if you say, oh, well, I like this, but I want a counter here. Or you look at the thing and navigate the menu. You know how people will move to a city they haven't even been to yet because of a job or something? And they have to like get an apartment kind of like unseen? Like a VR experience could really bring that to you. I mean, it's interesting that we're having this conversation because, you know, you go back a few months ago to one of the big stories with VR that Facebook bought Oculus, right? And people are like, why does Facebook want to get into gaming? And it's like, yo, there's way more to Oculus than just gaming. And there's a great example, although I feel like I should patent pending. That's my business because I could make some money on that. There's also people who, well, like for me being nearsighted, that's one thing. I could take off my glasses and see just fine in the game. And if you have people with, say, who have to have like things magnified for them, you have that adjustable thing on the goggle. And, you know, it can help people who may have difficulty seeing in general or, you know, something that can change brightness and everything for people with dim vision, stuff like that, improve contrast. You know, it could be possible that you even have like another camera on the other side. I mean, there's all kinds of ideas for application of things like that. But for the most part, you know, despite, you know, we could speculate all night about, you know, what type of things we could see come out of that type of technology. But in the end, I mean, I have no problem with games. We can do some games too over there. S21 Hunter Matt noting in the chat over at live.vognetwork.com, all three OLR hosts have dove into the Rift now. Yes, that is, well, technically you didn't do the Rift. I didn't do the Rift because I couldn't wear my glasses with the Oculus Rift. But, you know, we've all had the VR headset experience, modern. Is there something else that occurred to me? Do you remember E3 a while back where they had the sphere that you touch it and it gives you like almost topographical feedback where it would develop texture? Yes. Could you imagine something like that with the Oculus? You know, that was a rumor for, believe it or not, that's been a rumor for Nintendo's DS at one point that it would have something like that. And it was a rumor for iPhones at one point. And I think iPhones did the reverse of that with the force push that they have in the, I'm talking like it's Star Wars, but you know what I mean? Like the force feedback thing they have in the new iPhones. 3D touch. Yeah, that's it. 3D touch. However, it has done kind of the reverse in the form of the haptic feedback on the Apple Watch. Ah, gotcha. Basically it's, for me, my haptic feedback is, you got a text message and turn bitch for my directions. Or get off your ass and stand up. Loki, were you trying to add something here a minute ago to the VR discussion? I'm sorry. No. I thought I saw you pick up your mic. All right. Well, he could have picked up his mic because he wanted to. Ah, maybe. Who knows? Quickly, quickly before we get to our guests tonight, I know there was some other stuff in the exhibit hall too, a lot of crafters that kind of make their own things. Yeah, I was hanging out with the artists like the entire time. It was great. Yeah, some really talented people in there. Made some good friends there. Um, actually did like a little fake, uh, menorah lighting with one of them. It was great. And you know, and basically I watched her booth so she could get a beer. They were giving the beers out. Because yeah, they gave us beer and it was great. Um, thank you Intel for beer. Um, I actually hung out with a few people from Intel just talking chop for a while. They had a really interesting booth where they had walls where you could basically write down and it was these questions like, what do you want to see in gaming in a few years? And what do you, you know, these very, especially considering the audience that GX targets, which is this very diverse audience that sometimes feels like in that Xbox Live culture where a lot of nasty things are flinged around that maybe they don't fit in. It was very interesting to see kind of a lot of what was written on the wall. I thought that was a very neat idea. But I will say this, I don't know how you feel about this dark soccer, but I would say, and I just want to say footnote, I don't want this to read as like a huge negative or anything because I love gamer X. I love GX. I financially supported this expo in a big way this year. But I found that in the expo hall, I was a little taken aback by how you had some big exhibitors there that didn't really bring games. Like you have Blizzard, you have Blizzard that was there with Jobs or whatever. Intel had their walls, but that was cool. And they gave away cookies. So I'm not going to, but the rock band area was fun. The rock band did it right. But I thought it was so weird that Blizzard had this big presence and it was like, they were, they had a job seeker there and it was like, no, no Overwatch, no World of Warcraft. I actually did talk with the ladies there for a while. And they were both, yeah, like, yeah, the whole company's buckling down for stuff right now. Yeah. And Overwatch has been down for maintenance too. So maybe that, that came into play too. But I just, I was kind of surprised, especially coming off of last year where you had Gearbox was there showing Borderlands, the pre-sequel or whatever it was. That was the first time that was playable was at the last GX. Not that I'm saying I expect cutting edge stuff out of the expo. I was just surprised that the expo hall itself only had the indie games, which is great because I found a lot of good stuff there. But it didn't have any corporate games considering all that corporate support that went into it. I'm just, I was a little surprised by that compared to last year. But again, I don't want that to read like a negative because I do think the con is doing some good things. And I kind of think everybody involved realizes that. I don't think I'm the first person to say that. And so I kind of think that's already on their radar for what can we do next year to put, put the bigger game in GamerX. The only reason I wish we'd been able to stay for the closing ceremonies and feedback was to please beg for the cosplay contest to go back to the Saturday night instead of Sunday. I have a feeling the only reason it was on Sunday was because the talent that hosted it. That was the day they were in town. I have a weird feeling. But then again, they were there Saturday night because they came by the table Saturday night. So I don't know. And that's just a lot of, especially since like us, we checked out of our hotel. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And when you are dealing with that much crap, you know, props and your costume and needing help because Alan had to help me change into parts of my costume. You need to have access to your hotel room for that kind of stuff. So. But other than that, I mean, everything was really smooth. The cosplay contest in general was run a lot more smoothly than it was last year. Yeah. And I thought, I did, I did want to say the space, you know, it was a big transition for them to go from San Francisco to San Jose. I love the new space. It worked so much. It worked so much better. So much more room to move around. The convention center was great. It felt more con like. Yes. Than. Although I kind of felt like they probably could have sold more tickets. I mean, from what I heard, it was close to a sellout, but it didn't look like, I kind of feel like they could have packed more people in there if they wanted to. I think it'll get bigger. I don't know if it's going to be Fauna Mae big for a while, but. No, no, I know. It's going to get bigger. Yeah. And again, there were so many great things come out of it. So much networking that I did. Like, I'm not, I had a great time and just the festivities. I just made a lot of friends. Yeah. Yeah. It was just hanging with cool people. Yeah. One of the cool people we met at the convention, uh, down had the booth, like right near us. And we were looking at that game going, what is that? That looks kind of like, is that dodge ball? What is that? That guy's playing over there. And, uh, turns out, uh, it's a game called super slam dunk touchdown. And it's like a bunch of eight bit sports games all rolled into one. And, uh, we played roller derby character is the best. We played it. We had a lot of fun with it. And I was like, Oh, we got to get you on the show. When, when does it come out? And he said this week I was like, Oh, well shoot. So we're going to get them on the line right now. We're going to, uh, give Rick a call and Rick is with tipping goat games. And he's going to talk to us tonight about this game, super slam dunk touchdown. And I think we have them on the line. Rick, are you there? Yes. Hello. Thanks for having me. Hey, no problem, Rick. Thanks so much for being here. My pleasure. How was, uh, how was GX for you? Did you have a good time at the show? I had a great time. It was, uh, I've done a lot of expos and so they've ranged from nightmarish to, uh, just a pleasant time. And that was on the positive end of the spectrum. So I'm positive, uh, about that show. It was a good show. Now. I didn't realize this about you when we were playing the game and, and there at the expo, but that GX was kind of in your backyard. It was local to you, right? So that, that must've made it very convenient. Oh yeah. It was super easy. Just parked, carried my stuff in. I was done. I know that was, that was the great thing about us having a table that didn't involve computers or any of that stuff, because it's like we could just kind of carry it all in one setting. It was great. Um, so tell us a little bit about a super slam dunk touchdown for those of our listeners out there who weren't at GX, which is unfortunately most people. Uh, tell us a little bit about the game and what it looks like and what it's like. Uh, sure. It's a local multiplayer irreverent all sports mashup. Uh, so as you mentioned 8-bit, uh, games, it's sort of inspired by 8 and 16-bit era games that didn't take themselves terribly seriously, the sports games of that era. Uh, so you mentioned Super Dodge Ball, which is a, a lot of people make that comparison as well. Um, so it looks, it looks retro. It's, it's got 8, 16-bit sort of graphics, but it's actually driven by 3D physics. So there's kind of nuance to how the balls move and everything. Hmm. How did you, uh, how did you get inspired to do a game like this? Where did it, where did it come from when you, when you put pen to paper and said, this is the game I want to make? This game has been burning a hole in my brain for about, about six years now. I finally have been able to release it, but, uh, yeah, about six years ago, I was like, I really want to make an all sports crazy mashup game. And it probably comes from just growing up in an era of local multiplayer. That was the only kind of multiplayer back then. And, uh, I, I feel like social gaming to me is people hanging out together playing a game. And, uh, so I wanted to make something like that. Uh, and, uh, again, if you want to ask Rick a question about Super Slam Dunk Touchdown, you can over at live.vognetwork.com in our chat room over there. Um, so I noticed, uh, you talking a lot about local multiplayer and, uh, I noticed when you came to the show, you brought like four separate controllers. You had everything. You were really stressing that this is, this is a party game, right? So if I were to ask about, well, what about online? What, what, what's your thoughts on that? I mean, online, just not in the cards free? That's not what you want this to be? Well, first off, there was six controllers. We do up to six players locally on Windows. Oh, my bad. My bad. I forgot how to count. Well, if I wanted to take maybe, I don't know, three to six months and really try to make it online, I probably could do that. But that's not really the heart and soul of what this game is about. And, uh, it's really about yelling at your teammates and, uh, you know, having a good time together. So I think having people in front of the TV is a better experience for this title. Um, that said, if I had, you know, unlimited funding, I'd love to pay somebody to add an online component, but we're a very, very small studio, uh, with a total employee count of one. I was about to say, is it just you that's doing all this? Uh, well, I contract out the art, uh, as money comes in, but yeah, it's just me. Got it. Wow. That's still very impressive for such a small studio of one basically to have created something like this. So props to you. This must be, how are you feeling this week with the big release and the whole kind of making that transition from early access to a full release? How are you feeling? I have to, I'll be honest. I kind of feel like a college senior, just sort of sliding the paper under the door at 11 59. You know, I just, just get it out there. I'm going to go lay down. It's been, it's been a long, long year and a half since I've been working on this and I'm looking forward to the break. What are some of the reactions you see when you see people playing your game at expos? Because again, you are bringing this full, you, you, you bring this game to cons the way it's meant to be played. And so you're able to get, you know, sometimes, sometimes I can't get five people over to my house to play a video game. I mean, if I have, you know, liquor maybe, but at a con, it's very easy to get that together. So you must see all sorts of, of great reactions. What do you, what do you, what do you kind of see from the people to play your game at cons? Well, there's several stages. First, it's like confusion because they're not sure what it is they're looking at. And then their brain tries to tell them what they're looking at, but they still don't really believe it. So they have to come over and then they see what it is and that it's real and then they want to play. And then they find out it's six players and you know, there's a critical mass problem at these conventions. If I get one or two people playing, it's pretty easy to get six, but if it's empty, it's a little harder. What, now for those that don't know, what is the object of the game? Because they, you might look at it and you see, okay, I've got this soccer goal and it's got a basketball hoop on it. And then there's like that, that touchdown tee. What, what, what is the object? Yeah, goal pose. Just in plain, simple terms, you're taking your sports players, a whole team of sports players, and you're trying to maneuver the ball or puck or whatever it is through one of the goal areas, which could be a lower net, it could be a basketball style hoop, or it could be the uprights, the football, American football style field goal pose. So there's different ways to score and then all the different players are kind of playing their own way. So baseball players hitting pop flies, the hockey players hitting slap shots, the soccer players kicking, the American football players tossing spirals. And so you mix all that together and it becomes a crazy 3D physics team based sports game. Now, I noticed that it wasn't really just the sports players and the sports balls themselves that were all coming together. But as I was playing, I was playing the game earlier today to, you know, prepare for this. And I noticed that there was a lot of just other, for lack of a better term, crazy shit that would happen while you're playing the game. Like the marching band would just start running right through the middle of the game doing their thing. And then I think my derby girl got three shots in a row. So of course, as what happens in hockey when you get three shots in a row, hats start flying all over the arena. And just all this crazy stuff starts happening. Where did you come up with all these ideas and what made you think like, oh, I just want to get it crazier with all this stuff? Well, it's just things that pop up in your brain when you think sports. And, you know, these are things. Hat trick, that's a thing. You know, if you ask somebody who doesn't know anything about sports, they'll just name some terms. And so it's sort of just, you know, the marching band shows up. Doesn't show up in the middle of the match, but it's more fun that way. So it's kind of just putting as much sports in as small a tight a space as we can and just seeing what happens. Now, am I crazy? Or did I see a streaker? Because I swear to God, the other team all of a sudden had a player running around the back of the goalpost who was just naked. Like, is that thing? That's a thing. We just released an update. He used to kind of just drop from the ceiling, but now he's hiding in the crowd. So if you look in the crowd as you're playing and you see a shady guy with the trench coat on, watch out because he might jump into the arena and try to steal the ball. That cracked me up because, I mean, the art is done so tastefully that you're not going to see anything that's going to make this game get an AO rating, right? Fortunately, we're dealing with subpixels there. Yeah, exactly, right. So you can't really see anything, but it's just kind of like, because I kind of did a double take. I'm like, first off, who is that guy? And second off, does he have no clothes on? What is he doing? But I didn't even realize that he had jumped in from the crowd just because there's so much other stuff going on. Oh, that's new. That's new. So I'm posting updates. We've done our first post-release update. There's going to be a season mode expansion next year, so I'm continuously trying to improve the game and making it better for a hopeful, eventual console release. Oh, nice. What consoles are you looking at? I'm under tight lips right now. I can't say much. All right, fair enough. You come back when you can tell us. So what else was I going to say? There are some modes in the game. There's what? There's two modes in the game now? There's the challenge mode and kind of the quick play mode, right? Yep, you can also battle the ending credits if you want to do that. I somehow missed that. You can battle the credits? Yes, and there's a shot practice mode too, which I encourage everybody to try that just to get the feel for the game before the AI starts beating you up. But yeah, you battle the credits. Do you remember Altered Beast on the Sega Genesis did that? You beat the game and then the credits would come down and they'd start knocking you out. So that sort of stuck with me and I was like, let's get our revenge. Let's beat up the credits. So the credits is made of balls and you can throw them at each other. That kind of happens in Super Smash Brothers as well with the credit roll, but it's a little different, but I love that. And yeah, DarkTetsuya making that same comparison in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com. Going to some other questions from our chat room over at live.vognetware.com, SSJ100Matt says, So I see a lot of sources of inspiration in the game like Blades of Steel, Double Dribble, Tecmo Super Bowl, Super Dodge Ball, Nintendo World Cup, Hit the Ice, NHL 94, NBA Jam. Am I missing anything? Oh sure, yeah. You've got Speedball was one. Is NES Ice Hockey in that list? Nope, NES Ice Hockey was not in the list. There was one, Pigskin, I forget the year, it was like 320 AD or something like that, but it was like a medieval Pigskin game where you have pits that you can fall in and a bunch of guys beating each other up. So that whole era, I guess they couldn't do a realistic sports game very well, so they said, oh well, let's just make it fun. And that's kind of what this game's about. I probably told you this when I was playing the game for the first time, I'm not really a sports ball kind of guy. I enjoy going to a hockey game and occasionally a basketball game, but I'm horrible at playing the real thing and I don't get as into it as a lot of other people my age do. So when games were NBA Jam or Tecmo Bowl, when it was very arcade-y in the element of it, that's when I loved sports games the most. And I'm assuming you must find the same thing to be similar or true as well to have been inspired to make a game like this, right? Absolutely. Yeah, those games were fun. Anyone can pick them up, so this game has three buttons and an analog stick, so anybody can pick this up. There's a lot to learn, there's a lot you can learn about the different players and everything, but at its heart it's a very accessible experience, which I think it should be. And you and I were having a conversation about how newer sports games like the Madden's of the world and so forth are oftentimes, I think you called them simulations, and I thought that was a really good kind of comparison. Does this game get anything from newer sports titles? I'll be honest, the newest sports title that I'm able to play would be some iteration of Virtuit Tennis, which is kind of similar. You had analog stick and a few buttons. I tried to play a modern soccer game that there was a demo for on PlayStation, and you literally had to juggle the ball with the stick. You couldn't just move the guy, you had to actually try to keep the ball from getting away from you, and I'm like, this is way too much. You know what I'll tell you is one of the best sports games to come out in years and years besides, of course, Super Slam Dunk Touchdown. I'll tell you, it's Rocket League. Oh yes, yes. I have not had a chance to play that, I'm afraid it's going to suck me in. Yeah, I wouldn't doubt you're going to play it and then all of a sudden a car is going to show up in Super Slam Dunk Touchdown somewhere, I'll tell you. But that's kind of the same thing where it's like a sports game. Well, it's not really a sport, but it kind of is. It's just fun and silly and easily accessible. Because everybody knows how to drive a video game car. It's accelerate and brake. Very, very easy. Brake? Yeah, who uses the brake? Who uses that? That's what the walls are for. Let's see, Tigerclaw says, a sports game with very simple controls that doesn't require you to do complicated button combinations would be more fun to play. And I noticed that is kind of part of your game, right? It's like two or three buttons tops, right? Yeah, one of them's passed, so you're hardly using that unless your teammate has the ball or you want to send it over there. There's a shoot button, that's the main button. And then there's a turbo boost, so that's pretty much like NBA Jam in terms of number of buttons. And then I noticed that, I guess the shoot button would also double as the fight button. And if you can get enough people in the fight, it'll turn into this cartoon cloud that starts flying all over the arena, right? Yeah, and that was actually a product of user feedback. So I used to do playtest parties early on to get local multiplayer feedback, and the chaos of the game was a little too much for people. So that rowdy cloud, as I call it, sucks people in. If they're getting too violent, let's put them in one place and they can mash their buttons and let the guy who's not in that fight try to shoot and win the game. I've noticed that your game has gone through some changes with graphics, too, because I saw some screenshots and I think some material you've done for PAX, and the slam dunk sequence looked very different than it does now. Before it was kind of, I don't want to say it was plain, but it was a little plainer. But now it looks like you got the full audience. It looks like that double dribble thing we all remember from when we were kids, which had to be an influence, I'm sure, right? Yeah, I definitely wanted to do that, but I wanted to make it interactive. And the old art, which has been kind of the bane of my existence this year, has been slowly getting replaced. And the art that you might be referring to, the early art, I actually drew that over Christmas right after my artist decided to pursue other projects. So that has been programmer art that has been in the game for a long time, and I'm so happy to have replaced that with the really nice looking, as you said, inspired by double dribble dunk sequences. How many changes did your game go through in development? It went through a lot of evolutions. If you go back and look at the very early videos, you can tell it's just a super primitive version of what it is now. The main things were with player feedback and just letting people know what was going on. So there's an aiming cursor, you can tell which direction you're pointing while you're aiming, which is helpful. There's a pass cursor that shows up when you're being passed to, so little things like that that just kind of clue people in. The player selection screen went through about three or four different durations to get where it is now. Now, this game was on early access for a little while. How long were you on early access until the release this week? It was about three months, I think. And did you get feedback through that process as well? How did that work? That was great, because it was pulling teeth sometimes after my same friends had played the game, and they were like, okay, let's play a different game. We've been playing this all summer. But when it goes into early access, suddenly all these people are playing and they're on the Steam forums, and it's like, okay, cool. Now I've got feedback from fresh players, they're seeing it with fresh eyes, I'm getting good reactions, honest reactions. And you kind of have to, as a developer, take everything everybody says very seriously. Because if there's a problem, if they're not playing the game what you think is correctly, then you're not communicating it correctly to them. So it's been very useful. So thanks to everybody on the Steam forums, and please do jump on there if you've got any feedback. I bet a lot of us sometimes take that for granted, especially if we're developing. And not that everybody listening to this show necessarily develops full-on games, but something like Super Mario Maker I think has really opened it up so that some people can kind of experience what that process is like a little bit. And I know I'm fascinated when I watch people play a level that I made in Mario Maker on YouTube or Twitch or something. And it's like, that is not how I intended people to get past that part of the game. Or that is not how you're supposed to do that part, but they did it. And that's got to be even exponentially the case when you're making a full-fledged game as opposed to a level in Mario. Well that's the joy of it, because you see things for the first time because somebody will be playing it in a way that you've never played it before. And sometimes that leads to bugs, but other times it leads to just really hilarious stuff. One of the things that happened during a convention, there was a fight and the ball got knocked just because of the 3D physics so high that it went off the screen for like a good 3 or 4 seconds. And I thought, okay, that's interesting, that's new. So I actually put a ceiling on the game now, and if it goes up that high you can actually knock a light loose, it'll fall down and land on the field. So it's just by observing how people play the game we can add to it and make it more fun. Awesome. Let me get to one more question here from our chat room. S2100Matt asking, you were able to get this done in a year and a half, which is an impressive feat considering how polished the game looks. How much of your time was taken up with development versus work versus real life stuff? Did you even sleep? I did sleep, but that's about all I did. I actually quit my job in May of 2014 to work on this game and have been working non-stop ever since then. And I mentioned the crisis over Christmas last year, that basically, that crisis didn't stop until launch. So it's been a lot of work, it's been a lot of fun, it's been up and down in all directions. Well congratulations on the launch of the game. And again, radio can only go so far as to what this game really looks like. I do encourage you guys to go check it out. On the Steam store, super slam dunk touchdown. Rick, any other websites or social media for our listeners to see more about this game? Sure, you can check out our Facebook page, you can follow me on Twitter, Tipping Goat. And we also have a webpage at tippinggoat.com. I'm also very active on the Steam forums and there is a subreddit at SSDTouchdown. So whatever your network of choice. Very cool. And I'm hoping to get a YouTube done of some play this week. I wanted to do that today and then all the computer stuff started happening here in studio. So I'm going to try to get that on my YouTube channel a little later this week, so that'll be something as well. And yeah, I do definitely encourage people to at least give the game a look and I think it's going to kind of get you right in that feel. Where Blades of Steel and Double Dribble and NBA Jam and those games back when sports games were arcadey and fun. I think it's going to get you in that same spot. So congrats to you, Rick. Thank you. Alright, best of luck with the game and thanks for being on OLR tonight. Thanks for having me. Alright, take care. Bye bye. You too. Alright, that was Rick with Tipping Goat Games and the game there Super Slam Dunk Touchdown. Dark Soccer, I know you got to play that as well at the Con and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. I had a good time. Yeah. I had a really good time. Although, I don't know why I just kept blanking on the name over and over, but it's still funny. Well, it is kind of all these different sports terms all together. The goal is to sport harder than the other people. I think it seems like it can be set up kind of very similar to iDarb where they have... Maybe even if he doesn't do internet play over the internet, like multiplayer, he can do maybe some sort of Twitch support or something like that. With all the iDarb crap where he can put keywords in and silly shit happens. Oh yeah, maybe some of that audience stuff, like the streakers and all that stuff. That might be kind of fun. Like maybe some of that stuff. Throw some power ups, like t-shirt cannons or something like that. That would be pretty awesome. Or maybe, and I don't know how difficult this is, I mean we spout them off like they're no problem at all, but we have to remember he's only a team of one. And I forgot to ask him about this, but there's some really silly advertisements that you see in the background. Try Food. Yeah, Try Food was one of them. And I was like, I think I will try eating at some point. There's just some silly stuff there. I should do that. Yeah, I should try food someday. I might be good. Alright, well again, best of luck to him. It was a lot of fun to play and I hope he's able to get the money back for the time invested and he can look at making whatever game he wants to do next. Maybe some more retro inspired stuff there. So again, that's super slam dunk touchdown. Look at that, Dungeon Buster in chat giving a link there to our listeners if they want to check that out on the Steam store. I believe it's $14.99. That's how much that is. Alright, we're going to get into news and talk about what else has been going on in the video game world this week. But I do want to take a chance to go around and ask what types of video games have you been playing this week? We always like to talk about how was your gaming week. So outside of the con, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week? It was very TurboGrafx oriented with some Adventure Island, Monster Boy, Bonk. We had Bonk. We had Magical Chase. A lot of Magical Chase. Some Proteus Da. Twinbee. I didn't play any Dragon Age. And I played some Animal Crossing, the Happy Cam Designer. That was for the most part quite the retro-tastic week. What brought that on? Getting our Turbo EverDrive. That works. Alright. I have a feeling that will come back to us a little later when we get into the classic game of the week. We'll see. Meanwhile, let's go over to Loki. How was your gaming week? Well, I played quite a bit actually. I played lots of Fallout 4. So I'm like, gosh. I don't even know how many hours into the game. I think it's counting in days now. So I'm at least two days in. I'd say maybe 60 hours or so. I don't remember yet. So I'm pretty far. Still really enjoying that. It's kind of fun just to wander around. I'm enjoying it like Skyrim. And cheating in it like Skyrim. Exploiting every possible console glitch hack I could possibly do and I'm enjoying that while I can. I do want to play through it again. Actually, once I'm done with this one. Someone came up with the idea of doing a faction-less one. So instead of joining one of the factions you just fucking kill everybody and be an asshole to everybody. I'm like, yes! I will do that. That is what I want to do next time. So that's what I'm going to do. Just Cause 3. Tried playing that a little bit. But it's a fucking mess. And it's really disappointing because I really want to play that game. But I cannot handle trying to play one of the challenges to unlock stuff in the game and having a three minute load time in between every time I retry that. Fuck that. I am not playing that game until that's fixed. I also played Minecraft on the Wii U. Cause my son wanted Minecraft on the Wii U cause he wanted to play on the screen. And so I did that and I downloaded it and played with the controller. I fucking hate the Wii U controller with that game. The button placement stuff is very awkward. I don't like how the buttons are below the analog stick. PlayStation and Xbox controls work a lot better for me. But that is just frustrating. I don't even want to play it. And the text is so small on that screen. You would think like, hmm, we have this on the second screen. Maybe we should make the menus and UI fucking readable. Nope. Let's make it fucking, just shrink it down. Make it super microscopic so you can't fucking read anything. I'm really disappointed at what a lazy port cash in Minecraft Wii U is. I mean, for all the potential that's there with the touch screen. I just, I really feel like this is a whole, well, it's either A, well, we gotta shut the Nintendo fans up. Or B, well, we gotta make money from the Nintendo fans by just, you know, copy pasting. You know, I really wish they had done more with what the Wii U was intended for. I mean, shit, they're making tons of money from me. I bought it on pretty much every console, so I don't know why. But, yeah, my son wants to play it. He enjoys it. That's fine. But I find the controls frustrating and I'll play it on any other system. I just don't want to play it on that one. Especially since it's missing features that are on the other systems. No, no thanks. But I bought it, so I guess you win. And then I bought Earth Defense Force 4.1. I wasn't gonna technically buy that, but Eric wanted to play and then he bailed out. So I spent the money on it for no reason, but I did. But it's fine. I'm sure we'll hook up another day. But I played through it a little bit and it's really hard. I tried like, well, I'm gonna bump it up with a hard one. And it's like, this is really frustrating. And it's frustrating in the fact that they've changed how some of the ants and stuff attack you, so now they can shake you around and you're supposed to be able to shoot them while they're doing that. And it's fucking annoying. It's just like, I don't know. It's kind of cheap, I guess, in that sense. But, whatever. That's the type of game it is. It's supposed to be frustratingly hard. And, yeah. So, I'll probably play more of that after I get done with Fallout. Because I was like, I can play more of the Earth Defense Force, or I can play more Fallout. Someone play more Fallout. And then, of course, I played tons of Ingress. I drove up the fucking Placerville and, like, rescue today to make a field from there to Auburn for no fucking reason. Other than, I was like, oh, maybe I'll get some more points. Uniques. You got uniques. I had, like, two. Because I didn't really actually, you know, hack anything because I was under, like, a time constraint. I need to get your schedule so we can go out some time together. Because you can do so much more in that game when you even have just one other person. You can do better stuff. But, like, my schedule's gonna change after the first of the year, so then I'm not gonna have the weekdays anymore. Because they used to have Thursdays to play. And now, nope. That's not gonna happen. So, I may have, no, I'm not gonna, depends on what my schedule is, you know, where I'm trying to shift, trade shifts, and I may not have any time in the morning anymore. Oh, boy. Alright. It'll be, like, weekends, maybe. Or if I take a day off. I don't know. Well, real life is more important than silly portal bandits, so it's fine. Yeah, I'm probably not gonna do any more of the fielding stuff. I just, like, a few weeks ago I went to Auburn, because I was meant to, like, field that day. And then, like, I drove, like, two hours round trip to do that. And by the time I got back here to actually link it up, someone had fucking, on our own side, had fucking thrown some blocking links. I'm like, are you fucking serious? But they didn't know. They didn't know. Well, no, they, it's because I couldn't text them, because I'm driving on a fucking road that's twisty as fuck, and, like, in the rain, with no cell coverage. Like, well, he didn't say anything. I'm like, yeah, because I'm fucking driving. I can't text on the phone while I'm driving to tell you, with no cell signal. So, whatever, it's fine. I wasn't mad, and it was just, like, it's just something that happens. More like your luck. It's like, yeah, my luck. I wasted all this time. You know, drove all the way back here. It's like, oh, fuck, I can't do anything. Well, that was that, so. Alright. I can't wait. You guys, I really feel like, because of this Ingress thing, I feel like Loki is gonna play Pokemon Go. I'll try. So, anyways, I've been doing Christmas shopping, so I have your gifts. Oh, my gosh. So, you guys can choose or fight over which one, and I don't know if you have these yet, so I can never know, because you buy all these figures and stuff. Oh, my God. Anyways, so I got both the Sam Flynn and the Korra Disney Infinity figures. I didn't know, they look pretty awesome, and I've been buying Disney Infinity stuff, because I'm buying my son the game, Disney Infinity 2.0. So, you guys can decide which one you want. Wow, that's awesome. I'm fine, whichever one you want to take. I think I'd really like Korra. You want Korra? That's fine. I'll take Flynn. Thank you. Hey, thank you, Loki. I'm gonna take that out of the box. I was looking at Amiibos, and I'm like, does he have that one? Yes, I have them all. It's sick. You know what, though, guys? I don't know if I should talk about this on air. I might get in trouble, but we'll see. Shane told me he's gonna stop collecting Amiibo. I think he finally got broken, like the Amiibo thing kind of broke him. Because I ordered the Shovel Knight Amiibo on Best Buy this week, and I was like, Shane, you didn't tell me that it was up for sale. I heard about it from somebody else. And I was like, are you gonna go get it? He's not feeling the Amiibo thing anymore, and I'm like, are you okay, buddy? I bought a disturbing amount of Disney Infinity figures this week. But they were on clearance. They were on clearance, yes. And they're used. So I bought the game, which was on clearance, because it's last year's game. And then I bought the figures, because they're on sale this week. And even, like, I bought an Olaf for my other son, and that's Disney 3.0. You can't actually use it in the game, but I'm gonna download 3.0 so that they play. But the other figures were, like, five bucks new, or they had, you know, GameStop had, like, buy two used and get three free. I'm like, I cleared out, like, their whole section. They're hard to get anymore. So I'm like, well, fuck, if I'm gonna buy this, I'm gonna buy the characters while I can still get them. And fucking trying to find that Spider-Man set, just forget it. It's impossible to find. After, like, a year. Alright, looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, I think that lit up the chatroom more than anything else. Me saying the Shane is out of the Amiibo thing. Act F saying, what? It's 2100, Matt. I don't believe it. The what meme saying, did Shane finally accept a job for Sony PR? That, that, that I would believe for everything else. And SJ100Matt says, are you sure he was tired, wasn't tired and just needed a nap? That could also be true. I don't know. Okay, so my gaming week. I actually, I played a whole lot this past week. Not just on Steam, obviously I played some Super Slam Dunk Touchdown. I played another game, and I want to have these guys on the show when their game is a little closer to full release. The game is called Black Ice, and it was kind of like Tron meets Diablo. And I was like, I am into both of those things. Tell me more about your game. And I liked that one a lot, so I was playing that on Steam. And actually, you know who's been playing that even more than me is Alan. Alan's really into that, so we'll talk about that game a little later on. I'm hoping to have them on the show. But then I got home and I played some other stuff. I want to talk quickly about a game I talked about two weeks ago. Two weeks ago on the show I talked about Xenoblade Chronicles X. And although I don't think I was too negative on the game, I did give some feedback that was a little bit like, this really bothers me. And I did spend some more time with the game to see if I could get over some of that stuff. And for the most part, yeah, I think I did get over a little bit of a hump that I think kind of happens in the story, kind of between Chapter 3 and 4. And I was able to progress a little more in the story, and I feel a little better about where I'm headed in the game now. It still doesn't completely change the fact that I do think there's a big disconnect between the manual is there, so you have to read the manual on the Wii U gamepad. But the game has some tutorials in it, but if you're not able to read the manual as well... I don't know, there's some kind of disconnect there in how the game really paces itself in the beginning. And that still kind of bothers me and I think will turn some people off. But if you can stick with it and get over that hurdle, I mean, the game is really good looking, there's a lot of great music in the game. The battle system is fun, even if people never shut up, they keep yelling at each other, but I kind of like that ambience. It's a little different than other RPG games I played. So I am enjoying myself with Xenoblade Chronicles X, and I thought that was an important little follow-up point. So even though I do think the game has its flaws, and I know there's going to be Nintendo defenders and Xenoblade defenders that are going to say I'm wrong, and that's fine. But I really do think that there's some roadblocks in that game that prevent it from being a great game. Because at the end of the day, I still think a lot of the voice acting and the scripting is very... It's a little generic, a little blah. I hear the story gets better and better, but I'm not going to be totally convinced. I don't think that it was written for a reading game and it's being acted and not very well. But outside of that, I mean, what RPG games on the Wii U are there? There's not a lot, a lot, a lot of games. There's a few, but not a lot. And Xenoblade is really good, and if you are a Wii U owner, I think it is worth having if you're into JRPGs at all. Just be warned, you got to read through that manual, and you might hit these parts where you're like, am I even on the right fucking path? If you feel like that, just try something else and you'll get there. Also on the Wii U this week, I played a game that was released on the eShop that I'm kind of surprised I didn't play sooner, the day it came out, but it's called Fast Racing Neo. And this is the game that a lot of people are saying, well, this is what happens when Nintendo doesn't put out F-Zero, is that the indie studio made their own version of F-Zero. And so I checked out the game, and I got to say, it's pretty sweet. It's more Wipeout than F-Zero to me. Yeah, that's what it looked like to me, more Wipeout. But that's not a bad thing at all. It's fast, and it's racing. So in fact, it's so fast that when I was playing, and it's really smooth, like it does run at that 60 frames a second, I did notice when I was going really fast on some complex tracks that the track kind of popped in in the distance. You kind of see the pop in. But that was extremely infrequent, all things considered. But I think that's how they made it happen at 60 frames a second. But I got to say, it was so fast and so smooth that even I was getting a little bit of that, whoa, I got to stop. I'm almost getting a little queasy playing this on my big TV. It's almost a bit much. But they kind of put an interesting twist on the formula where there's almost like an Ikaruga thing where you have to flip the color of your engine to match the color of the boosters if you want to boost. There's orange boost and blue boost, and you have to flip the colors back and forth to match the boost in order to actually go faster. And I thought that kind of put a neat little spin on it. So I think the music's good. I think the tracks are pretty varied for an indie game, and at least the beginning ones I've played are pretty well designed. However, it's pretty difficult. It's not exactly like the first time I played. The lowest difficulty is not a gimme. Like, you play Mario Kart on 50cc, you're going to win. No problem, right? Unless you're maybe like a kid or like, you know, a gamer who really doesn't play very often. Like, you're going to win 50cc Mario Kart. You're not going to win Fast Racing Neo your first time through. If you do, props to you. You're really good. But that's okay. I'm okay with the game. I'm not like saying, oh, it's too hard. It just took me by surprise a little bit, so I'm going to warn you all out there. It is a more difficult game. But the second time I played through, I did place first in the circuit, and I was able to move on. So I'm totally okay with a game kind of requiring a little bit of effort for progression. The only thing that kind of bothers me about the game, I don't like the default controls, is that, like, you know, they do the little ZL and ZR are kind of like the super left turner. Like, they drift your car left and right like it didn't have zero. But then the R button is the boost. And the L button flips between the orange and blue, but you can also use X to do that. And it's like my fingers on the L and R's are never hitting the right button. And so suddenly I'll boost when I think I'm going to be drifting to the right. Or worse yet, I'll drift to the right when I think I'm going to boost. And like I'm having a hard time kind of like training my fingers to do that. And I didn't see a way to remap those buttons at all. I could have missed it, but I really wish it would let me remap some of that to a configuration that works for me. I did notice the menu system in the game is really basic. A lot of the shell around the game itself is really basic. But that's, I mean, that's okay. I mean, you know, the important part is, is it a fast racing game? And yes, it is. But I just, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't have that polish you would expect out of an F-Zero game, right? Like F-Zero GX was extremely polished from start to finish. And most Nintendo games are, right? This one's a little rough in the edges, but when you're actually racing, it's a lot of fun. And I'll give it that. So, look in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Dark Ted Sousa says, I saw some video of fast racing Neo. Yeah, I did get sort of a wipeout vibe from it, but it still looked blazing fast. It definitely seems to have a little bit of an F-Zero vibe to it, too. There's still definitely a F-Zero vibe to it. Like, I swear to God, one of the opponent's names, it's not Captain Falcon, but it's like Fapton Calkin or something. Like, it's really similar. It's kind of surprising. Like General Hawk. Wait, that's actually, I think, G.I. Joe. So. Anyway. And I got to give this important update. Shane actually joined the chat room and said, what terrible lie was said? And so the chatters basically filled him in on what I'd been saying. And Shane said, yeah, it's hell trying to hunt for both Amiibo and Power Rangers toys. So I had to pick one. So. But what about my needs? What about the Amiibo I need? See, Shane was always, like he was keeping me in the loop on the Amiibo. Shane was my dealer. I know Shane was my dealer. And now he's just, you can't just quit. Alright. So anyway. There you go. That was pretty much my gaming week. I think that's all I really have to say for my gaming week was those games. Housekeeping, and then we'll get into news tonight. Just for housekeeping real quick, I know we've missed a lot of shows recently. The good news is, no more missed shows unless something really bad happens. We will be here weekly, at least through the end of February. But I will be gone for a Sunday in the end of February. Maybe we can tape in advance that week. Because I'll only be gone like Thursday, Friday, so maybe we can tape on a Wednesday or something. This is way out in February, so we don't have to worry about it now. I'm going to Disneyland next month. Are you really? Yeah. Lucky. I told you. Oh yeah, that's right, because you're going to the farewell before they bulldoze. I'm going to meet. Yeah, before they bulldoze a lot of the frontier stuff for Star Wars Land. And I wouldn't have even known about that actually being the weekend if not for Victoria, so I'm going to be like, I'll be there. Yeah. It's going to be interesting. Because I deserve it. You do deserve it. I'm kind of jealous you're going to Disneyland, but that's okay because a month later, I won't be here at the end of February, so we won't be live at the end of February. This is a ways off. I'm going to MAGFest. I booked my flight. I know I've talked about it on the show for some time, but I'm officially 100% going. I booked my flight. I'm staying with some podcasting buddies. And I'm going to be spending Thursday through Monday out in the D.C. area. It's not technically in D.C., but it's the D.C. area. I'm flying into the Rainier Airport. You'll have a good time. I'm very excited about it because I had a good time at Rockage out here on the West Coast. And Gabe, who is from the Sac-I-GDA, he works with MAGFest because he's from Jersey. So I've got to talk to him and see what his plans are. Yeah, it's going to be my first MAGFest. I'm really excited about it. So I hope to see you guys there. VOG, OLR, we're not doing anything in official capacity. I kind of signed up too late. I forgot the panel submissions were going to close. I kind of forgot to get on that bandwagon. So we're not really doing anything in an official capacity, but I will be there. And if you're there, we'll plan an unofficial meetup somewhere. Meet me by the Tron machine at 3 p.m. or something. We'll figure something out. We'll tweet on our Twitter account, at OLR. All right, that's all I can think of for housekeeping. Otherwise, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR. We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio. And Google, google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio. Let's get into what happened this week in gaming news, starting with Loki. There was a lot for late December, can I just say. There was a lot of news this week. It was crazy. So let's get to it. So apparently Hideo Kojima came off of his vacation. And wasted no time to make the announcement that Kojima Productions is going to be coming back. And they're going to be partnering with Sony for the first title. So that's pretty amazing, actually. Like literally right after signing the deal for that. And it's going to be like a new franchise or a new IP. It's not going to be based off of Metal Gear or Silent Hill. But it should be something great. And apparently as part of that, I think Sony is going to be fronting some money to help kick start that company. So that's kind of cool. Now that they've gone indie though, of course, what's going to happen to Metal Gear? Well, apparently Konami is looking for staff for a new Metal Gear game. Now there's been this post scene I guess that they have seeking people experienced that want to sign up to make a new game. Although it could be, I think this was left over, it might have been from Phantom Pains. But I mean it's still up and so they're still seeking staff for a new Metal Gear title. So I don't know. You have to wonder if they aren't just going to take the Metal Gear IP and do something kind of different with it. Like a pachinko machine. No, maybe experimenting with the online stuff or I don't know. I don't know. I mean like I'm surprised if they are actually still considering doing console games for this. I mean after all the bridges that they burned I'm just surprised that they're like, Hey, we're going to come back. They didn't just burn the bridges, they detonated them. Like is anyone going to give a shit that they came back? It's like, you know, unless there's something really cool to show, I mean I just think no one's going to give a shit. Yeah, Konami's going to have to work real hard to get me to give a shit about whatever's in store for Metal Gear. So that being said, let's talk about Kojima and the Sony thing. So what do y'all think? I think it's exciting. I can't wait to see what he's got. It's a very logical pairing, especially after the very good reception of P.T. But can we talk about how bad I want P.T. to be the thing that he's working on with Sony? It could be. Maybe he's going to work on something that's not Silent Hills but is Silent Hills. But like a scary... And yeah, I realize he can't even really use P.T. because technically Konami paid for that development. So any of the characters, any of the stuff he did... But there wasn't really anything in it, I mean... Yeah, but I don't know. So he can't actually make P.T., but he can make something that's inspired-ish, you know what I mean? I guess I just want Kojima to make a scary game, and I kind of want Guillermo del Toro to be involved as well. So, I mean, yes, he can't make Silent Hills, duh. That's done. But I would be very interested in whatever it is he's making. He's making, yeah, a new franchise. Silent Hill hasn't really been with Silent Hill for a long time anyway, so... I'm kind of okay with that being done with a new franchise. We'll love it just as much. Interesting theory from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. ActDeft says, I'm calling it, Kojima will make a Playstation VR game. Could that be what they are going to put him on? Make it, oh god, can you imagine a scary game in VR? I might shit my pants for real, good lord. I don't know, DartSakura? What do you think of all this? I hope not. I hope not. I mean, honestly, I hate speculating on stuff like that because, first of all, we knew he was going to be getting right back into thing after, you know, his contract date was up. Because I knew it wasn't a vacation, it was a separation, a complete separation. And having him pairing up with Sony, like, right away. Oh, Sony took him out on a nice date. Sony played some romance, Sony played some Adele, to some candlelit music, and steak, and Sony sexed him somehow. This wasn't a love hotel, this was a full on host date. It was fucking like, hey, hey, listen. This was Kojima breaking up and going right onto the hookup app to find the next best thing. And Sony's like, me, me, me, me, me. Listen, I know your pimp was treating you bad before, but come on. Well, I'll buy you nice things, you know, you can make whatever you want. You got freedom. Alan Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Sony and Kojima's date was like that Instagram series. He got money. Have you ever seen that? It's funny. At any rate, the only thing I can expect is great things. So when's Konami going to announce that he's actually left the company? Is he still going to be on vacation? Is it going to be a weekend at Bernie's situation where it's like, no, he's still working. See, look, look at all the work he's doing. He's right there. I kind of think when your ex-husband announces they just got married, that kind of insinuates that there was a divorce that happened at some point. I don't think Konami needs to make a statement. I think at this point for Konami to make a statement is just for the Internet's amusement, which Konami is probably not amused that the rest of us are amused, but they really only have themselves to blame at how they've conducted themselves. Like I said, Konami is a PR nightmare right now. I would hate to be in their PR department and none of them had anything to do with it. And Lord knows, they're probably yelling. What needs to happen at Konami, the CEO needs to be dethroned. This is such a fucking mess at this point. The CEO needs to be switched and that's the only way. This is like when Microsoft needed to lose their CEO. Honestly, for everything that Microsoft went through last year or two years ago, it's nothing compared to what Konami is going through. And Don Mattrick lost his job over it. I mean, they'll say it was parted on mutual terms. He lost his job over it. Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. AlanAlchemy, Sony, what do you want to watch? I got Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, Amazon Prime, Kojima, LOL, whose password do you have? Sony, I pay for it all, Kojima. He got money! SSG100Matt says, we'll see if people flip off Konami with their wallet when the new Metal Gear Solid game comes out. I certainly hope they do. Well, you know, how would you feel? Now, I'm going to be like the most ultimate tinfoil hat right now, but just humor me for a minute here. Let's say I get my wish and the management is shaken up severely at Konami. Severe management shakeup. And Konami decides to bring in an outside person that's worked on another big game series to do Metal Gear. Would you have faith at that point? Would you be willing to forgive Konami if Konami basically fired the people that needed to be fired and put in some fresh blood from other places? Would you give Metal Gear Solid a chance at that point? No, because they aren't bringing out a new Dance Dance Revolution game. Oh, come on. I just don't care. Whatmeme says, those people working on new Metal Gear had nothing to do with the nasty split. Don't punish them. Shane in our chat says, how can Konami fire itself? But this stuff happens all the time. Shareholders revolt and demand to the board that it changes. Well, let's put it this way. Let's just see how their Patinko business works. I hope it's as good as they think it is. That's all I'm saying. It's just like betting everything on mobile. I really hope that you don't think that you're going to have the next Angry Birds. Because I'm sorry, whatever game you put out on there is probably not going to be that big. But they might have Metal Gear tap puzzle surprise thing. I don't know. Who knows? It'll be terrible. Chibi Metal Gear, where you drag Solid Snake in a cardboard box through mazes of whimsical obstacles. It's Metal Gear Solid Racing! It's just Snake in a cardboard box. Exactly. It's like a cardboard box derby car. It's like that Boy Scouts event where people build their little cars. Soap box derby. That's it. Metal Gear Solid soap box derby. Sg100Matt, I'll leave it on this. Sg100Matt in chat says, I want them to come out on stage, bow their heads, and say, Hey, we were dicks. Sorry, but we'll change. Well, I don't know about that. Still won't care. Yeah, we'll see. Hey, let's move on though to some other news that happened this past week. Including your Xbox One got enriched with more backwards compatibility. Microsoft making good on their word to add more backwards compatibility each month for the second month in a row. So hopefully this trend will continue into January and February. But some new games available on the Xbox One are Xbox 360 titles like Braid, Deus Ex Human Revolution, Fable 3, Halo Reach, Hydro Thunder, that's I think a favorite of Dark Soccer's, Ms. Pac-Man, Pagle, Portal Still Alive, that was the standalone Portal thing on 360, Splunky, Splosion Man, and Doritos Crash Course. For those of you that were fans of Doritos and their saturation of the gaming market. But yeah, all those games are available now on the Xbox One. So that's pretty cool. By the way, Hydro Thunder is really Dan's thing. Oh, I thought you were into that too. I mean, I was for a hot minute, but Dan was like, he'll still like when he finds a Hydro Thunder machine, he'll be like, Tidal Blade! Damn the torpedoes! What was the game that was like the spiritual successor? H2 Overdrive. That's it, H2 Overdrive. He likes that one too. That game's fun too. Yeah. Anyway, all right, so yeah, turn on your Xbox One and check your games library because you never know what you might have bought on 360. I think that Doritos game was free, so I think a lot of people have that. But yeah, I logged in. I was like, oh, hey, I've got like five new games available. I didn't even realize I bought all this shit. I knew it would pay off someday. That's me looking at my Steam library. Right. Anyhow. So here's a little bit of interesting speculation is that there's been this ongoing question, is Rare Replay coming to Wii U? We finally have an answer. At least Microsoft hasn't said like a definite no. They just said that they hadn't had any information. But Rare spoke up and said it is exclusive to Xbox One. We have the answer. Now people can shut up. That is, I mean, I don't know. It seems a little bit obvious to me that that would be the case, that it's exclusive to Xbox. But maybe people were hoping that a Nintendo release on Wii U would then maybe sub out some of the 360 titles for stuff like Donkey Kong Country. I'm assuming that was the fan wank that started all that. They'd like to think so. But I mean, a good number, though, of those games were on Nintendo consoles before. That's some of the coolest stuff in the pack, like playing Cobra Triangle again. It was half like this is awesome and half actually it's not that awesome. It was just more awesome when I was a kid. But now it's like, sorry, Nintendo players who want to recapture those nostalgia, time to bust out your carts and blow out some dust. That's how you're going to get it on a Nintendo system. But I understand Microsoft kind of wanting to keep those Xbox One exclusives where they can. But at the same time, again, Microsoft working with Nintendo products, not unheard of. I mean, obviously, Minecraft this week, right? That's a Microsoft thing now. And then Viva Pinata was on the 3DS. So Microsoft will do it if, you know. Microsoft will play nice with the other team. Sure. I mean, we've got Office on Mac. I mean, why not? Yeah. I mean, the question is, can they make money? Yes. And that's all that matters is the money. He got money. Yes. Capitalistic paradise here, huh? There's Brad in our chat room. MS got money. Oh, my ticket is getting all wrinkled. What? My ticket. Oh, your movie ticket? Are you one of those people who saves movie tickets? I have movie tickets for years. When I moved out here, I had a bundle of movie tickets from, like, 1989. I don't. And I moved out here in 98. Wow. No, I don't save movie tickets. I do. Because memories. And they go like, haha, sat through that. I knew a person that saved, tangent time, but sorry about it. I knew a person that saved every ticket from when they saw the Rocky Horror Picture Show. That's cool. And they had, like, a binder of, like, 150 tickets from just week after week after week of seeing Rocky Horror. That's cool. Yeah. I did think that was kind of cool, but I was like, dang, like. So you got a binder full of printed paper, but memories. Binder full of women. Yes, binders full of women. Binder full of transsexual Transylvanians. Who knew that that four-year-old joke would work well on the show tonight? Let's travel around the world and check our binders full of release dates. How about binders full of sluts and assholes? I don't think you're going to find those in the release dates. In fact, I think those binders are going to be pretty empty this week leading into Christmas, but let's ask, are there any releases coming out in the U.S. this week? Loki. Yeah, there's a Tales of Legend game that's coming out on PlayStation 3 and the Vita. And that's it? Yeah. I mean, it's the week of Christmas, so. Yeah. Yeah. And that's it. You get only one Exceed RPG this week, and that's it. If your game's not out by now, it's not for the holiday season, I guess. On the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week. Now, Christmas is a little different in Japan. You can get a cake, but it's not really quite the same thing it is here. I want a Christmas cake. I just want cake. You know, we usually try to find the restaurant on Christmas. We'll do our little. Yeah, we haven't decided what to do this year. We'll have to figure that out, but maybe we should have cake. But you know what the crappy thing is? What? I have to work the next day, so I can't stay out late. Aww. So. We have to get creative, because we are doing our thing with Alan's family, so I don't know. Why don't we do this? How about Sunday before the show instead? Maybe. We'll do Gay Jumis on Sunday. Will there be cake? We can have cake. Right. It better not be a lie. Or, and places will be open. That's true. So, we can just put it off. We could do cheesecake. We could do cheesecake. Last year we got cheated out of our holiday. You know I love cheesecake. Why don't we do Cheesecake Factory? I even will play Five Nights at Freddy's for cheesecake. Let's do Cheesecake Factory for Gay Jumis. Alright, that works. Okay. Alright. Wattmeme in chat says, there were some digital releases this week. Just curious, why does no LR announce digital releases? That's a good question. It's too hard to keep track of all those. We sometimes will pick that up too in the rapid fire news. We try to sort of, I think for some reason Dark Soccer's has the digital mixed in when she does the UK. But otherwise, Loki and I look at retail stuff so it's a little tricky sometimes. It's too hard to remember everything that's coming out anyways. I basically, I'll go ahead and just say, I basically use Eurogamer as my source and they mix in the UK stuff. I mean until someone can buy me a better UK release thing because game hasn't been super reliable. Right. Okay. Well, let's go to Japan and check out some releases over in Japan. On the PlayStation 4, Assault Suit Lanos is out this week on December the 23rd. God Eater Offshot Twin Pack Volume 3 is also coming out on the PlayStation 4 this week. Going to the PlayStation 3, TV Anime Idolmaster Cinderella G4U Pack Volume 7. Your guess is as good as mine as to what the fuck that is. It's an Idolmaster expansion pack of some sort. This is definitely the week to put something like that out. Volume 7. If you can believe it. Good lord. On the Wii U this week, there is a new game. Geni Ibunroku \u00a3FE is out this week. And I think that's actually, the emphasis is on FE in the title. So I think this must be based on some, oh is it Fire Emblem? Is this the Fire Emblem crossover game? That must be what this is. I think this is the Fire Emblem crossover game. That they've been waiting for is finally out on the Wii U this week. You know Rob. Why didn't they just call it Fire Emblem? Then I know what it is. You know what Rob? It could be that given this is so modern, that could be hashtag FE. Yeah, maybe that's what it looks like at first is hashtag FE. But I'm like, eh, I think so. Unless they really like iron. Yeah. You know, because FE, Varus, iron. Well I'm sure some people will be importing that one on the Wii U because I know Fire Emblem has their fans. Going to the PlayStation Vita, Getsui no Kusaro, Sakuran Paranoia comes out this week, as well as Mobile Suit Gundam, Extreme vs. Force, and Storm Lover V comes out on the Vita in Japan this week because Vita in Japan is still a thing. And on the Nintendo 3DS this week, I think this is kind of awesome, Sega 3D Fukoku Archives 1 and 2 Double Pack. This is a collection of all those Sega 3D games they've released, at least in Japan. Get this, Power Drift, Space Harrier, Sonic, Fantasy Zone, Outrun, Fantasy Zone 2, Bare Knuckle, Galaxy Force 2, Shinobi, Echo the Dolphin, Thunder Blade. I mean, that's not even all of them. So that's a heck of a collection. That actually reminds me of something that I learned over the week because it's another game I forgot to mention. Fantasy Zone for PC Engine is kind of crappy. At least the music is. Aw, sorry to hear that. Sorry to hear that. Let's see, Gameguru clarifying the title there. It is, of course, Shin Megami Tensei Crossfire Emblem. That's right, that's what they're calling it here. And Gameguru says the pound is supposed to be a musical sharp symbol. So it's sharp-F-E. I knew that that's what it meant in music, but the last time I think I've heard something like that in regards to a video game was... What was the role-playing game that had all the music... Internal Sonata. Internal Sonata, that was it. That's a really underrated game, I think. History needs to remember that game a little better. That was a really good RPG. There's so much musical innuendo in that game. Yeah, it fell a little flat, didn't it? Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio. Dark Sakura will be sacked after tonight's episode. I'd like to apologize to all the listeners that had to deal with that punishment just then. Am I in trouble? You are in big trouble. You just got moved to Santa's naughty list. Alright, let's go to the UK release dates. I'll just play myself a little sad song on my piano. It's not really my forte, though. I hate her so much, you guys. Allow me to break out a little more fortissimo and I'll do my part now. I've been here for seven years. The medication doesn't work. I know, it fell on its base. Shut up and read the release dates. Gee, Rob. That was also a music joke, too. The chatters are yelling, stop. She must be stopped. Well, better a stop than a repeat, right? We could just do that. Read release dates. I will end you. There's one. One. In my magnum opus of puns. December 30th is story of seasons for 3DS. Finny. Just a couple more quick stories for you guys and we're going to get to the classic game of the week. Loki. Another Smash Direct this week. Isn't this the last one they're doing? Last one ever. The way they end it with, of course, adding Bayonetta. Bayonetta is going to be joining the Smash Bros. roster in the game. Allow me to join what? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? And allow me to join what Twitter said in response to this this week. Yes! Because that was basically my entire Twitter feed during that conference. It was just one great, big yes! I'm super happy they put her original outfit. I'm sure you're looking forward to the eventual amiibo that will be coming out. Oh, yeah. The Bayonetta amiibo is almost better news than Bayonetta being in the game, to be honest. But yeah, I'm with Dark Soccer. I like the fact that they have both the Bayonetta 1 and 2 outfits in it. I want, though, the amiibo to be the original Bayonetta as well, because I really do not like her second game look. We'll see. I would pick up the game if it was discounted, but it's not. Also, they're adding Corrin from Fire Emblem as well. And so that's going to be, they have like, how many people from Fire Emblem now in this game? I mean, seriously. I don't even know her. I've never played Fire Emblem. There were a lot of people that were like, really? More Fire Emblem? But at the same time, I'm kind of like, I'm of two mindsets. I mean, there's a part of me that's like, okay, yeah, maybe I would have liked to see somebody a little more well-known, but at the same time, if Corrin is a solid character that they believe in, I mean, shouldn't she be allowed a chance to shine? It is a fighting game. It makes sense that you have sword wielders in it. And there's a shit ton of Pokemon and Mario characters, so what's another Fire Emblem character, especially with Japan? But they've got like six. Cloud, Final Fantasy, Bayonetta, like, they couldn't have said, instead of, okay, let's put a, like, the 15th Fire Emblem character in there. They could have, like, said, how about we do whatever? It seems like 15. Um, they could have just like, hey, let's put, like, Birdo in there or something, or say, hey, how about a character from fucking Super Mario Brothers 2? Anybody. At this point, I'm wondering why they don't do a Fire Emblem fighting game. The chatroom is correcting me on something. Corrin, like several of the other Fire Emblem characters, can be either male or female. I'm using female pronouns, because that's how it was presented in the video, if I'm not mistaken. So, that's what kind of associ- I know it's both. Yes, I know that's what I'm saying. It's both. No, no, no. In the video that I saw, um, Corrin started off male and was kept being referred to as Big Brother, Big Brother, Big Brother. Oh. Now Big Brother's Big Sister, and that's even better! I laughed so much. So, just, just so y'all can stop writing the emails. I, uh, they, it was the same thing that Robin does, where you can be boy or girl. That's cool, but, once again, you know, I'd rather, like, some more obscure characters. Hey, let's put Captain Rainbow in there, or fucking, like, you know, anybody from Super Mario Brothers 2. Here's the thing. If that had been the note they ended on, then I think a lot of us would be like, oh, okay, cool. But, the fact that they said, okay, here's Corrin, and then here's fucking Bayonetta, like, it's like, oh, okay, cool, cool. Yeah, I'm in, I'm in. Like, you know, Corrin's just kind of like, oh, it's just like a little bit, it's a cherry on top, but Bayonetta, hmm. That's gonna be a lot of fun. Bayonetta is luscious. No, I can't freaking wait. I didn't download Cloud yet, though. I was, I was so busy playing Xenoblade and even Mario Maker, I didn't even talk about it during my gaming week, but I was catching up on all the Mario Maker event stages, because I have to get all those new costumes, right? Like the badge arcade bunny and all that stuff. I'm sure, I think we'll talk about that later. I haven't gotten that one yet. They only had a few, I didn't have that latest update when I checked it last, so I only got the car and, I forget, I don't, I got the cat thing from Monster Hunter and I'm almost positive you have a story on it after the break, so it'll probably jog your memory. No, no, I saw that. I'm just saying, I didn't play those levels, the new ones, so I must have done it before they put those up. But, yeah, you know, the developers, they made a solid game. If Corrin is the character they believe in and want to have in the game, they are more than welcome to do it. Cool. I want there to be a Pokemon game that plays like Smash. Uh, Pokken, well, it doesn't really play like Smash, I guess, but you kind of have a fighting Pokemon game coming at Pokken Tournament. Maybe not what you had in mind. Also, Mii costumes, right? Because I know some people are getting excited about some of those. They're going to have the Mii costumes they had, um, I was kind of disappointed that they didn't put any Mario RPG stuff like actual characters, but they have got, um, I want to say the Geno costume. Yeah. Um, they had also, you know, stuff from you could do, uh, was it a chocobo? And then they also had, like, uh, the Sonic characters, like Knuckles, Tails, um, so that looked pretty cool. And then they have the Mii costumes now. Bionic armor from Brawler, or for the Brawler, let's see, um, Gil from the Tower of Druaga. And, let's see, Ashley from WarioWare, right? Ashley from WarioWare. And, uh, Takamura from Nazo, no, I don't even know what the fuck the series was. I'm not even going to bother. Sorry, you tried. But Geno, though, seriously, Geno would have been awesome. Yeah, I gotta say, I think the one thing I was seeing about the Corrin thing is that people were like, couldn't we have gotten Geno instead of Corrin? Do you remember Nazo, what do you mean, Nazo no Yeah, I don't know what that is. It means it's a mysterious girlfriend. Wow, that cleared it up. Well, look, uh, um, here's, here's the other thing, you kind of talk about Super Mario RPG. Uh, a couple years ago, I would have said no way, no how, you're never getting a sequel to that game. Square and Nintendo are not going to be back in bed together. But, now that we've got Cloud for Smash Brothers, Geno shows up as a costume, rumors gaining steam that Square is somehow heavily involved with NX. Y'all, I'm just saying, could you imagine, could you, tinfoil hat time. This is Rob's dream. E3 2016. Nintendo NX. It's fucking coming. Reggie Fils-Aime is out on stage, he punches a kid in the face, he's like, this is going to be so fucking rad. And then, he says, and guess what title we're launching with? Mario RPG 2. I mean, there's, there's not enough Kleenex in the world to scoop up all the you know what that would be out there if that were to be the big announcement at NX. I'm just saying. You know, that sounds like a great idea. In my head, it's fabulous. It's fabulous, and then they're like, and here's the controller. Oh, it's a fucking mobile touch screen with no fucking buttons! Because we don't fucking get it. And then we'd be like, damn you! No! I am not purchasing that. So, Nintendo, so in your dream, Loki. No, seriously, like, I watched, like, just on a TV show, like, I'm having this dream, and I'm so pleasantly asleep, and then Loki comes in and ruins my dream. Well, no, it's like, you get the game you've always wanted, and then they fuck it up! They, yeah, because, well, seriously though, I watched, like, I watched one of those Did You Know Gaming things, and they were talking about the Wii U and stuff, and, like, we've heard the story before about, like, when they were talking about the online and everything, and how, oh, hey, we've never, we have no fucking experience with what the Playstation Network and Xbox Live are, or how to create an infrastructure, and just boggles my mind that with the launch of the Wii U, they didn't fucking know anything about that shit. And I mean, even now, it's a little bit better, but that kind of scares me, what we're going into with NX. Like, you would think, okay, they should really have a handle on how to run the, you know, the structure of everything. I mean, they just started doing DLC, what, like, a year or two ago? I mean, I'm just like, I hope it's good. I hope it's good, but I'm worried that they don't get it, and it's gonna be fucked up somehow. Alright, sst200maddenchat says, I dream of having Twitch stream of Loki's live reaction of the NX announcement. This is why they invented Periscope. Are they announcing it this year? Because I'm seriously thinking about taking off time for E3 this year. I think 2016, I think E3 will be the big announcement. I think there's so much hype going into this, I can't see how they don't announce it at the next E3. We'll see. Let's see, also actdeft trying to sell Dark Sakura on Pokken, saying Pokken isn't like Smash, but it's like Tekken. And Dark Sakura loves Tekken. So... I don't know if I'm feeling it with, uh, Pokken, though. Alright. And Dark Tetsuya says, I just want a date and title on Zelda games. Ah, Zelda U. Man, who saw, um, Akuma, um, in the new Tekken? Oh, yeah. Oh my god. I was like... That was random. I know. It's random, but it's like, what the fuck did happen to Tekken Cross Street Fighter? I mean, it's like, hey, you have Street Fighter in there now. Maybe. Where's the rest of it? Maybe that's it. I just kind of gurgled a little bit. You know what it is? It's fucking Tekken 7 with the Tekken Cross Street Fighter DLC. Be careful what you wish for. That is, I don't know, I'm gonna upgrade that from tinfoil hat to, like, paper mache hat, because that is a lot more realistic, I think, that concept. Just saying. Anyhow, uh, let's move on. Let's talk about, uh, one big thing that's been developing the past couple weeks is Sony releasing more PlayStation 2 games on the PlayStation 4. Did you know that Parappa 2 came out in the week that, uh, we've been off? No, it was just this past week, actually. Parappa the Rapa 2 is now available on PlayStation 4. That's kind of cool. Um, well, anyway, uh, Sony's been doing a campaign on Twitter where you can use the hashtag PS2PS4. Get it? Because PS2... It's like the play on the number 2. They're not putting PlayStation games on the PlayStation 4. That doesn't make any sense. Shut up. Alright, anyway, so, uh, using that hashtag, uh, they are, uh, Dave Thatch with Sony is tracking what the popular suggestions are to figure out what games should be brought over to the PS4 yet. Uh, some of the games that, uh, have been noticed have been, I guess, trending a little bit. Tekken, SOCOM, Fatal Frame, Timesplitters, Simpsons Hit and Run, God Hand, Persona 3, Dragon Quest, and Kingdom Hearts. Now, Timesplitters 2 would be good. Let's please do Timesplitters 2. I can't believe that Final Fantasy 12 would not be on that list, because... Well, Final Fantasy 12 already got an HD remake that's already, well, no, actually it didn't. I was like, it did, because I've been asleep there, because I don't think it has. Are they doing that? Uh, no. Everything's been quiet on Final Fantasy 12. Um, the game I want, most of all, Katamari Damacy. We just talked about it. It was a classic game of the week a couple weeks ago. You know what I want? That's the one I want. I want the games that I fucking purchased already to be fucking available, is what I want. I want that shit to fucking just work without having me buy that shit again. Oh, Loki, you're asking for too much. Apparently. Alright, let's go to the classic game of the week. We're gonna take a walk down memory lane to a time... The games did not have DLC. There was not a separate DLC adventure. There was no patch. It was just, this is the game you get. Take it or leave it. In fact, this is the game that our system comes with, right, Darsakra? Sort of. Not necessarily. Not at the beginning. Alright. Let's get to it. What is the classic game of the week, Darsakra? The classic game of the week is Bonk's Adventure. Yay. It was run by Red Company and Atlas. It came out in 1989 in Japan and 1990 in North America for the TurboGrafx-16. Now, as we all know, the TurboGrafx-16 in Japan was called the PC Engine. When this game came out in Japan, it was called PC Genjin because it sounded like PC Engine, sort of. And it has come out, it was re-released in the US in 1992 on the Gates of Thunder 4 in one game CD-ROM, and actually another pretty good TurboGrafx game. It had ports for the NES, Game Boy, and Amiga and different other systems under some different titles like FC Genjin, GB Genjin, and VC Genjin. And it was out on Virtual Console and on PlayStation Store. There's even a mobile version in Japan for phones. Basically, your main character is Bonk, who has a very, very big head. And unbelievably, his head's bigger than the orange on a toothpick kid's head from So I Married an Axe Murderer. That's pretty big. So he's a bald cave boy who basically fights dinosaurs and other different prehistoric-type enemies with his head. His unbreakable, invincible head. He basically has Luke Cage for a head, except without being that awesome. So he has to rescue Princess Zaa, who is a pink playasaur-type dinosaur lady, from King to Jewel, who is a Tyrannosaurus style. In the arcade version, Bonk also has a female version of himself that you can play as. So anyway, Bonk basically hits things with his head. Bonk's health, he starts off with three hearts, and they can be depleted as he takes damage, and he has three extra lives. But he can restore his life by eating fruits and vegetables. See what they did to their kids? He can also get pieces of meat as power-ups. They give him different special abilities and make him stronger. So he gets his normal self for the first stage. The second stage, he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground. And the third stage, he becomes temporarily invulnerable. He gets his big meat and small meat. So he's an equal meat eater. So when the third stage of meat power wears off, he goes back to the second stage, and then he goes back to regular Bonk. He also can get different power-ups that will refill his health, or a large red heart that restores all of his health. There's also blue heart power-ups that will increase his heart health by one heart. So the game, I mean, it... The other thing about naming it PC Genjin is that Genjin is also Japanese for caveman. So... It works in two different ways. It's a fun pun, guys. Um... It was meant to be called a From Right PC Kid. Um... But they never called it the PC Engine in the US. So, um, and I doubt they could have called it, like, Turbo Boy or something. So they called it Bonk's Adventure. Um... The game has always been, um, Bonk's Adventure here in the US. Um, in 2003, Hudson did a 3D remake of Bonk's Adventure in the Hudson Selection games that came out only in Japan on PlayStation 2 and GameCube. Um, but yeah, Bonk was basically, like, the big character used to advertise, um, the TurboGrafx-16 in the US around the mid-90s. Um, and I do believe that yeah, Bonk was used as a launch title for a while, wasn't it? I want to say it was, because I think my buddy had a TurboGrafx-16 and I think he had this game and I feel like he got them together. And I don't know if that was just, you know, Santa brought them both, but... I want to say that when the TurboGrafx came out, it was Keith Courage or, um... Might have been Keith Courage, was actually the packing game. But then this, I think it's like one of those things kind of like Sega and Sonic. Like, once Sonic really took off, they started packing that in. Well, but keep in mind, I think that one of the other big ones that kind of was used for advertising was Air Zonk. Remember? Yeah, yeah, I do. Um, which, uh, I mean, all really, you know, decent games. Um, so Husband was uh, Husband, why am I saying Husband? Because Dam was playing this too. Um, Hudson um, was also working on a reboot to uh, call it Bonk, Brink of Extinction for WiiWare and PSN, but when, uh, Hudson closed, uh, it went into limbo, um... And who bought Hudson, boys and girls? Who bought Hudson? Who's done nothing with this? Konami! Correct! I just was, I couldn't even bring myself to... Their name is forbidden from my lips. Unless it's old, old Konami. Yes. Old Konami. Sigh. Um, so anyway, um, it, uh, was supposed to be getting a Wii U Virtual Console release. This was announced on October 19th this year, but no one said anything? But the rating out there was supposed to, um, also indicate, uh, PS3 and PSP. So, that it was uh, supposed to be the TurboGrafx version. Which is the better version. You know. But that's it. Bonk's adventure. Here it is. It is on the regular Wii Virtual Console. I have it there. It is. Because the folks in chat are talking about like, well, how do I play this game? Somebody said, I didn't ever own a console that this was on. But I'm pretty sure it's on the regular Wii Virtual Console, which remember, you can boot your Wii U into Wii mode to get that game. I mean, it's kind of a pain, but you can do it. I will tell you this. If you can get your hands on the TurboGrafx, finding a copy of Bonk is not difficult. It's not a rare game. Um, it's just, you know, the problem is finding, as they called them in the U.S. TurboChips, or the HuCards for the PC Engine, um, the uh, um, you know, you can get ROMs for some of these things. Um, there is I think a licensed, I think it's a licensed emulator, don't quote me, but Magic Engine, which has been out for a while. Um, and it's got like full arcade card support and everything and will play HuCard um, uh, TurboChip games, any of them. You just like, though for the, the Duo games, you actually have to have the, the disc to play. But you know, which, as you have to say, we, we got our Turbo EverDrive. And the one thing that has actually kind of made me sad is that we had heard a rumor that it was going to let you do arcade card stuff so that we can play some of our arcade card, um, Duo games. Like, um, what is the one we have? Uh, one of the Fatal Fury games I know we have for uh, the arcade card CD. And I think our other one is Strider. Um, for PC Engine, uh, uh, arcade card games. And it doesn't work for that. So if that's what you're looking for, it's not going to work. So we're kind of back to trying to find a U.S. compatible version of the arcade card or the Duo add-on for the core graphics. Gotcha. Alright. Oh well. Well there it is. Your classic game of the week Bonks Adventure. A very, very classic Turbo graphics title or PC Engine, depending on what country you are in. On that note, we are going to take a quick break. Uh, take a moment here to stretch and refill our drinks here in the OLR studio. And so forth. When we come back though, there's plenty more Orange Laundry to come, including rapid fire news. The Fookle Question of the Week, which is about sports ball, in honor of our guest this week. And we're going to get to the mailbag, the FUs of the Week, and hopefully your calls, although with the Skype rig tonight, I don't know how well that's going to work. So we're going to try though. All we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this. Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight on December 20th of 2015, with episode number 624 of our show already in progress in the middle here of the holiday season. Get into full gear. I know a lot of folks celebrating Christmas in the next week, so Merry Christmas to those that celebrate. Um, next week will be the last show of 2015 if you can believe it. And I'm sure we'll be taking a look back on the year in gaming. Maybe looking back at some of our favorites of the year and some things that weren't so great in the past year. We will be running over all of that next week on episode 625. A nice kind of round number. A multiple of 25, I suppose, to end the year on. So that'll all be next week on the show. But let's get back into the news from this week with some rapid fire news. Loki. Hey, there's a new game from the people that made Flappy Bird. It's called Swingcopters 2. The people? The person. Whatever. The one dude. The people that play the game. Who did not like being famous. That made it popular to get him to make another one. People. Anyways, so um, Don Nguyen, he went ahead and made a new game. It was a sequel to one of his previous games, Swingcopters. And now it's out and you can play it. Yay. It's free still and ad supported. Yeah. Alright. And this is like, seriously, I'm surprised I'm actually seeing his company name. And I guess not surprised that it's coming to the Wii U. But apparently Napster, that's right, the previous file sharing music site that turned legit is now going to be coming to the Wii U as a free app on December 17th. And it also has a 30 day trial. And then you can, I guess there's different promotions. If you want to subscribe for three months, you can get pay a dollar. Otherwise it's $9.99 a month. No thanks. But I'll be coming to the Wii U if you want to check that out. And last but not least, Mario Maker is getting some updates. So there's going to be some three elements added in a new free update. These include being able to have an alternate for the spike wheel. And so instead of the grinder, you can actually turn it into a bumper. It kind of looks like a donut or like an inflatable inner tube or something. Like a pinball bumper type of thing. Yeah, basically something that you bump off of. Also they've got doors that are activated, warp doors that are activated by a P-switch. And you can do that by shaking the door. Oh, like ghost houses. I didn't realize that was missing. I guess that's... I was just going to say, I can't wait for that level that's nothing but like Mario getting bumped around from start to finish. That's just going to be like the bounce house or something. Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump. Because you know that level's coming. And then the Koopa Clown Car is getting a version that shoots fire. And you can shoot like fireballs and then I guess you can charge shot and destroy blocks with it or something. Cool! More fire! Yes, so that'll be coming December 22nd. And also with that, they're going to have a bookmark system that allows players to save levels from the web portal for later. That's kind of cool. Still don't know why they have a web portal to find levels instead of it having been built into the game like Little Big Planet. Once again, I just don't think they get it. I guess they're trying to work around it with what they got, but yeah I hear ya. I don't disagree. Along with that, of course, some new costumes you'll be able to play as including Badge Arcade Bunny. They're going to have Mr. Saturn and... Master Belch are going to be available. They are there, actually. They're already in the game. Awesome, so check it out. Play the 8-bit games or 8-bit levels to unlock them. And then also there is another costume that's not part of this but actually leaked out already. And this is from a Mario Maker level that is on the shop right now that someone hacked and somehow got this costume in there. And it's actually the Skypop Plane from Super Mario Land. Oh wow, that's obscure. Yeah, so you'll be able to play that soon because apparently they already have the level out there to download. Wow. That's cool. And I'm loving that all these updates are free. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Nintendo. It's something you've been doing very well this year, so thank you. Another game that's done very well for Nintendo this year is Splatoon, which by the way did you know there was a Splatfest this weekend? Totally missed it. Just so many other games going on. But yeah, there was a Splatfest. Who won? Act F? Who won the Splatfest thing? Because I probably would have used reverse logic and gone Team Nice, assuming everybody else would go Team Naughty. But maybe, I don't know who that is. Oh, Naughty 1. See, and I would have been fucked over again. Alright. Anyhow, so Splatoon, it's been a huge success since launching in May. It has sold over 2.42 million copies worldwide, and it's done very well in Japan. Apparently Nintendo announced this week 1 million of those copies sold in Japan, so congratulations. That's great. Especially because Nintendo took a big risk on a new franchise, but a lot of people really love Splatoon, and it's been doing very well for them, so I'm sure we have not seen the last of it. Also, to celebrate this milestone, Nintendo is going to hold a Squid Sisters concert. Splatoon Squid Sisters Live 2016 will take place at a convention center in Chiba City on January 30th, so yes, it's only for Japan, but Splatoon kind of has a fun little like surf rock soundtrack that goes with it, so I bet that'll be a lot of fun to see played live, so I'm very curious to see what that turns out as. Maybe they'll, a lot of times these concerts get CDs made of them too, so I wonder if they won't end up doing a CD of the live concert later on. We'll see. But that's Splatoon. Earlier in the show, I brought up Fast Racing Neo, and there is an update already planned for Fast Racing Neo from a tweet from Shin'en Games that actually created the game. They have announced that there is an update scheduled for January that will include a track mini-map that is not in the game right now, and I didn't mention this when I was talking about the game earlier. The Wii U gamepad, what's it used for? Off-screen play, and that's it. It's not used for anything else. So maybe the track mini-map will be on the gamepad, who knows. Online tags, I have not played the game online yet, so I guess you can't see people's tags online, but that will be fixed in January. And then they say stability improvements and the good old-fashioned various fixes. But that's nice to see that Fast Racing Neo is getting that support, and from what I'm hearing, doing very well in the online store. It was the number one online game in the past week, so props to those folks. Gee, I guess people wanted an F-Zero-like game on the Wii U after all. Who knew? Hey, look, even a story about Pokken Tournament, maybe just trying to get Dark Soccer's attention, begging for it here, it's going to launch alongside a special Wii U controller in Japan. When the Wii U version comes out on March 18th, there's going to be a Wii U bundle that has a digital copy of the game. There's going to be a wired controller that comes with it as well, but it's more, like, it looks different. It's kind of like a longer controller that, I guess, looks more like the arcade version. But anyway, it's going to be available, and it will also be compatible with the Wii U GamePad, the Wii U Pro Controller, and the Wii Classic Controller Pro. So, please look forward to that. Dark Soccer. Well, we have some news about Nobby Nobby Boy. Girl has finally reached Boy. Girl and Boy have met up again. They are now completely joined and happy. So, Girl reached Pluto and then has looped around and started making her way back to Earth. And it took six years of people playing Nobby Nobby Boy. Is that all? That's all. But how many times did Boy eat, or, Nobby Nobby Boy eat his own butt? That's a valid question, Dark Soccer. I played Nobby Nobby Boy on my phone for, like, ages. I mean, you used to see, I kept posting on Facebook, that I would give Boy and Girl all the love that I could. Do you know that that's what Dan and I call each other? Even before the game came out. Like, when I give him cards, it's to Boy from Girl. Aww. You know what? They made treatments for Hairballs, Rob. So, the Final Fantasy 7 remake group, they're getting some help from the Kingdom Hearts team, too. So, they are going to be doing a lot more development in it, too, where you can actually fully explore Midgar. So, the multi-part thing isn't going to affect your ability to go around the game. You get more attention on Biggs Wedge and Jesse. And, uh, a lot more neat stuff on them. And they're trying to bring back the voice cast from Advent Children. Nice. Also, Cloud's hallucinations are supposed to be more meaningful. I wonder if he's going to mention Xenogears. Like he did in the original. Anything is possible. Um, and then, uh, sort of a last but not least, Kurt Schilling, we know him, right? Baseball guy? 38 Studios founder? Yes. Well, um, he's like, I'm not going to say anything else about this. I'm done. So, unless they subpoena him, that's it. Then, uh, he says, I have not been served anything by anyone. There is not a person on this planet with even a smidgen of knowledge about the law who would say anything, but we all know he shouldn't testify while there is a bogus and incredibly wasteful civil suit still hanging around. So, and honestly enough, I mean, I don't know if it was exactly all his fault, but I think he's just done. I would be done too. I have a feeling he's kind of done with games for a long while. Which was sad, because the guy himself, as he is, had a real passion for it. He did really love games. And got way burnt by the whole thing, so. Yeah. So, sad face. I guess that's too bad. Alright, well, uh, but also I want to read this comment from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Sj100matt commenting on Kurt Schilling saying, he's put his foot in his mouth too much lately. He's about to lose his job at ESPN. Ouch. And, uh, Bobby Blackwolf talking about Kingdom Hearts saying, Kingdom Hearts team needs to work on Kingdom Hearts and not Final Fantasy. Uh, yeah, I think there's a lot of people that kind of feel that way. My assumption is that Kingdom Hearts might be at a point in development where some people can be shifted. Like, you know how some things are done early on in the process and that maybe Final Fantasy VII Remake needs help with that part. I don't know. We'll see. No. So, hopefully that's it. I can't see that they're actually taking resources from Kingdom Hearts. I mean, it's not like when they had to fix Final Fantasy XIV and things got really quiet at Square for a while before the Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn came out. I don't think it's like that, but we'll see. Alright, let's go to the FUGL question of the week. Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities. We ask a question and we get some answers. And this week we wanted to ask about sports ball. Because, you know, we did have Rick from Tipping Goat Games who was here earlier and we wanted to talk about sports games. So our question this week is, do you prefer the simplicity of a retro style sports game or do you prefer the complexity of the modern style sports games? Why did you answer the way you did? So let's get to some of the answers over on Facebook. Retertainment saying, the NBA street games were pretty dope until they started adding in the overly complicated game breakers that required four or five simultaneous button presses to pull off. So I'm going with simplicity. Tiger Claw says, I prefer sports games with simplistic control. Games like NBA Jam is more fun for casual players since you don't have complicated controls. One button is passing the other for shooting. Any sports games that everyone can play makes for a good party game. Andy R said, I don't play many sports games but the ones I have were the retro simple ones. So I guess those. Hitstun says, I like old arcade style sports games more. Not because they're simple but because they're fast. Modern sports games are accurate even to the boring parts. Games like RBA Baseball, NBA Jam, and NFL Blitz have better pacing than real life sports and that makes them better games. SSG100Matt says, to answer your question yes. To tell you the truth I have a place in my heart for both complex and retro or simplistic style sports games. I love playing, managing with real world characters. The professional athletes themselves and learning different strategies and skills to compete against certain defenses and offenses. I also love playing the really simple and sometimes over the top sports games that are scaled down to the essence of why people enjoy sports. Scoring, hitting, dunking, shooting, throwing passing, kicking, punching, etc. Dartetsuya says, the realistic or simulation style stats stuff doesn't appeal to me as much as the fast paced arcade style sports game. Blitz, NBA Jam and so on. I suppose it's that I'm more a casual sports fan than a hardcore one. And lastly on Facebook, Jim Sally our buddy Jim Sally with his train says, when I play sports games I want the controls to be as simple as punching my buddy in the arm while he's sitting next to me. If you want to play some complex hockey, buy a hockey stick and a cooper ball and start playing for real. Best thing is the 3D graphics in real life are almost as good as the new Xbox. But I like the way that's phrased, only almost. And going to Google Plus we have no answers on Google Plus this week. Now look, I know we all joke about Google Plus being dead, but usually there's a few of you that are loyal over on Google Plus, so I don't know what's going on. I've used Google Plus more now than... Yeah, ever since Ingress started, right? I technically haven't posted anything on Google Plus, let's be clear. The hangouts. The hangouts, yes. So yeah, there you go. Nothing on Google Plus this week, so there you go. Alright. So we're going to get back into some news. But Dark Soccer, you're on your way out, right? You had to take off a little early? Yeah, I told the hubby a little bit later than this, but he says he's here now. So I guess I'm out. Because I didn't drive here today. Dan dropped me off. We went to see Star Wars today. So yeah, he dropped me off because also my tires are a little bit unsafe. Just a little bit. I mean, I don't think it would have really been too bad for me to drive on, but at the same time, it was we were just going to be careful, so especially with the rain. So I guess I'm gone. Alright, okay, well that's okay. Did you want to tell us really quick that story you had coming up here? We'll do things a little out of order. I just closed everything. Alright. Sorry. I got it. Alright, Logie's got it. And some folks in chat are saying, Dan on the show, Dan on the show, they got places to be. Sadly, they're on their way out. But thank you for being here tonight Dark Soccer and we'll see you next week. Have a good holiday week. We will do Cheesecake. Oh my god, stop it computer. Your computer's giving you a little taste of what the show computer was giving me earlier. Alright. Alright, well Logie and I will hold down the fort here with our remaining news stories. So let's get to it. Logie. So this is kind of cool. So you know that whole Retron console that was supposed to be coming out, the one that was going to be based off of like cartridges and it would play like 18 or 8 to 32-bit style games. The Retro Magazine people were doing it, right? Yeah, yeah. That console. So anyways, now they've got support. Now it's no longer going to be the Retron video game system, but it's now, they've been backed by ColecoVision. You remember Coleco? Shit, that's like, that was like my first game system back in the 80s. You know, they haven't been around forever. But now they have a brand new system coming out called the ColecoVision, or the Coleco Chameleon. A quick thought on your way out there. I'm sorry, I'm putting on my shoes right now. I actually still have my ColecoVision from when I was a kid. And another ColecoVision. I wonder if it'll have old school Coleco games built in. It makes sense because those Flashback consoles. We finally get the expansion module number 3. I almost bought the Coleco Flashback today. They have them on they're closing them out out of Target. Or Walmart actually. They're closing them out there. And I really want the Atari one for some reason. They've got that in the Intellivision one. But anyways, yeah. So that's pretty cool. And then of course this is supposed to be launching in 2016. I'm curious to see how well it does. I'm kind of skeptical because Well, I mean when they first announced this I was like, I think it's really awesome what they're doing. I think it's extremely niche and I'm not sure how they're going to make money on it. But now that they have the backing of Coleco I kind of feel like that's going to maybe put it in more stores and it's going to make it more visible. So I kind of think it has a way better shot now than maybe. I mean and again I don't mean to poo-poo it and say it's never going to succeed. But I just feel like it was a really steep climb and this is going to really help give them that visibility that it needs. The controller looks interesting because it looks like a Wii U gamepad. Like the Wii U Pro gamepad. Not the screen or anything. It's identical to one of those gamepads. And then the middle portion it's basically the Super NES controller. I just think it's going to be weird when we see games out there. Like the retro-tastic games and it's like going to be coming out soon on Playstation 4, Xbox One and Coleco. What? I hope so as well but like I just don't know because like now if you want those retro games you can still get them on other platforms. It's not like this is the only way to get that fixed. Yeah they're going to have to have some exclusives or it's going to yeah I get that. Like I don't need the no I'm not going to buy a console for Shovel Knight when Shovel Knight's out on like a billion platforms right now. Yeah no I hear it. I hear it. Like several platforms. Alright well I'm very curious to see how that progresses. Again I think that's really good news for that and it's going to bump it a little bit out of something that otherwise would have been extremely niche. Well let's move on and talk about another Wii U game this week. There's a lot of Wii U stuff in the news this week. Did you know that a new Wii U game actually came out this week? This last Friday called Devil's Third. I actually think it wasn't, I think that was the Friday before where we're at now. Yeah it was Itagaki's game. That's right. Itagaki had put this game together for Wii U and I remember it kind of like... It was supposed to be a THQ game and then like that's... kind of disappeared but now it's out. Well apparently the game is really hard to find. Apparently Best Buy had no copies in stock in an entire district and GameStop very few copies. GameStop apparently told this reporter that there was only 420 copies of the game for sale in the entire country. What? Is that like only for the dot com? Or is that like each store got one copy of the game? And that's not even each store. That's like big stores got one copy of the game. That's crazy. Is that a pre-order? I know right? I hear the game wasn't very good but I mean that's I guess that's fine. It makes sense that there's only that many physical copies. It is available digitally so that's not a big deal. But people are snatching the shit up like it's a fucking collector's item. Yeah. And it's turning around and showing up on eBay right? It's a fucking it's a pretty shitty game so I don't know. Yeah. I guess everyone wants to make a buck. William Murderface in chat says apparently it's really bad. Dungeon Buster saying the Europeans got it months ago and pretty much panned it. What meme is asking is it a full $60 game? Unfortunately the answer is yes. 50. I think. Or 50. 50 dollars. Brad from Pod Culture in Act Deft mentioning the 420 there. 420 blaze it! Which actually you know as much as you kind of joke sometimes people put news stories out there that are intentionally false to see how far they'll travel. 420 that is an odd coincidence of a number to put in a story so maybe a little bit of salt with that but I think it really is fact to say the game is fucking hard to find. Whether it was 420 or 600 or 12 it's not an easy game to find. To be fair it is plausible because the reason for that is they manufactured those discs in lots of 30 and so 420 is divisible by 30 so Oh look at you bringing science into this! I mean there's that. I had no idea they did it in lots of 30. Yeah it's cases of 30 for like disc games usually so Wii U Okay. Well I learned something today. 24 for PlayStation because the discs are different. I don't know why it's only 24 but usually 24 for like PlayStation 3 I think now when everything is on Blu-ray it's all 30 but most of the time it's 30. DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying Loki laying down the industry knowledge yeah I got to admit I'm pretty impressed. But then again 420 could also be completely made up so I mean it's plausible. It's not a lot and I kind of would wonder what the minimum runs are on those things because normally they have to sell so many in order to make it worthwhile and usually they have to run more than I think 420 copies. Yeah unless Nintendo just straight up took a loss on this but the game is available in the digital store right? You can get it on the store if you really want to pay the full money. I just think I don't remember what their minimums are because I just know from like you know like there was a 3DS title that someone had made or DS title that was like some simulation game and they independently had it printed and it was like they had to make like 8000 copies or something of it like some ridiculous amount so if you have to make 8000 copies of that you know you probably have to make more than 420 copies I have a feeling I have a feeling someone's already written it off as a loss Well I'm just saying because like why even make a physical disc if you're going to only print that many copies you would think that they would make at least a few thousand I don't know. Maybe they have to for like tax reasons or something crazy I mean admittedly I'm talking out my ass a little bit but it would make sense. Or they just they had trouble getting it through customs damn those customs It's just it's terrible. Hey that's a pretty smart move though. Hey let's make only these make copies and make it crazy that people want it and have to get it and now they're selling all those copies. I don't know. Whatever. Alright. Well let's move on with some more stories. What else you got for us? Alright. Actually I think that would be you. With the Devil's Third Story? I just did that. Oh that's right. Oh we're talking about Jamie. Sorry about that. Okay so there's apparently this is kind of interesting so Good Game Studios they're accused of busting a union that was being created by their former employees and so I guess allegedly they were let's see here 20 employees were involved with establishing a workers council and then the company laid off that council earlier this year and so they kind of were brought up against allegations and I don't know it's they're denying that they did anything wrong but it's kind of like that's kind of weird that you would lay all those people off after they did this. Well there's a lot of people talking about how difficult and demanding the industry can be sometimes. I mean you really have to love video games because especially during you know some real crunch periods you know people work these crazy long days and I'm sure you all have heard of this you know coming out of the EA and some of the stuff here. Now this studio if I'm not mistaken they're in Germany so I mean now it has that complexity of you know I know what the laws are like here in America but I don't know what it's like in Germany. It's hard to say is it because of the union that they were laid off or is it because of the development cycle that they were laid off? Yeah. Yeah and who knows so there's a lot of those questions to answer but I think I think it definitely goes to show that there's some people that get so frustrated maybe with some of the the because sometimes these crimes and I'm saying sometimes sometimes these crunch periods are a result of bad decisions right bad decision is made up top and that trickles down and everybody else has to pay for it right. Yeah. So that's why sometimes these these unions and things are are being formed is to kind of like I guess make those higher up a little more accountable for the decisions they make and the trickle that that could have but again you throw the international complexity into it I'm not really sure how that all works out but very interesting. Alright. Do you want to talk about Minecraft as well before we get to Sure. So Minecraft got a console update and they're saying it's the biggest one yet. Brings the game up to version 1.88 and adds a bunch of new things new biomes including Mesa, Mega, Tiaga Roofed Forest, Birch Forest Savannah, Extreme Hills plus Deep Ocean and Snowless Tyga and see there's new mobs including the endermite guardian, elder guardian rabbits and chicken jockeys like I seriously I was looking through my son's book he has a Minecraft book that talks about like some of the enemies and I'm like I don't know who the fuck these characters are like this wasn't when I was playing so go back to the PC version other things, new blocks including granite, packed ice, red sandstone, diorite prismarine also you can catch treasure while fishing the buttons can be placed on top of or on the tops and bottoms of blocks skeletons flee from wolves and spiders no longer see through solid blocks and that's coming to PlayStation Xbox players no Wii U update yet of course alright well I guess I'll have to jump back in I have the PlayStation version of Minecraft so I'll check that out we should do that again cause I like kinda I keep talking to my son about like how we used to play on the server and stuff and it you know it's a lot more funny when you have more people playing it is, it is do you have it on PlayStation 4? we could just do a little I do have it on PlayStation 4 I have it on PlayStation 4 and on Wii U and Xbox 360 and Windows 10 my phone on my iPod yeah pretty much everywhere oh and I thought I was bad at buying the same game multiple places your Minecraft collection puts my Mass Effect 3 collection to shame alright well Valve a lot of people rumbling about the upcoming Steam sale right seems like it's inevitable we got a winter sale coming pretty soon and you know a lot of people usually praise Steam and all that they do but interesting Steam's taken a few hits this year and another one on its way is that Valve is being sued in the country of France not here in the States but still we like to cover news everywhere and that is they're being sued in France by and I'm gonna horribly mispronounce this name I'm sorry it's UFC K I have no idea how to pronounce that I'm sorry because I do not speak French but that is a French Consumer Association that's what you need to know it's French Consumer Association and they put out a new letter and said that the Steam subscriber agreement contains clauses which are detrimental to consumer interests apparently it all comes down to the fact that users cannot resell their digital games and that's something that French law allows for and we've talked about this on the show before is that whole controversy about being able to sell a digital game and what's interesting is that the Steam storefront is kind of set up for that right like because you can put games in your inventory but the used thing you can't really do it you can do it with a new game that you haven't installed and played yet but you can't really do it with a used game and I guess the French Association taking some issue with that also though it isn't just limited to that some other things cited is that Valve does not assume responsibility in cases where accounts get hacked and users personal information gets stolen and that is also can be said for how the company claims ownership of any user created content that is uploaded to Steam now apparently Valve they use Luxembourg's consumer law in all countries it operates in so that way they don't take into account each countries different rules but it should be noted that Valve was already sued once in a German court by a German consumer group a couple years ago probably when some of these stories first came up about the whole used games digital stuff Valve actually won that case but that was in 2014 and this is another country so we'll see what happens with that that could really change things if folks are able to resell their digital games I mean all of a sudden your library man people are going to be unloading games in their library for like 25 cents a pop I mean it's going to be very interesting I don't know I've always hesitated buying digital games I mean it's one thing on Steam when they unload games for you know 99 cents or like $3.99 for a little game it makes it very easy to buy that digitally because whatever equity you feel like you'd have in that game would be literally dollars and cents but it's a little harder sometimes to spend $60 on a game you're not sure about digitally because you know you're going to get stuck with that game if you don't really like it but if you have it on disc you can at least resell it your game has some equity it has some value in it it'll be very interesting to see how that could really change the market I worry for smaller indie developers that really rely on Steam that might not have the best effect yeah it's going to be kind of hard to do that yeah so I kind of worry for them but I definitely get people's frustration with the AAA side of things like what was it Batman Arkham Knight right was a shit show on Steam and you know they kind of had to eat a lot of crap for it and they were charging what $60 for that right so if people wanted to get rid of that there's a part of me that kind of thinks they should well Steam did enact that whole refund thing I think to try to account for some of that but I don't know I feel a little differently when it comes to a big big Warner Brothers $60 game like that and then like you know for example's sake the game we were talking about earlier tonight Super Slam Dunk Touchdown you know I don't know if I feel like you know we heard it's one guy that's doing most of this I mean you get some contract help and so forth that I would kind of feel bad if maybe the value of his game gets undercut by this all of a sudden emerging used game market right yeah so it'll be really interesting to see how this plays out I don't know so alright but I'm not a lawyer so I don't know at the end of the day we're going to get to the mailbag you guys it's time to open up the mailbag where you guys participate with us every week over at participate at orange lounge trader dot com if you want to send us an email that is participate at orange lounge radio dot com I'm logging into the mailbag now because usually Dark Soccer will dive into the mailbag and read some mail for you guys but as you all heard a minute ago she had to leave early so it's just me tonight so I'm going to get to the emails we have three of them tonight starting off with this one this is from Robert M who says here's two quick questions and a longer hopefully cool thing from Halloween yes the email is from this week first I don't know if the comic story line will affect Captain America Civil War and the MCU Marvel Cinematic Universe but if Falcon takes over the role of Captain from Rogers will he be Captain Fal no that's a dumb question actually can Captain America fly now or did that not happen in Ultimate Marvel I do not follow comics at all I hate to say it by the way I really want a comic show on VOG Network I'm just putting it out there I've been wanting one for years so if you know a long running show that's interested in joining up with some of us I would love that because this is where I would ask them help because I have no idea John picks up a lot of that slack so does Brad from Pod Culture but I would love some comic experts in here Loki do you follow any of that stuff no Brad from Pod Culture is filling in a little bit here saying Falcon became Captain and flies so that's how that works and I do know from what I remember in the new movie trailer you do see Falcon in it so who knows where the Marvel Cinematic Universe will go with that anyhow second have any of you including Bobby gotten to see the Gear VR yet sorry if that was already discussed well funny enough Jamie talked about her experiences earlier in the show Bobby owns one I know that because he's the one that showed the Gear VR to me and so yeah I've used Gear VR funny enough I didn't play any games in Gear VR the stuff I saw was like experiences I saw like a Cirque du Soleil thing and like a Paul McCartney concert and I know I've talked about this on the show before you'll want to go back to February of this year when I was at PAX East that was the week I got to play the Gear VR Loki did you end up getting one of these? I haven't bought one though because it's $100 and I don't use my Oculus well I didn't use my Oculus because it runs like shit on my laptop which is fine because it's not meant to run on my laptop I haven't had the money to build a new computer yet to run the Oculus and then of course I'll probably just buy the actual retail one but my phone's nice and should be able to run well it does run the Gear VR stuff so I just maybe eventually I don't know I have to see what they have on it and like maybe if I develop stuff for it that's a ways away so I'm holding out right now and let's see going to the last little bit of the email here from Robert M and finally I thought I'd share two months after slapping this together I built a nearly two foot tall figure for Halloween using Lego's Hero Factory or Bionicle building system I figured I wanted to try building a large scale character since I would certainly give it a cartoon animal design and I was sure the holo disproportionate robotic thing would invite the obvious comparisons I just went ahead and ran with it building for my parts bins in maybe two hours total in the end my brother didn't let me bring it to his house for his party fearing his three year old would tear it apart I considered building the white one for that reason it doesn't look that much like the in game model but it's effective for what it is and it actually stands up by itself although it's too top heavy for say a running pose now Robert M doesn't name what it is here in the email but he attached some pictures and you can actually see it's one of the characters from Five Nights at Freddy's I believe this is Foxy this is the guy that's behind the curtain there it's definitely yeah it's definitely the red Foxy character there it looks like an like a cyborg version of that and the way the eye hangs out is really creepy and yeah I would not want to see that in Five Nights at Freddy's or really probably real life so well done if you were going for scary so anyhow Robert M signs the email and then concludes saying PS do you have the public photo pool for OLR active no Robert we actually took that down on the old website a few years ago it was being abused and we didn't have a way to really effectively screen the photos that were going through there and it wasn't really emails like this are so few and far between that unfortunately it wasn't really enhancing the experience I think Twitter kind of took over now people just share their stuff on Twitter and we can kind of retweet and so forth so unfortunately the photo archive kind of kind of met its maker there but the old website in general is really in need of a boost and Jason and I have talked about that we really need to draw Dekeman into that too and see what we can come up with in the new year but we are it's kind of tricky where I'm at because at the same time I really want to make sure VOG has a lot of stuff and obviously we could always use more content for VOG so a lot of my focus kind of goes over there so Orangeloungeradio.com kind of becomes that's the place where the podcast is hosted and it works so don't upgrade the Skype version over there so it doesn't break so anyhow there it is that's our email tonight from Robert M let's go to the next email here from Raginator who's been emailing us an awful lot because as you know he can't participate live with the show if you've been following his emails so let's get on to the next and DarkTitsu is saying I know Dekeman's got a lot of family stuff going on so there's that oh yeah obviously and that stuff comes from please I don't I don't make money doing OLR so I can't pay people so yeah I am beggars can't be choosers I can only take help when people are able to help but I appreciate all help moving on to Raginator's email hi everyone it's Raginator again as per usual I'm writing in I have two topics for you the first is short but the second is a little long so I apologize for those that haven't noticed yet Humble Bundle is having a Neo Geo bundle going on thank you for reminding me I do have to get it by the time OLR airs and this email is read there'll be about a day and a half to two days left to jump on it but nonetheless I want to pass along the info all in all there's 25 or so games in the bundle which a few of them can be redeemed on Steam the rest are DRM free there's a few noteworthy games in there amongst them are Samurai Showdown 2 and 5, Art of Fighting 2, 2 or 3 King of Fighter games and Metal Slug 1 through 3 and X in my opinion it's a good deal even for the Samurai Showdown games alone seeing as they're not on Steam so yes that is a good FYI because we missed last week's show and a chance to bring that up but it's just running in an emulator you're buying ROMs basically you are buying ROMs but at least you're doing it legally right and some of it's on Steam so you have all that built in or whatever is there achievements or no? Not in the ROMs obviously but there's looks like the ones on Steam would be Metal Slug 1 and 3 and then they also have the King of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match Final Edition and... Is Fatal Fury Special in there? That's one of my very favorites Metal Slug X and the King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match Fatal Fury Special you said? Yeah that's my favorite Fatal Fury Special is one of the DRM free ones Alright Act Deft in our chat room talking about there's some controversy there about the ROMs and the emulator that .EMU uses for the games he says he might call in about that later I am behind on this news if that all must come up while I was out of town so I'm very curious to hear what's going on there I did hear it didn't come up on tonight's show but I did hear something and maybe somebody in chat or Loki even maybe you know about this remember a couple weeks ago we were talking about the whole Bubsy coming back in the 1 and 2 Yeah that's basically S.N.E.X Oh my god yeah I heard that was basically an emulator and those ROMs and that the people putting it up there weren't even authorized to do it right? I thought I heard that? They said they got the permission but I don't know if that's legitimate Oh man that's crazy and see that's another thing Steam's taken some real hits left and right this year because that would be another thing that's going to make them look silly Like I said I watch a lot of Jim Sterling and stuff and he reviews a lot of really shitty or doesn't review but plays a lot of really shitty Steam games and there's some though that are fucking ridiculous to have copyrighted shit in them that fucking just get through the Greenlight process and get put up there as legit games like they have Gabe Newell's simulator and it's like it's an absolute shit game and there's it's just people just send this stuff through and it's just cluttering up the fucking Steam store Very curious about that now just I heard that somewhere I don't know that to be true so I just want to put that out there and in fact I just did a news search and I'm not seeing anything about it but I swear to god I heard something out there this week about that whole thing so the Bubsy thing was not as not as A plus so I just allegedly covering my own ass there Alright let's get to Rage Nator's second topic here Only kinda sorta tangently gaming related alright I guess we'll allow it Hoping for your input nonetheless See I'm the oldest of four siblings and my sister two years my junior along with my one brother four years my junior for the past two months have repeatedly offered to loan me some money to get me a new PC I refuse for two reasons One being that when they do something out of the kindness of their hearts strings are always attached this time being no different Secondly my sister isn't in a position to loan or give out money due to her own finances living in a very expensive area of Alberta Canada owing way more on her mortgage I feel like this is personal stuff I don't want to read on air I told her specifically that her kids need to come first and at least with the strings attached aspect they told me if they were going to loan me the money I was to get the computer that they wanted me to have a low end Dell that I wouldn't run all my games and I'd be stuck with a PC I couldn't use and a debt that I'd have to repay My brother seemed to have dropped the subject albeit in a huff a month ago but my sister apparently didn't and tried to be slick She told me on 12-9 that she sent me via UPS a $200 Target card to be used on a computer and that I needed to be home the next day to accept it That despite the fact I asked her not to do it plus I already had plans that day due to doctors appointments I couldn't be home all day waiting on UPS Anyway I was forced to reschedule my appointment then when UPS did show up I refused delivery Of course 20 minutes later my sister calls me in a huff and we had a massive argument We're not talking. What's your points regarding this? Wow this is this is the OLR therapy moment here You guys need to sit down and have a nice long talk about this. I think that's very nice that your family wants to do that and I think you should acknowledge it at such and say I think it's very nice that you want to do this but I really want to be able to do this on my own terms and build the system that I want to do so thank you but no thank you and I think that has to be that and if for whatever reason they can't hear that then I would kind of wonder why they can't respect your wishes that you want to go through that process of saving the money that you want to do and build the system that you want. Now granted there's three sides to every story your side, their side, and the truth so I'm only able to really say this based on what I'm reading in this email I would just say you're not really under any obligation to accept a gift but at the same time you should probably acknowledge that hey somebody wants to do something nice for me and that's a good thing but this whole thing about the whole I bought you a card and you need to be at home and all that stuff that's a little weird but the fact that you refuse delivery you could have accepted the card and then taken her the card and said you know I appreciate this but I'm going to give it back to you it might have been a little easier way to do it without starting a whole fight there but anyway would you care to suggest anything to that Loki I did not realize we were going to be playing therapy on OLR in that email but that's alright I hope you guys can work it out, it's the holidays it's the freaking holidays hug it out alright one more email here from YYR Hello OLR feverishly working on diagrams for my provisional patent application if that sounds boring it's because it is ugh I'm fascinated that you're going through your patent application I would like to hear more about that process someday seated to my right however is Amy and she is not bored because she is playing Ori in the Blind Forest I don't know how I missed this game when it came out months back but I took a gamble on it grabbing it for $10 on the Black Friday sale knowing absolutely nothing about it fast forward a bit and I can honestly say it's a game I feel I have a responsibility to recommend to almost everyone specifically if you like Metroidvania style games at all and have an Xbox One you need to buy this the controls are perfect the gameplay is just as addictive as it is in the best games in that genre and the graphics well as far as games with 2D gameplay and 3D graphics go I've never seen one so beautiful the music is fantastic too and some of the power ups are really inventive and fun to use it's not a super long game so it won't take you away from your other bigger games for more than a few days the chance is high that it will go on sale again when the big Xbox sale begins in a few days very possibly to the $10 I got it for but quite honestly I'd pay the full $20 for it it is that good and if you buy it over the next few days it will be on your best game of the year list Rob I'm looking at you and possibly winking um surprise YYR I actually bought that game already I bought it in a sale I don't think it was Black Friday sale but they did some other random sale it was either at the end of summer or um beginning of fall I don't remember there was maybe Labor Day sale or something and uh Codeman was telling me what a great game that was and I heard it was Metroidvania so I actually checked it out and I did really enjoy it admittedly I did not spend enough time with it because you know it kind of fell in that avalanche of games that's coming out in the fall but um I do want to go back and spend some more time with it because I also agree it's a real gorgeous game and you know I love me some Metroidvania uh the game really ramps up in difficulty fast though from what I remember like I remember I was like playing in the beginning I'm like oh this is easy this is easy and then like just kidding so um yeah there is that but yeah I've already checked that out YYR but uh I'm sure the listeners still appreciate uh a little uh plug and so forth uh have you checked that out Loki the Ori and the Blind Forest? Um no I have not you'll have to keep an eye out for that on the Steam sale because I I agree with YYR it's almost certain to show up on Steam sale or Xbox One or one of those so alright uh and uh lastly hope you guys and all the listeners have a Supra Ultra Hyper Mega Merry Christmas Championship Edition Turbo 3 Happy Holidays YYR or Aaron thank you so much YYR really appreciate that and you know what I did get by the way your message about the um multitasking game right in the middle of GamerX so I have not had a chance to sit down and play that yet uh but you emailing us reminded me I really need to do that tonight after the show so uh love that and Dark Tetsuya says YYR should work for Capcom and Orange Wright uh adding something that you forgot for matching service Bob Coffee saying Alpha means that as well alright uh there you go that's the emails for tonight participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to send us an email in a future week and we uh encourage you to do so meanwhile it's time to get to the FUs of the week we're gonna get a little mad around here because well we do Loki um I guess I don't know FU2 not knowing um what my ship is gonna be next year because I'm trying to trade ships with other employees but I'm waiting for their managers to approve it it's supposed to be within a five day time frame but no one is getting back to me yay or nay I hate it when like if they're not gonna approve something just say listen we're not gonna approve it or you know listen they've decided not to go with your ship trade just let me know either way you know don't leave me in limbo alright um my FU of the week uh things have been going pretty well I uh I've had a pretty good weekend there's not a lot I can give an FU to um I would say um um oh FU to the computer problems I've been having tonight FU to Skype FU to Skype fucking breaking my computer with the updates and I really don't know how I'm gonna fix it I'm gonna have to do some type of like deep clean where I go in and remove every single Skype file I don't even really know how to do that but that's time this week I didn't want to have to spend and now I'm gonna but I'm doing it for you guys so we can make sure we continue the calls here on OLR cause having a listener interaction here on OLR is very important and I would never say FU to that so I will work to fix Skype even if that means updating the computer because honestly the show computer hasn't been upgraded since when did I throw the DevaFit that was when I was living with John that was a while ago that was um the DevaFit was in the garage that would have had to have been what 2009 2009? so this no I'm losing track in my head I want to say it was maybe like 2009 when that happened maybe a little earlier even like 2008 so getting old I know right I can't remember years well no I said the computer's getting old even those power supplies don't last that long yeah so it might be time to sub out a few parts maybe the power supply for sure and I don't know maybe try to put some more RAM or even another chip in there and just see if I can boost it to where it can run Windows 7 or something and some of the more modern stuff but you know more RAM I am I am such the type that's like I don't want to fix what's not broken but now it's breaking so it never works correctly just like stupid Unity and fucking Windows 8 and now Windows 10 doesn't it's like for no reason it just stops working no one has the answer to why this isn't working it's just eh fuck it Unity 5 no not gonna work yeah uh TigerCon chat says I remember the time OLR's computer went down after the video card died that's when this computer came in because and that was you guys and I gotta say that is one of I I I I rendered speechless quite often on this show I must say by the generosity of the listeners and so far cause you know we don't we don't ask for money or anything like that but you guys banded together and bought fucking computer parts and so this computer we're using is a listener donated computer so there's also a tiny part of me there's a tiny part of me that wants to make it last as long as possible but I'm in a much better place finance not that I'm like rolling in money but I'm in a better place I'm certainly not but I'm in a better place financially now than I was six years ago so if I have to kick down a little bit of money to buy a new chip or some RAM or a new power supply or whatever I don't mind we'll we'll make it work so alright uh anyhow let's uh let's move on we got a few more stories for you guys then we're gonna try to open up the Skype line but I'm gonna warn you guys it's gonna be a little wonky tonight so we'll do our best uh try to at least get some calls in here so let's get to Loki so now they've added one on one rival battles for Guitar Hero TV that's of course part of Guitar Hero Live and um I guess you'll be able to once you've hit level 10 you'll be put against other similarly skilled uh players on one on one battles and they said that twice during every 30 minute slot on Guitar Hero TV channel um you'll find another player I guess and then the winner of the challenge will receive an extra uh 100 XP I don't get this game anymore I still need to get it I keep saying I'm gonna get it and then I uh I don't so I need to pick that up cause uh um it was a lot of fun to play in the demo and so forth and I have to admit I was not expecting that out of Guitar Hero so uh I didn't drop all the money for it day one but uh uh I want to check this out so too many games and not enough time that's right isn't that isn't that it and you know we all have to hold down day jobs so we don't get to I don't have time to play games unfortunately well I end up staying up till one in the morning every day to play games and get my nice five hours of sleep we try though we do the best we can cause we love games although for some stupid reason I can make tons of time for fucking ingress which is retarded ingress is a game it's just a different type of game it's a social game it's a chore it's like a farm I went to an ingress party that had nothing to do with playing the game I was just hanging out with some of the people this week oh I don't know who any of the people are I mean I've met them I gotta meet introduce some more of them just some really fun people to play alright uh anyhow let's move on one more story for you guys also about music games and this one is about Rock Band 4 which I finally imported my Rock Band 3 songs over the weekend so I have that to look forward to playing all those games but one thing I'm not gonna get to do is play them online cause Harmonics said this week we're not sure yet where online multiplayer fits in our roadmap now Harmonics is saying that online multiplayer is very much on the table for Rock Band 4 but they don't know exactly where that fits in on the Harmonics blog David Sussman said online multiplayer is a part of a much bigger conversation we know it's at the top of a lot of people's want list online play with Rock Band is a big deal given the amount of different combinations of player 4 potential instruments, different difficulties song affinities between players and so forth there's a ton of testing necessary as well as technical back end to work through in order to provide a fun stable experience for any future development especially features that have existed in our legacy Rock Band games we want to be able to improve and refine wherever possible in the case of online play we have a lot of critical feedback on the Rock Band 3 design that we'd love to be able to address. Adding this functionality is very much on the table but we're not sure yet where it fits in our roadmap part of our process includes taking your advice into consideration before it can deliver a feature as complex as online multiplayer we would like to better understand what you want and find to be important blah blah blah we're gonna send out a survey about online play shortly blah blah blah fill it out now dark to see you in chat saying I don't get there hold up I mean didn't the previous games have online multi maybe I'm wrong I've really only played a little bit of 3 offline 2 and 3 both had it and I think that's why a lot of people are confused because it's adding into that whole perception that Rock Band 4 was a step backwards for the game I just don't let's just call it what it is it was fucking rushed out seriously it shouldn't be it's on our table of stuff that we're gonna add into the game that's just features it should've been fucking if it's not done it's not done don't release the game don't just put it out there because oh we need to get those sales in but here's the double edged sword with that I think Harmonix is in a tricky position especially because you know let's not forget Rock Band 3 had that EA money and it had that MTV money so I think in a way Harmonix had to get the game out there to fund the game they really wanted to make I realize that's not what you want to hear nobody wants to hear that but that's what's happening you know it's just like you know with Kinect and stuff well Kinect's gonna do all these fantastic things except it can't but Kinect 2.0 will but it can't but Kinect 3.0 it's like no I'm not gonna buy that alright we are to the point of this show where we're gonna open up the Skype line over at 1877 game OLR or actually I don't think the toll free number is working right now I think I enabled something that now because I can't log in on the desktop I can't undo that so I am just gonna give out our regular Skype which is Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype I'm gonna warn you guys we're doing this a little differently tonight so I don't know how this is gonna go but fuck it we'll do it live so if you wanna give us a call go ahead Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype the Skype line is open now if you do have general questions of course you can always yell those out in chat if you don't want to actually call in you can always give us the questions in the chat room I would usually use tweets to fill time but my phone is now dedicated to the Skype line tonight which we are getting a call coming in on the Skype line so I'm gonna try and get to it right now Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this? Legend of Zaku here Hey Zaku how you doing? Yeah it's been a long yeah it's been like ages I know I've been sacking off on this OLR thing Well welcome back we missed you what's on your mind? Nothing much other than well in about a minute my birthday's coming up Well happy birthday you're a holiday baby Yeah that too and you know essentially right now kind of in the midst of trying to switch over on FSX to the Steam edition which is gonna be fun and hopefully they'll get me onto Windows 10 Other than that it's like I guess going on that whole Rock Band multiplayer thing I guess you know you're right at some point Harmonix wants to avoid something known as Scope Creep where because it's like because of the actual requirements and the fact that they need to hit a hard deadline they have to forgo certain features even if they were standard and I guess the fact that they have to position themselves as trying to contrast against Guitar Hero Live which for all intents and purposes I hear didn't do as great as Rock Band 4 And you know what's interesting about that whole thing is I bet the history of the franchise really played into that because I have to be brutally honest as unfair and as it might sound of me I kind of judged Guitar Hero Live based on the prior Guitar Hero games and I probably shouldn't have done that I think as they were released I can't believe I'm going to say this I kind of think Guitar Hero was the better game out of the box and I kind of made a mistake choosing Rock Band 4 based on all these other promises I don't know it's weird it's a really weird situation for me but the reality is there's only so many fucking plastic instruments I'm willing to have and Guitar Hero took a huge risk changing not only where the instruments can't really be used but they really changed the formula with the whole six buttons I mean you couldn't even use the old ones if you wanted to so unfortunately the risk isn't paying off and I almost feel bad because that's twice now that developer's kind of gotten screwed for problems that aren't really theirs because that was the developer of DJ Hero horrifically underrated game and now they've got Guitar Hero Live which also is kind of underrated and I feel bad, I'm part of the problem Right and I guess in Harmonic's case to their benefit by focusing more on getting the install based compatibility at the expense of online multiplayer bringing it back to the core mechanics of actually having to go to someone's place to play Rock Band, bring back that experience I guess that was more important to them and you know as I said this is a stepping stone provided that they make enough money that they could probably just add, they could probably patch this in a later update. Remember you gotta keep in mind that Harmonic's for all intents and purposes would most likely release one version of that Rock Band franchise for that platform's entire lifespan meaning that because you could actually patch in features it shouldn't you know adding online multiplayer isn't like world ending in that sense because remember they see it as a platform and not necessarily a release Right and you know I'm trying to be fair to Harmonic's and you know I think I kind of said what I said about the fact that you know they're in a different position now than they were a couple of years ago but the reality is niceness and understanding only goes so far when you're asking for $100 of my money true but at the same token it could have been worse like Guitar Hero Live you had like almost zero songs from the original the previous releases carrying over like you're talking about people who spent upwards of at least a thousand bucks on Rock Band DLC alone in almost a decade that it's been ever since the first release so that's a hell of a longevity in terms of DLC literally carrying from one generation to another Well at least Guitar Hero is doing something a little different with the whole streaming thing but I get your point I mean I understand that you know Guitar Hero and maybe that's part of the reason Guitar Hero also took a hit in sales is that they didn't promise that backwards compatibility so to speak that Rock Band did and I think that's one reason a lot of people were jazzed about Rock Band and that would completely explain why Harmonic's had to cut certain features out because obviously making the hard deadlines a lot more important but I think this is important Harmonic still has not fully met that promise it took them a month to do it for Rock Band 3 we still do not have original Rock Band, Rock Band 2 Rock Band Lego there's still a lot of stuff missing and I don't think that's okay I don't think that was okay for them to misrepresent that there's really no nice way for me to put it I feel it was really misrepresented when they announced it is that they're gonna bring all that stuff out but not day one well as I said this is welcome to the world of licensing where now the lawyers have to play have to basically negotiate they're basically negotiating with the music industry well negotiate it before you announce it true yeah you usually don't announce it until the ink is dry but you know now they're pretty much caught right there you know they're exposed in that if for some reason certain Rock Band tracks unless they've specifically stated that certain tracks may not make it make it over to Rock Band 4 as a disclaimer they're pretty much caught in the sense that you know there were the only thing they have is their word and if their word doesn't deliver on the you know thousand plus dollars worth of DLC certain Rock Band you know last gen Rock Band owners have then yeah you know it would suck to spend all that money and all of it getting left behind as a result because harmonics basically you know they basically jumped the gun a bit too early in terms of trying to handle that transition but that pretty much could break the entire music rhythm genre for consoles in general unfortunately I think I mean you're right and that's the really sad thing especially having been fans of music games for so long is that if both these games tank there's not gonna be rhythm games for a good well I shouldn't say that there will be rhythm games and it's gonna be indie and that's gonna be awesome but the day of the plastic instruments is dead yeah and this is where like an arcade would you know Japan probably being the last bastion of rhythm gaming or that area around the Pacific Rim but yeah you're right well unless but I mean for those that follow Kyle Ward on Facebook something's up so we'll have to get in touch with him later to get more insight on that I don't know I don't want to comment on somebody's Facebook but I think all that stuff is public so it's not like it's not out there but very interesting stuff I heard I know he went to Japan past couple of weeks you know Grant that was in Peru just like following him there's a video we're seeing if you haven't seen it yet where he's definitely dancing on an 8 arrow mat you've never seen it before oh wait I think I get it now I think I may have saw that in my feed an 8 arrow oh Jesus so anyway that means he's probably unless he worked on something with Konami that would have to explain his meetings out there who knows who knows anyway I don't wanna I gotta watch how far I go down that we'll let him on the show when he wants to talk about that but anyway Zaku we'll let you go for now alright take care buddy thanks for calling bye have a good one you too alright that is Zaku there sorry you're gonna get Skype noises tonight on the show since we have to have this whole little rig here with my iPhone and all that stuff 1877 Game OLR or username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio if you wanna give us a call and I don't know why I gave out that 800 number cause welp it doesn't work tonight but we are getting oh I'm sorry Skype noise is coming through hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this hey this is Akdeaf hey Akdeaf buddy what's on your mind tonight well like I taste with Reginator's email oh okay yeah I'm gonna talk about the Neo Geo Humble Bundle oh yes you were commenting in chat about the whole controversy around the emulators what's going on yeah basically nobody knows because it kind of was it did get some coverage but it wasn't like really big but basically on the day that Humble got released a friend of mine a really close friend of mine called FoxHack on Twitter found some really interesting details about the where they got the ROMs for the games so basically those ROMs came from torrents pirates torrents of those games and you can find them on the code they have and also a really big issue that also came from that is that the emulator at first was thought that it was like an illegal one at least for for in this case .emu to use so basically after a day the day after it happened basically .emu came out and replied to my friend here that the emulator was gotten or was acquired by GameTap I think and they have a legal use of it but some other details appeared on this I'm gonna pretty much quote something I have on the sorry on the website I have here some thread basically on name world so if I'm following correctly just to make sure because there's a lot of moving parts here if I'm understanding this correctly the pirated ROMs Neo Geo grabbed them and ended up turning around and selling them which I have to admit is kind of some funny irony and honestly it's kind of like one of those well I don't this is gonna sound crazy I don't see the problem in that turnabouts fair play this is not necessarily the problem that they got the ROM from an illegal torrent it's more the hold on because Act F is gonna have a hard time hold on Act F they're gonna sue themselves what seriously it's like there's no way that whoever illegally put those up there is gonna have any recourse those are our files but I think this is where you're going Act F the problem is the emulator because the emulator technically is nothing that's not technically illegal I know a lot of people use them for illegal purposes but yeah if you include the emulator you didn't pay for that well that's not irony somebody did program that for homebrew stuff and who knows what that's a little bit of a different territory than the ROMs themselves yeah basically the ROMs are not the problem here it's more like they're pretty much lazy and .emu has a really bad history on laziness doing ports and stuff but that's not the issue here the issue here is the emulator and I'm gonna post a post here on this thread that I linked on on the chat the problem is Nebula uses the main FM cores, Nebula being the emulator they use which even to this day we haven't got Jarek a person who programmed the emulator to relicense for commercial use it's one of the biggest sticking blocks for relicense efforts so unless Alsemi another programmer there specifically rewrote them for this then it can simply it can be legal there's other main codes in Nebula too so it's not really clear cut as they make out Nebula definitely uses main FM cores and some of the main bits I don't recall so it probably wasn't legal for GameTap to use it and it's likely not for .emu either unless they replaced all of it so a reply from that says from Alsemi himself one of the programmers I can hardly remember who wrote them it was many years ago but GameTap had their own FM 68K and C80 cores that they plugged into Street Nebula core and integrated them in their platform I just provided the code and I was able to redistribute only the code written by me, Alsemi and assistance on how to plug the other cores into their frontend so to try and simplify this for listeners who might have a hard time following all this drama especially with all these internal names of emulators and so forth I get the sense what's happening is that MAME which of course is the multi arcade machine emulator, very popular multi arcade machine emulator if I'm not mistaken it's open source part of open source is that the source goes out there but you don't have the right to resell it am I correct? basically and so essentially if you're taking these MAME pieces and putting it in your Neo Geo emulator that I guess is being used on the Steam platform they're essentially selling MAME and I'm really oversimplifying it but they're essentially selling those MAME parts which is illegal correct? so that's kind of it although if GameTap in this case, sorry, DotEmu says they got those licenses from GameTap which they acquired them legally so there's not a big problem here but it's kind of shady because they didn't came through at first with this and it's still not clear where they got at least in this case GameTap how they got the code or at least how they they were selling those ROMs and enablers well realistically I mean I could see it one of two ways I could see that they just put the MAME code in there because they were probably like fuck it it's our game we'll do what we want and I realize that's not what you're supposed to do that could be but I could also see that they could have contacted GameTap to get that code because I mean GameTap is it's not with Turner anymore they sold that years ago to an overseas company they probably were able to get they probably emailed somebody at GameTap yo do you still have this code could we pay you like pennies for this code and GameTap was like oh yeah sure we don't have anything else going on I mean they could probably got that GameTap code for pennies I mean so but I don't know but this guy here does say that he gave the code written by him and assistance on the other course so I don't know maybe they were able to get the GameTap stuff but we don't know and I don't think they're gonna exactly be saying it I guess we should be happy I don't know to try and put a positive spin on this even though I don't know there is one it is being sold on Humble Bundle which a lot of that goes to charity anyway so yeah that's something that a lot of people did when they heard the story break and when they read my friend's Twitter most people they did want the game so they they gave all the money to charity so at least something good came of it so yeah at least there's that but very interesting I had no idea that that was the drama but essentially it is that the mame is basically being resold potentially and I can see where that's ruffling a lot of feathers thank you for the insight ActDeaf I'll make sure that the money goes to charity when I pick it up sure alright well take care of my friend I'm gonna let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call ok? hey thanks for coming on take care alright there it is one more call there and we're gonna try to open it up for one more call to squeeze in 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us a call I don't know why I keep giving out the phone number because I just said it didn't work but when you say one thing for hundreds and hundreds of episodes it's pretty hard to get it out of your vocabulary Loki any last minute things you're pulling up there while we're waiting for one more call potentially here? just the HTC Vive has gotten some sort of improvements and because of that I want to say that it was going to be pushed from to April 2016 as far as the release date and they're going to be showing offset improvements at CES interesting alright one last shout out for calls Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype it looks like it's working that's the good news the only downside is I'm getting some of the Skype noises there as I have to unmute and mute the cell phone feed from the mixing board but that also means I can play stuff from my iPhone right there into the mixing board that's kind of fun do you want to play some Flappy Bird? have some Flappy Bird sounds? want to do Ingress? well I'm dumping my keys out of my capsules because I had to put them all in there when I was doing that fielding which by the way it made checkpoints so that's good hey congrats that's great did you go up on the leaderboards? 31 nice make 100 slots available so I can give you some gear when the show's over oh I've got tons hook you up! let's see I guess that's it we're not getting any other calls so I guess we're well after 9 o'clock anyway so I think I'll go ahead and close up the Skype line there and thank you guys who did get in and if you didn't get in you can always email the show participate at orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send us an email I'm very sorry I didn't get to the tweets tonight but my phone was being taken up for something else so I'll try to get to those next week but that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio we're back weekly we will be here on Sunday I think many shows you listen to will be having the week off and they probably deserve it but since we already have taken several weeks off we're going to be here next week and the week after right on into 2016 and the 14th year of Orange Lounge Radio starting high school and going through that very awkward puberty phase that is going to be our 2016 here at Orange Lounge Radio maybe our voices will start changing we'll get a little deeper get a little deeper here on Orange Lounge Radio if you enjoyed the show please tell a friend or seven about the show help us spread the word we are the show where every gamer has a voice but if the voices aren't here then we can't let them out there so please spread the word tell a friend give us a five star review on a site like iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever it is that you heard about this program those reviews go an awful long way and we appreciate them all that's going to do it I want to thank Rick for being on the show tonight from Tipping Goat Games everybody check that out Super Slam Dunk Touchdown available on Steam thanks to him for being here and if you have an indie game you want to check out be sure to email us at Orange Lounge Radio participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I definitely want to showcase more hardworking indie developers as we get into 2016 I met a lot of great ones at GX and I hope to meet more at MAGFest and whatever shows I show up at in 2016 Dark Sakura had to leave early tonight but I'm sure if she had a final thought she'd say something like reject false icons we'll leave it at that but Loki how about you what's your final thought tonight as we head on out for the night at least it's a short week it is I was going to try to get my game done this year but I don't think it's going to happen you only got a week and a half left I've been trying to work on it but I've just been mentally exhausted so I actually have been working out very slowly like maybe a minute or two at a time because like I literally come home brain dead and between calls I don't have enough time to like shift focus like that so it's been a rough year in some ways I mean I was going through a lot personally especially in the first half of the year like you guys know how long some things were taken to get done and a lot of that I kind of blame on some of my personal life circumstance and that's getting better but you know I stay pretty busy with work and so forth so a lot of that like I wanted to do more streaming and more video production but it's just kind of slack this year I'm really hoping to kick that into gear next year so we'll see what happens so anyhow my final thought tonight is thank you for spending your holidays here with us at Orange Laundry radio and I am so appreciative of the time that you spend to take to listen to our show and it was great to meet some of you over at GX and I hope to meet many more of you as 2016 moves on have a great holiday stay safe and yeah those of you like that are fighting like that email we had tonight just try to work it out if you can for the holidays that's what the holidays are really all about that and so much candy that you go into a coma enjoy the steam sale and the Xbox sale and the Playstation sale they're coming try not to binge on too many games this week but enjoy it happy gaming have a great holiday everybody we'll see you in seven days to join us for a live show tune into fog network.com Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific 9 p.m. Eastern the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network
