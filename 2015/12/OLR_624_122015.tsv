7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Tonight, we interview Rick of Tippy Goat Games, makers of the Super Sports Smash Up title, Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.
19000	23000	We're back to get caught up on the last two weeks of gaming news, GamerX, your comments, and more.
23000	27000	And it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	47000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, tonight with episode number 624 of our show, December the 20th of 2015.
47000	52000	Our last show before the big, big holiday, right here in the midst of the holiday season.
52000	57000	So happy holidays to all of you guys out there, and to my co-hosts here in studio.
57000	61000	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E.
61000	65000	And joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
65000	66000	Hi.
66000	67000	Hello, how are you Jamie Summers?
67000	68000	Alright.
68000	69000	Alright.
69000	71000	Just, things happen.
71000	73000	Did we have a fun adventure last week?
73000	74000	We did.
74000	75000	We did.
75000	81000	We had a great fun adventure, and my feet are still arguing at me for those boots, but otherwise it was a great adventure.
81000	86000	Your cosplay looked great at the show, and I know that there's pictures of you around on the interwebs.
86000	88000	I'm on Unicorn Booty, which I laugh without to no end.
88000	90000	It's a pretty hilarious website name, isn't it?
90000	91000	It is.
91000	96000	There is actually, they have like one of the, you know like those standees you see as you're walking into like big events?
96000	99000	You know, you always see like the big wall with all the company logos, right?
99000	104000	So there was one outside of GamerX for that company, and it looked like a unicorn that was about to like kick your ass.
104000	110000	And I was like, I wanted to take a picture underneath it, like it was about to kick me in the face, but I didn't, I don't know.
110000	114000	I didn't want to hold up traffic so I could have my awkward photo, so it didn't end up happening.
114000	117000	Sorry. Well, they were stopping people to take pictures in front of that.
117000	118000	That's good.
118000	122000	Like I was going to look, and I feel bad because now I can't make my brain think of his name.
122000	123000	Uh-huh.
123000	126000	Josh? John? The Templar guy.
126000	127000	Mmm.
127000	128000	Who was Kayden.
128000	131000	I don't recall his name, but he looked great if he's out there listening.
131000	135000	Well, they got us together in front of the Unicorn Booty thing.
135000	141000	And now my, I'm so mad at myself because like, I can't think of like hardly anyone's name today.
141000	142000	That's okay.
142000	144000	It's okay, but I saw Star Wars and life is good.
144000	146000	Alright, fair enough.
146000	148000	Uh, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
148000	149000	Hi.
149000	150000	How are you doing, Loki?
150000	154000	Um, I enjoyed half that burger and then I'm not enjoying the other half of that burger.
154000	157000	Is your microphone on, Loki? Because I don't know if we're picking you up for some reason.
157000	158000	I am completely on.
158000	160000	Oh, you're just quiet tonight for some reason.
160000	161000	I am not completely quiet.
161000	162000	Alright, there you go.
162000	164000	You have levels problems.
164000	168000	We're having audio problems left and right in the studio tonight and I'll get into that in a minute.
168000	170000	I guess I'll just have to talk louder.
170000	172000	No, you're good. You're perfectly fine now.
172000	174000	I don't know, I don't know what the hell's going on.
174000	180000	For some reason, you're not looping back through the internal speakers like I'm used to, but you're picking up on the register so I know the audience can hear you.
180000	181000	Okay.
181000	182000	Oh my god.
182000	185000	If it's not one thing breaking in studio, it's another. I'll get to that in a minute.
185000	188000	But anyway, Loki, how has your couple weeks been?
188000	191000	You weren't able to go to the show, I know, but how was your week off?
191000	193000	Um, I don't remember what I did.
193000	198000	I think I played Fallout, maybe. Or maybe Ingress. Probably Ingress.
198000	199000	Probably a lot of Ingress.
199000	203000	I think a little bit of Ingress and then I stayed home for some of that.
203000	208000	You know, I was reading an article which didn't make our show roll tonight, but it was about Pokémon GO.
208000	212000	And there's some more information because there was an interview out there with Pokémon GO.
212000	221000	And I guess part of why the Pokémon company wanted to team up with Niantic, who are the makers of Ingress, to make Pokémon GO is that
221000	225000	the head of the Pokémon company is actually a high level Ingress player.
225000	229000	And the president of Niantic was like, he's a higher level player than I am.
229000	231000	So that kind of made me chuckle.
231000	234000	But from what I understand, Ingress is really big in Japan.
234000	241000	I don't know if that's true or just kind of something through the grapevine, but it kind of tells you why Pokémon GO.
242000	253000	I do think that is going to be quite the mobile game next year because it's going to be a mobile game very unlike the typical, I'm going to use my quotey fingers, mobile game.
253000	255000	Like it's not going to be Candy Crush.
255000	258000	I'll try it, I guess. I don't like Pokémon, though, so we'll see.
258000	259000	Maybe this will be it.
259000	260000	Eh.
260000	262000	This will be the first hit. I don't know.
262000	267000	Anyhow, we also want to welcome the ever-present fourth guest on our show, the chat room.
267000	272000	Hello to our chat room. We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
272000	276000	Live.vognetwork.com is where you can find our chat room.
276000	282000	And of course we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
282000	289000	We have folks in chat there saying, like, Dungeon Buster says, punch those audio problems with the dark side.
289000	294000	I almost, I was like this close to going to see Star Wars before the show.
295000	301000	But I had to cook, like, three things for my wife, and by that time I was like, I'm not going to make it there on time.
301000	307000	I'm going to miss the new Deadpool preview, and that's going to make me sad, so I decided not to.
307000	309000	Plus, I would have gotten here late.
309000	314000	It's all good. It's fine. I'm hoping to get out during the week at some point. We'll see.
314000	319000	SS2 and Hunter Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying nothing can silence Loki.
319000	323000	You know what? The systems in here have been trying tonight.
323000	328000	So real quick recap. First off, I want to say a big welcome to those of you.
328000	333000	We talked to a lot of people at GX3 or GamerX that stopped by the table.
333000	339000	So if there's any new listeners out there listening to OLR tonight who might have stopped by and said hi to us over at our table,
339000	346000	which could include, by the way, I had a conversation with podcasting with Trixie Mattel from RuPaul's Drag Race Season 7.
346000	349000	You missed that, Jamie, when Trixie came by the table.
349000	355000	But turns out Trixie listens to podcasts on her flights back and forth to different shows.
355000	359000	So shout out to Trixie if you're out there listening.
359000	362000	Hashtag justice for Trixie or whatever it was.
362000	369000	Anyway, so all that aside, we talked to a lot of people there at the expo, drag queens and non-drag queens.
369000	371000	Actually, a lot of non-drag queens.
371000	378000	And just talked about podcasting and everything that we have on the network with our variety of shows
378000	383000	and how we have shows about like Star Trek and World of Warcraft and movies and TVs.
383000	385000	And so I hope we got a few listeners from that.
385000	388000	So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lawns Radio, welcome.
388000	393000	We've been running, oh, golly, nonstop since 2002.
393000	398000	We started as an Internet radio program dedicated to dance dance revolution and music based video games
398000	404000	and kind of grew from that into all things video gaming because, of course, we were just fans of video games first.
404000	411000	It just so happens we were playing at the time a lot of Parappa the Rappa and bust a groove depending on what country you were in.
411000	414000	So we were talking about that for a while and then we did games.
414000	418000	So we like to be very interactive. We call ourselves a show where every gamer has a voice.
418000	422000	And we invite you guys to pull up a chair with us at our dinner table.
422000	427000	There's one thing we used to do when we played Dance Dance Revolution is after we played some DDR,
427000	432000	we would go to the cafe right across the street and sit down and talk some smack about video games.
432000	433000	So that's what we do here.
433000	439000	And order fried food because, you know, nothing better than after working out for a while to eat some fried fruits to offset it.
439000	444000	We just burned off all those calories playing DDR. Let's have some mozzarella sticks.
444000	446000	Let's do it right now.
446000	451000	So, yeah, that's we've kind of kept that tradition going now for going into next year.
451000	455000	Our 14th year is next year.
455000	457000	Every time I say the number, I die a little inside.
457000	458000	All right.
458000	460000	We're entering high school.
460000	462000	We love it. We love you guys. We love doing this.
462000	464000	And we're going to do it for a long time.
464000	468000	Although the computer tonight really didn't want it to happen.
468000	470000	I come into the studio after a two week break.
470000	475000	And again, we've been a little bit, admittedly, we've been spotty the past couple months.
475000	479000	I can't stand it because I got sick.
479000	483000	Then we had Thanksgiving, but I fell, had that fall and I would have been able to show anyway.
483000	486000	And then we had GX, which admittedly was an awesome reason to miss the show.
486000	488000	I don't apologize for that.
488000	491000	But I don't like that we miss so many shows back to back.
491000	493000	We like to be here every single week.
493000	497000	But tonight, I come in the studio, computer won't power on.
497000	498000	I'm like, what the hell?
498000	502000	So I figured it must have tripped the breaker at some point.
502000	505000	I'd like hold in the power button for a second, finally figured it out, got it working.
505000	506000	I'm like, phew.
506000	510000	Then it looks like Alan unplugged the internet at some point, which is fine.
510000	511000	That happens.
511000	512000	Sometimes you got to clean the hall.
512000	514000	So the cord's got to go or whatever.
514000	516000	And then so finally figured that out.
516000	519000	But the cord, it's like one of those things where the cord, we have this super long cord.
519000	525000	It's like a hundred foot cord that runs from the computer all the way to the router.
525000	528000	Like one of those that I have it at home.
528000	530000	It's ethernet through power.
530000	531000	You just plug it in.
531000	532000	Yeah, that would be cool.
532000	535000	And you guys might be thinking, why don't you just use Wi-Fi?
535000	538000	Because it's internet radio and we're streaming constantly.
538000	540000	We really have to have a wired connection for that.
540000	544000	Even if your Comcast is anything like my Comcast, it's fucking sucked.
544000	545000	Exactly.
545000	548000	Like I'm just like, it's seriously getting worse every day.
548000	550000	And I'm not sure how that's possible.
550000	552000	So finally figured out the net thing.
552000	557000	I just had to bend the cord just right at like the 30 degree angle that'll make it get the signal.
557000	563000	Okay, so then finally, you know, I had a moment of weakness and I clicked yes when Skype said,
563000	565000	do you want to upgrade Skype?
565000	567000	And now it won't work.
567000	575000	I try to bring it up and it says, sorry, we can't find the internet while I'm running IRC and Google and everything else in the background.
575000	577000	It's like, sorry, can't find the internet.
577000	581000	So I'm like, all right, well, there's plenty of websites out there where I can download the old version.
581000	586000	So download old version Skype 5.0 and still won't work.
586000	589000	So trying to install Skype messed my settings.
589000	591000	So I'm going to have to look into that this week.
591000	598000	So we have this whole rig set up in studio where I've got my iPhone plugged into our mixing board.
598000	601000	So we can hopefully take some calls later in the show.
601000	605000	But so we can definitely tonight bring you an interview.
605000	607000	I'm very excited. We're going to have a guest on the show tonight.
607000	614000	One of the cool things about going to an expo like GX got to talk to a lot of indie developers that were there showing their stuff.
615000	623000	And one of the games that we saw actually made that transition from early access to a fully fledged release game on Steam this week.
623000	627000	So we're excited. We're going to have Rick on the show tonight from Tipping Goat Games.
627000	628000	Love that name.
628000	632000	Going to talk to us tonight about Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.
632000	641000	And this is a game that kind of takes a lot of 8-bit retro sports games and it's like a giant Katamari ball that rolls them all up.
641000	644000	And it's one game that incorporates all these elements.
644000	650000	So we're going to have Rick on in about 15 minutes to tell us a little more about how that game works.
650000	654000	And I think he's shown this game at some of the Penny Arcade Expos and some other places.
654000	658000	So I know some of our listeners are actually well aware of this game that weren't even at GX.
658000	661000	So you may not know though that it's actually out now on Steam.
661000	663000	If you want to try it out for yourself, you can check that out.
663000	667000	Just use that old search box in Steam and you will be happily on your way.
668000	672000	Rick will be joining us live and you can ask your questions about the game.
672000	676000	In fact, I see SSJ100matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
676000	677000	I'm hyped about this game.
677000	685000	And yeah, if you want to ask Rick some questions, we will be fielding questions from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
685000	690000	But first, we need to recap what happened while we were gone.
690000	692000	We missed a week of show.
692000	696000	So I think we need to do last week's news set to Holik.
698000	706000	So while we were gone last week for GX, Minecraft finally launched on the Wii U.
706000	710000	But if you were looking forward to that Wii U gamepad support,
710000	713000	so you could do inventory management and stuff on Minecraft Wii U,
713000	720000	I'm sorry, but you can do off-screen play like you can do in every Wii U game.
720000	722000	So there you go.
722000	729000	Also, Mercedes-Benz and Nintendo teamed up for a Super Mario Maker costume.
729000	734000	And it's actually in the game now and you can actually play us a little race car in Super Mario Maker.
734000	738000	And I know there was some more news on Mario Maker this week we'll get into a little bit later.
738000	745000	And also, a new patent supposedly serviced for the Nintendo NX last week.
745000	752000	A weird controller that actually had a video or an image screen built into the controller.
752000	757000	I don't know, it looked a little weird to me, but I guess it's the way they could change the controller
757000	759000	and how it looks on the fly.
759000	762000	You mean like a touchpad where they can have signed buttons to random slots?
762000	764000	That sounds fucking terrible.
764000	765000	Yeah, I...
765000	769000	It's like, jeez, you know what I really wish I had in my console gaming experience
769000	774000	is that wonderful usability of not having buttons on a touchpad or mobile device.
774000	778000	I have real problems with this if the buttons are fake.
778000	785000	Because it doesn't work well for mobile gaming unless that is the way the game is meant to be controlled
785000	787000	is with swiping and dragging.
787000	792000	Like for some games it works fine, but when you try to take, like if you were to take Super Mario Brothers
792000	795000	and just put it on iPhone or Android, it would be horrible.
795000	798000	Sonic is that way on the phone, right? And it stinks.
798000	801000	I'm sorry, I love Sonic, but it stinks on mobile devices.
801000	805000	Because tangible controls are different than touch button controls.
805000	814000	So now, if the whole thing with NX is that the controller is a TV, but it has tangible buttons kind of inside it,
814000	817000	like you know what I mean, like the TV is built around those controls,
817000	820000	then I think that's kind of weird as hell, but...
820000	821000	I think it's stupid.
821000	822000	We'll try it.
822000	824000	And the reason why I think it's stupid is because my hand is on the controller,
824000	826000	I can't see the image under my hand.
826000	828000	So I don't...
828000	829000	See the point.
829000	834000	Depending on the design of the controller, like okay, I think about a controller like the Nintendo 64 controller.
834000	838000	That thing was a fat controller, or the original Xbox controller, Jesus.
838000	839000	That thing was a fat controller.
839000	843000	I don't want to hold a fucking LCD screen in my hand like that, you know.
843000	848000	But see, maybe I'm weird, but I like the Wii U gamepad controller.
848000	851000	It doesn't bother me the way it bothers everybody else.
851000	856000	I like it until I play Minecraft with it, and I fucking hate it.
856000	860000	I seriously, like, it made me realize how much I hate that controller.
861000	864000	Well anyway, now keep in mind, it's a patent.
864000	866000	It doesn't necessarily mean anything.
866000	868000	People like to jump to conclusions with this stuff.
868000	873000	We won't really know anything until E3 next year, but it's very interesting nonetheless.
873000	877000	So those are some of the big stories from the week that we were gone.
878000	881000	Anything else we want to talk about with GX?
881000	884000	Dark Sakura, how was your GX experience?
884000	887000	I mean, I know you did the costume and had your picture taken a lot.
887000	891000	You're a Grey Warden from Dragon Age, and very well received.
891000	893000	I know they had a contest.
893000	898000	Sadly, no trophies for Dark Sakura, but you had some stiff competition,
898000	900000	and I think you were just doing it for fun, right?
900000	902000	Well, I wanted to win something.
903000	906000	Winning's nice. Winning's nice.
906000	908000	I had a really good time.
908000	912000	I only bonked a few people with my staff.
912000	918000	It broke a lot, and I did repairs three nights in a row, it seemed.
918000	920000	It's a miracle that we got this.
920000	924000	By the way, she had this full-length staff with this intricate skull thing on the top of it,
924000	930000	and then a metal... well, it wasn't actually a metal blade, but an illusion of a metal blade at the end.
930000	935000	Somehow fit that thing in my car with five people in my little Civic.
935000	939000	I think the whole thing ended up being something like six and a half feet long.
940000	944000	So definitely another foot and a half taller than me.
945000	949000	But we got it to fit in the car, and I carried it around the whole convention
949000	953000	and walked in boots that I really should have had better insults for.
953000	955000	But it was a really good time.
955000	964000	I didn't really want to get back into the costume after dinner to go back to the cosplay dance.
965000	968000	I heard there was drama, so I'm kind of glad I didn't go.
970000	972000	Drama in the form of...
972000	977000	Oh, yeah. I don't want to linger on the negative, but somebody had way too much to drink,
977000	980000	and I think it was more than just liquor, that's all I'm going to say,
980000	985000	and basically the ambulance was called on him and had to get taken out of the place,
985000	987000	and it kind of shut the thing down early.
987000	992000	But you know what? For those not involved, it was handled well.
992000	995000	The guy got the medical attention he needed.
995000	1000000	He was fine because he was on the gurney making motions and things, so I know he's fine,
1000000	1004000	but it didn't really ruin the party, if that makes sense.
1004000	1009000	He added it early, but it didn't ruin the spirit or anything, so for what it's worth.
1009000	1018000	Well, at any rate, I would say that I'm not the same type of congoer I used to be,
1018000	1020000	but I had a really good time cosplaying.
1020000	1025000	I really miss it because it's been a while since I've done any kind of serious cosplay.
1025000	1033000	Victoria did a great job with the costume itself, and all the props were mine, but...
1033000	1038000	Did you get to participate or see any panels or get to play games?
1038000	1040000	I didn't go to any panels but our own.
1040000	1042000	Yeah? How'd the Podcast Cross Zone panel go for you?
1042000	1044000	It was really, really cool.
1044000	1048000	It was good that we just kept moving around and got to make some good points
1048000	1051000	and talk with people in the crowd. It was great.
1051000	1059000	I did play fake scrabble in costume against a templar to see who could spell better,
1059000	1062000	as in, haha spell, lol.
1062000	1068000	We've actually got pictures up on Twitter, so I can find them and link them in the chat room.
1068000	1075000	I was really tired, though, at the end of every day.
1075000	1077000	I mean, that kind of goes without saying.
1077000	1079000	Yeah, cons can be really draining.
1079000	1086000	Yeah, but I'm hoping to break the costume back out for a day of sac anime if all goes to plan.
1086000	1087000	Excellent.
1087000	1090000	And other than that, yeah.
1090000	1091000	Great.
1091000	1092000	How's your turn?
1092000	1093000	Yeah, I...
1093000	1098000	Oh, and I played the sports ball game, which is what I'm naming it in my head because the name's kind of long.
1099000	1108000	And I played that goggle game, not the Oculus-type game, with the Samsung headset.
1108000	1112000	I was just about to ask this because they were demoing a game on Oculus,
1112000	1115000	and I apologize so much to these creators because I forget the names of the games in the moment.
1115000	1118000	But there was one on the Oculus, and there was one using the Gear VR.
1118000	1120000	And you played the Gear VR one, right?
1120000	1123000	I did because it can be adjusted to near-sighted.
1123000	1131000	And you know what's funny is that I was actually speaking an email with the creators, and I think I CC'd you on my reply.
1131000	1132000	I don't know if you got it.
1132000	1136000	Yeah, I probably did, but trying to organize stuff for a few weeks out.
1136000	1140000	Well, yeah, but I'm trying...
1140000	1144000	Yeah, I've got the email right here so I can actually get the name.
1144000	1146000	It was...
1146000	1148000	Oh, yeah, it was Bizarre VR.
1148000	1149000	Oh, okay.
1149000	1150000	That was it.
1150000	1152000	I knew it had something to do with Bizarre, but I wanted to make sure.
1152000	1156000	But yeah, it was pretty fun, and there were great people.
1156000	1160000	Her name was Teresa working there, which I would love to have them on the show too.
1160000	1161000	Have her on the show.
1161000	1162000	We'll make it happen. We will.
1162000	1163000	Yeah.
1163000	1167000	But at any rate, those were the big things that I played.
1167000	1169000	I tried a few other things, but those were really my two.
1169000	1172000	I gotta back up though for a minute when you talk about VR,
1172000	1178000	because you have openly talked on the show about that a lot of first-person games will make you very motion sick,
1178000	1183000	and you don't like to play things like Skyrim in first person,
1183000	1185000	because that can really kind of mess with you.
1185000	1187000	And it happens.
1187000	1190000	After playing Fast Racing Neo this week, which I'll talk about later,
1190000	1193000	I can totally see how that happens to people.
1193000	1197000	So I can imagine there might have been some hesitation to get into VR,
1197000	1200000	but how did that go for you, all things considered?
1200000	1203000	I wonder if part of it was because I wasn't wearing my glasses.
1203000	1205000	But I seem to do just fine.
1205000	1208000	After a little while, I got a headache, which is about normal.
1208000	1211000	It got a little queasy, like with some of the turns,
1211000	1214000	but it was really smooth for the most part,
1214000	1217000	and there is a big part of me that's wondering if it's because of my glasses.
1217000	1218000	Interesting.
1218000	1224000	The fact that I was pretty much using unfiltered glasses.
1224000	1227000	I'm going to break down a little science here.
1227000	1234000	Glasses will refract light so that your eyeballs will see it at the right magnificence.
1234000	1240000	Instead of having the focal point be in a place other than where your eyes are set to look at.
1240000	1248000	So in this case, it was actually being projected to me at what was fine for my eyes.
1248000	1253000	And I think that something in that might have made it to where I didn't get as motion sick,
1253000	1259000	because I didn't get the same kind of weird eye strain that I get with monitors and things too.
1259000	1261000	It just wasn't there.
1261000	1267000	I suppose this is a question worth asking. What was the game? What was the experience in there?
1267000	1273000	You basically float around on a flying carpet, and you look around for missing things in each level.
1273000	1275000	And you can find coins.
1275000	1277000	Oh, so when you say Bazaar, it's like Aladdin's...
1277000	1279000	B-A-Z-A-A-R.
1279000	1282000	Not like Bazaar, Love Triangle, which is what came to my mind.
1282000	1284000	Bazaar, not Bizzar.
1284000	1286000	Does it play New Order?
1286000	1287000	No, but the music's really good in it.
1287000	1289000	I liked it. She was talking about the composer.
1289000	1291000	Oh, cool.
1291000	1293000	But yeah, the music was really good.
1297000	1301000	Basically, you go through these different floating levels.
1301000	1303000	Well, you're on the carpet, but you're over a canal.
1303000	1306000	And then you have to look for the different pieces.
1306000	1308000	And it's funny, if you look up, you can see the sky.
1308000	1312000	And you've got constellations that match the different things that you're looking for.
1312000	1316000	So you get all the pieces for that, and then you unlock the next level.
1317000	1323000	And you've got a shop that you can pick up extra Turkish Delight and other things.
1323000	1327000	I'm wondering if there's going to be more stuff added, like enemies and things, as you go.
1327000	1331000	Well, I'm sure a lot of these games were in early development.
1331000	1333000	But it was very pink.
1333000	1336000	But it was a pretty good game.
1336000	1339000	It was a pretty good game. I was very pleased with it.
1339000	1341000	I had a lot of fun playing it.
1341000	1345000	I probably could have kept going, if not for a little bit of a headache.
1345000	1352000	Just the one thing that actually really helped me stay centered is keeping my hand on the table.
1355000	1357000	Because my feet were rooted, right?
1357000	1361000	But keeping my hand on the table kind of connected me back.
1361000	1364000	Yeah, it kind of didn't let you go all in.
1364000	1368000	It kept you grounded, literally, like a lightning rod or something.
1368000	1370000	I would say more that it kept me oriented.
1370000	1371000	Okay.
1371000	1374000	So that I knew which way I was facing.
1374000	1379000	And if I couldn't find the table with my hand, I knew that I was facing away from the table.
1379000	1381000	Because it would have been behind me.
1381000	1382000	Okay.
1382000	1391000	So it really was like my anchor, in this case, kept me focused on where my directions were and where I was facing.
1391000	1399000	So that I knew at any given point that if I had to take that thing off and run, for example, I know I'd be going in the right direction.
1399000	1401000	I'd know which way to turn.
1401000	1405000	Which is, it's actually always been a thing for me, is always knowing where my exit routes are.
1405000	1410000	So Jamie survived her first Gear VR experience and didn't get sick or anything.
1410000	1411000	Didn't have a panic attack.
1411000	1414000	Had some ideas on how to make that experience work for you.
1414000	1415000	That's great.
1415000	1418000	It was a cute game and I really had a good time.
1418000	1429000	I'd like to see, actually, Dan and I were talking about this today, where we were talking about how they have those VR sets and would love to see something like that for iOS.
1429000	1435000	Having something like that would definitely open doors for more gamers.
1435000	1444000	And honestly enough, I could see things like that really working well with Google Maps, for example, how you have that walk view.
1444000	1447000	Imagine having virtual tours and whatnot.
1447000	1450000	Or say people, here's a business idea.
1450000	1454000	Virtual house tours if you're buying a model home.
1454000	1455000	Yeah.
1455000	1458000	And if you say, oh, well, I like this, but I want a counter here.
1458000	1461000	Or you look at the thing and navigate the menu.
1461000	1466000	You know how people will move to a city they haven't even been to yet because of a job or something?
1466000	1470000	And they have to like get an apartment kind of like unseen?
1470000	1473000	Like a VR experience could really bring that to you.
1473000	1483000	I mean, it's interesting that we're having this conversation because, you know, you go back a few months ago to one of the big stories with VR that Facebook bought Oculus, right?
1483000	1485000	And people are like, why does Facebook want to get into gaming?
1485000	1489000	And it's like, yo, there's way more to Oculus than just gaming.
1489000	1493000	And there's a great example, although I feel like I should patent pending.
1493000	1495000	That's my business because I could make some money on that.
1495000	1499000	There's also people who, well, like for me being nearsighted, that's one thing.
1499000	1502000	I could take off my glasses and see just fine in the game.
1502000	1512000	And if you have people with, say, who have to have like things magnified for them, you have that adjustable thing on the goggle.
1512000	1524000	And, you know, it can help people who may have difficulty seeing in general or, you know, something that can change brightness and everything for people with dim vision, stuff like that, improve contrast.
1524000	1529000	You know, it could be possible that you even have like another camera on the other side.
1529000	1535000	I mean, there's all kinds of ideas for application of things like that.
1535000	1543000	But for the most part, you know, despite, you know, we could speculate all night about, you know, what type of things we could see come out of that type of technology.
1543000	1548000	But in the end, I mean, I have no problem with games.
1548000	1550000	We can do some games too over there.
1550000	1556000	S21 Hunter Matt noting in the chat over at live.vognetwork.com, all three OLR hosts have dove into the Rift now.
1556000	1558000	Yes, that is, well, technically you didn't do the Rift.
1558000	1562000	I didn't do the Rift because I couldn't wear my glasses with the Oculus Rift.
1562000	1565000	But, you know, we've all had the VR headset experience, modern.
1565000	1578000	Is there something else that occurred to me? Do you remember E3 a while back where they had the sphere that you touch it and it gives you like almost topographical feedback where it would develop texture?
1578000	1579000	Yes.
1579000	1582000	Could you imagine something like that with the Oculus?
1582000	1589000	You know, that was a rumor for, believe it or not, that's been a rumor for Nintendo's DS at one point that it would have something like that.
1589000	1592000	And it was a rumor for iPhones at one point.
1592000	1599000	And I think iPhones did the reverse of that with the force push that they have in the, I'm talking like it's Star Wars, but you know what I mean?
1599000	1602000	Like the force feedback thing they have in the new iPhones.
1602000	1603000	3D touch.
1603000	1604000	Yeah, that's it. 3D touch.
1604000	1609000	However, it has done kind of the reverse in the form of the haptic feedback on the Apple Watch.
1609000	1612000	Ah, gotcha.
1612000	1622000	Basically it's, for me, my haptic feedback is, you got a text message and turn bitch for my directions. Or get off your ass and stand up.
1622000	1625000	Loki, were you trying to add something here a minute ago to the VR discussion? I'm sorry.
1625000	1626000	No.
1626000	1627000	I thought I saw you pick up your mic. All right.
1627000	1630000	Well, he could have picked up his mic because he wanted to.
1630000	1639000	Ah, maybe. Who knows? Quickly, quickly before we get to our guests tonight, I know there was some other stuff in the exhibit hall too, a lot of crafters that kind of make their own things.
1639000	1642000	Yeah, I was hanging out with the artists like the entire time. It was great.
1642000	1643000	Yeah, some really talented people in there.
1643000	1649000	Made some good friends there. Um, actually did like a little fake, uh, menorah lighting with one of them. It was great.
1649000	1654000	And you know, and basically I watched her booth so she could get a beer.
1654000	1667000	They were giving the beers out. Because yeah, they gave us beer and it was great. Um, thank you Intel for beer. Um, I actually hung out with a few people from Intel just talking chop for a while.
1667000	1676000	They had a really interesting booth where they had walls where you could basically write down and it was these questions like, what do you want to see in gaming in a few years?
1676000	1690000	And what do you, you know, these very, especially considering the audience that GX targets, which is this very diverse audience that sometimes feels like in that Xbox Live culture where a lot of nasty things are flinged around that maybe they don't fit in.
1690000	1695000	It was very interesting to see kind of a lot of what was written on the wall. I thought that was a very neat idea.
1695000	1705000	But I will say this, I don't know how you feel about this dark soccer, but I would say, and I just want to say footnote, I don't want this to read as like a huge negative or anything because I love gamer X. I love GX.
1705000	1717000	I financially supported this expo in a big way this year. But I found that in the expo hall, I was a little taken aback by how you had some big exhibitors there that didn't really bring games.
1717000	1728000	Like you have Blizzard, you have Blizzard that was there with Jobs or whatever. Intel had their walls, but that was cool. And they gave away cookies. So I'm not going to, but the rock band area was fun.
1728000	1739000	The rock band did it right. But I thought it was so weird that Blizzard had this big presence and it was like, they were, they had a job seeker there and it was like, no, no Overwatch, no World of Warcraft.
1739000	1747000	I actually did talk with the ladies there for a while. And they were both, yeah, like, yeah, the whole company's buckling down for stuff right now.
1747000	1761000	Yeah. And Overwatch has been down for maintenance too. So maybe that, that came into play too. But I just, I was kind of surprised, especially coming off of last year where you had Gearbox was there showing Borderlands, the pre-sequel or whatever it was.
1761000	1776000	That was the first time that was playable was at the last GX. Not that I'm saying I expect cutting edge stuff out of the expo. I was just surprised that the expo hall itself only had the indie games, which is great because I found a lot of good stuff there.
1776000	1785000	But it didn't have any corporate games considering all that corporate support that went into it. I'm just, I was a little surprised by that compared to last year.
1785000	1795000	But again, I don't want that to read like a negative because I do think the con is doing some good things. And I kind of think everybody involved realizes that. I don't think I'm the first person to say that.
1795000	1802000	And so I kind of think that's already on their radar for what can we do next year to put, put the bigger game in GamerX.
1802000	1811000	The only reason I wish we'd been able to stay for the closing ceremonies and feedback was to please beg for the cosplay contest to go back to the Saturday night instead of Sunday.
1811000	1821000	I have a feeling the only reason it was on Sunday was because the talent that hosted it. That was the day they were in town. I have a weird feeling. But then again, they were there Saturday night because they came by the table Saturday night. So I don't know.
1821000	1828000	And that's just a lot of, especially since like us, we checked out of our hotel.
1828000	1829000	Right. Yeah. Yeah.
1829000	1840000	And when you are dealing with that much crap, you know, props and your costume and needing help because Alan had to help me change into parts of my costume.
1840000	1846000	You need to have access to your hotel room for that kind of stuff. So.
1847000	1853000	But other than that, I mean, everything was really smooth. The cosplay contest in general was run a lot more smoothly than it was last year.
1853000	1862000	Yeah. And I thought, I did, I did want to say the space, you know, it was a big transition for them to go from San Francisco to San Jose. I love the new space.
1862000	1863000	It worked so much.
1863000	1868000	It worked so much better. So much more room to move around. The convention center was great.
1868000	1869000	It felt more con like.
1869000	1870000	Yes.
1870000	1871000	Than.
1871000	1880000	Although I kind of felt like they probably could have sold more tickets. I mean, from what I heard, it was close to a sellout, but it didn't look like, I kind of feel like they could have packed more people in there if they wanted to.
1880000	1884000	I think it'll get bigger. I don't know if it's going to be Fauna Mae big for a while, but.
1884000	1885000	No, no, I know.
1885000	1886000	It's going to get bigger.
1886000	1892000	Yeah. And again, there were so many great things come out of it. So much networking that I did. Like, I'm not, I had a great time and just the festivities.
1892000	1893000	I just made a lot of friends.
1893000	1894000	Yeah.
1894000	1895000	Yeah.
1895000	1896000	It was just hanging with cool people.
1896000	1897000	Yeah.
1897000	1906000	One of the cool people we met at the convention, uh, down had the booth, like right near us. And we were looking at that game going, what is that? That looks kind of like, is that dodge ball?
1906000	1913000	What is that? That guy's playing over there. And, uh, turns out, uh, it's a game called super slam dunk touchdown.
1913000	1922000	And it's like a bunch of eight bit sports games all rolled into one. And, uh, we played roller derby character is the best. We played it.
1922000	1926000	We had a lot of fun with it. And I was like, Oh, we got to get you on the show. When, when does it come out?
1926000	1935000	And he said this week I was like, Oh, well shoot. So we're going to get them on the line right now. We're going to, uh, give Rick a call and Rick is with tipping goat games.
1935000	1942000	And he's going to talk to us tonight about this game, super slam dunk touchdown. And I think we have them on the line. Rick, are you there?
1942000	1944000	Yes. Hello. Thanks for having me.
1944000	1946000	Hey, no problem, Rick. Thanks so much for being here.
1946000	1947000	My pleasure.
1947000	1950000	How was, uh, how was GX for you? Did you have a good time at the show?
1950000	1957000	I had a great time. It was, uh, I've done a lot of expos and so they've ranged from nightmarish to, uh, just a pleasant time.
1957000	1962000	And that was on the positive end of the spectrum. So I'm positive, uh, about that show. It was a good show.
1962000	1969000	Now. I didn't realize this about you when we were playing the game and, and there at the expo, but that GX was kind of in your backyard.
1969000	1972000	It was local to you, right? So that, that must've made it very convenient.
1972000	1976000	Oh yeah. It was super easy. Just parked, carried my stuff in. I was done.
1976000	1985000	I know that was, that was the great thing about us having a table that didn't involve computers or any of that stuff, because it's like we could just kind of carry it all in one setting. It was great.
1985000	1993000	Um, so tell us a little bit about a super slam dunk touchdown for those of our listeners out there who weren't at GX, which is unfortunately most people.
1993000	1997000	Uh, tell us a little bit about the game and what it looks like and what it's like.
1997000	2012000	Uh, sure. It's a local multiplayer irreverent all sports mashup. Uh, so as you mentioned 8-bit, uh, games, it's sort of inspired by 8 and 16-bit era games that didn't take themselves terribly seriously, the sports games of that era.
2012000	2025000	Uh, so you mentioned Super Dodge Ball, which is a, a lot of people make that comparison as well. Um, so it looks, it looks retro. It's, it's got 8, 16-bit sort of graphics, but it's actually driven by 3D physics. So there's kind of nuance to how the balls move and everything.
2025000	2033000	Hmm. How did you, uh, how did you get inspired to do a game like this? Where did it, where did it come from when you, when you put pen to paper and said, this is the game I want to make?
2033000	2045000	This game has been burning a hole in my brain for about, about six years now. I finally have been able to release it, but, uh, yeah, about six years ago, I was like, I really want to make an all sports crazy mashup game.
2045000	2059000	And it probably comes from just growing up in an era of local multiplayer. That was the only kind of multiplayer back then. And, uh, I, I feel like social gaming to me is people hanging out together playing a game. And, uh, so I wanted to make something like that.
2059000	2081000	Uh, and, uh, again, if you want to ask Rick a question about Super Slam Dunk Touchdown, you can over at live.vognetwork.com in our chat room over there. Um, so I noticed, uh, you talking a lot about local multiplayer and, uh, I noticed when you came to the show, you brought like four separate controllers. You had everything. You were really stressing that this is, this is a party game, right?
2081000	2089000	So if I were to ask about, well, what about online? What, what, what's your thoughts on that? I mean, online, just not in the cards free? That's not what you want this to be?
2089000	2093000	Well, first off, there was six controllers. We do up to six players locally on Windows.
2093000	2095000	Oh, my bad. My bad. I forgot how to count.
2096000	2106000	Well, if I wanted to take maybe, I don't know, three to six months and really try to make it online, I probably could do that. But that's not really the heart and soul of what this game is about.
2106000	2115000	And, uh, it's really about yelling at your teammates and, uh, you know, having a good time together. So I think having people in front of the TV is a better experience for this title.
2115000	2125000	Um, that said, if I had, you know, unlimited funding, I'd love to pay somebody to add an online component, but we're a very, very small studio, uh, with a total employee count of one.
2125000	2129000	I was about to say, is it just you that's doing all this?
2129000	2134000	Uh, well, I contract out the art, uh, as money comes in, but yeah, it's just me.
2134000	2141000	Got it. Wow. That's still very impressive for such a small studio of one basically to have created something like this. So props to you.
2141000	2149000	This must be, how are you feeling this week with the big release and the whole kind of making that transition from early access to a full release? How are you feeling?
2149000	2163000	I have to, I'll be honest. I kind of feel like a college senior, just sort of sliding the paper under the door at 11 59. You know, I just, just get it out there. I'm going to go lay down.
2163000	2168000	It's been, it's been a long, long year and a half since I've been working on this and I'm looking forward to the break.
2168000	2178000	What are some of the reactions you see when you see people playing your game at expos? Because again, you are bringing this full, you, you, you bring this game to cons the way it's meant to be played.
2178000	2188000	And so you're able to get, you know, sometimes, sometimes I can't get five people over to my house to play a video game. I mean, if I have, you know, liquor maybe, but at a con, it's very easy to get that together.
2188000	2195000	So you must see all sorts of, of great reactions. What do you, what do you, what do you kind of see from the people to play your game at cons?
2195000	2205000	Well, there's several stages. First, it's like confusion because they're not sure what it is they're looking at. And then their brain tries to tell them what they're looking at, but they still don't really believe it.
2205000	2213000	So they have to come over and then they see what it is and that it's real and then they want to play. And then they find out it's six players and you know, there's a critical mass problem at these conventions.
2213000	2220000	If I get one or two people playing, it's pretty easy to get six, but if it's empty, it's a little harder.
2220000	2234000	What, now for those that don't know, what is the object of the game? Because they, you might look at it and you see, okay, I've got this soccer goal and it's got a basketball hoop on it. And then there's like that, that touchdown tee. What, what, what is the object? Yeah, goal pose.
2234000	2254000	Just in plain, simple terms, you're taking your sports players, a whole team of sports players, and you're trying to maneuver the ball or puck or whatever it is through one of the goal areas, which could be a lower net, it could be a basketball style hoop, or it could be the uprights, the football, American football style field goal pose.
2254000	2271000	So there's different ways to score and then all the different players are kind of playing their own way. So baseball players hitting pop flies, the hockey players hitting slap shots, the soccer players kicking, the American football players tossing spirals. And so you mix all that together and it becomes a crazy 3D physics team based sports game.
2272000	2295000	Now, I noticed that it wasn't really just the sports players and the sports balls themselves that were all coming together. But as I was playing, I was playing the game earlier today to, you know, prepare for this. And I noticed that there was a lot of just other, for lack of a better term, crazy shit that would happen while you're playing the game. Like the marching band would just start running right through the middle of the game doing their thing.
2296000	2315000	And then I think my derby girl got three shots in a row. So of course, as what happens in hockey when you get three shots in a row, hats start flying all over the arena. And just all this crazy stuff starts happening. Where did you come up with all these ideas and what made you think like, oh, I just want to get it crazier with all this stuff?
2315000	2338000	Well, it's just things that pop up in your brain when you think sports. And, you know, these are things. Hat trick, that's a thing. You know, if you ask somebody who doesn't know anything about sports, they'll just name some terms. And so it's sort of just, you know, the marching band shows up. Doesn't show up in the middle of the match, but it's more fun that way. So it's kind of just putting as much sports in as small a tight a space as we can and just seeing what happens.
2338000	2348000	Now, am I crazy? Or did I see a streaker? Because I swear to God, the other team all of a sudden had a player running around the back of the goalpost who was just naked. Like, is that thing?
2348000	2363000	That's a thing. We just released an update. He used to kind of just drop from the ceiling, but now he's hiding in the crowd. So if you look in the crowd as you're playing and you see a shady guy with the trench coat on, watch out because he might jump into the arena and try to steal the ball.
2363000	2372000	That cracked me up because, I mean, the art is done so tastefully that you're not going to see anything that's going to make this game get an AO rating, right?
2372000	2374000	Fortunately, we're dealing with subpixels there.
2374000	2384000	Yeah, exactly, right. So you can't really see anything, but it's just kind of like, because I kind of did a double take. I'm like, first off, who is that guy? And second off, does he have no clothes on? What is he doing?
2384000	2389000	But I didn't even realize that he had jumped in from the crowd just because there's so much other stuff going on.
2390000	2403000	Oh, that's new. That's new. So I'm posting updates. We've done our first post-release update. There's going to be a season mode expansion next year, so I'm continuously trying to improve the game and making it better for a hopeful, eventual console release.
2403000	2406000	Oh, nice. What consoles are you looking at?
2406000	2410000	I'm under tight lips right now. I can't say much.
2410000	2422000	All right, fair enough. You come back when you can tell us. So what else was I going to say? There are some modes in the game. There's what? There's two modes in the game now? There's the challenge mode and kind of the quick play mode, right?
2422000	2426000	Yep, you can also battle the ending credits if you want to do that.
2426000	2429000	I somehow missed that. You can battle the credits?
2429000	2435000	Yes, and there's a shot practice mode too, which I encourage everybody to try that just to get the feel for the game before the AI starts beating you up.
2435000	2445000	But yeah, you battle the credits. Do you remember Altered Beast on the Sega Genesis did that? You beat the game and then the credits would come down and they'd start knocking you out. So that sort of stuck with me and I was like, let's get our revenge. Let's beat up the credits.
2445000	2448000	So the credits is made of balls and you can throw them at each other.
2448000	2455000	That kind of happens in Super Smash Brothers as well with the credit roll, but it's a little different, but I love that.
2456000	2460000	And yeah, DarkTetsuya making that same comparison in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com.
2460000	2465000	Going to some other questions from our chat room over at live.vognetware.com, SSJ100Matt says,
2465000	2478000	So I see a lot of sources of inspiration in the game like Blades of Steel, Double Dribble, Tecmo Super Bowl, Super Dodge Ball, Nintendo World Cup, Hit the Ice, NHL 94, NBA Jam. Am I missing anything?
2478000	2485000	Oh sure, yeah. You've got Speedball was one. Is NES Ice Hockey in that list?
2485000	2487000	Nope, NES Ice Hockey was not in the list.
2487000	2497000	There was one, Pigskin, I forget the year, it was like 320 AD or something like that, but it was like a medieval Pigskin game where you have pits that you can fall in and a bunch of guys beating each other up.
2497000	2504000	So that whole era, I guess they couldn't do a realistic sports game very well, so they said, oh well, let's just make it fun. And that's kind of what this game's about.
2505000	2521000	I probably told you this when I was playing the game for the first time, I'm not really a sports ball kind of guy. I enjoy going to a hockey game and occasionally a basketball game, but I'm horrible at playing the real thing and I don't get as into it as a lot of other people my age do.
2521000	2538000	So when games were NBA Jam or Tecmo Bowl, when it was very arcade-y in the element of it, that's when I loved sports games the most. And I'm assuming you must find the same thing to be similar or true as well to have been inspired to make a game like this, right?
2538000	2553000	Absolutely. Yeah, those games were fun. Anyone can pick them up, so this game has three buttons and an analog stick, so anybody can pick this up. There's a lot to learn, there's a lot you can learn about the different players and everything, but at its heart it's a very accessible experience, which I think it should be.
2553000	2567000	And you and I were having a conversation about how newer sports games like the Madden's of the world and so forth are oftentimes, I think you called them simulations, and I thought that was a really good kind of comparison. Does this game get anything from newer sports titles?
2567000	2590000	I'll be honest, the newest sports title that I'm able to play would be some iteration of Virtuit Tennis, which is kind of similar. You had analog stick and a few buttons. I tried to play a modern soccer game that there was a demo for on PlayStation, and you literally had to juggle the ball with the stick. You couldn't just move the guy, you had to actually try to keep the ball from getting away from you, and I'm like, this is way too much.
2591000	2599000	You know what I'll tell you is one of the best sports games to come out in years and years besides, of course, Super Slam Dunk Touchdown. I'll tell you, it's Rocket League.
2599000	2604000	Oh yes, yes. I have not had a chance to play that, I'm afraid it's going to suck me in.
2604000	2612000	Yeah, I wouldn't doubt you're going to play it and then all of a sudden a car is going to show up in Super Slam Dunk Touchdown somewhere, I'll tell you.
2612000	2625000	But that's kind of the same thing where it's like a sports game. Well, it's not really a sport, but it kind of is. It's just fun and silly and easily accessible. Because everybody knows how to drive a video game car. It's accelerate and brake. Very, very easy.
2625000	2626000	Brake?
2626000	2629000	Yeah, who uses the brake? Who uses that?
2629000	2631000	That's what the walls are for.
2632000	2647000	Let's see, Tigerclaw says, a sports game with very simple controls that doesn't require you to do complicated button combinations would be more fun to play. And I noticed that is kind of part of your game, right? It's like two or three buttons tops, right?
2647000	2659000	Yeah, one of them's passed, so you're hardly using that unless your teammate has the ball or you want to send it over there. There's a shoot button, that's the main button. And then there's a turbo boost, so that's pretty much like NBA Jam in terms of number of buttons.
2659000	2670000	And then I noticed that, I guess the shoot button would also double as the fight button. And if you can get enough people in the fight, it'll turn into this cartoon cloud that starts flying all over the arena, right?
2670000	2690000	Yeah, and that was actually a product of user feedback. So I used to do playtest parties early on to get local multiplayer feedback, and the chaos of the game was a little too much for people. So that rowdy cloud, as I call it, sucks people in. If they're getting too violent, let's put them in one place and they can mash their buttons and let the guy who's not in that fight try to shoot and win the game.
2690000	2718000	I've noticed that your game has gone through some changes with graphics, too, because I saw some screenshots and I think some material you've done for PAX, and the slam dunk sequence looked very different than it does now. Before it was kind of, I don't want to say it was plain, but it was a little plainer. But now it looks like you got the full audience. It looks like that double dribble thing we all remember from when we were kids, which had to be an influence, I'm sure, right?
2718000	2736000	Yeah, I definitely wanted to do that, but I wanted to make it interactive. And the old art, which has been kind of the bane of my existence this year, has been slowly getting replaced. And the art that you might be referring to, the early art, I actually drew that over Christmas right after my artist decided to pursue other projects.
2736000	2748000	So that has been programmer art that has been in the game for a long time, and I'm so happy to have replaced that with the really nice looking, as you said, inspired by double dribble dunk sequences.
2748000	2752000	How many changes did your game go through in development?
2753000	2780000	It went through a lot of evolutions. If you go back and look at the very early videos, you can tell it's just a super primitive version of what it is now. The main things were with player feedback and just letting people know what was going on. So there's an aiming cursor, you can tell which direction you're pointing while you're aiming, which is helpful. There's a pass cursor that shows up when you're being passed to, so little things like that that just kind of clue people in. The player selection screen went through about three or four different durations to get where it is now.
2781000	2786000	Now, this game was on early access for a little while. How long were you on early access until the release this week?
2786000	2788000	It was about three months, I think.
2788000	2792000	And did you get feedback through that process as well? How did that work?
2792000	2800000	That was great, because it was pulling teeth sometimes after my same friends had played the game, and they were like, okay, let's play a different game. We've been playing this all summer.
2800000	2806000	But when it goes into early access, suddenly all these people are playing and they're on the Steam forums, and it's like, okay, cool.
2806000	2814000	Now I've got feedback from fresh players, they're seeing it with fresh eyes, I'm getting good reactions, honest reactions.
2814000	2818000	And you kind of have to, as a developer, take everything everybody says very seriously.
2818000	2825000	Because if there's a problem, if they're not playing the game what you think is correctly, then you're not communicating it correctly to them.
2825000	2831000	So it's been very useful. So thanks to everybody on the Steam forums, and please do jump on there if you've got any feedback.
2831000	2836000	I bet a lot of us sometimes take that for granted, especially if we're developing.
2836000	2849000	And not that everybody listening to this show necessarily develops full-on games, but something like Super Mario Maker I think has really opened it up so that some people can kind of experience what that process is like a little bit.
2849000	2857000	And I know I'm fascinated when I watch people play a level that I made in Mario Maker on YouTube or Twitch or something.
2857000	2862000	And it's like, that is not how I intended people to get past that part of the game.
2862000	2866000	Or that is not how you're supposed to do that part, but they did it.
2866000	2874000	And that's got to be even exponentially the case when you're making a full-fledged game as opposed to a level in Mario.
2875000	2880000	Well that's the joy of it, because you see things for the first time because somebody will be playing it in a way that you've never played it before.
2880000	2884000	And sometimes that leads to bugs, but other times it leads to just really hilarious stuff.
2884000	2893000	One of the things that happened during a convention, there was a fight and the ball got knocked just because of the 3D physics so high that it went off the screen for like a good 3 or 4 seconds.
2893000	2896000	And I thought, okay, that's interesting, that's new.
2896000	2902000	So I actually put a ceiling on the game now, and if it goes up that high you can actually knock a light loose, it'll fall down and land on the field.
2902000	2907000	So it's just by observing how people play the game we can add to it and make it more fun.
2907000	2910000	Awesome. Let me get to one more question here from our chat room.
2910000	2917000	S2100Matt asking, you were able to get this done in a year and a half, which is an impressive feat considering how polished the game looks.
2917000	2923000	How much of your time was taken up with development versus work versus real life stuff? Did you even sleep?
2924000	2934000	I did sleep, but that's about all I did. I actually quit my job in May of 2014 to work on this game and have been working non-stop ever since then.
2934000	2939000	And I mentioned the crisis over Christmas last year, that basically, that crisis didn't stop until launch.
2939000	2945000	So it's been a lot of work, it's been a lot of fun, it's been up and down in all directions.
2945000	2952000	Well congratulations on the launch of the game. And again, radio can only go so far as to what this game really looks like.
2952000	2958000	I do encourage you guys to go check it out. On the Steam store, super slam dunk touchdown.
2958000	2965000	Rick, any other websites or social media for our listeners to see more about this game?
2965000	2969000	Sure, you can check out our Facebook page, you can follow me on Twitter, Tipping Goat.
2970000	2977000	And we also have a webpage at tippinggoat.com. I'm also very active on the Steam forums and there is a subreddit at SSDTouchdown.
2977000	2980000	So whatever your network of choice.
2980000	2984000	Very cool. And I'm hoping to get a YouTube done of some play this week.
2984000	2987000	I wanted to do that today and then all the computer stuff started happening here in studio.
2987000	2992000	So I'm going to try to get that on my YouTube channel a little later this week, so that'll be something as well.
2992000	2999000	And yeah, I do definitely encourage people to at least give the game a look and I think it's going to kind of get you right in that feel.
2999000	3007000	Where Blades of Steel and Double Dribble and NBA Jam and those games back when sports games were arcadey and fun.
3007000	3010000	I think it's going to get you in that same spot. So congrats to you, Rick.
3010000	3011000	Thank you.
3011000	3013000	Alright, best of luck with the game and thanks for being on OLR tonight.
3013000	3014000	Thanks for having me.
3014000	3015000	Alright, take care. Bye bye.
3015000	3016000	You too.
3017000	3023000	Alright, that was Rick with Tipping Goat Games and the game there Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.
3023000	3028000	Dark Soccer, I know you got to play that as well at the Con and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.
3028000	3029000	I had a good time.
3029000	3030000	Yeah.
3030000	3031000	I had a really good time.
3031000	3036000	Although, I don't know why I just kept blanking on the name over and over, but it's still funny.
3036000	3040000	Well, it is kind of all these different sports terms all together.
3040000	3043000	The goal is to sport harder than the other people.
3043000	3048000	I think it seems like it can be set up kind of very similar to iDarb where they have...
3048000	3055000	Maybe even if he doesn't do internet play over the internet, like multiplayer, he can do maybe some sort of Twitch support or something like that.
3055000	3061000	With all the iDarb crap where he can put keywords in and silly shit happens.
3061000	3066000	Oh yeah, maybe some of that audience stuff, like the streakers and all that stuff. That might be kind of fun.
3066000	3067000	Like maybe some of that stuff.
3067000	3071000	Throw some power ups, like t-shirt cannons or something like that. That would be pretty awesome.
3071000	3078000	Or maybe, and I don't know how difficult this is, I mean we spout them off like they're no problem at all, but we have to remember he's only a team of one.
3078000	3084000	And I forgot to ask him about this, but there's some really silly advertisements that you see in the background.
3084000	3085000	Try Food.
3085000	3087000	Yeah, Try Food was one of them.
3087000	3092000	And I was like, I think I will try eating at some point. There's just some silly stuff there.
3092000	3093000	I should do that.
3093000	3096000	Yeah, I should try food someday. I might be good.
3097000	3099000	Alright, well again, best of luck to him.
3099000	3110000	It was a lot of fun to play and I hope he's able to get the money back for the time invested and he can look at making whatever game he wants to do next.
3110000	3112000	Maybe some more retro inspired stuff there.
3112000	3115000	So again, that's super slam dunk touchdown.
3115000	3120000	Look at that, Dungeon Buster in chat giving a link there to our listeners if they want to check that out on the Steam store.
3120000	3124000	I believe it's $14.99. That's how much that is.
3124000	3128000	Alright, we're going to get into news and talk about what else has been going on in the video game world this week.
3128000	3134000	But I do want to take a chance to go around and ask what types of video games have you been playing this week?
3134000	3136000	We always like to talk about how was your gaming week.
3136000	3139000	So outside of the con, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
3140000	3155000	It was very TurboGrafx oriented with some Adventure Island, Monster Boy, Bonk.
3155000	3159000	We had Bonk. We had Magical Chase. A lot of Magical Chase.
3159000	3165000	Some Proteus Da. Twinbee.
3165000	3173000	I didn't play any Dragon Age. And I played some Animal Crossing, the Happy Cam Designer.
3173000	3177000	That was for the most part quite the retro-tastic week. What brought that on?
3177000	3179000	Getting our Turbo EverDrive.
3179000	3189000	That works. Alright. I have a feeling that will come back to us a little later when we get into the classic game of the week. We'll see.
3189000	3192000	Meanwhile, let's go over to Loki. How was your gaming week?
3192000	3202000	Well, I played quite a bit actually. I played lots of Fallout 4. So I'm like, gosh. I don't even know how many hours into the game.
3202000	3211000	I think it's counting in days now. So I'm at least two days in. I'd say maybe 60 hours or so. I don't remember yet.
3211000	3217000	So I'm pretty far. Still really enjoying that. It's kind of fun just to wander around. I'm enjoying it like Skyrim.
3217000	3226000	And cheating in it like Skyrim. Exploiting every possible console glitch hack I could possibly do and I'm enjoying that while I can.
3226000	3233000	I do want to play through it again. Actually, once I'm done with this one. Someone came up with the idea of doing a faction-less one.
3233000	3240000	So instead of joining one of the factions you just fucking kill everybody and be an asshole to everybody. I'm like, yes! I will do that.
3240000	3245000	That is what I want to do next time. So that's what I'm going to do.
3245000	3253000	Just Cause 3. Tried playing that a little bit. But it's a fucking mess. And it's really disappointing because I really want to play that game.
3253000	3261000	But I cannot handle trying to play one of the challenges to unlock stuff in the game and having a three minute load time in between every time I retry that.
3261000	3265000	Fuck that. I am not playing that game until that's fixed.
3265000	3276000	I also played Minecraft on the Wii U. Cause my son wanted Minecraft on the Wii U cause he wanted to play on the screen.
3276000	3285000	And so I did that and I downloaded it and played with the controller. I fucking hate the Wii U controller with that game.
3286000	3292000	The button placement stuff is very awkward. I don't like how the buttons are below the analog stick.
3292000	3299000	PlayStation and Xbox controls work a lot better for me. But that is just frustrating. I don't even want to play it.
3299000	3310000	And the text is so small on that screen. You would think like, hmm, we have this on the second screen. Maybe we should make the menus and UI fucking readable.
3310000	3316000	Nope. Let's make it fucking, just shrink it down. Make it super microscopic so you can't fucking read anything.
3316000	3325000	I'm really disappointed at what a lazy port cash in Minecraft Wii U is. I mean, for all the potential that's there with the touch screen.
3325000	3331000	I just, I really feel like this is a whole, well, it's either A, well, we gotta shut the Nintendo fans up.
3331000	3337000	Or B, well, we gotta make money from the Nintendo fans by just, you know, copy pasting.
3337000	3342000	You know, I really wish they had done more with what the Wii U was intended for.
3342000	3349000	I mean, shit, they're making tons of money from me. I bought it on pretty much every console, so I don't know why.
3349000	3355000	But, yeah, my son wants to play it. He enjoys it. That's fine. But I find the controls frustrating and I'll play it on any other system.
3355000	3361000	I just don't want to play it on that one. Especially since it's missing features that are on the other systems. No, no thanks.
3361000	3373000	But I bought it, so I guess you win. And then I bought Earth Defense Force 4.1. I wasn't gonna technically buy that, but Eric wanted to play and then he bailed out.
3373000	3381000	So I spent the money on it for no reason, but I did. But it's fine. I'm sure we'll hook up another day.
3381000	3386000	But I played through it a little bit and it's really hard. I tried like, well, I'm gonna bump it up with a hard one.
3386000	3396000	And it's like, this is really frustrating. And it's frustrating in the fact that they've changed how some of the ants and stuff attack you, so now they can shake you around and you're supposed to be able to shoot them while they're doing that.
3396000	3406000	And it's fucking annoying. It's just like, I don't know. It's kind of cheap, I guess, in that sense. But, whatever. That's the type of game it is. It's supposed to be frustratingly hard.
3406000	3417000	And, yeah. So, I'll probably play more of that after I get done with Fallout. Because I was like, I can play more of the Earth Defense Force, or I can play more Fallout. Someone play more Fallout.
3417000	3426000	And then, of course, I played tons of Ingress. I drove up the fucking Placerville and, like, rescue today to make a field from there to Auburn for no fucking reason.
3427000	3429000	Other than, I was like, oh, maybe I'll get some more points.
3429000	3431000	Uniques. You got uniques.
3431000	3437000	I had, like, two. Because I didn't really actually, you know, hack anything because I was under, like, a time constraint.
3437000	3445000	I need to get your schedule so we can go out some time together. Because you can do so much more in that game when you even have just one other person. You can do better stuff.
3446000	3452000	But, like, my schedule's gonna change after the first of the year, so then I'm not gonna have the weekdays anymore. Because they used to have Thursdays to play.
3452000	3465000	And now, nope. That's not gonna happen. So, I may have, no, I'm not gonna, depends on what my schedule is, you know, where I'm trying to shift, trade shifts, and I may not have any time in the morning anymore.
3465000	3467000	Oh, boy. Alright.
3467000	3471000	It'll be, like, weekends, maybe. Or if I take a day off. I don't know.
3471000	3476000	Well, real life is more important than silly portal bandits, so it's fine.
3476000	3484000	Yeah, I'm probably not gonna do any more of the fielding stuff. I just, like, a few weeks ago I went to Auburn, because I was meant to, like, field that day.
3484000	3496000	And then, like, I drove, like, two hours round trip to do that. And by the time I got back here to actually link it up, someone had fucking, on our own side, had fucking thrown some blocking links. I'm like, are you fucking serious?
3496000	3497000	But they didn't know. They didn't know.
3497000	3516000	Well, no, they, it's because I couldn't text them, because I'm driving on a fucking road that's twisty as fuck, and, like, in the rain, with no cell coverage. Like, well, he didn't say anything. I'm like, yeah, because I'm fucking driving. I can't text on the phone while I'm driving to tell you, with no cell signal. So, whatever, it's fine. I wasn't mad, and it was just, like, it's just something that happens.
3516000	3517000	More like your luck.
3517000	3525000	It's like, yeah, my luck. I wasted all this time. You know, drove all the way back here. It's like, oh, fuck, I can't do anything. Well, that was that, so.
3525000	3534000	Alright. I can't wait. You guys, I really feel like, because of this Ingress thing, I feel like Loki is gonna play Pokemon Go.
3534000	3541000	I'll try. So, anyways, I've been doing Christmas shopping, so I have your gifts.
3541000	3542000	Oh, my gosh.
3542000	3549000	So, you guys can choose or fight over which one, and I don't know if you have these yet, so I can never know, because you buy all these figures and stuff.
3549000	3550000	Oh, my God.
3550000	3567000	Anyways, so I got both the Sam Flynn and the Korra Disney Infinity figures. I didn't know, they look pretty awesome, and I've been buying Disney Infinity stuff, because I'm buying my son the game, Disney Infinity 2.0.
3567000	3570000	So, you guys can decide which one you want.
3570000	3574000	Wow, that's awesome. I'm fine, whichever one you want to take.
3574000	3575000	I think I'd really like Korra.
3575000	3577000	You want Korra? That's fine. I'll take Flynn.
3577000	3578000	Thank you.
3578000	3581000	Hey, thank you, Loki. I'm gonna take that out of the box.
3581000	3584000	I was looking at Amiibos, and I'm like, does he have that one?
3584000	3587000	Yes, I have them all. It's sick.
3587000	3592000	You know what, though, guys? I don't know if I should talk about this on air. I might get in trouble, but we'll see.
3592000	3599000	Shane told me he's gonna stop collecting Amiibo. I think he finally got broken, like the Amiibo thing kind of broke him.
3599000	3607000	Because I ordered the Shovel Knight Amiibo on Best Buy this week, and I was like, Shane, you didn't tell me that it was up for sale. I heard about it from somebody else.
3608000	3614000	And I was like, are you gonna go get it? He's not feeling the Amiibo thing anymore, and I'm like, are you okay, buddy?
3614000	3618000	I bought a disturbing amount of Disney Infinity figures this week.
3618000	3620000	But they were on clearance.
3620000	3622000	They were on clearance, yes. And they're used.
3622000	3628000	So I bought the game, which was on clearance, because it's last year's game.
3628000	3631000	And then I bought the figures, because they're on sale this week.
3631000	3640000	And even, like, I bought an Olaf for my other son, and that's Disney 3.0. You can't actually use it in the game, but I'm gonna download 3.0 so that they play.
3640000	3650000	But the other figures were, like, five bucks new, or they had, you know, GameStop had, like, buy two used and get three free.
3650000	3655000	I'm like, I cleared out, like, their whole section. They're hard to get anymore.
3656000	3660000	So I'm like, well, fuck, if I'm gonna buy this, I'm gonna buy the characters while I can still get them.
3660000	3668000	And fucking trying to find that Spider-Man set, just forget it. It's impossible to find. After, like, a year.
3668000	3674000	Alright, looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, I think that lit up the chatroom more than anything else.
3674000	3676000	Me saying the Shane is out of the Amiibo thing.
3676000	3679000	Act F saying, what? It's 2100, Matt. I don't believe it.
3679000	3683000	The what meme saying, did Shane finally accept a job for Sony PR?
3683000	3687000	That, that, that I would believe for everything else.
3687000	3692000	And SJ100Matt says, are you sure he was tired, wasn't tired and just needed a nap?
3692000	3695000	That could also be true. I don't know.
3695000	3699000	Okay, so my gaming week. I actually, I played a whole lot this past week.
3699000	3703000	Not just on Steam, obviously I played some Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.
3703000	3709000	I played another game, and I want to have these guys on the show when their game is a little closer to full release.
3709000	3713000	The game is called Black Ice, and it was kind of like Tron meets Diablo.
3713000	3717000	And I was like, I am into both of those things. Tell me more about your game.
3717000	3719000	And I liked that one a lot, so I was playing that on Steam.
3719000	3722000	And actually, you know who's been playing that even more than me is Alan.
3722000	3725000	Alan's really into that, so we'll talk about that game a little later on.
3725000	3728000	I'm hoping to have them on the show.
3728000	3731000	But then I got home and I played some other stuff.
3731000	3734000	I want to talk quickly about a game I talked about two weeks ago.
3734000	3737000	Two weeks ago on the show I talked about Xenoblade Chronicles X.
3737000	3746000	And although I don't think I was too negative on the game, I did give some feedback that was a little bit like, this really bothers me.
3746000	3750000	And I did spend some more time with the game to see if I could get over some of that stuff.
3750000	3759000	And for the most part, yeah, I think I did get over a little bit of a hump that I think kind of happens in the story, kind of between Chapter 3 and 4.
3759000	3765000	And I was able to progress a little more in the story, and I feel a little better about where I'm headed in the game now.
3765000	3777000	It still doesn't completely change the fact that I do think there's a big disconnect between the manual is there, so you have to read the manual on the Wii U gamepad.
3777000	3784000	But the game has some tutorials in it, but if you're not able to read the manual as well...
3784000	3789000	I don't know, there's some kind of disconnect there in how the game really paces itself in the beginning.
3789000	3792000	And that still kind of bothers me and I think will turn some people off.
3792000	3801000	But if you can stick with it and get over that hurdle, I mean, the game is really good looking, there's a lot of great music in the game.
3801000	3807000	The battle system is fun, even if people never shut up, they keep yelling at each other, but I kind of like that ambience.
3807000	3810000	It's a little different than other RPG games I played.
3810000	3815000	So I am enjoying myself with Xenoblade Chronicles X, and I thought that was an important little follow-up point.
3815000	3823000	So even though I do think the game has its flaws, and I know there's going to be Nintendo defenders and Xenoblade defenders that are going to say I'm wrong, and that's fine.
3823000	3829000	But I really do think that there's some roadblocks in that game that prevent it from being a great game.
3829000	3835000	Because at the end of the day, I still think a lot of the voice acting and the scripting is very...
3835000	3838000	It's a little generic, a little blah.
3838000	3842000	I hear the story gets better and better, but I'm not going to be totally convinced.
3842000	3848000	I don't think that it was written for a reading game and it's being acted and not very well.
3848000	3853000	But outside of that, I mean, what RPG games on the Wii U are there?
3853000	3856000	There's not a lot, a lot, a lot of games. There's a few, but not a lot.
3856000	3864000	And Xenoblade is really good, and if you are a Wii U owner, I think it is worth having if you're into JRPGs at all.
3864000	3870000	Just be warned, you got to read through that manual, and you might hit these parts where you're like,
3870000	3876000	am I even on the right fucking path? If you feel like that, just try something else and you'll get there.
3878000	3884000	Also on the Wii U this week, I played a game that was released on the eShop that I'm kind of surprised I didn't play sooner,
3884000	3888000	the day it came out, but it's called Fast Racing Neo.
3888000	3891000	And this is the game that a lot of people are saying,
3891000	3899000	well, this is what happens when Nintendo doesn't put out F-Zero, is that the indie studio made their own version of F-Zero.
3899000	3903000	And so I checked out the game, and I got to say, it's pretty sweet.
3903000	3906000	It's more Wipeout than F-Zero to me.
3906000	3907000	Yeah, that's what it looked like to me, more Wipeout.
3907000	3911000	But that's not a bad thing at all. It's fast, and it's racing.
3911000	3920000	So in fact, it's so fast that when I was playing, and it's really smooth, like it does run at that 60 frames a second,
3920000	3925000	I did notice when I was going really fast on some complex tracks that the track kind of popped in in the distance.
3925000	3927000	You kind of see the pop in.
3927000	3931000	But that was extremely infrequent, all things considered.
3931000	3934000	But I think that's how they made it happen at 60 frames a second.
3934000	3940000	But I got to say, it was so fast and so smooth that even I was getting a little bit of that, whoa, I got to stop.
3940000	3943000	I'm almost getting a little queasy playing this on my big TV.
3943000	3945000	It's almost a bit much.
3945000	3956000	But they kind of put an interesting twist on the formula where there's almost like an Ikaruga thing where you have to flip the color of your engine to match the color of the boosters if you want to boost.
3956000	3963000	There's orange boost and blue boost, and you have to flip the colors back and forth to match the boost in order to actually go faster.
3963000	3965000	And I thought that kind of put a neat little spin on it.
3965000	3968000	So I think the music's good.
3968000	3976000	I think the tracks are pretty varied for an indie game, and at least the beginning ones I've played are pretty well designed.
3976000	3979000	However, it's pretty difficult.
3979000	3983000	It's not exactly like the first time I played.
3983000	3985000	The lowest difficulty is not a gimme.
3985000	3989000	Like, you play Mario Kart on 50cc, you're going to win.
3989000	3990000	No problem, right?
3990000	3994000	Unless you're maybe like a kid or like, you know, a gamer who really doesn't play very often.
3994000	3996000	Like, you're going to win 50cc Mario Kart.
3996000	3999000	You're not going to win Fast Racing Neo your first time through.
3999000	4000000	If you do, props to you.
4000000	4001000	You're really good.
4001000	4002000	But that's okay.
4002000	4003000	I'm okay with the game.
4003000	4005000	I'm not like saying, oh, it's too hard.
4005000	4010000	It just took me by surprise a little bit, so I'm going to warn you all out there.
4010000	4012000	It is a more difficult game.
4012000	4017000	But the second time I played through, I did place first in the circuit, and I was able to move on.
4017000	4021000	So I'm totally okay with a game kind of requiring a little bit of effort for progression.
4021000	4024000	The only thing that kind of bothers me about the game,
4024000	4034000	I don't like the default controls, is that, like, you know, they do the little ZL and ZR are kind of like the super left turner.
4034000	4036000	Like, they drift your car left and right like it didn't have zero.
4036000	4039000	But then the R button is the boost.
4039000	4044000	And the L button flips between the orange and blue, but you can also use X to do that.
4044000	4049000	And it's like my fingers on the L and R's are never hitting the right button.
4049000	4052000	And so suddenly I'll boost when I think I'm going to be drifting to the right.
4052000	4055000	Or worse yet, I'll drift to the right when I think I'm going to boost.
4055000	4058000	And like I'm having a hard time kind of like training my fingers to do that.
4058000	4061000	And I didn't see a way to remap those buttons at all.
4061000	4068000	I could have missed it, but I really wish it would let me remap some of that to a configuration that works for me.
4068000	4074000	I did notice the menu system in the game is really basic.
4074000	4078000	A lot of the shell around the game itself is really basic.
4078000	4079000	But that's, I mean, that's okay.
4079000	4082000	I mean, you know, the important part is, is it a fast racing game?
4082000	4087000	And yes, it is. But I just, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't have that polish you would expect out of an F-Zero game, right?
4087000	4091000	Like F-Zero GX was extremely polished from start to finish.
4091000	4093000	And most Nintendo games are, right?
4093000	4097000	This one's a little rough in the edges, but when you're actually racing, it's a lot of fun.
4097000	4098000	And I'll give it that.
4098000	4103000	So, look in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
4103000	4107000	Dark Ted Sousa says, I saw some video of fast racing Neo.
4107000	4111000	Yeah, I did get sort of a wipeout vibe from it, but it still looked blazing fast.
4111000	4114000	It definitely seems to have a little bit of an F-Zero vibe to it, too.
4114000	4117000	There's still definitely a F-Zero vibe to it.
4117000	4123000	Like, I swear to God, one of the opponent's names, it's not Captain Falcon, but it's like Fapton Calkin or something.
4123000	4125000	Like, it's really similar.
4125000	4127000	It's kind of surprising.
4127000	4129000	Like General Hawk.
4129000	4132000	Wait, that's actually, I think, G.I. Joe.
4132000	4133000	So.
4133000	4134000	Anyway.
4134000	4136000	And I got to give this important update.
4136000	4140000	Shane actually joined the chat room and said, what terrible lie was said?
4140000	4144000	And so the chatters basically filled him in on what I'd been saying.
4144000	4149000	And Shane said, yeah, it's hell trying to hunt for both Amiibo and Power Rangers toys.
4149000	4151000	So I had to pick one.
4151000	4152000	So.
4152000	4154000	But what about my needs?
4154000	4155000	What about the Amiibo I need?
4155000	4158000	See, Shane was always, like he was keeping me in the loop on the Amiibo.
4158000	4159000	Shane was my dealer.
4159000	4160000	I know Shane was my dealer.
4160000	4162000	And now he's just, you can't just quit.
4166000	4167000	Alright.
4167000	4168000	So anyway.
4168000	4169000	There you go.
4169000	4170000	That was pretty much my gaming week.
4170000	4174000	I think that's all I really have to say for my gaming week was those games.
4174000	4176000	Housekeeping, and then we'll get into news tonight.
4176000	4179000	Just for housekeeping real quick, I know we've missed a lot of shows recently.
4179000	4184000	The good news is, no more missed shows unless something really bad happens.
4184000	4188000	We will be here weekly, at least through the end of February.
4188000	4191000	But I will be gone for a Sunday in the end of February.
4191000	4193000	Maybe we can tape in advance that week.
4193000	4196000	Because I'll only be gone like Thursday, Friday, so maybe we can tape on a Wednesday or something.
4196000	4198000	This is way out in February, so we don't have to worry about it now.
4198000	4199000	I'm going to Disneyland next month.
4199000	4200000	Are you really?
4200000	4201000	Yeah.
4201000	4202000	Lucky.
4202000	4203000	I told you.
4203000	4205000	Oh yeah, that's right, because you're going to the farewell before they bulldoze.
4205000	4206000	I'm going to meet.
4206000	4209000	Yeah, before they bulldoze a lot of the frontier stuff for Star Wars Land.
4209000	4212000	And I wouldn't have even known about that actually being the weekend if not for Victoria,
4212000	4214000	so I'm going to be like, I'll be there.
4214000	4215000	Yeah.
4215000	4216000	It's going to be interesting.
4216000	4217000	Because I deserve it.
4217000	4218000	You do deserve it.
4218000	4222000	I'm kind of jealous you're going to Disneyland, but that's okay because a month later,
4222000	4227000	I won't be here at the end of February, so we won't be live at the end of February.
4227000	4228000	This is a ways off.
4228000	4229000	I'm going to MAGFest.
4229000	4230000	I booked my flight.
4230000	4234000	I know I've talked about it on the show for some time, but I'm officially 100% going.
4234000	4235000	I booked my flight.
4235000	4238000	I'm staying with some podcasting buddies.
4238000	4244000	And I'm going to be spending Thursday through Monday out in the D.C. area.
4244000	4246000	It's not technically in D.C., but it's the D.C. area.
4246000	4248000	I'm flying into the Rainier Airport.
4248000	4249000	You'll have a good time.
4249000	4252000	I'm very excited about it because I had a good time at Rockage out here on the West Coast.
4252000	4259000	And Gabe, who is from the Sac-I-GDA, he works with MAGFest because he's from Jersey.
4259000	4262000	So I've got to talk to him and see what his plans are.
4262000	4264000	Yeah, it's going to be my first MAGFest.
4264000	4265000	I'm really excited about it.
4265000	4266000	So I hope to see you guys there.
4266000	4269000	VOG, OLR, we're not doing anything in official capacity.
4269000	4270000	I kind of signed up too late.
4270000	4272000	I forgot the panel submissions were going to close.
4272000	4274000	I kind of forgot to get on that bandwagon.
4274000	4277000	So we're not really doing anything in an official capacity, but I will be there.
4277000	4281000	And if you're there, we'll plan an unofficial meetup somewhere.
4281000	4284000	Meet me by the Tron machine at 3 p.m. or something.
4284000	4285000	We'll figure something out.
4285000	4288000	We'll tweet on our Twitter account, at OLR.
4290000	4292000	All right, that's all I can think of for housekeeping.
4292000	4294000	Otherwise, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.
4294000	4298000	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.
4298000	4302000	And Google, google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.
4302000	4306000	Let's get into what happened this week in gaming news, starting with Loki.
4306000	4308000	There was a lot for late December, can I just say.
4308000	4310000	There was a lot of news this week.
4310000	4311000	It was crazy.
4311000	4312000	So let's get to it.
4312000	4316000	So apparently Hideo Kojima came off of his vacation.
4318000	4326000	And wasted no time to make the announcement that Kojima Productions is going to be coming back.
4326000	4330000	And they're going to be partnering with Sony for the first title.
4330000	4333000	So that's pretty amazing, actually.
4334000	4338000	Like literally right after signing the deal for that.
4338000	4341000	And it's going to be like a new franchise or a new IP.
4341000	4344000	It's not going to be based off of Metal Gear or Silent Hill.
4344000	4347000	But it should be something great.
4347000	4355000	And apparently as part of that, I think Sony is going to be fronting some money to help kick start that company.
4355000	4356000	So that's kind of cool.
4357000	4362000	Now that they've gone indie though, of course, what's going to happen to Metal Gear?
4362000	4367000	Well, apparently Konami is looking for staff for a new Metal Gear game.
4367000	4376000	Now there's been this post scene I guess that they have seeking people experienced that want to sign up to make a new game.
4376000	4381000	Although it could be, I think this was left over, it might have been from Phantom Pains.
4382000	4387000	But I mean it's still up and so they're still seeking staff for a new Metal Gear title.
4387000	4389000	So I don't know.
4389000	4394000	You have to wonder if they aren't just going to take the Metal Gear IP and do something kind of different with it.
4394000	4396000	Like a pachinko machine.
4396000	4402000	No, maybe experimenting with the online stuff or I don't know.
4402000	4403000	I don't know.
4403000	4410000	I mean like I'm surprised if they are actually still considering doing console games for this.
4411000	4416000	I mean after all the bridges that they burned I'm just surprised that they're like,
4416000	4418000	Hey, we're going to come back.
4418000	4421000	They didn't just burn the bridges, they detonated them.
4421000	4423000	Like is anyone going to give a shit that they came back?
4423000	4429000	It's like, you know, unless there's something really cool to show, I mean I just think no one's going to give a shit.
4429000	4435000	Yeah, Konami's going to have to work real hard to get me to give a shit about whatever's in store for Metal Gear.
4435000	4438000	So that being said, let's talk about Kojima and the Sony thing.
4438000	4441000	So what do y'all think?
4441000	4444000	I think it's exciting. I can't wait to see what he's got.
4444000	4449000	It's a very logical pairing, especially after the very good reception of P.T.
4449000	4454000	But can we talk about how bad I want P.T. to be the thing that he's working on with Sony?
4454000	4458000	It could be. Maybe he's going to work on something that's not Silent Hills but is Silent Hills.
4458000	4459000	But like a scary...
4459000	4465000	And yeah, I realize he can't even really use P.T. because technically Konami paid for that development.
4465000	4467000	So any of the characters, any of the stuff he did...
4467000	4469000	But there wasn't really anything in it, I mean...
4469000	4477000	Yeah, but I don't know. So he can't actually make P.T., but he can make something that's inspired-ish, you know what I mean?
4477000	4482000	I guess I just want Kojima to make a scary game, and I kind of want Guillermo del Toro to be involved as well.
4482000	4489000	So, I mean, yes, he can't make Silent Hills, duh. That's done. But I would be very interested in whatever it is he's making.
4489000	4490000	He's making, yeah, a new franchise.
4490000	4494000	Silent Hill hasn't really been with Silent Hill for a long time anyway, so...
4494000	4500000	I'm kind of okay with that being done with a new franchise. We'll love it just as much.
4500000	4503000	Interesting theory from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
4503000	4509000	ActDeft says, I'm calling it, Kojima will make a Playstation VR game.
4509000	4512000	Could that be what they are going to put him on?
4512000	4514000	Make it, oh god, can you imagine a scary game in VR?
4514000	4517000	I might shit my pants for real, good lord.
4517000	4519000	I don't know, DartSakura? What do you think of all this?
4519000	4520000	I hope not.
4520000	4533000	I hope not. I mean, honestly, I hate speculating on stuff like that because, first of all, we knew he was going to be getting right back into thing after, you know, his contract date was up.
4533000	4539000	Because I knew it wasn't a vacation, it was a separation, a complete separation.
4539000	4543000	And having him pairing up with Sony, like, right away.
4544000	4547000	Oh, Sony took him out on a nice date.
4547000	4556000	Sony played some romance, Sony played some Adele, to some candlelit music, and steak, and Sony sexed him somehow.
4556000	4561000	This wasn't a love hotel, this was a full on host date.
4561000	4563000	It was fucking like, hey, hey, listen.
4563000	4568000	This was Kojima breaking up and going right onto the hookup app to find the next best thing.
4568000	4571000	And Sony's like, me, me, me, me, me.
4571000	4574000	Listen, I know your pimp was treating you bad before, but come on.
4574000	4579000	Well, I'll buy you nice things, you know, you can make whatever you want.
4579000	4580000	You got freedom.
4580000	4587000	Alan Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Sony and Kojima's date was like that Instagram series.
4587000	4589000	He got money.
4589000	4592000	Have you ever seen that? It's funny.
4594000	4600000	At any rate, the only thing I can expect is great things.
4600000	4604000	So when's Konami going to announce that he's actually left the company? Is he still going to be on vacation?
4604000	4608000	Is it going to be a weekend at Bernie's situation where it's like, no, he's still working.
4608000	4611000	See, look, look at all the work he's doing. He's right there.
4611000	4623000	I kind of think when your ex-husband announces they just got married, that kind of insinuates that there was a divorce that happened at some point.
4623000	4625000	I don't think Konami needs to make a statement.
4625000	4635000	I think at this point for Konami to make a statement is just for the Internet's amusement, which Konami is probably not amused that the rest of us are amused, but they really only have themselves to blame at how they've conducted themselves.
4635000	4643000	Like I said, Konami is a PR nightmare right now. I would hate to be in their PR department and none of them had anything to do with it.
4643000	4645000	And Lord knows, they're probably yelling.
4645000	4649000	What needs to happen at Konami, the CEO needs to be dethroned.
4650000	4657000	This is such a fucking mess at this point. The CEO needs to be switched and that's the only way.
4657000	4661000	This is like when Microsoft needed to lose their CEO.
4661000	4671000	Honestly, for everything that Microsoft went through last year or two years ago, it's nothing compared to what Konami is going through.
4671000	4673000	And Don Mattrick lost his job over it.
4673000	4676000	I mean, they'll say it was parted on mutual terms.
4676000	4678000	He lost his job over it.
4682000	4686000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
4686000	4690000	AlanAlchemy, Sony, what do you want to watch?
4690000	4695000	I got Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, Amazon Prime, Kojima, LOL, whose password do you have?
4695000	4697000	Sony, I pay for it all, Kojima.
4697000	4699000	He got money!
4700000	4707000	SSG100Matt says, we'll see if people flip off Konami with their wallet when the new Metal Gear Solid game comes out.
4707000	4708000	I certainly hope they do.
4708000	4711000	Well, you know, how would you feel?
4711000	4716000	Now, I'm going to be like the most ultimate tinfoil hat right now, but just humor me for a minute here.
4716000	4722000	Let's say I get my wish and the management is shaken up severely at Konami.
4722000	4724000	Severe management shakeup.
4724000	4731000	And Konami decides to bring in an outside person that's worked on another big game series to do Metal Gear.
4731000	4733000	Would you have faith at that point?
4733000	4743000	Would you be willing to forgive Konami if Konami basically fired the people that needed to be fired and put in some fresh blood from other places?
4743000	4745000	Would you give Metal Gear Solid a chance at that point?
4745000	4748000	No, because they aren't bringing out a new Dance Dance Revolution game.
4748000	4751000	Oh, come on.
4751000	4753000	I just don't care.
4754000	4762000	Whatmeme says, those people working on new Metal Gear had nothing to do with the nasty split. Don't punish them.
4762000	4765000	Shane in our chat says, how can Konami fire itself?
4765000	4770000	But this stuff happens all the time. Shareholders revolt and demand to the board that it changes.
4770000	4774000	Well, let's put it this way. Let's just see how their Patinko business works.
4774000	4776000	I hope it's as good as they think it is.
4776000	4777000	That's all I'm saying.
4777000	4786000	It's just like betting everything on mobile. I really hope that you don't think that you're going to have the next Angry Birds.
4786000	4790000	Because I'm sorry, whatever game you put out on there is probably not going to be that big.
4790000	4797000	But they might have Metal Gear tap puzzle surprise thing. I don't know. Who knows?
4797000	4799000	It'll be terrible.
4800000	4808000	Chibi Metal Gear, where you drag Solid Snake in a cardboard box through mazes of whimsical obstacles.
4808000	4810000	It's Metal Gear Solid Racing!
4813000	4815000	It's just Snake in a cardboard box.
4815000	4818000	Exactly. It's like a cardboard box derby car.
4820000	4823000	It's like that Boy Scouts event where people build their little cars.
4823000	4824000	Soap box derby.
4824000	4825000	That's it.
4826000	4828000	Metal Gear Solid soap box derby.
4831000	4834000	Sg100Matt, I'll leave it on this. Sg100Matt in chat says,
4834000	4837000	I want them to come out on stage, bow their heads, and say,
4837000	4839000	Hey, we were dicks. Sorry, but we'll change.
4839000	4841000	Well, I don't know about that.
4841000	4842000	Still won't care.
4842000	4843000	Yeah, we'll see.
4843000	4847000	Hey, let's move on though to some other news that happened this past week.
4847000	4851000	Including your Xbox One got enriched with more backwards compatibility.
4852000	4857000	Microsoft making good on their word to add more backwards compatibility each month
4857000	4859000	for the second month in a row.
4859000	4862000	So hopefully this trend will continue into January and February.
4862000	4866000	But some new games available on the Xbox One are
4866000	4873000	Xbox 360 titles like Braid, Deus Ex Human Revolution, Fable 3, Halo Reach,
4873000	4876000	Hydro Thunder, that's I think a favorite of Dark Soccer's,
4876000	4882000	Ms. Pac-Man, Pagle, Portal Still Alive, that was the standalone Portal thing on 360,
4882000	4887000	Splunky, Splosion Man, and Doritos Crash Course.
4887000	4893000	For those of you that were fans of Doritos and their saturation of the gaming market.
4893000	4896000	But yeah, all those games are available now on the Xbox One.
4896000	4898000	So that's pretty cool.
4898000	4901000	By the way, Hydro Thunder is really Dan's thing.
4901000	4903000	Oh, I thought you were into that too.
4903000	4906000	I mean, I was for a hot minute, but Dan was like,
4906000	4910000	he'll still like when he finds a Hydro Thunder machine, he'll be like,
4910000	4913000	Tidal Blade! Damn the torpedoes!
4913000	4916000	What was the game that was like the spiritual successor?
4916000	4918000	H2 Overdrive.
4918000	4920000	That's it, H2 Overdrive.
4920000	4921000	He likes that one too.
4921000	4922000	That game's fun too.
4922000	4923000	Yeah.
4923000	4926000	Anyway, all right, so yeah, turn on your Xbox One and check your games library
4926000	4929000	because you never know what you might have bought on 360.
4929000	4932000	I think that Doritos game was free, so I think a lot of people have that.
4932000	4933000	But yeah, I logged in.
4933000	4935000	I was like, oh, hey, I've got like five new games available.
4935000	4938000	I didn't even realize I bought all this shit.
4940000	4941000	I knew it would pay off someday.
4941000	4942000	That's me looking at my Steam library.
4942000	4943000	Right.
4943000	4944000	Anyhow.
4944000	4951000	So here's a little bit of interesting speculation is that
4951000	4955000	there's been this ongoing question, is Rare Replay coming to Wii U?
4955000	4958000	We finally have an answer.
4958000	4963000	At least Microsoft hasn't said like a definite no.
4963000	4966000	They just said that they hadn't had any information.
4966000	4972000	But Rare spoke up and said it is exclusive to Xbox One.
4972000	4973000	We have the answer.
4973000	4975000	Now people can shut up.
4975000	4977000	That is, I mean, I don't know.
4977000	4979000	It seems a little bit obvious to me that that would be the case,
4979000	4981000	that it's exclusive to Xbox.
4981000	4984000	But maybe people were hoping that a Nintendo release on Wii U
4984000	4988000	would then maybe sub out some of the 360 titles for stuff like
4988000	4989000	Donkey Kong Country.
4989000	4993000	I'm assuming that was the fan wank that started all that.
4993000	4995000	They'd like to think so.
4995000	5000000	But I mean, a good number, though, of those games were on Nintendo consoles before.
5000000	5003000	That's some of the coolest stuff in the pack, like playing Cobra Triangle again.
5003000	5007000	It was half like this is awesome and half actually it's not that awesome.
5007000	5009000	It was just more awesome when I was a kid.
5009000	5015000	But now it's like, sorry, Nintendo players who want to recapture those nostalgia,
5015000	5018000	time to bust out your carts and blow out some dust.
5018000	5021000	That's how you're going to get it on a Nintendo system.
5021000	5024000	But I understand Microsoft kind of wanting to keep those Xbox One exclusives
5024000	5025000	where they can.
5025000	5031000	But at the same time, again, Microsoft working with Nintendo products,
5031000	5032000	not unheard of.
5032000	5034000	I mean, obviously, Minecraft this week, right?
5034000	5035000	That's a Microsoft thing now.
5035000	5037000	And then Viva Pinata was on the 3DS.
5037000	5039000	So Microsoft will do it if, you know.
5039000	5041000	Microsoft will play nice with the other team.
5041000	5042000	Sure.
5042000	5044000	I mean, we've got Office on Mac.
5044000	5045000	I mean, why not?
5045000	5046000	Yeah.
5046000	5048000	I mean, the question is, can they make money?
5048000	5049000	Yes.
5049000	5050000	And that's all that matters is the money.
5050000	5052000	He got money.
5052000	5054000	Yes.
5054000	5056000	Capitalistic paradise here, huh?
5056000	5058000	There's Brad in our chat room.
5058000	5061000	MS got money.
5061000	5063000	Oh, my ticket is getting all wrinkled.
5063000	5064000	What?
5064000	5065000	My ticket.
5065000	5066000	Oh, your movie ticket?
5066000	5067000	Are you one of those people who saves movie tickets?
5067000	5069000	I have movie tickets for years.
5069000	5074000	When I moved out here, I had a bundle of movie tickets from, like, 1989.
5074000	5075000	I don't.
5075000	5077000	And I moved out here in 98.
5077000	5078000	Wow.
5078000	5079000	No, I don't save movie tickets.
5079000	5080000	I do.
5080000	5081000	Because memories.
5081000	5083000	And they go like, haha, sat through that.
5083000	5087000	I knew a person that saved, tangent time, but sorry about it.
5087000	5092000	I knew a person that saved every ticket from when they saw the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
5092000	5093000	That's cool.
5093000	5100000	And they had, like, a binder of, like, 150 tickets from just week after week after week
5100000	5101000	of seeing Rocky Horror.
5101000	5102000	That's cool.
5102000	5103000	Yeah.
5103000	5105000	I did think that was kind of cool, but I was like, dang, like.
5105000	5109000	So you got a binder full of printed paper, but memories.
5109000	5111000	Binder full of women.
5111000	5113000	Yes, binders full of women.
5113000	5117000	Binder full of transsexual Transylvanians.
5117000	5122000	Who knew that that four-year-old joke would work well on the show tonight?
5122000	5125000	Let's travel around the world and check our binders full of release dates.
5125000	5129000	How about binders full of sluts and assholes?
5129000	5131000	I don't think you're going to find those in the release dates.
5131000	5136000	In fact, I think those binders are going to be pretty empty this week leading into Christmas,
5136000	5140000	but let's ask, are there any releases coming out in the U.S. this week?
5140000	5142000	Loki.
5142000	5150000	Yeah, there's a Tales of Legend game that's coming out on PlayStation 3 and the Vita.
5150000	5151000	And that's it?
5151000	5154000	Yeah. I mean, it's the week of Christmas, so.
5154000	5155000	Yeah.
5155000	5157000	Yeah. And that's it.
5157000	5160000	You get only one Exceed RPG this week, and that's it.
5160000	5164000	If your game's not out by now, it's not for the holiday season, I guess.
5164000	5167000	On the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.
5167000	5169000	Now, Christmas is a little different in Japan.
5169000	5173000	You can get a cake, but it's not really quite the same thing it is here.
5173000	5175000	I want a Christmas cake. I just want cake.
5175000	5178000	You know, we usually try to find the restaurant on Christmas.
5178000	5179000	We'll do our little.
5179000	5180000	Yeah, we haven't decided what to do this year.
5180000	5182000	We'll have to figure that out, but maybe we should have cake.
5182000	5184000	But you know what the crappy thing is?
5184000	5185000	What?
5185000	5187000	I have to work the next day, so I can't stay out late.
5187000	5188000	Aww.
5188000	5189000	So.
5189000	5192000	We have to get creative, because we are doing our thing with Alan's family, so I don't know.
5192000	5195000	Why don't we do this? How about Sunday before the show instead?
5195000	5196000	Maybe.
5196000	5200000	We'll do Gay Jumis on Sunday.
5200000	5201000	Will there be cake?
5201000	5202000	We can have cake.
5202000	5204000	Right. It better not be a lie.
5204000	5206000	Or, and places will be open.
5206000	5207000	That's true.
5207000	5208000	So, we can just put it off.
5208000	5209000	We could do cheesecake.
5209000	5210000	We could do cheesecake.
5210000	5212000	Last year we got cheated out of our holiday.
5212000	5214000	You know I love cheesecake.
5214000	5216000	Why don't we do Cheesecake Factory?
5216000	5218000	I even will play Five Nights at Freddy's for cheesecake.
5218000	5220000	Let's do Cheesecake Factory for Gay Jumis.
5220000	5221000	Alright, that works.
5221000	5222000	Okay.
5222000	5223000	Alright.
5223000	5227000	Wattmeme in chat says, there were some digital releases this week.
5227000	5230000	Just curious, why does no LR announce digital releases?
5230000	5231000	That's a good question.
5231000	5233000	It's too hard to keep track of all those.
5233000	5236000	We sometimes will pick that up too in the rapid fire news.
5236000	5243000	We try to sort of, I think for some reason Dark Soccer's has the digital mixed in when she does the UK.
5243000	5247000	But otherwise, Loki and I look at retail stuff so it's a little tricky sometimes.
5247000	5251000	It's too hard to remember everything that's coming out anyways.
5251000	5258000	I basically, I'll go ahead and just say, I basically use Eurogamer as my source and they mix in the UK stuff.
5258000	5263000	I mean until someone can buy me a better UK release thing because game hasn't been super reliable.
5263000	5264000	Right.
5264000	5265000	Okay.
5265000	5267000	Well, let's go to Japan and check out some releases over in Japan.
5267000	5272000	On the PlayStation 4, Assault Suit Lanos is out this week on December the 23rd.
5272000	5277000	God Eater Offshot Twin Pack Volume 3 is also coming out on the PlayStation 4 this week.
5277000	5286000	Going to the PlayStation 3, TV Anime Idolmaster Cinderella G4U Pack Volume 7.
5286000	5290000	Your guess is as good as mine as to what the fuck that is.
5290000	5294000	It's an Idolmaster expansion pack of some sort.
5294000	5296000	This is definitely the week to put something like that out.
5296000	5298000	Volume 7.
5298000	5300000	If you can believe it. Good lord.
5300000	5303000	On the Wii U this week, there is a new game.
5303000	5310000	Geni Ibunroku £FE is out this week.
5310000	5313000	And I think that's actually, the emphasis is on FE in the title.
5313000	5316000	So I think this must be based on some, oh is it Fire Emblem?
5316000	5318000	Is this the Fire Emblem crossover game?
5318000	5319000	That must be what this is.
5319000	5321000	I think this is the Fire Emblem crossover game.
5321000	5324000	That they've been waiting for is finally out on the Wii U this week.
5324000	5325000	You know Rob.
5325000	5327000	Why didn't they just call it Fire Emblem? Then I know what it is.
5327000	5328000	You know what Rob?
5328000	5332000	It could be that given this is so modern, that could be hashtag FE.
5332000	5336000	Yeah, maybe that's what it looks like at first is hashtag FE.
5336000	5338000	But I'm like, eh, I think so.
5338000	5340000	Unless they really like iron.
5340000	5341000	Yeah.
5341000	5344000	You know, because FE, Varus, iron.
5344000	5346000	Well I'm sure some people will be importing that one on the Wii U
5346000	5349000	because I know Fire Emblem has their fans.
5349000	5352000	Going to the PlayStation Vita, Getsui no Kusaro,
5352000	5354000	Sakuran Paranoia comes out this week,
5354000	5357000	as well as Mobile Suit Gundam, Extreme vs. Force,
5357000	5360000	and Storm Lover V comes out on the Vita in Japan this week
5360000	5363000	because Vita in Japan is still a thing.
5363000	5366000	And on the Nintendo 3DS this week, I think this is kind of awesome,
5366000	5372000	Sega 3D Fukoku Archives 1 and 2 Double Pack.
5372000	5376000	This is a collection of all those Sega 3D games they've released,
5376000	5377000	at least in Japan.
5377000	5383000	Get this, Power Drift, Space Harrier, Sonic, Fantasy Zone, Outrun,
5383000	5388000	Fantasy Zone 2, Bare Knuckle, Galaxy Force 2, Shinobi,
5388000	5390000	Echo the Dolphin, Thunder Blade.
5390000	5392000	I mean, that's not even all of them.
5392000	5394000	So that's a heck of a collection.
5394000	5396000	That actually reminds me of something that I learned over the week
5396000	5398000	because it's another game I forgot to mention.
5398000	5401000	Fantasy Zone for PC Engine is kind of crappy.
5401000	5402000	At least the music is.
5402000	5405000	Aw, sorry to hear that. Sorry to hear that.
5405000	5408000	Let's see, Gameguru clarifying the title there.
5408000	5410000	It is, of course, Shin Megami Tensei Crossfire Emblem.
5410000	5411000	That's right, that's what they're calling it here.
5411000	5415000	And Gameguru says the pound is supposed to be a musical sharp symbol.
5415000	5417000	So it's sharp-F-E.
5417000	5419000	I knew that that's what it meant in music,
5419000	5422000	but the last time I think I've heard something like that
5422000	5426000	in regards to a video game was...
5426000	5430000	What was the role-playing game that had all the music...
5430000	5431000	Internal Sonata.
5431000	5433000	Internal Sonata, that was it.
5433000	5436000	That's a really underrated game, I think.
5436000	5438000	History needs to remember that game a little better.
5438000	5439000	That was a really good RPG.
5439000	5441000	There's so much musical innuendo in that game.
5441000	5443000	Yeah, it fell a little flat, didn't it?
5446000	5450000	Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.
5450000	5453000	Dark Sakura will be sacked after tonight's episode.
5453000	5455000	I'd like to apologize to all the listeners
5455000	5458000	that had to deal with that punishment just then.
5458000	5460000	Am I in trouble?
5460000	5462000	You are in big trouble.
5462000	5465000	You just got moved to Santa's naughty list.
5467000	5470000	Alright, let's go to the UK release dates.
5470000	5474000	I'll just play myself a little sad song on my piano.
5474000	5476000	It's not really my forte, though.
5479000	5481000	I hate her so much, you guys.
5482000	5485000	Allow me to break out a little more fortissimo
5485000	5487000	and I'll do my part now.
5489000	5491000	I've been here for seven years.
5491000	5493000	The medication doesn't work.
5493000	5495000	I know, it fell on its base.
5496000	5498000	Shut up and read the release dates.
5498000	5500000	Gee, Rob.
5500000	5502000	That was also a music joke, too.
5502000	5504000	The chatters are yelling, stop.
5504000	5506000	She must be stopped.
5506000	5508000	Well, better a stop than a repeat, right?
5508000	5510000	We could just do that.
5510000	5512000	Read release dates.
5512000	5514000	I will end you.
5514000	5516000	There's one.
5516000	5518000	One.
5518000	5520000	In my magnum opus of puns.
5520000	5523000	December 30th is story of seasons for 3DS.
5525000	5527000	Finny.
5529000	5532000	Just a couple more quick stories for you guys
5532000	5534000	and we're going to get to the classic game of the week.
5534000	5536000	Loki.
5536000	5538000	Another Smash Direct this week.
5538000	5540000	Isn't this the last one they're doing?
5540000	5542000	Last one ever.
5542000	5544000	The way they end it with, of course,
5544000	5546000	adding Bayonetta.
5546000	5548000	Bayonetta is going to be joining the Smash Bros. roster in the game.
5548000	5550000	Allow me to join what?
5550000	5552000	What?
5552000	5554000	What?
5554000	5556000	What?
5556000	5558000	What?
5558000	5560000	What?
5560000	5562000	What?
5562000	5564000	What?
5564000	5566000	And allow me to join what Twitter said
5566000	5568000	in response to this this week.
5568000	5570000	Yes!
5570000	5572000	Because that was basically my entire
5572000	5574000	Twitter feed during that conference.
5574000	5576000	It was just one great, big
5576000	5578000	yes!
5578000	5580000	I'm super happy they put her original outfit.
5580000	5582000	I'm sure you're looking forward to the eventual amiibo that will be coming out.
5582000	5584000	Oh, yeah. The Bayonetta amiibo is almost better news
5584000	5586000	than Bayonetta being in the game, to be honest.
5586000	5588000	But yeah, I'm with Dark Soccer.
5588000	5590000	I like the fact that they have both the Bayonetta 1 and 2 outfits in it.
5590000	5592000	I want, though,
5592000	5594000	the amiibo to be the original Bayonetta
5594000	5596000	as well, because I really do not like
5596000	5598000	her second game look.
5598000	5600000	We'll see.
5600000	5602000	I would pick up the game if it was discounted,
5602000	5604000	but it's not.
5604000	5606000	Also, they're adding
5606000	5608000	Corrin from Fire Emblem as well.
5608000	5610000	And so that's going to be, they have
5610000	5612000	like, how many people from Fire Emblem
5612000	5614000	now in this game? I mean, seriously.
5614000	5616000	I don't even know her.
5616000	5618000	I've never played Fire Emblem.
5618000	5620000	There were a lot of people that were like,
5620000	5622000	really? More Fire Emblem?
5622000	5624000	But at the same time, I'm kind of like,
5624000	5626000	I'm of two mindsets. I mean, there's a part
5626000	5628000	of me that's like, okay, yeah, maybe I would have
5628000	5630000	liked to see somebody a little more well-known,
5630000	5632000	but at the same time, if Corrin
5632000	5634000	is a solid character that they believe
5634000	5636000	in, I mean, shouldn't she be allowed a chance
5636000	5638000	to shine? It is a fighting game.
5638000	5640000	It makes sense that you have sword wielders
5640000	5642000	in it. And there's a shit ton
5642000	5644000	of Pokemon and Mario characters, so
5644000	5646000	what's another Fire Emblem character, especially
5646000	5648000	with Japan? But they've got like
5648000	5650000	six. Cloud,
5650000	5652000	Final Fantasy, Bayonetta,
5652000	5654000	like, they couldn't
5654000	5656000	have said, instead of, okay, let's put a, like,
5656000	5658000	the 15th Fire Emblem character in there.
5658000	5660000	They could have, like, said, how about we do
5660000	5662000	whatever? It seems like 15.
5662000	5664000	Um, they could have
5664000	5666000	just like, hey, let's put, like, Birdo
5666000	5668000	in there or something, or say, hey, how about a
5668000	5670000	character from fucking Super Mario Brothers 2?
5670000	5672000	Anybody.
5672000	5674000	At this point, I'm wondering why they don't do a Fire Emblem
5674000	5676000	fighting game. The chatroom is correcting
5676000	5678000	me on something. Corrin, like several
5678000	5680000	of the other Fire Emblem characters, can be
5680000	5682000	either male or female. I'm using
5682000	5684000	female pronouns, because that's how it was presented
5684000	5686000	in the video, if I'm not mistaken. So,
5686000	5688000	that's what kind of associ- I know it's both. Yes, I know
5688000	5690000	that's what I'm saying. It's both. No, no, no. In the video that I saw,
5690000	5692000	um, Corrin started off male and was kept
5692000	5694000	being referred to as Big Brother, Big Brother, Big Brother.
5694000	5696000	Oh. Now Big Brother's
5696000	5698000	Big Sister, and that's even better!
5698000	5700000	I laughed so much.
5700000	5702000	So, just, just so y'all
5702000	5704000	can stop writing the emails. I, uh, they,
5704000	5706000	it was the same thing that Robin does, where you can be
5706000	5708000	boy or girl. That's cool, but, once again,
5708000	5710000	you know, I'd rather, like,
5710000	5712000	some more obscure characters.
5712000	5714000	Hey, let's put Captain Rainbow in there, or
5714000	5716000	fucking, like, you know,
5716000	5718000	anybody from Super Mario Brothers 2.
5718000	5720000	Here's the thing. If that had
5720000	5722000	been the note they ended on, then I think
5722000	5724000	a lot of us would be like, oh,
5724000	5726000	okay, cool.
5726000	5728000	But, the fact that they said, okay, here's
5728000	5730000	Corrin, and then here's fucking Bayonetta,
5730000	5732000	like, it's like, oh, okay, cool, cool.
5732000	5734000	Yeah, I'm in, I'm in. Like, you know,
5734000	5736000	Corrin's just kind of like, oh, it's just like a little bit,
5736000	5738000	it's a cherry on top, but Bayonetta, hmm.
5738000	5740000	That's gonna be a lot of fun.
5740000	5742000	Bayonetta is luscious.
5742000	5744000	No, I can't freaking wait.
5744000	5746000	I didn't download Cloud yet, though. I was,
5746000	5748000	I was so busy playing Xenoblade
5748000	5750000	and even Mario Maker, I didn't even talk about it during my gaming week,
5750000	5752000	but I was catching up on all the Mario Maker
5752000	5754000	event stages, because I have to get all those
5754000	5756000	new costumes, right? Like the badge arcade bunny
5756000	5758000	and all that stuff. I'm sure, I think we'll talk about that later.
5758000	5760000	I haven't gotten that one yet. They only had a few,
5760000	5762000	I didn't have that latest update when I checked
5762000	5764000	it last, so I only got the car
5764000	5766000	and,
5766000	5768000	I forget, I don't,
5768000	5770000	I got the cat thing from
5770000	5772000	Monster Hunter and
5772000	5774000	I'm almost positive
5774000	5776000	you have a story on it after the break, so it'll probably jog
5776000	5778000	your memory. No, no, I saw that.
5778000	5780000	I'm just saying, I didn't play those levels,
5780000	5782000	the new ones, so I must have
5782000	5784000	done it before they put those up.
5784000	5786000	But,
5786000	5788000	yeah, you know, the developers,
5788000	5790000	they made a solid game. If Corrin is the
5790000	5792000	character they believe in and want to have in the game, they
5792000	5794000	are more than welcome to do it. Cool.
5794000	5796000	I want there to be a
5796000	5798000	Pokemon game that plays like Smash.
5798000	5800000	Uh, Pokken, well, it doesn't
5800000	5802000	really play like Smash, I guess, but you kind of
5802000	5804000	have a fighting Pokemon game coming at
5804000	5806000	Pokken Tournament.
5806000	5808000	Maybe not what you had in mind.
5808000	5810000	Also, Mii costumes, right?
5810000	5812000	Because I know some people are getting excited about
5812000	5814000	some of those. They're going to have the Mii costumes
5814000	5816000	they had, um,
5816000	5818000	I was kind of disappointed that they didn't put any
5818000	5820000	Mario RPG stuff like actual characters,
5820000	5822000	but they have got, um, I want to say the
5822000	5824000	Geno costume. Yeah. Um, they
5824000	5826000	had also, you know, stuff from
5826000	5828000	you could do, uh,
5828000	5830000	was it a chocobo?
5830000	5832000	And then they also had, like, uh, the Sonic
5832000	5834000	characters, like Knuckles, Tails,
5834000	5836000	um,
5836000	5838000	so that looked pretty cool. And then they have the Mii
5838000	5840000	costumes now. Bionic armor
5840000	5842000	from Brawler, or for the Brawler,
5842000	5844000	let's see, um, Gil from
5844000	5846000	the Tower of Druaga.
5846000	5848000	And, let's
5848000	5850000	see, Ashley from WarioWare, right?
5850000	5852000	Ashley from WarioWare.
5852000	5854000	And, uh, Takamura from
5854000	5856000	Nazo, no,
5856000	5858000	I don't even know what the fuck the series was.
5858000	5860000	I'm not even going to bother. Sorry, you tried.
5860000	5862000	But Geno, though, seriously, Geno would have been awesome.
5862000	5864000	Yeah, I gotta say, I think the one thing
5864000	5866000	I was seeing about the
5866000	5868000	Corrin thing is that people were like,
5868000	5870000	couldn't we have gotten Geno instead of Corrin?
5870000	5872000	Do you remember Nazo, what do you mean, Nazo no
5872000	5874000	Yeah, I don't know what that is.
5874000	5876000	It means it's a mysterious girlfriend.
5876000	5878000	Wow, that cleared it up.
5878000	5880000	Well,
5880000	5882000	look, uh, um,
5882000	5884000	here's, here's the other thing, you
5884000	5886000	kind of talk about Super Mario RPG.
5886000	5888000	Uh, a couple years ago, I would have said
5888000	5890000	no way, no how, you're never getting a sequel to that game.
5890000	5892000	Square and Nintendo are not going to be back in bed together.
5892000	5894000	But, now that we've got
5894000	5896000	Cloud for Smash Brothers,
5896000	5898000	Geno shows up as a costume,
5898000	5900000	rumors gaining steam that
5900000	5902000	Square is somehow heavily involved with NX.
5902000	5904000	Y'all,
5904000	5906000	I'm just saying, could you imagine,
5906000	5908000	could you, tinfoil hat time.
5908000	5910000	This is Rob's dream.
5912000	5914000	E3 2016.
5914000	5916000	Nintendo NX.
5916000	5918000	It's fucking coming.
5918000	5920000	Reggie Fils-Aime is out on stage,
5920000	5922000	he punches a kid in the face, he's like,
5922000	5924000	this is going to be so fucking rad.
5924000	5926000	And then, he says, and guess what title
5926000	5928000	we're launching with?
5928000	5930000	Mario RPG 2.
5930000	5932000	I mean,
5932000	5934000	there's, there's not
5934000	5936000	enough Kleenex in the world
5936000	5938000	to scoop up all the you know what
5938000	5940000	that would be out there if that were
5940000	5942000	to be the big announcement at
5942000	5944000	NX. I'm just saying.
5946000	5948000	You know, that sounds like a great idea.
5948000	5950000	In my head, it's fabulous.
5950000	5952000	It's fabulous, and then they're like, and here's
5952000	5954000	the controller. Oh, it's a fucking mobile
5954000	5956000	touch screen with no fucking buttons!
5956000	5958000	Because we don't fucking get it.
5958000	5960000	And then we'd be like,
5960000	5962000	damn you! No!
5962000	5964000	I am not purchasing that.
5966000	5968000	So, Nintendo,
5968000	5970000	so in your dream, Loki. No, seriously,
5970000	5972000	like, I watched, like,
5972000	5974000	just on a TV show, like, I'm having this
5974000	5976000	dream, and I'm so pleasantly asleep,
5976000	5978000	and then Loki comes in and ruins my dream.
5978000	5980000	Well, no, it's like, you get the game
5980000	5982000	you've always wanted, and then they fuck it up!
5982000	5984000	They, yeah, because, well, seriously though,
5984000	5986000	I watched, like, I watched one of those Did You Know
5986000	5988000	Gaming things, and they were talking about the Wii U and stuff,
5988000	5990000	and, like, we've heard the story before
5990000	5992000	about, like, when they were talking about the online and everything,
5992000	5994000	and how, oh, hey, we've never,
5994000	5996000	we have no fucking experience with what the Playstation
5996000	5998000	Network and Xbox Live are, or how
5998000	6000000	to create an infrastructure, and just
6000000	6002000	boggles my mind that
6002000	6004000	with the launch of the Wii U, they
6004000	6006000	didn't fucking know anything about that
6006000	6008000	shit. And I mean, even now,
6008000	6010000	it's a little bit better, but that kind of
6010000	6012000	scares me, what we're going into with
6012000	6014000	NX. Like, you would think, okay, they
6014000	6016000	should really have a handle on how to run
6016000	6018000	the, you know, the structure of everything.
6018000	6020000	I mean, they just started doing DLC, what,
6020000	6022000	like, a year or two ago?
6022000	6024000	I mean, I'm just like,
6024000	6026000	I hope it's good. I hope
6026000	6028000	it's good, but I'm worried that they
6028000	6030000	don't get it, and it's
6030000	6032000	gonna be fucked up somehow.
6032000	6034000	Alright, sst200maddenchat says,
6034000	6036000	I dream of having Twitch stream of Loki's
6036000	6038000	live reaction of the NX announcement.
6038000	6040000	This is why they invented Periscope.
6040000	6042000	Are they announcing it this year? Because I'm seriously thinking about taking
6042000	6044000	off time for E3 this year.
6044000	6046000	I think 2016, I think
6046000	6048000	E3 will be the big announcement. I think
6048000	6050000	there's so much hype
6050000	6052000	going into this, I can't see how they don't
6052000	6054000	announce it at the next E3. We'll see.
6054000	6056000	Let's see, also
6056000	6058000	actdeft trying to sell
6058000	6060000	Dark Sakura on Pokken,
6060000	6062000	saying Pokken isn't like
6062000	6064000	Smash, but it's like Tekken.
6064000	6066000	And Dark Sakura loves Tekken.
6066000	6068000	So... I don't know if I'm feeling
6068000	6070000	it with, uh,
6070000	6072000	Pokken, though. Alright.
6072000	6074000	And Dark Tetsuya says, I just want a date and title
6074000	6076000	on Zelda games. Ah, Zelda U. Man,
6076000	6078000	who saw, um,
6078000	6080000	Akuma, um, in
6080000	6082000	the new Tekken? Oh, yeah.
6082000	6084000	Oh my god. I was like...
6084000	6086000	That was random. I know.
6086000	6088000	It's random, but it's like,
6088000	6090000	what the fuck did happen to Tekken
6090000	6092000	Cross Street Fighter? I mean, it's like, hey, you have
6092000	6094000	Street Fighter in there now. Maybe.
6094000	6096000	Where's the rest of it? Maybe that's it.
6096000	6098000	I just kind of gurgled a little bit.
6098000	6100000	You know what it is? It's fucking Tekken 7
6100000	6102000	with the Tekken Cross Street Fighter
6102000	6104000	DLC.
6106000	6108000	Be careful what you wish for.
6108000	6110000	That is, I don't know, I'm gonna
6110000	6112000	upgrade that from tinfoil hat to, like,
6112000	6114000	paper mache hat, because that is
6114000	6116000	a lot more realistic, I think, that
6116000	6118000	concept. Just saying.
6118000	6120000	Anyhow, uh, let's move
6120000	6122000	on. Let's talk about, uh,
6122000	6124000	one big thing that's been developing the past couple weeks
6124000	6126000	is Sony releasing more
6126000	6128000	PlayStation 2 games on the PlayStation 4.
6128000	6130000	Did you know that Parappa 2
6130000	6132000	came out in the week that, uh, we've been off?
6132000	6134000	No, it was just this past week, actually.
6134000	6136000	Parappa the Rapa 2 is now available on PlayStation 4.
6136000	6138000	That's kind of cool. Um, well, anyway,
6138000	6140000	uh, Sony's been doing a campaign on
6140000	6142000	Twitter where you can use the hashtag
6142000	6144000	PS2PS4.
6144000	6146000	Get it? Because PS2...
6146000	6148000	It's like the play on the number 2.
6148000	6150000	They're not putting PlayStation games on the PlayStation 4.
6150000	6152000	That doesn't make any sense.
6152000	6154000	Shut up.
6154000	6156000	Alright, anyway, so, uh, using that hashtag,
6156000	6158000	uh, they are, uh, Dave
6158000	6160000	Thatch with Sony is tracking
6160000	6162000	what the popular suggestions are to figure out
6162000	6164000	what games should be brought over
6164000	6166000	to the PS4 yet. Uh,
6166000	6168000	some of the games that, uh, have been noticed
6168000	6170000	have been, I guess, trending a little bit.
6170000	6172000	Tekken, SOCOM, Fatal
6172000	6174000	Frame, Timesplitters,
6174000	6176000	Simpsons Hit and Run, God Hand,
6176000	6178000	Persona 3, Dragon Quest,
6178000	6180000	and Kingdom Hearts. Now, Timesplitters
6180000	6182000	2 would be good. Let's please do
6182000	6184000	Timesplitters 2. I can't believe that Final Fantasy
6184000	6186000	12 would not be on
6186000	6188000	that list, because... Well, Final Fantasy 12
6188000	6190000	already got an HD remake that's already,
6190000	6192000	well, no, actually it didn't. I was like, it did,
6192000	6194000	because I've been asleep there, because I don't think it has.
6194000	6196000	Are they doing that? Uh, no.
6196000	6198000	Everything's been quiet on Final Fantasy 12.
6198000	6200000	Um, the game I want,
6200000	6202000	most of all, Katamari Damacy.
6202000	6204000	We just talked about it. It was a classic game of the week
6204000	6206000	a couple weeks ago. You know what I want? That's the one I want.
6206000	6208000	I want the games that I fucking purchased
6208000	6210000	already to be fucking available, is what
6210000	6212000	I want. I want that shit to fucking
6212000	6214000	just work without having me buy that
6214000	6216000	shit again.
6216000	6218000	Oh, Loki, you're asking for
6218000	6220000	too much. Apparently.
6230000	6232000	Alright, let's go to the classic game
6232000	6234000	of the week. We're gonna take a walk down
6234000	6236000	memory lane to a time...
6236000	6238000	The games did not have DLC.
6238000	6240000	There was not a separate DLC
6240000	6242000	adventure. There was no patch.
6242000	6244000	It was just, this is the game you get.
6244000	6246000	Take it or leave it.
6246000	6248000	In fact, this is the game that our system comes
6248000	6250000	with, right, Darsakra?
6250000	6252000	Sort of. Not necessarily.
6252000	6254000	Not at the beginning. Alright.
6254000	6256000	Let's get to it. What is the classic game of the week,
6256000	6258000	Darsakra? The classic game of the week is
6258000	6260000	Bonk's Adventure. Yay.
6260000	6262000	It was run by Red
6262000	6264000	Company and Atlas.
6264000	6266000	It came out in 1989 in Japan
6266000	6268000	and 1990 in North America
6268000	6270000	for the TurboGrafx-16.
6270000	6272000	Now, as we all know,
6272000	6274000	the TurboGrafx-16 in Japan was
6274000	6276000	called the PC Engine.
6276000	6278000	When this game came out in Japan, it was
6278000	6280000	called PC Genjin
6280000	6282000	because it sounded like
6282000	6284000	PC Engine, sort of.
6284000	6286000	And it has come out,
6286000	6288000	it was re-released
6288000	6290000	in the US in 1992 on
6290000	6292000	the Gates of Thunder 4
6292000	6294000	in one game CD-ROM,
6294000	6296000	and actually another
6296000	6298000	pretty good
6298000	6300000	TurboGrafx game.
6300000	6302000	It had ports for the NES, Game Boy,
6302000	6304000	and Amiga and different
6304000	6306000	other systems under some different
6306000	6308000	titles like FC Genjin,
6308000	6310000	GB Genjin, and VC Genjin.
6310000	6312000	And it was
6312000	6314000	out on Virtual Console and
6314000	6316000	on PlayStation Store.
6316000	6318000	There's even a mobile version in Japan
6318000	6320000	for phones.
6320000	6322000	Basically, your main character is Bonk,
6322000	6324000	who has a very, very big head.
6324000	6326000	And unbelievably,
6326000	6328000	his head's bigger
6328000	6330000	than the orange on a toothpick kid's head
6330000	6332000	from So I Married an Axe Murderer.
6332000	6334000	That's pretty big.
6334000	6336000	So he's a bald cave boy
6336000	6338000	who basically
6338000	6340000	fights dinosaurs and other different
6340000	6342000	prehistoric-type enemies
6342000	6344000	with his head.
6344000	6346000	His unbreakable, invincible
6346000	6348000	head. He basically has Luke Cage
6348000	6350000	for a head, except
6350000	6352000	without being that awesome.
6352000	6354000	So he has to rescue Princess Zaa,
6354000	6356000	who is a pink
6356000	6358000	playasaur-type
6358000	6360000	dinosaur lady, from King
6360000	6362000	to Jewel, who is a Tyrannosaurus
6362000	6364000	style. In the arcade
6364000	6366000	version, Bonk also has
6366000	6368000	a female version of himself
6368000	6370000	that you can play as.
6370000	6372000	So anyway, Bonk basically hits things
6372000	6374000	with his head.
6374000	6376000	Bonk's health, he starts off with
6376000	6378000	three hearts, and they can be
6378000	6380000	depleted as he takes damage,
6380000	6382000	and he has three extra lives.
6382000	6384000	But he can restore
6384000	6386000	his life by eating fruits and vegetables.
6386000	6388000	See what they did to their kids?
6388000	6390000	He can also get
6390000	6392000	pieces of meat as power-ups.
6392000	6394000	They give him different special abilities and make him stronger.
6394000	6396000	So he gets his normal self
6396000	6398000	for the first stage. The second stage,
6398000	6400000	he can stun enemies by pounding on the
6400000	6402000	ground. And the third stage, he becomes temporarily
6402000	6404000	invulnerable. He gets
6404000	6406000	his big meat and small meat.
6406000	6408000	So he's an equal meat eater.
6412000	6414000	So when the third stage of meat power
6414000	6416000	wears off, he goes back to the second
6416000	6418000	stage, and then he goes back to regular Bonk.
6418000	6420000	He also can get different
6420000	6422000	power-ups that will refill his health,
6422000	6424000	or a large red heart that
6424000	6426000	restores all of his health.
6426000	6428000	There's also blue heart power-ups that
6428000	6430000	will increase his heart health by
6430000	6432000	one heart.
6432000	6434000	So the game, I mean,
6434000	6436000	it...
6436000	6438000	The other thing about naming it PC Genjin
6438000	6440000	is that Genjin is also Japanese
6440000	6442000	for caveman. So...
6442000	6444000	It works in two different ways.
6444000	6446000	It's a fun pun, guys.
6446000	6448000	Um...
6448000	6450000	It was
6450000	6452000	meant to be called a From Right PC Kid.
6452000	6454000	Um...
6454000	6456000	But they never called it
6456000	6458000	the PC Engine in the US.
6458000	6460000	So, um,
6460000	6462000	and I doubt they could have called it, like,
6462000	6464000	Turbo Boy or something.
6464000	6466000	So they called it
6466000	6468000	Bonk's Adventure. Um...
6468000	6470000	The game has always been, um,
6470000	6472000	Bonk's Adventure here in the US.
6472000	6474000	Um, in 2003, Hudson did
6474000	6476000	a 3D remake of Bonk's Adventure
6476000	6478000	in the Hudson Selection games
6478000	6480000	that came out only in Japan on PlayStation 2
6480000	6482000	and GameCube.
6482000	6484000	Um, but yeah, Bonk
6484000	6486000	was basically, like, the big
6486000	6488000	character used to
6488000	6490000	advertise, um,
6490000	6492000	the TurboGrafx-16 in the US
6492000	6494000	around the mid-90s.
6494000	6496000	Um, and I do believe that
6496000	6498000	yeah, Bonk was used as a launch title
6498000	6500000	for a while, wasn't it?
6500000	6502000	I want to say it was,
6502000	6504000	because I think my buddy had a TurboGrafx-16
6504000	6506000	and I think he had this game
6506000	6508000	and I feel like he got them together.
6508000	6510000	And I don't know if that was just, you know, Santa brought them both, but...
6510000	6512000	I want to say that when the TurboGrafx
6512000	6514000	came out, it was Keith Courage
6514000	6516000	or, um...
6516000	6518000	Might have been Keith Courage, was actually the packing game.
6518000	6520000	But then this, I think it's like one of those things
6520000	6522000	kind of like Sega and Sonic.
6522000	6524000	Like, once Sonic really took off, they started packing that in.
6524000	6526000	Well, but keep in mind, I think that one of the
6526000	6528000	other big ones that kind of was used for
6528000	6530000	advertising was Air Zonk.
6530000	6532000	Remember? Yeah, yeah, I do.
6532000	6534000	Um, which, uh,
6534000	6536000	I mean, all really, you know, decent games.
6536000	6538000	Um, so Husband was
6538000	6540000	uh, Husband, why am I saying Husband?
6540000	6542000	Because Dam was playing this too.
6542000	6544000	Um, Hudson
6544000	6546000	um, was also working
6546000	6548000	on a reboot to
6548000	6550000	uh, call it Bonk, Brink of Extinction
6550000	6552000	for WiiWare and PSN,
6552000	6554000	but when, uh,
6554000	6556000	Hudson closed, uh,
6556000	6558000	it went into limbo, um...
6558000	6560000	And who bought Hudson,
6560000	6562000	boys and girls? Who bought Hudson?
6562000	6564000	Who's done nothing with this?
6564000	6566000	Konami! Correct!
6566000	6568000	I just
6568000	6570000	was, I couldn't even bring
6570000	6572000	myself to... Their name is forbidden from
6572000	6574000	my lips.
6574000	6576000	Unless it's old, old Konami.
6576000	6578000	Yes. Old Konami.
6578000	6580000	Sigh.
6580000	6582000	Um, so anyway, um,
6582000	6584000	it, uh,
6584000	6586000	was supposed to be getting
6586000	6588000	a Wii U Virtual Console release.
6588000	6590000	This was announced on October 19th
6590000	6592000	this year, but
6592000	6594000	no one
6594000	6596000	said anything?
6596000	6598000	But the rating
6598000	6600000	out there was supposed to, um, also
6600000	6602000	indicate, uh, PS3 and PSP.
6602000	6604000	So, that it was
6604000	6606000	uh, supposed to be the TurboGrafx version.
6606000	6608000	Which is the better version.
6608000	6610000	You know. But that's it.
6610000	6612000	Bonk's adventure. Here it is.
6612000	6614000	It is on the regular Wii Virtual Console.
6614000	6616000	I have it there. It is. Because the folks in chat are talking
6616000	6618000	about like, well, how do I play this game?
6618000	6620000	Somebody said, I didn't ever own a console that this was on.
6620000	6622000	But I'm pretty sure it's on the regular
6622000	6624000	Wii Virtual Console, which remember, you can boot
6624000	6626000	your Wii U into Wii mode to get that
6626000	6628000	game. I mean, it's kind of a pain, but you can do it.
6628000	6630000	I will tell you this. If you can get your hands on the
6630000	6632000	TurboGrafx, finding a copy
6632000	6634000	of Bonk is not difficult.
6634000	6636000	It's not a rare game.
6636000	6638000	Um, it's just, you know, the problem
6638000	6640000	is finding, as they called them in the U.S.
6640000	6642000	TurboChips, or the HuCards
6642000	6644000	for the PC Engine, um,
6644000	6646000	the
6646000	6648000	uh, um, you know, you can
6648000	6650000	get ROMs for some of
6650000	6652000	these things. Um, there is
6652000	6654000	I think a licensed, I think
6654000	6656000	it's a licensed emulator, don't quote me, but
6656000	6658000	Magic Engine, which has been out for
6658000	6660000	a while. Um, and it's
6660000	6662000	got like full arcade card support and everything
6662000	6664000	and will play HuCard
6664000	6666000	um, uh, TurboChip
6666000	6668000	games, any of them. You just like,
6668000	6670000	though for the, the Duo games,
6670000	6672000	you actually have to have the, the disc
6672000	6674000	to play. But you know,
6674000	6676000	which, as you have to say, we,
6676000	6678000	we got our Turbo EverDrive. And the one
6678000	6680000	thing that has actually kind of made me sad is
6680000	6682000	that we had heard a rumor
6682000	6684000	that it was going to let you do arcade
6684000	6686000	card stuff so that we can
6686000	6688000	play some of our arcade card, um,
6688000	6690000	Duo games. Like, um,
6690000	6692000	what is the one we have?
6692000	6694000	Uh, one of the Fatal Fury games I know we have for
6694000	6696000	uh,
6696000	6698000	the arcade card CD. And I think our other one is Strider.
6698000	6700000	Um, for PC
6700000	6702000	Engine, uh, uh,
6702000	6704000	arcade card games. And
6704000	6706000	it doesn't work for that. So if that's what you're
6706000	6708000	looking for, it's not going to work.
6708000	6710000	So we're kind of back to
6710000	6712000	trying to find a U.S.
6712000	6714000	compatible version of the arcade card
6714000	6716000	or the Duo add-on for
6716000	6718000	the core graphics. Gotcha.
6718000	6720000	Alright. Oh well. Well there
6720000	6722000	it is. Your classic game of the week
6722000	6724000	Bonks Adventure. A
6724000	6726000	very, very classic Turbo graphics
6726000	6728000	title or PC Engine, depending on what country
6728000	6730000	you are in. On that note, we are
6730000	6732000	going to take a quick break. Uh, take
6732000	6734000	a moment here to stretch and refill
6734000	6736000	our drinks here in the OLR studio. And
6736000	6738000	so forth. When we come back though, there's
6738000	6740000	plenty more Orange Laundry to come, including
6740000	6742000	rapid fire news.
6742000	6744000	The Fookle Question of the Week, which is about
6744000	6746000	sports ball, in honor of our guest
6746000	6748000	this week. And we're going to get to the mailbag,
6748000	6750000	the FUs of the Week, and
6750000	6752000	hopefully your calls, although with
6752000	6754000	the Skype rig tonight, I don't know
6754000	6756000	how well that's going to work. So we're going to try
6756000	6758000	though. All we come back with more
6758000	6760000	of Orange Lounge Radio right after
6760000	6762000	this.
6762000	6768000	Welcome
6768000	6770000	back everybody to Orange Lounge
6770000	6772000	Radio. Live tonight on December
6772000	6774000	20th of 2015, with
6774000	6776000	episode number 624
6776000	6778000	of our show already
6778000	6780000	in progress in the middle here
6780000	6782000	of the holiday season. Get into full gear.
6782000	6784000	I know a lot of folks celebrating
6784000	6786000	Christmas in the next week, so Merry Christmas
6786000	6788000	to those that celebrate. Um, next
6788000	6790000	week will be the last show of 2015
6790000	6792000	if you can believe it. And I'm sure
6792000	6794000	we'll be taking a look back on the year in gaming.
6794000	6796000	Maybe looking back at some of our favorites
6796000	6798000	of the year and some things that weren't
6798000	6800000	so great in the past year. We will be running
6800000	6802000	over all of that next week on episode
6802000	6804000	625. A nice kind of
6804000	6806000	round number. A multiple
6806000	6808000	of 25, I suppose, to end the
6808000	6810000	year on. So that'll all be next week
6810000	6812000	on the show. But let's get back into the news from
6812000	6814000	this week with some rapid fire
6814000	6816000	news. Loki. Hey, there's
6816000	6818000	a new game from the people that made
6818000	6820000	Flappy Bird. It's called
6820000	6822000	Swingcopters 2. The people?
6822000	6824000	The person. Whatever. The one
6824000	6826000	dude. The people that play the game.
6826000	6828000	Who did not like being famous. That made it popular to
6828000	6830000	get him to make another one.
6830000	6832000	People. Anyways, so
6832000	6834000	um, Don Nguyen, he
6834000	6836000	went ahead and made a new game. It was a sequel to
6836000	6838000	one of his previous games, Swingcopters.
6838000	6840000	And now it's out and you can play
6840000	6842000	it. Yay. It's free still
6842000	6844000	and ad supported. Yeah.
6844000	6846000	Alright. And this
6846000	6848000	is like, seriously,
6848000	6850000	I'm surprised I'm actually seeing
6850000	6852000	his company name. And
6852000	6854000	I guess not surprised that it's coming to the
6854000	6856000	Wii U. But apparently Napster,
6856000	6858000	that's right, the previous
6858000	6860000	file sharing
6860000	6862000	music site that turned
6862000	6864000	legit is now
6864000	6866000	going to be coming to the Wii U as
6866000	6868000	a free app on December 17th.
6868000	6870000	And it also has
6870000	6872000	a 30 day trial.
6872000	6874000	And then you can, I
6874000	6876000	guess there's different promotions. If you want
6876000	6878000	to subscribe for three months, you can get
6878000	6880000	pay a dollar. Otherwise
6880000	6882000	it's $9.99 a month.
6882000	6884000	No thanks.
6884000	6886000	But I'll be coming to the Wii U
6886000	6888000	if you want to check that out.
6888000	6890000	And last but not least,
6890000	6892000	Mario Maker is getting some updates.
6892000	6894000	So there's going to be some
6894000	6896000	three elements added in a new
6896000	6898000	free update. These include
6898000	6900000	being able to
6900000	6902000	have an alternate for the
6902000	6904000	spike wheel. And so instead of the grinder,
6904000	6906000	you can actually turn it into a
6906000	6908000	bumper. It kind of looks like a donut
6908000	6910000	or like an inflatable inner tube
6910000	6912000	or something. Like a pinball bumper type of thing.
6912000	6914000	Yeah, basically something that you bump off of.
6914000	6916000	Also they've got
6916000	6918000	doors that are activated, warp doors
6918000	6920000	that are activated by a P-switch. And you
6920000	6922000	can do that by shaking the door.
6922000	6924000	Oh, like ghost houses. I didn't realize
6924000	6926000	that was missing. I guess that's...
6926000	6928000	I was just going to say, I can't wait for that
6928000	6930000	level that's nothing but like Mario
6930000	6932000	getting bumped around from start to finish.
6932000	6934000	That's just going to be like the bounce house
6934000	6936000	or something. Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.
6936000	6938000	Because you know that level's coming.
6938000	6940000	And then the Koopa Clown Car is getting a
6940000	6942000	version that shoots fire. And you can
6942000	6944000	shoot like fireballs and then I guess
6944000	6946000	you can charge shot and destroy
6946000	6948000	blocks with it or something. Cool! More fire!
6948000	6950000	Yes, so that'll be coming
6950000	6952000	December 22nd.
6952000	6954000	And also with that, they're
6954000	6956000	going to have a bookmark system that allows
6956000	6958000	players to save levels from the web
6958000	6960000	portal for later.
6960000	6962000	That's kind of cool. Still don't know why
6962000	6964000	they have a web portal to find levels
6964000	6966000	instead of it having been built into the
6966000	6968000	game like Little Big Planet. Once again,
6968000	6970000	I just don't think they get it. I guess they're trying
6970000	6972000	to work around it with what they got, but yeah
6972000	6974000	I hear ya. I don't disagree.
6974000	6976000	Along with that, of course, some new costumes
6976000	6978000	you'll be able to play as
6978000	6980000	including Badge Arcade Bunny.
6980000	6982000	They're going to have Mr. Saturn
6982000	6984000	and...
6984000	6986000	Master Belch
6986000	6988000	are going to be available.
6988000	6990000	They are there, actually. They're already in the game.
6990000	6992000	Awesome, so check it out. Play the 8-bit
6992000	6994000	games or 8-bit levels to
6994000	6996000	unlock them. And then also there is
6996000	6998000	another costume that's not part of this but
6998000	7000000	actually leaked out already. And this
7000000	7002000	is from a Mario Maker level
7002000	7004000	that is on the shop right
7004000	7006000	now that someone hacked
7006000	7008000	and somehow got this costume
7008000	7010000	in there. And it's actually
7010000	7012000	the Skypop Plane from Super Mario
7012000	7014000	Land. Oh wow, that's obscure.
7014000	7016000	Yeah, so you'll be able to
7016000	7018000	play that soon
7018000	7020000	because apparently they already
7020000	7022000	have the level out there
7022000	7024000	to download. Wow.
7024000	7026000	That's cool.
7026000	7028000	And I'm loving that all these
7028000	7030000	updates are free. Yes.
7030000	7032000	Thank you. Thank you, Nintendo.
7032000	7034000	It's something you've been doing very well
7034000	7036000	this year, so thank you.
7036000	7038000	Another game that's done very well for
7038000	7040000	Nintendo this year is Splatoon, which by the way
7040000	7042000	did you know there was a Splatfest this weekend? Totally
7042000	7044000	missed it. Just so many other games going on.
7044000	7046000	But yeah, there was a Splatfest. Who won?
7046000	7048000	Act F? Who won
7048000	7050000	the Splatfest thing? Because I probably
7050000	7052000	would have used reverse logic
7052000	7054000	and gone Team Nice, assuming
7054000	7056000	everybody else would go Team Naughty.
7056000	7058000	But maybe, I don't know who that is. Oh, Naughty 1.
7058000	7060000	See, and I would have been fucked over again.
7060000	7062000	Alright.
7062000	7064000	Anyhow,
7064000	7066000	so Splatoon, it's
7066000	7068000	been a huge success since launching in
7068000	7070000	May. It has sold over
7070000	7072000	2.42 million copies
7072000	7074000	worldwide, and
7074000	7076000	it's done very well in Japan.
7076000	7078000	Apparently Nintendo announced this week
7078000	7080000	1 million of those copies sold in
7080000	7082000	Japan, so congratulations. That's great.
7082000	7084000	Especially because Nintendo took a big risk
7084000	7086000	on a new franchise, but a lot of
7086000	7088000	people really love Splatoon, and
7088000	7090000	it's been doing very well for them, so
7090000	7092000	I'm sure we have not seen
7092000	7094000	the last of it. Also, to celebrate
7094000	7096000	this milestone, Nintendo is
7096000	7098000	going to hold a Squid Sisters
7098000	7100000	concert. Splatoon
7100000	7102000	Squid Sisters Live 2016
7102000	7104000	will take place
7104000	7106000	at a convention center in Chiba City
7106000	7108000	on January 30th, so
7108000	7110000	yes, it's only for Japan, but
7110000	7112000	Splatoon kind of has a fun little
7112000	7114000	like surf rock soundtrack that goes
7114000	7116000	with it, so I bet that'll be a lot of fun to see
7116000	7118000	played live, so
7118000	7120000	I'm very curious to see what that
7120000	7122000	turns out as. Maybe they'll,
7122000	7124000	a lot of times these concerts get CDs
7124000	7126000	made of them too, so I wonder if they won't end up doing
7126000	7128000	a CD of the live concert
7128000	7130000	later on. We'll see. But that's Splatoon.
7130000	7132000	Earlier in the show, I
7132000	7134000	brought up Fast Racing Neo,
7134000	7136000	and there is an update already planned for
7136000	7138000	Fast Racing Neo from a tweet
7138000	7140000	from Shin'en Games that actually
7140000	7142000	created the game. They have announced that there is
7142000	7144000	an update scheduled for January that will
7144000	7146000	include a track mini-map
7146000	7148000	that is not in the game right now, and I didn't mention
7148000	7150000	this when I was talking about the game earlier. The Wii U
7150000	7152000	gamepad, what's it used for?
7152000	7154000	Off-screen play, and that's it.
7154000	7156000	It's not used for anything else. So maybe the track
7156000	7158000	mini-map will be on the gamepad, who knows.
7158000	7160000	Online tags, I have not
7160000	7162000	played the game online yet, so I guess you
7162000	7164000	can't see people's tags online, but that will be
7164000	7166000	fixed in January. And then they say
7166000	7168000	stability improvements and the good old-fashioned
7168000	7170000	various fixes.
7170000	7172000	But that's nice to see that Fast Racing
7172000	7174000	Neo is getting that support, and
7174000	7176000	from what I'm hearing, doing very well in the online
7176000	7178000	store. It was the number one online game
7178000	7180000	in the past week, so props to those
7180000	7182000	folks. Gee, I guess people
7182000	7184000	wanted an F-Zero-like game on the Wii U
7184000	7186000	after all. Who knew?
7186000	7188000	Hey, look, even a story
7188000	7190000	about Pokken Tournament, maybe just
7190000	7192000	trying to get Dark Soccer's attention, begging for it
7192000	7194000	here, it's going to launch alongside
7194000	7196000	a special Wii U controller
7196000	7198000	in Japan. When the Wii U
7198000	7200000	version comes out on March 18th,
7200000	7202000	there's going to be a Wii U bundle that has a
7202000	7204000	digital copy of the game. There's going to be a wired
7204000	7206000	controller that comes with it as well, but
7206000	7208000	it's more, like, it looks different. It's
7208000	7210000	kind of like a longer controller
7210000	7212000	that, I guess,
7212000	7214000	looks more like the arcade version.
7214000	7216000	But anyway, it's going to be available,
7216000	7218000	and it will also be compatible with
7218000	7220000	the Wii U GamePad, the Wii U
7220000	7222000	Pro Controller, and the Wii
7222000	7224000	Classic Controller
7224000	7226000	Pro. So, please look forward
7226000	7228000	to that. Dark Soccer.
7228000	7230000	Well,
7230000	7232000	we have some news about Nobby Nobby
7232000	7234000	Boy. Girl has
7234000	7236000	finally reached Boy.
7236000	7238000	Girl and Boy have met up again.
7238000	7240000	They are now completely
7240000	7242000	joined and happy.
7242000	7244000	So, Girl reached Pluto
7244000	7246000	and then has looped around
7246000	7248000	and started making her way back to Earth.
7248000	7250000	And it took
7250000	7252000	six years
7252000	7254000	of people playing
7254000	7256000	Nobby Nobby Boy.
7256000	7258000	Is that all?
7258000	7260000	That's all.
7260000	7262000	But how many times did Boy
7262000	7264000	eat, or,
7264000	7266000	Nobby Nobby Boy eat his own butt?
7266000	7270000	That's a valid question, Dark Soccer.
7270000	7272000	I played Nobby Nobby Boy
7272000	7274000	on my phone for, like, ages.
7274000	7276000	I mean, you used to see,
7276000	7278000	I kept posting on Facebook,
7278000	7280000	that I would give Boy and Girl
7280000	7282000	all the love that I could.
7282000	7284000	Do you know that that's what
7284000	7286000	Dan and I call each other?
7286000	7288000	Even before the game came out.
7288000	7290000	Like, when I give him
7290000	7292000	cards, it's
7292000	7294000	to Boy from Girl.
7294000	7296000	Aww.
7296000	7298000	You know what?
7298000	7300000	They made treatments for Hairballs, Rob.
7304000	7306000	So, the Final Fantasy 7
7306000	7308000	remake group, they're getting some help
7308000	7310000	from the Kingdom Hearts team, too.
7310000	7312000	So, they are
7312000	7314000	going to be doing
7314000	7316000	a lot more development
7316000	7318000	in it, too, where you can actually fully
7318000	7320000	explore Midgar.
7320000	7322000	So, the multi-part
7322000	7324000	thing isn't going to affect
7324000	7326000	your ability to go around the game.
7326000	7328000	You get more attention on
7328000	7330000	Biggs Wedge and Jesse.
7330000	7332000	And, uh,
7332000	7334000	a lot more neat stuff on them.
7334000	7336000	And they're trying to bring back the voice cast
7336000	7338000	from Advent Children.
7338000	7340000	Nice. Also,
7340000	7342000	Cloud's hallucinations are supposed to be more meaningful.
7342000	7344000	I wonder if he's going to mention Xenogears.
7344000	7346000	Like he did
7346000	7348000	in the original. Anything is possible.
7348000	7350000	Um,
7350000	7352000	and then, uh,
7352000	7354000	sort of a last but not least,
7354000	7356000	Kurt Schilling, we know him, right?
7356000	7358000	Baseball guy?
7358000	7360000	38 Studios founder? Yes.
7360000	7362000	Well, um, he's like, I'm not going to say
7362000	7364000	anything else about this. I'm done.
7364000	7366000	So, unless they subpoena him,
7366000	7368000	that's it.
7368000	7370000	Then, uh, he says,
7370000	7372000	I have not been served anything by anyone.
7372000	7374000	There is not a person on this planet
7374000	7376000	with even a smidgen of knowledge
7376000	7378000	about the law who would say anything, but
7378000	7380000	we all know he shouldn't testify
7380000	7382000	while there is a bogus and incredibly wasteful
7382000	7384000	civil suit still hanging around.
7384000	7386000	So,
7386000	7388000	and honestly enough, I mean,
7388000	7390000	I don't know if it was
7390000	7392000	exactly all his fault, but I think he's just
7392000	7394000	done. I would be done too.
7394000	7396000	I have a feeling he's kind of done with
7396000	7398000	games for a long while.
7398000	7400000	Which was sad, because the guy himself,
7400000	7402000	as he is, had a real passion
7402000	7404000	for it. He did really love games.
7404000	7406000	And got way burnt by the whole thing, so.
7406000	7408000	Yeah.
7408000	7410000	So, sad face. I guess that's too bad.
7410000	7412000	Alright, well, uh,
7412000	7414000	but also I want to read this comment from our chatroom over at
7414000	7416000	live.vognetwork.com.
7416000	7418000	Sj100matt commenting on Kurt Schilling saying,
7418000	7420000	he's put his foot in his mouth too much lately. He's about
7420000	7422000	to lose his job at ESPN. Ouch.
7422000	7424000	And, uh, Bobby Blackwolf
7424000	7426000	talking about Kingdom Hearts saying,
7426000	7428000	Kingdom Hearts team needs to work on Kingdom Hearts
7428000	7430000	and not Final Fantasy. Uh,
7430000	7432000	yeah, I think there's a lot of people that kind of feel
7432000	7434000	that way. My assumption is that Kingdom Hearts
7434000	7436000	might be at a point in development
7436000	7438000	where some people can be shifted.
7438000	7440000	Like, you know how some things are done
7440000	7442000	early on in the process and that maybe
7442000	7444000	Final Fantasy VII Remake needs help with that part.
7444000	7446000	I don't know. We'll see.
7446000	7448000	No. So, hopefully
7448000	7450000	that's it. I can't see that they're actually
7450000	7452000	taking resources from Kingdom Hearts. I mean,
7452000	7454000	it's not like when they had to fix
7454000	7456000	Final Fantasy XIV and things got
7456000	7458000	really quiet at Square for a while
7458000	7460000	before the Final Fantasy
7460000	7462000	XIV Realm Reborn came out.
7462000	7464000	I don't think it's like that, but we'll see.
7464000	7466000	Alright, let's go to the FUGL
7466000	7468000	question of the week.
7468000	7470000	Every week we go to our Facebook
7470000	7472000	and our Google Plus communities.
7472000	7474000	We ask a question
7474000	7478000	and we get some answers.
7478000	7480000	And this week we wanted to ask about
7480000	7482000	sports ball. Because, you know,
7482000	7484000	we did have Rick from
7484000	7486000	Tipping Goat Games who was here earlier
7486000	7488000	and we wanted to talk about
7488000	7490000	sports games. So our question this week
7490000	7492000	is, do you prefer
7492000	7494000	the simplicity of a
7494000	7496000	retro style sports game
7496000	7498000	or do you prefer the complexity
7498000	7500000	of the modern style sports
7500000	7502000	games? Why did you answer
7502000	7504000	the way you did? So let's get to
7504000	7506000	some of the answers over on Facebook.
7506000	7508000	Retertainment saying, the NBA
7508000	7510000	street games were pretty dope until they
7510000	7512000	started adding in the overly complicated
7512000	7514000	game breakers that required
7514000	7516000	four or five simultaneous button
7516000	7518000	presses to pull off. So I'm going
7518000	7520000	with simplicity. Tiger
7520000	7522000	Claw says, I prefer sports games with
7522000	7524000	simplistic control. Games like
7524000	7526000	NBA Jam is more fun for casual
7526000	7528000	players since you don't have complicated
7528000	7530000	controls. One button is passing
7530000	7532000	the other for shooting. Any sports games
7532000	7534000	that everyone can play makes for
7534000	7536000	a good party game.
7536000	7538000	Andy R said, I don't play many sports games
7538000	7540000	but the ones I have were the retro simple ones.
7540000	7542000	So I guess those.
7542000	7544000	Hitstun says, I like old arcade
7544000	7546000	style sports games more. Not because
7546000	7548000	they're simple but because they're fast.
7548000	7550000	Modern sports games are
7550000	7552000	accurate even to the boring parts.
7552000	7554000	Games like RBA Baseball, NBA
7554000	7556000	Jam, and NFL Blitz have
7556000	7558000	better pacing than real life sports
7558000	7560000	and that makes them better games.
7560000	7562000	SSG100Matt says, to answer your question
7562000	7564000	yes. To tell you the truth
7564000	7566000	I have a place in my heart for both
7566000	7568000	complex and retro or simplistic
7568000	7570000	style sports games. I love
7570000	7572000	playing, managing with real world characters.
7572000	7574000	The professional athletes themselves
7574000	7576000	and learning different strategies and skills
7576000	7578000	to compete against certain defenses and offenses.
7578000	7580000	I also love playing the really simple
7580000	7582000	and sometimes over the top sports games
7582000	7584000	that are scaled down to the essence of why
7584000	7586000	people enjoy sports.
7586000	7588000	Scoring, hitting, dunking, shooting, throwing
7588000	7590000	passing, kicking, punching, etc.
7590000	7592000	Dartetsuya says, the
7592000	7594000	realistic or simulation style
7594000	7596000	stats stuff doesn't appeal to me
7596000	7598000	as much as the fast paced arcade style
7598000	7600000	sports game. Blitz, NBA Jam
7600000	7602000	and so on. I suppose
7602000	7604000	it's that I'm more a casual sports
7604000	7606000	fan than a hardcore one.
7606000	7608000	And lastly on Facebook, Jim Sally
7608000	7610000	our buddy Jim Sally
7610000	7612000	with his train says, when I play
7612000	7614000	sports games I want the controls to be as
7614000	7616000	simple as punching my buddy in the arm
7616000	7618000	while he's sitting next to me.
7618000	7620000	If you want to play some complex hockey, buy a hockey
7620000	7622000	stick and a cooper ball and start
7622000	7624000	playing for real. Best thing is the
7624000	7626000	3D graphics in real life are
7626000	7628000	almost as good as the new Xbox.
7628000	7630000	But I like the way
7630000	7632000	that's phrased, only almost.
7632000	7634000	And going to Google Plus
7634000	7636000	we have no answers on
7636000	7638000	Google Plus this week. Now
7638000	7640000	look, I know we all joke about Google Plus
7640000	7642000	being dead, but usually there's a few
7642000	7644000	of you that are loyal over on Google Plus, so
7644000	7646000	I don't know what's going on. I've used Google Plus
7646000	7648000	more now than... Yeah, ever since
7648000	7650000	Ingress started, right?
7650000	7652000	I technically haven't posted anything
7652000	7654000	on Google Plus, let's be clear.
7654000	7656000	The hangouts. The hangouts, yes.
7656000	7658000	So yeah, there you go.
7658000	7660000	Nothing on Google Plus this week, so
7660000	7662000	there you go. Alright.
7662000	7664000	So we're going to get back into some
7664000	7666000	news. But Dark Soccer,
7666000	7668000	you're on your way out, right? You had to take off a little early?
7668000	7670000	Yeah, I told the hubby a little bit later
7670000	7672000	than this, but he says he's here now.
7672000	7674000	So I guess
7674000	7676000	I'm out.
7676000	7678000	Because I didn't drive here
7678000	7680000	today. Dan dropped me off. We went to
7680000	7682000	see Star Wars today. So
7682000	7684000	yeah, he dropped
7684000	7686000	me off because also my tires
7686000	7688000	are a little bit unsafe.
7688000	7690000	Just a little bit. I mean, I don't think
7690000	7692000	it would have really been too bad for me to drive
7692000	7694000	on, but at the same time, it was
7694000	7696000	we were just going to be careful, so
7696000	7698000	especially with the rain. So I guess
7698000	7700000	I'm gone. Alright, okay, well that's okay.
7700000	7702000	Did you want to tell us really quick that story you had
7702000	7704000	coming up here? We'll do things a little out of order.
7704000	7706000	I just closed everything. Alright.
7706000	7708000	Sorry. I got it. Alright,
7708000	7710000	Logie's got it. And
7710000	7712000	some folks in chat are saying,
7712000	7714000	Dan on the show, Dan on the show, they got places
7714000	7716000	to be. Sadly, they're on their way out.
7716000	7718000	But
7718000	7720000	thank you for being here tonight Dark Soccer
7720000	7722000	and we'll see you next week.
7722000	7724000	Have a good holiday week. We will do
7724000	7726000	Cheesecake. Oh my god, stop it computer.
7726000	7728000	Your computer's
7728000	7730000	giving you a little taste of what the show computer
7730000	7732000	was giving me earlier. Alright.
7732000	7734000	Alright, well Logie and I will hold down the fort here
7734000	7736000	with our remaining news stories. So let's get to it.
7736000	7738000	Logie. So this is kind of cool.
7738000	7740000	So you know that whole
7740000	7742000	Retron console that was supposed to be
7742000	7744000	coming out, the one that was going to be based off
7744000	7746000	of like cartridges and it would
7746000	7748000	play like 18 or 8 to
7748000	7750000	32-bit style games. The Retro
7750000	7752000	Magazine people were doing it, right? Yeah, yeah.
7752000	7754000	That console. So anyways, now
7754000	7756000	they've got support. Now it's no longer
7756000	7758000	going to be the Retron video game system,
7758000	7760000	but it's now, they've been
7760000	7762000	backed by ColecoVision.
7762000	7764000	You remember Coleco?
7764000	7766000	Shit, that's like, that was like my first game
7766000	7768000	system back in the 80s. You know, they haven't been around forever.
7768000	7770000	But now they have a brand new system
7770000	7772000	coming out called the
7772000	7774000	ColecoVision, or the
7774000	7776000	Coleco Chameleon.
7776000	7778000	A quick thought on your way out there.
7778000	7780000	I'm sorry, I'm putting on my shoes right now.
7780000	7782000	I actually still have my
7782000	7784000	ColecoVision from when I was a kid.
7784000	7786000	And another ColecoVision. I wonder if it'll
7786000	7788000	have old school Coleco games built in.
7788000	7790000	It makes sense because those Flashback consoles. We finally get the
7790000	7792000	expansion module number 3.
7792000	7794000	I almost bought the
7794000	7796000	Coleco Flashback today. They have them on
7796000	7798000	they're closing them out out of
7798000	7800000	Target. Or
7800000	7802000	Walmart actually. They're closing them
7802000	7804000	out there. And I really want the
7804000	7806000	Atari one for some reason. They've got that in the
7806000	7808000	Intellivision one.
7808000	7810000	But anyways, yeah.
7810000	7812000	So that's pretty cool. And then of course
7812000	7814000	this is supposed to be launching in 2016.
7814000	7816000	I'm
7816000	7818000	curious to see how well it does.
7818000	7820000	I'm kind of skeptical
7820000	7822000	because
7822000	7824000	Well, I mean when they first announced
7824000	7826000	this I was like, I think it's
7826000	7828000	really awesome what they're doing. I think it's
7828000	7830000	extremely niche and I'm not sure how
7830000	7832000	they're going to make money on it. But
7832000	7834000	now that they have the backing of Coleco
7834000	7836000	I kind of feel like that's going to maybe put it in more
7836000	7838000	stores and it's going to make it more visible.
7838000	7840000	So I kind of think it has a way better
7840000	7842000	shot now than maybe. I mean and again
7842000	7844000	I don't mean to poo-poo it and say
7844000	7846000	it's never going to succeed. But I just
7846000	7848000	feel like it was a really steep climb and this is
7848000	7850000	going to really help give them that visibility
7850000	7852000	that it needs. The controller looks interesting because it looks
7852000	7854000	like a Wii U
7854000	7856000	gamepad. Like the Wii U Pro
7856000	7858000	gamepad. Not the
7858000	7860000	screen or anything.
7860000	7862000	It's identical
7862000	7864000	to one of those gamepads.
7864000	7866000	And then the middle portion
7866000	7868000	it's basically the
7868000	7870000	Super NES controller.
7870000	7872000	I just think it's going to be weird when we see
7872000	7874000	games out there. Like the retro-tastic
7874000	7876000	games and it's like going to be coming out
7876000	7878000	soon on Playstation 4, Xbox One
7878000	7880000	and Coleco.
7880000	7882000	What?
7882000	7884000	I hope so as well but like I just
7884000	7886000	don't know because like now if you want
7886000	7888000	those retro games you can still get them on other platforms.
7888000	7890000	It's not like this is the only way to
7890000	7892000	get that fixed. Yeah they're going to have to have some
7892000	7894000	exclusives or it's going to
7894000	7896000	yeah I get that. Like I don't need the
7896000	7898000	no I'm not going to buy a console for
7898000	7900000	Shovel Knight when Shovel Knight's out on like a
7900000	7902000	billion platforms right now. Yeah no I hear it.
7902000	7904000	I hear it. Like several
7904000	7906000	platforms.
7906000	7908000	Alright well I'm very curious
7908000	7910000	to see how that progresses. Again I think that's really
7910000	7912000	good news for that and it's going to bump it a little
7912000	7914000	bit out of something that otherwise would have been extremely
7914000	7916000	niche. Well let's
7916000	7918000	move on and talk about another Wii U
7918000	7920000	game this week. There's a lot of Wii U stuff in the news
7920000	7922000	this week. Did you know that a new Wii U
7922000	7924000	game actually came out this week?
7924000	7926000	This last Friday called Devil's Third.
7926000	7928000	I actually think it wasn't, I think that was the Friday
7928000	7930000	before where we're at now.
7930000	7932000	Yeah it was Itagaki's game.
7932000	7934000	That's right. Itagaki had put this game together for Wii U
7934000	7936000	and I remember it kind of like... It was supposed to be a
7936000	7938000	THQ game and then like that's...
7938000	7940000	kind of disappeared but now it's out.
7940000	7942000	Well apparently the game is
7942000	7944000	really hard to find.
7944000	7946000	Apparently Best Buy
7946000	7948000	had no copies in stock in an entire
7948000	7950000	district and GameStop
7950000	7952000	very few copies. GameStop
7952000	7954000	apparently told this reporter
7954000	7956000	that there was only
7956000	7958000	420 copies of the game
7958000	7960000	for sale in the entire
7960000	7962000	country. What?
7962000	7964000	Is that like only for the dot
7964000	7966000	com? Or is that like each store
7966000	7968000	got one copy of the game?
7968000	7970000	And that's not even each store.
7970000	7972000	That's like big stores got one copy
7972000	7974000	of the game. That's crazy. Is that a pre-order?
7974000	7976000	I know right? I hear the game wasn't very good
7976000	7978000	but I mean that's
7978000	7980000	I guess that's fine. It makes sense
7980000	7982000	that there's only that many physical copies.
7982000	7984000	It is available digitally
7984000	7986000	so that's not a big deal. But people are
7986000	7988000	snatching the shit up like it's a fucking collector's
7988000	7990000	item. Yeah. And it's turning around
7990000	7992000	and showing up on eBay right? It's a fucking
7992000	7994000	it's a pretty shitty game
7994000	7996000	so I don't know. Yeah.
7996000	7998000	I guess everyone wants to make a buck.
7998000	8000000	William Murderface in chat says apparently
8000000	8002000	it's really bad. Dungeon Buster
8002000	8004000	saying the Europeans got it months ago and
8004000	8006000	pretty much panned it. What meme
8006000	8008000	is asking is it a full $60 game?
8008000	8010000	Unfortunately the answer is yes. 50. I think.
8010000	8012000	Or 50. 50 dollars.
8012000	8014000	Brad from Pod Culture in Act Deft mentioning
8014000	8016000	the 420 there. 420
8016000	8018000	blaze it! Which actually
8018000	8020000	you know as much as you kind of joke
8020000	8022000	sometimes people put news stories
8022000	8024000	out there that are intentionally false
8024000	8026000	to see how far they'll travel.
8026000	8028000	420 that is an odd coincidence
8028000	8030000	of a number to put in a story so
8030000	8032000	maybe a little bit of salt with that but
8032000	8034000	I think it really
8034000	8036000	is fact to say the game is fucking
8036000	8038000	hard to find. Whether it was 420
8038000	8040000	or 600 or 12
8040000	8042000	it's not an easy game to find.
8042000	8044000	To be fair it is plausible
8044000	8046000	because the reason for that is they manufactured
8046000	8048000	those discs in lots of 30
8048000	8050000	and so 420
8050000	8052000	is divisible by 30 so
8052000	8054000	Oh look at you bringing science into this!
8054000	8056000	I mean there's that.
8056000	8058000	I had no idea they did it in lots of 30.
8058000	8060000	Yeah it's cases of 30
8060000	8062000	for like disc games usually
8062000	8064000	so Wii U
8064000	8066000	Okay. Well I learned something today.
8066000	8068000	24 for PlayStation
8068000	8070000	because the discs
8070000	8072000	are different. I don't know why
8072000	8074000	it's only 24 but usually 24
8074000	8076000	for like PlayStation 3
8076000	8078000	I think now when everything is on Blu-ray it's all 30
8078000	8080000	but most of the time
8080000	8082000	it's 30. DungeonBuster
8082000	8084000	in chat over at live.vognetwork.com
8084000	8086000	saying Loki laying down the industry knowledge
8086000	8088000	yeah I got to admit I'm pretty impressed.
8088000	8090000	But then again 420 could also be
8090000	8092000	completely made up so I mean
8092000	8094000	it's plausible. It's not a lot
8094000	8096000	and I kind of would wonder
8096000	8098000	what the minimum runs are on those things because
8098000	8100000	normally they have to sell
8100000	8102000	so many in order to make it worthwhile
8102000	8104000	and usually
8104000	8106000	they have to run more than I think
8106000	8108000	420 copies. Yeah unless
8108000	8110000	Nintendo just straight up took a loss on this
8110000	8112000	but the game is available in the digital
8112000	8114000	store right? You can get it on
8114000	8116000	the store if you really want to pay the full money.
8116000	8118000	I just think I don't remember what their minimums are because
8118000	8120000	I just know from like
8120000	8122000	you know like
8122000	8124000	there was a 3DS title that someone had made
8124000	8126000	or DS title that was like some
8126000	8128000	simulation game and they independently
8128000	8130000	had it printed and it was like
8130000	8132000	they had to make like 8000 copies or something of it
8132000	8134000	like some ridiculous amount
8134000	8136000	so if you have to make 8000 copies of that
8136000	8138000	you know you probably
8138000	8140000	have to make more than 420 copies
8140000	8142000	I have a feeling
8142000	8144000	I have a feeling someone's already written it off as a loss
8144000	8146000	Well I'm just saying because like why even
8146000	8148000	make a physical disc if you're going to only print
8148000	8150000	that many copies you would think that they would
8150000	8152000	make at least a few thousand
8152000	8154000	I don't know. Maybe they have to for like tax
8154000	8156000	reasons or something crazy I mean
8156000	8158000	admittedly I'm talking out my ass a little bit
8158000	8160000	but it would make sense.
8160000	8162000	Or they just
8162000	8164000	they had trouble getting it through customs
8164000	8166000	damn those customs
8166000	8168000	It's just
8168000	8170000	it's terrible. Hey that's
8170000	8172000	a pretty smart move though. Hey let's
8172000	8174000	make only these make copies and make it crazy
8174000	8176000	that people want it and
8176000	8178000	have to get it and now
8178000	8180000	they're selling all those
8180000	8182000	copies. I don't know.
8182000	8184000	Whatever. Alright. Well let's move on with some
8184000	8186000	more stories. What else you got for us?
8186000	8188000	Alright. Actually I think
8188000	8190000	that would be you.
8190000	8192000	With the Devil's Third Story? I just did that.
8192000	8194000	Oh that's right. Oh we're talking about
8194000	8196000	Jamie. Sorry about that.
8196000	8198000	Okay so
8198000	8200000	there's apparently
8200000	8202000	this is kind of interesting so
8202000	8204000	Good Game Studios they're
8204000	8206000	accused of busting
8206000	8208000	a union that was being
8208000	8210000	created by
8210000	8212000	their former employees
8212000	8214000	and so
8214000	8216000	I guess allegedly they were
8216000	8218000	let's see here
8218000	8220000	20 employees were involved
8220000	8222000	with establishing a workers
8222000	8224000	council and then
8224000	8226000	the company laid off
8226000	8228000	that council earlier
8228000	8230000	this year and so they
8230000	8232000	kind of were brought up against allegations
8232000	8234000	and
8234000	8236000	I don't know it's they're denying
8236000	8238000	that they did anything wrong but it's kind
8238000	8240000	of like that's kind of weird that you would lay
8240000	8242000	all those people off after they did
8242000	8244000	this. Well there's a lot of people talking about
8244000	8246000	how difficult and demanding
8246000	8248000	the industry can be sometimes. I mean you really
8248000	8250000	have to love video games because
8250000	8252000	especially during you know some real
8252000	8254000	crunch periods you know people
8254000	8256000	work these crazy long days
8256000	8258000	and I'm sure you all have heard of this
8258000	8260000	you know coming out of the EA and some of the stuff here. Now
8260000	8262000	this studio if I'm not mistaken they're in Germany
8262000	8264000	so I mean now it has
8264000	8266000	that complexity of you know I know
8266000	8268000	what the laws are like here in America but I don't know what it's like in Germany.
8268000	8270000	It's hard to say is it because of the union that they
8270000	8272000	were laid off or is it because of the
8272000	8274000	development cycle that they were laid off? Yeah.
8274000	8276000	Yeah and who knows so there's a lot of those questions
8276000	8278000	to answer but I think I think it definitely goes to show
8278000	8280000	that there's some people that get so
8280000	8282000	frustrated maybe with some of the
8282000	8284000	the because sometimes
8284000	8286000	these crimes and I'm saying sometimes
8286000	8288000	sometimes these crunch periods are a result
8288000	8290000	of bad decisions right
8290000	8292000	bad decision is made up top and that
8292000	8294000	trickles down and everybody else has to pay for it
8294000	8296000	right. Yeah. So that's why sometimes these
8296000	8298000	these unions and things are are being
8298000	8300000	formed is to kind of like I guess make
8300000	8302000	those higher up a little more accountable
8302000	8304000	for the decisions they make and the trickle that
8304000	8306000	that could have but again you
8306000	8308000	throw the international complexity into it I'm not
8308000	8310000	really sure how that all works out but
8310000	8312000	very interesting.
8314000	8316000	Alright. Do you want to talk about
8316000	8318000	Minecraft as well before we get to
8318000	8320000	Sure. So Minecraft got a
8320000	8322000	console update and they're saying it's the
8322000	8324000	biggest one yet. Brings the game up to version
8324000	8326000	1.88 and
8326000	8328000	adds a bunch of new things new biomes
8328000	8330000	including Mesa, Mega, Tiaga
8330000	8332000	Roofed Forest, Birch Forest
8334000	8336000	Savannah, Extreme Hills
8336000	8338000	plus Deep Ocean
8338000	8340000	and Snowless
8340000	8342000	Tyga and
8342000	8344000	see there's new mobs including the endermite
8344000	8346000	guardian, elder guardian
8346000	8348000	rabbits and chicken jockeys
8348000	8350000	like
8350000	8352000	I seriously
8352000	8354000	I was looking through my son's
8354000	8356000	book he has a Minecraft book that talks about like
8356000	8358000	some of the enemies and I'm like I don't know who the fuck
8358000	8360000	these characters are like this wasn't
8360000	8362000	when I was playing so
8362000	8364000	go back to the PC version
8364000	8366000	other things, new blocks
8366000	8368000	including granite, packed ice, red
8368000	8370000	sandstone, diorite
8370000	8372000	prismarine
8372000	8374000	also you can catch treasure while fishing
8374000	8376000	the buttons can be placed
8376000	8378000	on top of or on the tops and bottoms
8378000	8380000	of blocks
8380000	8382000	skeletons flee from wolves
8382000	8384000	and spiders no longer see through solid blocks
8384000	8386000	and that's coming to PlayStation
8386000	8388000	Xbox players
8388000	8390000	no Wii U update yet
8390000	8392000	of course
8392000	8394000	alright well
8394000	8396000	I guess I'll have to jump back in
8396000	8398000	I have the PlayStation version
8398000	8400000	of Minecraft so I'll check that out
8400000	8402000	we should do that again cause I like kinda
8402000	8404000	I keep talking to my son about like how we used to play
8404000	8406000	on the server and stuff and it
8406000	8408000	you know it's a lot more funny when you have more people playing
8408000	8410000	it is, it is
8410000	8412000	do you have it on PlayStation 4? we could just do a little
8412000	8414000	I do have it on PlayStation 4
8414000	8416000	I have it on PlayStation 4
8416000	8418000	and on Wii U
8418000	8420000	and Xbox 360
8420000	8422000	and Windows 10
8422000	8424000	my phone on
8424000	8426000	my iPod
8426000	8428000	yeah pretty much everywhere
8428000	8430000	oh and I thought I was bad at buying the same game
8430000	8432000	multiple places
8432000	8434000	your Minecraft collection puts my
8434000	8436000	Mass Effect 3 collection to shame
8436000	8438000	alright well Valve
8438000	8440000	a lot of people rumbling about
8440000	8442000	the upcoming Steam sale right
8442000	8444000	seems like it's inevitable we got a winter sale coming
8444000	8446000	pretty soon and you know a lot
8446000	8448000	of people usually praise Steam and all that they
8448000	8450000	do but interesting
8450000	8452000	Steam's taken a few hits this year
8452000	8454000	and another one on its way is that Valve
8454000	8456000	is being sued in the country of
8456000	8458000	France not here in the States
8458000	8460000	but still we like to cover news everywhere
8460000	8462000	and that is they're being sued
8462000	8464000	in France by and I'm gonna horribly
8464000	8466000	mispronounce this name I'm sorry it's
8466000	8468000	UFC K
8468000	8470000	I have no idea how to
8470000	8472000	pronounce that I'm sorry because I do not speak
8472000	8474000	French but that is a French Consumer
8474000	8476000	Association that's what you need to know it's French
8476000	8478000	Consumer Association and they put
8478000	8480000	out a new letter and said that the
8480000	8482000	Steam subscriber agreement contains
8482000	8484000	clauses which are detrimental
8484000	8486000	to consumer interests
8486000	8488000	apparently
8488000	8490000	it all comes down to the fact that users
8490000	8492000	cannot resell their digital
8492000	8494000	games and that's something that French
8494000	8496000	law allows for and we've talked about this
8496000	8498000	on the show before is that whole controversy
8498000	8500000	about being able to sell a
8500000	8502000	digital game and what's interesting is that
8502000	8504000	the Steam storefront is kind
8504000	8506000	of set up for that right like because you
8506000	8508000	can put games in your inventory
8508000	8510000	but the used thing
8510000	8512000	you can't really do it you can do it with a new
8512000	8514000	game that you haven't installed and played yet but you can't
8514000	8516000	really do it with a used game and I guess the
8516000	8518000	French Association taking
8518000	8520000	some issue with that also
8520000	8522000	though it isn't just limited to that
8522000	8524000	some other things cited is that Valve does
8524000	8526000	not assume responsibility
8526000	8528000	in cases where accounts get hacked
8528000	8530000	and users personal information gets
8530000	8532000	stolen and
8532000	8534000	that is also can be said
8534000	8536000	for how the company claims ownership
8536000	8538000	of any user created
8538000	8540000	content that is uploaded to Steam
8540000	8542000	now apparently
8542000	8544000	Valve they use Luxembourg's
8544000	8546000	consumer law in all countries
8546000	8548000	it operates in so that way
8548000	8550000	they don't take into account each countries different
8550000	8552000	rules but it should be noted
8552000	8554000	that Valve was already sued once
8554000	8556000	in a German court by a German
8556000	8558000	consumer group a couple years ago
8558000	8560000	probably when some of these stories first came up
8560000	8562000	about the whole used games digital stuff
8562000	8564000	Valve actually won that case
8564000	8566000	but that was in 2014 and this
8566000	8568000	is another country so
8568000	8570000	we'll see what happens with that
8570000	8572000	that could really change things
8572000	8574000	if folks are able to resell
8574000	8576000	their digital games I mean
8576000	8578000	all of a sudden your library man
8578000	8580000	people are going to be unloading games in their library
8580000	8582000	for like 25 cents a pop
8582000	8584000	I mean
8584000	8586000	it's going to be very interesting
8586000	8588000	I don't know
8588000	8590000	I've always hesitated buying
8590000	8592000	digital games I mean
8592000	8594000	it's one thing on Steam when they
8594000	8596000	unload games for you know
8596000	8598000	99 cents or like
8598000	8600000	$3.99 for a little game
8600000	8602000	it makes it very easy to buy that digitally
8602000	8604000	because whatever equity you feel like
8604000	8606000	you'd have in that game would be literally dollars and cents
8606000	8608000	but it's a little harder sometimes
8608000	8610000	to spend $60
8610000	8612000	on a game you're not sure about
8612000	8614000	digitally because you know you're going to get
8614000	8616000	stuck with that game if you don't really like
8616000	8618000	it but if you have it on disc you can at least
8618000	8620000	resell it your game has some equity it has some
8620000	8622000	value in it it'll be very interesting to see
8622000	8624000	how that could really change the market
8624000	8626000	I worry for
8626000	8628000	smaller indie developers that really
8628000	8630000	rely on Steam that might
8630000	8632000	not have the best effect
8632000	8634000	yeah it's going to be kind of hard to do that
8634000	8636000	yeah so I kind of worry for them
8636000	8638000	but I definitely get people's
8638000	8640000	frustration with the AAA side of things
8640000	8642000	like what was it Batman
8642000	8644000	Arkham Knight right
8644000	8646000	was a shit show on Steam
8646000	8648000	and you know they kind of had to eat a lot
8648000	8650000	of crap for it and they were charging what $60
8650000	8652000	for that right so if people wanted to get
8652000	8654000	rid of that there's a part of me
8654000	8656000	that kind of thinks they should well Steam
8656000	8658000	did enact that whole
8658000	8660000	refund thing I think to
8660000	8662000	try to account for some of that but I don't know
8662000	8664000	I feel a little differently when it comes to a
8664000	8666000	big big Warner Brothers $60 game
8666000	8668000	like that and then like you know
8668000	8670000	for example's sake the game we were talking about
8670000	8672000	earlier tonight Super Slam Dunk Touchdown
8672000	8674000	you know I don't know if I feel like
8674000	8676000	you know we heard it's one guy
8676000	8678000	that's doing most of this I mean you get some
8678000	8680000	contract help and so forth that I would kind of
8680000	8682000	feel bad if maybe the value of his game
8682000	8684000	gets undercut by this
8684000	8686000	all of a sudden emerging used game
8686000	8688000	market right yeah so
8688000	8690000	it'll be really interesting to see how this
8690000	8692000	plays out I don't know so
8693000	8695000	alright but I'm not a lawyer
8695000	8697000	so I don't know at the end of the day
8697000	8699000	we're going to get to the mailbag you guys it's time
8699000	8701000	to open up the mailbag where you guys
8701000	8703000	participate with us every week
8707000	8709000	over at participate

8713000	8715000	participate at orange lounge
8715000	8717000	radio dot com
8717000	8719000	I'm logging into the mailbag now because usually
8719000	8721000	Dark Soccer will dive into the mailbag
8721000	8723000	and read some mail for you guys but
8723000	8725000	as you all heard a minute ago she had to leave
8725000	8727000	early so it's just me
8727000	8729000	tonight so I'm going to get to the emails
8729000	8731000	we have three of them tonight starting off
8731000	8733000	with this one this is from Robert M
8733000	8735000	who says
8735000	8737000	here's two quick questions and a longer
8737000	8739000	hopefully cool thing from Halloween
8739000	8741000	yes the email is from this week
8741000	8743000	first I don't know if the comic story line
8743000	8745000	will affect Captain America Civil War
8745000	8747000	and the MCU Marvel
8747000	8749000	Cinematic Universe but if Falcon
8749000	8751000	takes over the role of Captain from Rogers
8751000	8753000	will he be Captain Fal
8753000	8755000	no that's a dumb question actually
8755000	8757000	can Captain America fly now or did that not
8757000	8759000	happen in Ultimate Marvel
8759000	8761000	I do not follow
8761000	8763000	comics at all I
8763000	8765000	hate to say it by the way I really
8765000	8767000	want a comic show on VOG Network I'm just putting it out
8767000	8769000	there I've been wanting one for years so if you
8769000	8771000	know a long running show that's interested in joining
8771000	8773000	up with some of us I would
8773000	8775000	love that because this is where I would ask them
8775000	8777000	help because I have no idea
8777000	8779000	John picks up a lot of that slack
8779000	8781000	so does Brad from Pod Culture but
8781000	8783000	I would love some comic experts in here
8785000	8787000	Loki do you follow any of that stuff
8787000	8789000	no
8789000	8791000	Brad from Pod Culture
8791000	8793000	is filling in a little bit here saying Falcon became
8793000	8795000	Captain and flies so that's
8795000	8797000	how that works and I do know from what I
8797000	8799000	remember in the new movie trailer you do see
8799000	8801000	Falcon in it so who knows where the Marvel Cinematic
8801000	8803000	Universe will go with that anyhow
8803000	8805000	second have any
8805000	8807000	of you including Bobby gotten to
8807000	8809000	see the Gear VR yet sorry if
8809000	8811000	that was already discussed well funny enough
8811000	8813000	Jamie talked about her experiences earlier in the
8813000	8815000	show Bobby owns one
8815000	8817000	I know that because he's the one that showed
8817000	8819000	the Gear VR to me and so yeah
8819000	8821000	I've used Gear VR funny
8821000	8823000	enough I didn't play any games in Gear VR
8823000	8825000	the stuff I saw was like experiences
8825000	8827000	I saw like a Cirque du Soleil thing
8827000	8829000	and like a Paul McCartney concert and I know
8829000	8831000	I've talked about this on the show before you'll
8831000	8833000	want to go back to February
8833000	8835000	of this year when I was at PAX East
8835000	8837000	that was the
8837000	8839000	week I got to play the Gear VR
8839000	8841000	Loki did you end up getting one of these?
8841000	8843000	I haven't bought one though because it's
8843000	8845000	$100 and I don't use my
8845000	8847000	Oculus well I didn't use my
8847000	8849000	Oculus because it runs like shit on my laptop
8849000	8851000	which is fine because it's not meant to
8851000	8853000	run on my laptop
8853000	8855000	I haven't had the money to
8855000	8857000	build a new computer yet to run the Oculus
8857000	8859000	and then of course I'll probably just buy the actual
8859000	8861000	retail one but my phone's nice
8861000	8863000	and should be able to run well it does
8863000	8865000	run the Gear VR stuff so I just
8865000	8867000	maybe eventually
8867000	8869000	I don't know I have to see
8869000	8871000	what they have on it and like maybe if I
8871000	8873000	develop stuff for it that's a
8873000	8875000	ways away so I'm holding out
8875000	8877000	right now
8877000	8879000	and let's see going
8879000	8881000	to the last little bit of the
8881000	8883000	email here from Robert M and
8883000	8885000	finally I thought I'd share two months
8885000	8887000	after slapping this together
8887000	8889000	I built a nearly two foot
8889000	8891000	tall figure for Halloween using
8891000	8893000	Lego's Hero Factory or
8893000	8895000	Bionicle building system
8895000	8897000	I figured I wanted to try building a large scale
8897000	8899000	character since I would certainly
8899000	8901000	give it a cartoon animal design
8901000	8903000	and I was sure the holo
8903000	8905000	disproportionate robotic thing would
8905000	8907000	invite the obvious comparisons I just went
8907000	8909000	ahead and ran with it building for my
8909000	8911000	parts bins in maybe two hours total
8911000	8913000	in the end my brother didn't let me bring it to his
8913000	8915000	house for his party fearing his three year old
8915000	8917000	would tear it apart I considered building the
8917000	8919000	white one for that reason it doesn't look
8919000	8921000	that much like the in game model but it's effective
8921000	8923000	for what it is and it actually stands
8923000	8925000	up by itself although it's too top heavy
8925000	8927000	for say a running pose
8927000	8929000	now Robert M doesn't name what it is
8929000	8931000	here in the email but he attached some pictures
8931000	8933000	and you can actually see it's one of the
8933000	8935000	characters from Five Nights at Freddy's I believe this is
8935000	8937000	Foxy this is the guy that's behind the curtain
8937000	8939000	there it's definitely yeah it's definitely the red Foxy
8939000	8941000	character there it looks like an
8941000	8943000	like a
8943000	8945000	cyborg version of that and the
8945000	8947000	way the eye hangs out is really
8947000	8949000	creepy and yeah I would not want to see that in Five
8949000	8951000	Nights at Freddy's or really probably real
8951000	8953000	life so well done if you were going
8953000	8955000	for scary so
8955000	8957000	anyhow Robert M
8957000	8959000	signs the email and then concludes saying
8959000	8961000	PS do you have the public photo
8961000	8963000	pool for OLR active
8963000	8965000	no Robert we actually took that down on the old
8965000	8967000	website a few years ago it was being abused
8967000	8969000	and we didn't have a way to really effectively
8969000	8971000	screen the photos that were going
8971000	8973000	through there and it wasn't really
8973000	8975000	emails like this are so few
8975000	8977000	and far between that unfortunately it wasn't really enhancing
8977000	8979000	the experience I think Twitter
8979000	8981000	kind of took over now people just share their
8981000	8983000	stuff on Twitter and we can kind of retweet
8983000	8985000	and so forth so unfortunately the photo archive
8985000	8987000	kind of kind of met its maker there
8987000	8989000	but the old
8989000	8991000	website in general is really in need
8991000	8993000	of a boost and Jason and I
8993000	8995000	have talked about that we really need to draw Dekeman
8995000	8997000	into that too and see what we can come up
8997000	8999000	with in the new year but we are
8999000	9001000	it's kind of tricky where I'm at because
9001000	9003000	at the same time I really want to make sure VOG
9003000	9005000	has a lot of stuff and obviously
9005000	9007000	we could always use more content for VOG so
9007000	9009000	a lot of my focus kind of goes over there
9009000	9011000	so Orangeloungeradio.com kind of becomes
9011000	9013000	that's the place where the podcast
9013000	9015000	is hosted and it works
9015000	9017000	so don't upgrade the Skype version
9017000	9019000	over there so it doesn't break so
9019000	9021000	anyhow
9021000	9023000	there it is that's our email
9023000	9025000	tonight from Robert M let's go to the next email
9025000	9027000	here from Raginator
9027000	9029000	who's been emailing us an awful lot because as you know
9029000	9031000	he can't participate live with the show
9031000	9033000	if you've been following his emails
9033000	9035000	so let's get on to the
9035000	9037000	next and DarkTitsu is saying I know
9037000	9039000	Dekeman's got a lot of family stuff going on so there's
9039000	9041000	that oh yeah obviously and that stuff comes from
9041000	9043000	please I don't I don't make
9043000	9045000	money doing OLR so I can't pay people
9045000	9047000	so yeah I am beggars
9047000	9049000	can't be choosers I can only take help when
9049000	9051000	people are able to help but I appreciate all help
9051000	9053000	moving
9053000	9055000	on to Raginator's email hi everyone it's
9055000	9057000	Raginator again as per usual I'm writing
9057000	9059000	in I have two topics for you the first is short
9059000	9061000	but the second is a little long so I apologize
9061000	9063000	for those that haven't noticed yet Humble Bundle
9063000	9065000	is having a Neo Geo bundle going
9065000	9067000	on thank you for reminding me I do have to get
9067000	9069000	it by the time OLR airs and this
9069000	9071000	email is read there'll be about a day and a half to two days
9071000	9073000	left to jump on it but nonetheless I want to
9073000	9075000	pass along the info all in all
9075000	9077000	there's 25 or so games in the bundle which
9077000	9079000	a few of them can be redeemed on Steam
9079000	9081000	the rest are DRM free there's a few
9081000	9083000	noteworthy games in there amongst them are Samurai
9083000	9085000	Showdown 2 and 5, Art of Fighting
9085000	9087000	2, 2 or 3 King of Fighter games
9087000	9089000	and Metal Slug
9089000	9091000	1 through 3 and X
9091000	9093000	in my opinion it's a good deal
9093000	9095000	even for the Samurai Showdown games
9095000	9097000	alone seeing as they're not on Steam
9097000	9099000	so yes that is a
9099000	9101000	good FYI because we missed
9101000	9103000	last week's show and a chance to bring that up
9103000	9105000	but it's just running in an emulator you're buying ROMs
9105000	9107000	basically you are buying ROMs but at least
9107000	9109000	you're doing it legally right and some of it's on
9109000	9111000	Steam so you have all that built
9111000	9113000	in or whatever is there achievements or
9113000	9115000	no? Not in the ROMs
9115000	9117000	obviously but there's
9117000	9119000	looks like the ones on Steam would be
9119000	9121000	Metal Slug 1 and 3
9121000	9123000	and then they also have the King
9123000	9125000	of Fighters 98 Ultimate
9125000	9127000	Match Final Edition
9127000	9129000	and...
9129000	9131000	Is Fatal Fury Special in there?
9131000	9133000	That's one of my very favorites Metal Slug X and the King
9133000	9135000	of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match
9135000	9137000	Fatal Fury Special you said?
9137000	9139000	Yeah that's my
9139000	9141000	favorite
9141000	9143000	Fatal Fury Special is one of the
9143000	9145000	DRM free ones
9145000	9147000	Alright
9147000	9149000	Act Deft in our chat room
9149000	9151000	talking about there's some controversy there
9151000	9153000	about the ROMs and the emulator that .EMU
9153000	9155000	uses for the games he says he might call in about that
9155000	9157000	later I am behind
9157000	9159000	on this news if that
9159000	9161000	all must come up while I was out of town so I'm very curious
9161000	9163000	to hear what's going on there I did hear
9163000	9165000	it didn't come up on tonight's show but I did hear something
9165000	9167000	and maybe somebody in chat or
9167000	9169000	Loki even maybe you know about this
9169000	9171000	remember a couple weeks ago we were talking about the whole
9171000	9173000	Bubsy coming back in the 1 and 2
9173000	9175000	Yeah that's basically S.N.E.X
9175000	9177000	Oh my god yeah I heard that
9177000	9179000	was basically an emulator
9179000	9181000	and those ROMs and that the people putting it
9181000	9183000	up there weren't even authorized to do it right?
9183000	9185000	I thought I heard that?
9185000	9187000	They said they got the permission but
9187000	9189000	I don't know if that's legitimate
9189000	9191000	Oh man
9191000	9193000	that's crazy and see that's
9193000	9195000	another thing Steam's taken some real
9195000	9197000	hits left and right this year because that would be
9197000	9199000	another thing that's going to make them look silly
9199000	9201000	Like I said I watch a lot of Jim Sterling
9201000	9203000	and stuff and
9203000	9205000	he reviews a lot of really shitty
9205000	9207000	or doesn't review but plays
9207000	9209000	a lot of really shitty Steam games
9209000	9211000	and there's some though that are fucking
9211000	9213000	ridiculous to have copyrighted shit
9213000	9215000	in them that fucking just get through the Greenlight
9215000	9217000	process and get put up there as legit games
9217000	9219000	like they have Gabe Newell's simulator
9219000	9221000	and it's like it's an absolute
9221000	9223000	shit game
9223000	9225000	and there's it's just
9225000	9227000	people just send this
9227000	9229000	stuff through and it's just cluttering up the
9229000	9231000	fucking Steam store
9231000	9233000	Very curious
9233000	9235000	about that now just I
9235000	9237000	heard that somewhere I don't know that to be true
9237000	9239000	so I just want to put that out there
9239000	9241000	and in fact I just did a news search and I'm not seeing
9241000	9243000	anything about it but I swear to god I heard something out
9243000	9245000	there this week about that whole thing so
9245000	9247000	the Bubsy thing was not
9247000	9249000	as not as
9249000	9251000	A plus so I just allegedly
9251000	9253000	covering my own ass there
9253000	9255000	Alright let's get to Rage Nator's second topic here
9255000	9257000	Only kinda sorta tangently
9257000	9259000	gaming related alright I guess we'll allow it
9259000	9261000	Hoping for your input nonetheless
9261000	9263000	See I'm the oldest of four siblings
9263000	9265000	and my sister two years my junior
9265000	9267000	along with my one brother four years my junior
9267000	9269000	for the past two months have repeatedly offered
9269000	9271000	to loan me some money to get me a new PC
9271000	9273000	I refuse for two reasons
9273000	9275000	One being that when they do something out of the
9275000	9277000	kindness of their hearts strings are always attached
9277000	9279000	this time being no different
9279000	9281000	Secondly my sister isn't in a position to loan
9281000	9283000	or give out money due to her own finances
9283000	9285000	living in a very expensive area of Alberta
9285000	9287000	Canada owing way more on her mortgage
9287000	9289000	I feel like this is personal stuff I don't want to read on
9289000	9291000	air I told her
9291000	9293000	specifically that her kids need to come first
9293000	9295000	and at least with the strings attached
9295000	9297000	aspect they told me if they were going to loan me the
9297000	9299000	money I was to get the computer that
9299000	9301000	they wanted me to have a low end Dell
9301000	9303000	that I wouldn't run all my games
9303000	9305000	and I'd be stuck with a PC I couldn't use
9305000	9307000	and a debt that I'd have to repay
9307000	9309000	My brother seemed to have dropped the subject albeit
9309000	9311000	in a huff a month ago but my sister apparently
9311000	9313000	didn't and tried to be slick
9313000	9315000	She told me on 12-9 that she sent me via
9315000	9317000	UPS a $200 Target card
9317000	9319000	to be used on a computer and that I needed to be
9319000	9321000	home the next day to accept it
9321000	9323000	That despite the fact I asked her not to do it
9323000	9325000	plus I already had plans that day
9325000	9327000	due to doctors appointments I couldn't be home
9327000	9329000	all day waiting on UPS
9329000	9331000	Anyway I was forced to reschedule my appointment
9331000	9333000	then when UPS did show up I refused delivery
9333000	9335000	Of course 20 minutes later my sister calls me
9335000	9337000	in a huff and we had a massive argument
9337000	9339000	We're not talking. What's your points
9339000	9341000	regarding this?
9343000	9345000	Wow this is this is
9345000	9347000	the OLR therapy moment here
9347000	9349000	You guys need to sit down and have a nice
9349000	9351000	long talk about this. I think that's
9351000	9353000	very nice that your family wants to do
9353000	9355000	that and I think you should acknowledge it
9355000	9357000	at such and say I think it's very nice that
9357000	9359000	you want to do this but
9359000	9361000	I really want to be able to do this on my own terms
9361000	9363000	and build the system that I want to do
9363000	9365000	so thank you but
9365000	9367000	no thank you and I think that has to be that
9367000	9369000	and if for whatever reason they can't hear
9369000	9371000	that then I would kind of wonder
9371000	9373000	why they can't
9373000	9375000	respect your wishes that you want to go
9375000	9377000	through that process of saving the money
9377000	9379000	that you want to do and build the
9379000	9381000	system that you want. Now granted
9381000	9383000	there's three sides to every story
9383000	9385000	your side, their side, and the truth
9385000	9387000	so I'm only able
9387000	9389000	to really say this based on what I'm reading in this
9389000	9391000	email
9391000	9393000	I would just say you're not really
9393000	9395000	under any obligation to accept
9395000	9397000	a gift but at the same time
9397000	9399000	you should probably acknowledge that
9399000	9401000	hey somebody wants to do something nice
9401000	9403000	for me and that's a good thing but this whole
9403000	9405000	thing about the whole I bought you
9405000	9407000	a card and you need to be at home
9407000	9409000	and all that stuff that's
9409000	9411000	a little weird but the fact that you refuse delivery
9411000	9413000	you could have accepted the card and
9413000	9415000	then taken her the card and said you know I
9415000	9417000	appreciate this but I'm going to give it back to you
9417000	9419000	it might have been a little easier way to do
9419000	9421000	it without starting a whole
9421000	9423000	fight there
9423000	9425000	but anyway
9425000	9427000	would you care to
9427000	9429000	suggest anything to that Loki
9429000	9431000	I did not realize we were going to be
9431000	9433000	playing therapy on OLR in that email
9433000	9435000	but that's alright
9435000	9437000	I hope you guys can work it out, it's the holidays
9437000	9439000	it's the freaking holidays
9439000	9441000	hug it out
9441000	9443000	alright
9443000	9445000	one more email here
9445000	9447000	from YYR
9447000	9449000	Hello
9449000	9451000	OLR
9451000	9453000	feverishly working on diagrams for my
9453000	9455000	provisional patent application
9455000	9457000	if that sounds boring it's because it is
9457000	9459000	ugh I'm fascinated that you're going
9459000	9461000	through your patent application I would like
9461000	9463000	to hear more about that process someday
9463000	9465000	seated to my right however is Amy
9465000	9467000	and she is not bored because she is playing Ori
9467000	9469000	in the Blind Forest I don't know how I missed
9469000	9471000	this game when it came out months back but I took a
9471000	9473000	gamble on it grabbing it for $10 on the Black Friday
9473000	9475000	sale knowing absolutely nothing about it
9475000	9477000	fast forward a bit and I can honestly
9477000	9479000	say it's a game I feel I have a responsibility
9479000	9481000	to recommend to almost everyone specifically
9481000	9483000	if you like Metroidvania style games at
9483000	9485000	all and have an Xbox One you need
9485000	9487000	to buy this the controls are perfect
9487000	9489000	the gameplay is just as addictive as it is
9489000	9491000	in the best games in that genre and the graphics
9491000	9493000	well as far as games with 2D
9493000	9495000	gameplay and 3D graphics go I've never seen one
9495000	9497000	so beautiful the music is fantastic
9497000	9499000	too and some of the power ups are really
9499000	9501000	inventive and fun to use it's not a super
9501000	9503000	long game so it won't take you away from your other
9503000	9505000	bigger games for more than a few days
9505000	9507000	the chance is high that it will go on sale again
9507000	9509000	when the big Xbox sale begins in a few days
9509000	9511000	very possibly to the $10 I got
9511000	9513000	it for but quite honestly I'd pay the
9513000	9515000	full $20 for it
9515000	9517000	it is that good and if you buy
9517000	9519000	it over the next few days it will be on your
9519000	9521000	best game of the year list Rob
9521000	9523000	I'm looking at you and possibly winking
9523000	9525000	um surprise YYR I
9525000	9527000	actually bought that game already I bought it in
9527000	9529000	a sale I don't think it was Black Friday sale but they
9529000	9531000	did some other random sale it was either
9531000	9533000	at the end of summer or um
9533000	9535000	beginning of fall I don't remember there was maybe
9535000	9537000	Labor Day sale or something and uh
9537000	9539000	Codeman was telling me what a great game that was and I
9539000	9541000	heard it was Metroidvania so I actually checked it out
9541000	9543000	and I did really enjoy it admittedly
9543000	9545000	I did not spend enough time with it because
9545000	9547000	you know it kind of fell in that
9547000	9549000	avalanche of games that's coming out in the
9549000	9551000	fall but um I do want to go back
9551000	9553000	and spend some more time with it because I
9553000	9555000	also agree it's a real gorgeous game
9555000	9557000	and you know I love me some Metroidvania
9557000	9559000	uh the game
9559000	9561000	really ramps up in difficulty fast though from what
9561000	9563000	I remember like I remember I was like playing in the beginning
9563000	9565000	I'm like oh this is easy this is easy and then like
9565000	9567000	just kidding so
9567000	9569000	um yeah there is that
9569000	9571000	but yeah I've already checked that out YYR
9571000	9573000	but uh I'm sure the listeners still appreciate
9573000	9575000	uh a little uh plug
9575000	9577000	and so forth uh have you checked that out Loki
9577000	9579000	the Ori and the Blind Forest? Um
9579000	9581000	no I have not you'll have to keep an
9581000	9583000	eye out for that on the Steam sale because I
9583000	9585000	I agree with YYR it's almost certain to show up
9585000	9587000	on Steam sale or Xbox One
9587000	9589000	or one of those so
9589000	9591000	alright uh and uh
9591000	9593000	lastly hope you guys and all the listeners
9593000	9595000	have a Supra Ultra
9595000	9597000	Hyper Mega Merry Christmas

9649000	9651000	well we do
9665000	9667000	Loki
9667000	9669000	um I guess
9669000	9671000	I don't know FU2
9671000	9673000	not knowing um what my ship
9673000	9675000	is gonna be next year because I'm trying to
9675000	9677000	trade ships with other employees but
9677000	9679000	I'm waiting for their
9679000	9681000	managers to approve it
9681000	9683000	it's supposed to be within a five day time frame but no
9683000	9685000	one is getting back to me yay or nay
9685000	9687000	I hate it when like if they're not gonna
9687000	9689000	approve something just say listen we're not gonna
9689000	9691000	approve it or you know listen
9691000	9693000	they've decided not to go with your
9693000	9695000	ship trade
9695000	9697000	just let me know either way
9697000	9699000	you know don't leave me in limbo
9699000	9701000	alright
9701000	9703000	um my FU of the week uh
9703000	9705000	things have been going pretty well I uh
9705000	9707000	I've had a pretty good weekend there's not a lot I can
9707000	9709000	give an FU to um I would say
9709000	9711000	um
9711000	9713000	um oh FU to the computer problems
9713000	9715000	I've been having tonight FU to Skype
9715000	9717000	FU to Skype
9717000	9719000	fucking breaking my computer with the
9719000	9721000	updates and I really don't know how I'm gonna fix
9721000	9723000	it I'm gonna have to do some type of like
9723000	9725000	deep clean where I go in and remove every single
9725000	9727000	Skype file I don't even really know how to
9727000	9729000	do that but that's time
9729000	9731000	this week I didn't want to have to spend and now I'm gonna
9731000	9733000	but I'm doing it for you guys
9733000	9735000	so we can make sure we continue the calls here on
9735000	9737000	OLR cause having a listener
9737000	9739000	interaction here on OLR is very important
9739000	9741000	and I would never say FU to that so
9741000	9743000	I will work to fix Skype
9743000	9745000	even if that means updating the computer
9745000	9747000	because honestly the show computer hasn't been
9747000	9749000	upgraded since when did I throw the
9749000	9751000	DevaFit that was when I was living with John
9751000	9753000	that was a while ago that was um
9753000	9755000	the DevaFit was in the garage
9755000	9757000	that would have had to have been what 2009
9757000	9759000	2009?
9759000	9761000	so this no
9761000	9763000	I'm losing
9763000	9765000	track in my head I want to say it was maybe like
9765000	9767000	2009 when that happened maybe a little earlier
9767000	9769000	even like 2008
9769000	9771000	so getting old I know right
9771000	9773000	I can't remember years well no I said the
9773000	9775000	computer's getting old even those power supplies
9775000	9777000	don't last that long yeah so it might be
9777000	9779000	time to sub out a few parts
9779000	9781000	maybe the power supply for sure
9781000	9783000	and I don't know maybe try to put some more RAM or even
9783000	9785000	another chip in there and just see
9785000	9787000	if I can boost it to where it can run
9787000	9789000	Windows 7 or something and some of the more
9789000	9791000	modern stuff but you know
9791000	9793000	more RAM I am I am such
9793000	9795000	the type that's like I don't want to fix
9795000	9797000	what's not broken
9797000	9799000	but now it's breaking so it never works correctly
9799000	9801000	just like stupid Unity and fucking
9801000	9803000	Windows 8 and now Windows 10
9803000	9805000	doesn't it's like for no reason it just
9805000	9807000	stops working no one has the answer to why
9807000	9809000	this isn't working it's just eh fuck
9809000	9811000	it Unity 5 no not gonna
9811000	9813000	work yeah uh TigerCon
9813000	9815000	chat says I remember the time OLR's computer
9815000	9817000	went down after the video card died that's
9817000	9819000	when this computer came in because and that was you
9819000	9821000	guys and I gotta say that is one of
9821000	9823000	I I I I
9823000	9825000	rendered speechless quite often on this show
9825000	9827000	I must say by the generosity of the
9827000	9829000	listeners and so far cause you know we don't we don't ask for
9829000	9831000	money or anything like that but you guys
9831000	9833000	banded together and bought fucking
9833000	9835000	computer parts and so this computer
9835000	9837000	we're using is a listener donated computer
9837000	9839000	so there's also a tiny
9839000	9841000	part of me there's a tiny part of me that wants to make it
9841000	9843000	last as long as possible but
9843000	9845000	I'm in a much better place finance not that I'm like
9845000	9847000	rolling in money but I'm in a better place
9847000	9849000	I'm certainly not but I'm in a better place financially now
9849000	9851000	than I was six years ago so
9851000	9853000	if I have to kick down a little bit of money to
9853000	9855000	buy a new chip or some RAM or a new power supply
9855000	9857000	or whatever I don't mind we'll we'll make
9857000	9859000	it work so alright
9859000	9861000	uh anyhow
9861000	9863000	let's uh let's move on we got a few more
9863000	9865000	stories for you guys then we're gonna try
9865000	9867000	to open up the Skype line but I'm gonna warn you guys
9867000	9869000	it's gonna be a little wonky tonight so we'll do our
9869000	9871000	best uh try to at least get some calls in here
9871000	9873000	so let's get to Loki
9873000	9875000	so now they've added one on one
9875000	9877000	rival battles for Guitar Hero
9877000	9879000	TV that's of course part
9879000	9881000	of Guitar Hero Live
9881000	9883000	and um I guess you'll
9883000	9885000	be able to once you've hit
9885000	9887000	level 10 you'll be put
9887000	9889000	against other similarly skilled
9889000	9891000	uh players on one on one
9891000	9893000	battles and they
9893000	9895000	said that twice during every
9895000	9897000	30 minute slot on Guitar Hero
9897000	9899000	TV channel um
9899000	9901000	you'll find another player I guess
9901000	9903000	and then the winner of the challenge will
9903000	9905000	receive an extra uh
9905000	9907000	100 XP
9907000	9909000	I don't get this game anymore
9909000	9911000	I still need to
9911000	9913000	get it I keep saying I'm gonna get it
9913000	9915000	and then I uh I don't so
9915000	9917000	I need to pick that up cause uh
9917000	9919000	um it was a lot of fun to play
9919000	9921000	in the demo and so forth and I have to
9921000	9923000	admit I was not expecting that out of Guitar Hero
9923000	9925000	so uh I didn't drop all the money for it day
9925000	9927000	one but uh uh
9927000	9929000	I want to check this out so
9929000	9931000	too many games and not
9931000	9933000	enough time that's right isn't that isn't
9933000	9935000	that it and you know we all have to hold down
9935000	9937000	day jobs so we don't get to
9937000	9939000	I don't have time to play
9939000	9941000	games unfortunately
9941000	9943000	well I end up staying up till one in the
9943000	9945000	morning every day to play games
9945000	9947000	and get my nice
9947000	9949000	five hours of sleep we
9949000	9951000	try though we do the best we can cause we love games
9951000	9953000	although for some stupid
9953000	9955000	reason I can make tons of time for fucking ingress
9955000	9957000	which is retarded
9957000	9959000	ingress is a game it's just a different
9959000	9961000	type of game it's a social game
9961000	9963000	it's a chore
9963000	9965000	it's like a farm
9965000	9967000	I went to an ingress party that had nothing to do with
9967000	9969000	playing the game I was just hanging out with some of the people this week
9969000	9971000	oh I don't know who any of the people are I mean I've
9971000	9973000	met them I gotta meet introduce some more of them
9973000	9975000	just some really fun people to play
9975000	9977000	alright uh
9977000	9979000	anyhow let's move on one more story for you guys
9979000	9981000	also about music games and this one is about
9981000	9983000	Rock Band 4 which I finally
9983000	9985000	imported my Rock Band 3 songs over the weekend
9985000	9987000	so I have that to look forward to
9987000	9989000	playing all those games but one
9989000	9991000	thing I'm not gonna get to do is play them online
9991000	9993000	cause Harmonics said this week
9993000	9995000	we're not sure yet where online multiplayer
9995000	9997000	fits in our roadmap
9997000	9999000	now Harmonics is saying that online multiplayer
9999000	10001000	is very much on the table for Rock Band 4
10001000	10003000	but they don't know exactly
10003000	10005000	where that fits in
10005000	10007000	on the Harmonics blog David Sussman
10007000	10009000	said online multiplayer is
10009000	10011000	a part of a much bigger conversation
10011000	10013000	we know it's at the top of a lot of people's want list
10013000	10015000	online play with Rock Band is a big deal
10015000	10017000	given the amount of different combinations of player
10017000	10019000	4 potential instruments, different difficulties
10019000	10021000	song affinities between players and so forth
10021000	10023000	there's a ton of testing necessary
10023000	10025000	as well as technical back end to work through
10025000	10027000	in order to provide a fun stable experience
10027000	10029000	for any future development
10029000	10031000	especially features that have existed in our legacy
10031000	10033000	Rock Band games
10033000	10035000	we want to be able to improve and refine wherever
10035000	10037000	possible in the case of online
10037000	10039000	play we have a lot of critical feedback
10039000	10041000	on the Rock Band 3 design that we'd love to be able
10041000	10043000	to address. Adding this functionality
10043000	10045000	is very much on the table but we're not sure
10045000	10047000	yet where it fits in our roadmap
10047000	10049000	part of our process includes taking
10049000	10051000	your advice into consideration
10051000	10053000	before it can deliver a feature as complex
10053000	10055000	as online multiplayer we would like
10055000	10057000	to better understand what you want
10057000	10059000	and find to be important
10059000	10061000	blah blah blah we're gonna send out a survey
10061000	10063000	about online play shortly blah blah blah
10063000	10065000	fill it out
10065000	10067000	now dark to see you in chat saying I don't get there
10067000	10069000	hold up I mean didn't the previous games have online
10069000	10071000	multi maybe I'm wrong I've really only
10071000	10073000	played a little bit of 3 offline
10073000	10075000	2 and 3 both had it
10075000	10077000	and I think that's why a lot of people
10077000	10079000	are confused because it's adding
10079000	10081000	into that whole perception that Rock Band
10081000	10083000	4 was a step backwards for the game
10083000	10085000	I just don't
10085000	10087000	let's just call it what it is
10087000	10089000	it was fucking rushed out
10089000	10091000	seriously it shouldn't be
10091000	10093000	it's on our table of stuff that we're gonna
10093000	10095000	add into the game
10095000	10097000	that's just features
10097000	10099000	it should've been fucking if it's not done
10099000	10101000	it's not done don't release the game
10101000	10103000	don't just put it out there because oh we need to
10103000	10105000	get those sales in
10105000	10107000	but here's the double edged sword
10107000	10109000	with that I think Harmonix is in a
10109000	10111000	tricky position especially because you know
10111000	10113000	let's not forget Rock Band 3
10113000	10115000	had that EA money and it had that MTV
10115000	10117000	money so I think in a way
10117000	10119000	Harmonix had to get the game
10119000	10121000	out there to fund the game they really
10121000	10123000	wanted to make I realize
10123000	10125000	that's not what you want to hear
10125000	10127000	nobody wants to hear that
10127000	10129000	but that's what's happening
10151000	10153000	you know it's just like
10153000	10155000	you know with Kinect and stuff
10155000	10157000	well Kinect's gonna do all these fantastic
10157000	10159000	things except it can't
10159000	10161000	but Kinect 2.0 will
10161000	10163000	but it can't
10163000	10165000	but Kinect 3.0
10165000	10167000	it's like no I'm not gonna buy that
10167000	10169000	alright
10169000	10171000	we are to the point of this show where we're gonna open
10171000	10173000	up the Skype line over at 1877
10173000	10175000	game OLR or actually
10175000	10177000	I don't think the toll free number is working right now
10177000	10179000	I think I enabled something
10179000	10181000	that now because I can't log in on the desktop
10181000	10183000	I can't undo that so
10183000	10185000	I am just gonna give out our regular Skype
10185000	10187000	which is Orange Lounge Radio all one word
10187000	10189000	on Skype I'm gonna warn you guys
10189000	10191000	we're doing this a little differently tonight so I don't know how this
10191000	10193000	is gonna go but
10193000	10195000	fuck it we'll do it live so if you wanna
10195000	10197000	give us a call go ahead Orange Lounge Radio all one
10197000	10199000	word on Skype the Skype line is open
10199000	10201000	now
10201000	10203000	if you do have general questions of course you can always
10203000	10205000	yell those out in chat if you don't want to actually call in
10205000	10207000	you can always give us the questions in the chat
10207000	10209000	room I would usually use tweets
10209000	10211000	to fill time but my phone
10211000	10213000	is now dedicated to the Skype line
10213000	10215000	tonight which we are getting a
10215000	10217000	call coming in on the Skype line so I'm gonna try
10217000	10219000	and get to it right now
10219000	10221000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?
10221000	10223000	Legend of Zaku here
10223000	10225000	Hey Zaku how you doing?
10225000	10227000	Yeah it's been a long
10227000	10229000	yeah it's been like ages I know I've been
10229000	10231000	sacking off on this OLR thing
10231000	10233000	Well welcome back we missed you
10233000	10235000	what's on your mind?
10235000	10237000	Nothing much other than
10237000	10239000	well in about a minute my
10239000	10241000	birthday's coming up Well happy birthday
10241000	10243000	you're a holiday baby
10243000	10245000	Yeah that too
10245000	10247000	and you know essentially
10247000	10249000	right now
10249000	10251000	kind of in the midst of trying to
10251000	10253000	switch over on FSX to the Steam
10253000	10255000	edition which is gonna be fun
10255000	10257000	and hopefully they'll get me
10257000	10259000	onto Windows 10 Other than that
10259000	10261000	it's like I guess going on that
10261000	10263000	whole Rock Band multiplayer thing
10263000	10265000	I guess you know
10265000	10267000	you're right
10267000	10269000	at some point
10269000	10271000	Harmonix wants to avoid
10271000	10273000	something known as Scope Creep
10273000	10275000	where because it's like
10275000	10277000	because of the actual
10277000	10279000	requirements
10279000	10281000	and the fact that they need to hit a hard deadline
10281000	10283000	they have to
10283000	10285000	forgo certain features
10285000	10287000	even if they were standard
10287000	10289000	and I guess
10289000	10291000	the fact that they have to
10291000	10293000	position themselves as trying to contrast
10293000	10295000	against Guitar Hero Live which
10295000	10297000	for all intents and purposes I hear didn't
10297000	10299000	do as great as Rock Band 4
10299000	10301000	And you know
10301000	10303000	what's interesting about that whole thing is
10303000	10305000	I bet the history of the franchise
10305000	10307000	really played into that because
10307000	10309000	I have to be brutally honest
10309000	10311000	as unfair and
10311000	10313000	as it might sound of me
10313000	10315000	I kind of judged Guitar Hero Live
10315000	10317000	based on the prior Guitar Hero
10317000	10319000	games and I probably
10319000	10321000	shouldn't have done that
10321000	10323000	I think as they
10323000	10325000	were released
10325000	10327000	I can't believe I'm going to say this
10327000	10329000	I kind of think Guitar Hero was the better game out of the box
10329000	10331000	and I kind of
10331000	10333000	made a mistake choosing Rock Band 4
10333000	10335000	based on all these other promises
10335000	10337000	I don't know
10337000	10339000	it's weird
10339000	10341000	it's a really weird situation for me but the reality is
10341000	10343000	there's only so many
10343000	10345000	fucking plastic instruments I'm willing to have
10345000	10347000	and Guitar Hero
10347000	10349000	took a huge risk
10349000	10351000	changing not only where the
10351000	10353000	instruments can't really be used
10353000	10355000	but they really changed the formula with the whole
10355000	10357000	six buttons I mean you couldn't even
10357000	10359000	use the old ones if you wanted to
10359000	10361000	so unfortunately
10361000	10363000	the risk isn't paying
10363000	10365000	off and I almost feel bad because
10365000	10367000	that's twice now
10367000	10369000	that developer's kind of gotten screwed
10369000	10371000	for problems that aren't really theirs
10371000	10373000	because that was the developer of DJ Hero
10373000	10375000	horrifically underrated
10375000	10377000	game and now they've got Guitar Hero
10377000	10379000	Live which also is kind of underrated
10379000	10381000	and I feel bad, I'm part of the problem
10381000	10383000	Right
10383000	10385000	and I guess in Harmonic's case to their
10385000	10387000	benefit by focusing
10387000	10389000	more on getting the install
10389000	10391000	based compatibility
10391000	10393000	at the expense
10393000	10395000	of online multiplayer
10395000	10397000	bringing it back to
10397000	10399000	the core mechanics of
10399000	10401000	actually having to go to someone's
10401000	10403000	place to play Rock Band, bring back that
10403000	10405000	experience I guess that was more important to them
10405000	10407000	and you know
10407000	10409000	as I said this is a stepping stone
10409000	10411000	provided that they make enough
10411000	10413000	money that they could probably just
10413000	10415000	add, they could probably patch this in
10415000	10417000	a later update. Remember
10417000	10419000	you gotta keep in mind that Harmonic's
10419000	10421000	for all intents and purposes
10421000	10423000	would most likely release one
10423000	10425000	version of that
10425000	10427000	Rock Band franchise for that
10427000	10429000	platform's entire
10429000	10431000	lifespan meaning that
10431000	10433000	because you could actually patch in features
10433000	10435000	it shouldn't you know
10435000	10437000	adding online multiplayer
10437000	10439000	isn't like world ending in that sense
10439000	10441000	because remember they see it
10441000	10443000	as a platform and not necessarily a release
10443000	10445000	Right and you know
10445000	10447000	I'm trying to be fair to Harmonic's
10447000	10449000	and you know I think I kind of said what I said about
10449000	10451000	the fact that you know they're in a different position now
10451000	10453000	than they were a couple of years ago but
10453000	10455000	the reality is niceness
10455000	10457000	and understanding only goes so far
10457000	10459000	when you're asking for $100 of my money
10459000	10461000	true but
10461000	10463000	at the same token
10463000	10465000	it could have been worse like Guitar Hero
10465000	10467000	Live you had like
10467000	10469000	almost zero
10469000	10471000	songs from the original
10471000	10473000	the previous releases carrying over
10473000	10475000	like you're talking about people who spent
10475000	10477000	upwards of at least a thousand bucks
10477000	10479000	on Rock Band DLC alone
10479000	10481000	in almost a decade
10481000	10483000	that it's been ever since the first
10483000	10485000	release so that's a hell of
10485000	10487000	a longevity in terms of DLC
10487000	10489000	literally carrying from one generation
10489000	10491000	to another
10491000	10493000	Well at least Guitar Hero is doing something a little
10493000	10495000	different with the whole streaming thing
10495000	10497000	but I get your point I mean I understand that
10497000	10499000	you know Guitar Hero and maybe that's part
10499000	10501000	of the reason Guitar Hero also took
10501000	10503000	a hit in sales is that they didn't promise
10503000	10505000	that backwards compatibility
10505000	10507000	so to speak that Rock Band did
10507000	10509000	and I think that's one reason a lot of people were jazzed
10509000	10511000	about Rock Band and that would completely
10511000	10513000	explain why Harmonic's
10513000	10515000	had to cut certain features out because
10515000	10517000	obviously making the hard
10517000	10519000	deadlines a lot more important
10519000	10521000	but I think this is important
10521000	10523000	Harmonic still has not
10523000	10525000	fully met that promise
10525000	10527000	it took them a month to do it
10527000	10529000	for Rock Band 3 we still
10529000	10531000	do not have original Rock Band, Rock Band 2
10531000	10533000	Rock Band Lego there's still a lot of stuff
10533000	10535000	missing and I don't think that's
10535000	10537000	okay I don't think that was okay
10537000	10539000	for them to misrepresent
10539000	10541000	that there's really
10541000	10543000	no nice way for me to put it I feel it was really
10543000	10545000	misrepresented when they announced it
10545000	10547000	is that they're gonna bring all that
10547000	10549000	stuff out but not day one
10549000	10551000	well as I said this is
10551000	10553000	welcome to the world of
10553000	10555000	licensing where now the lawyers
10555000	10557000	have to play have to basically negotiate
10557000	10559000	they're basically
10559000	10561000	negotiating with the music industry
10561000	10563000	well negotiate it before you announce it
10563000	10565000	true yeah you usually don't
10565000	10567000	announce it until the ink is dry
10567000	10569000	but you know now they're pretty much
10569000	10571000	caught right there you know
10571000	10573000	they're exposed in that
10573000	10575000	if for some reason certain
10575000	10577000	Rock Band tracks unless they've
10577000	10579000	specifically stated that certain tracks
10579000	10581000	may not make it
10581000	10583000	make it over to Rock Band 4
10583000	10585000	as a disclaimer they're pretty much
10585000	10587000	caught in the sense that
10587000	10589000	you know there were the only thing they
10589000	10591000	have is their word and if their word doesn't
10591000	10593000	deliver on the you know
10593000	10595000	thousand plus dollars worth of DLC
10595000	10597000	certain Rock Band
10597000	10599000	you know last gen Rock Band owners have
10599000	10601000	then yeah you know
10601000	10603000	it would suck to spend all
10603000	10605000	that money and
10605000	10607000	all of it getting left
10607000	10609000	behind as a result because harmonics
10609000	10611000	basically you know
10611000	10613000	they basically jumped the
10613000	10615000	gun a bit too early in terms of
10615000	10617000	trying to handle that transition
10617000	10619000	but that pretty much could break
10619000	10621000	the entire music
10621000	10623000	rhythm genre for consoles
10623000	10625000	in general
10625000	10627000	unfortunately I think
10627000	10629000	I mean you're right and that's
10629000	10631000	the really sad thing especially having been
10631000	10633000	fans of music games for so long is that if
10633000	10635000	both these games tank there's
10635000	10637000	not gonna be rhythm games for a good
10637000	10639000	well I shouldn't say that
10639000	10641000	there will be rhythm games and it's gonna be
10641000	10643000	indie and that's gonna be awesome
10643000	10645000	but the day of the plastic instruments is dead
10645000	10647000	yeah and this is where
10647000	10649000	like an arcade would you know
10649000	10651000	Japan probably being the last bastion
10651000	10653000	of rhythm gaming or
10653000	10655000	that area around the Pacific Rim
10655000	10657000	but yeah you're right
10657000	10659000	well unless but
10659000	10661000	I mean for those that follow
10661000	10663000	Kyle Ward on Facebook
10663000	10665000	something's up so
10665000	10667000	we'll have to get in touch with him later
10667000	10669000	to get more insight on that I don't know
10669000	10671000	I don't want to comment on somebody's Facebook
10671000	10673000	but I think all that stuff is public
10673000	10675000	so it's not like it's not out there but
10675000	10677000	very interesting stuff I heard
10677000	10679000	I know he went to Japan
10679000	10681000	past couple of weeks
10681000	10683000	you know Grant that was in Peru just like
10683000	10685000	following him there's a video we're seeing
10685000	10687000	if you haven't seen it yet where
10687000	10689000	he's definitely dancing on an 8 arrow
10689000	10691000	mat you've never seen it before
10691000	10693000	oh wait I think I get it
10693000	10695000	now I think I may have saw that in my feed
10695000	10697000	an 8 arrow oh Jesus
10697000	10699000	so anyway that means he's probably
10699000	10701000	unless he worked on something
10701000	10703000	with Konami that would have to explain
10703000	10705000	his meetings out there who knows
10705000	10707000	who knows anyway I don't wanna
10707000	10709000	I gotta watch how far I go down that
10709000	10711000	we'll let him on the show when he wants to talk about that
10711000	10713000	but anyway Zaku
10713000	10715000	we'll let you go for now
10715000	10717000	alright take care buddy thanks for calling

10741000	10743000	but we are getting oh I'm sorry Skype noise is coming through
10743000	10745000	hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this
10745000	10747000	hey this is Akdeaf
10747000	10749000	hey Akdeaf buddy what's on your mind tonight
10749000	10751000	well like I taste
10751000	10753000	with Reginator's email
10753000	10755000	oh okay
10755000	10757000	yeah I'm gonna talk about the
10757000	10759000	Neo Geo
10759000	10761000	Humble Bundle oh yes
10761000	10763000	you were commenting in chat about the whole controversy
10763000	10765000	around the emulators what's going on
10765000	10767000	yeah basically
10767000	10769000	nobody knows because
10769000	10771000	it kind of was
10771000	10773000	it did get
10773000	10775000	some coverage
10775000	10777000	but it wasn't like really big
10777000	10779000	but basically
10779000	10781000	on the day
10781000	10783000	that Humble got released
10783000	10785000	a friend of mine
10785000	10787000	a really close friend of mine called
10787000	10789000	FoxHack on Twitter
10789000	10791000	found some really interesting details
10791000	10793000	about the
10793000	10795000	where they got the
10795000	10797000	ROMs for the games
10797000	10799000	so basically
10799000	10801000	those ROMs came from
10801000	10803000	torrents
10803000	10805000	pirates torrents of those games
10805000	10807000	and you can find
10807000	10809000	them on the code they have
10809000	10811000	and also
10811000	10813000	a really big issue that
10813000	10815000	also came from
10815000	10817000	that is that the emulator
10817000	10819000	at first
10819000	10821000	was thought that it was
10821000	10823000	like an illegal
10823000	10825000	one at least for
10825000	10827000	for in this case
10827000	10829000	.emu to use
10829000	10831000	so
10831000	10833000	basically
10833000	10835000	after a day
10835000	10837000	the day after it happened
10837000	10839000	basically .emu came out and
10839000	10841000	replied to my friend
10841000	10843000	here that
10843000	10845000	the emulator was
10845000	10847000	gotten or was acquired by
10847000	10849000	GameTap
10849000	10851000	I think
10851000	10853000	and they have a legal use of it
10853000	10855000	but
10855000	10857000	some other details
10857000	10859000	appeared on this
10859000	10861000	I'm gonna
10861000	10863000	pretty much quote something
10863000	10865000	I have on the
10865000	10867000	sorry on the website
10867000	10869000	I have here
10869000	10871000	some thread basically on
10871000	10873000	name world
10873000	10875000	so if I'm following correctly
10875000	10877000	just to make sure because there's a lot of moving parts here
10877000	10879000	if I'm understanding this correctly
10879000	10881000	the pirated ROMs
10881000	10883000	Neo Geo grabbed them
10883000	10885000	and ended up turning around and selling them
10885000	10887000	which I have to admit
10887000	10889000	is kind of some funny irony
10889000	10891000	and honestly it's kind of like one of those
10891000	10893000	well I don't
10893000	10895000	this is gonna sound crazy
10895000	10897000	I don't see the problem in that
10897000	10899000	turnabouts fair play
10899000	10901000	this is not necessarily the problem
10901000	10903000	that they got the ROM from
10903000	10905000	an illegal torrent
10905000	10907000	it's more the
10907000	10909000	hold on
10909000	10911000	because Act F is gonna have a hard time
10911000	10913000	hold on Act F
10913000	10915000	they're gonna sue themselves what
10915000	10917000	seriously it's like
10917000	10919000	there's no way that whoever illegally put those up there
10919000	10921000	is gonna have any recourse
10921000	10923000	those are our files
10923000	10925000	but I think this is where you're going Act F
10925000	10927000	the problem is the emulator
10927000	10929000	because the emulator technically is nothing
10929000	10931000	that's not technically illegal
10931000	10933000	I know a lot of people use them for illegal purposes
10933000	10935000	but yeah if you include the
10935000	10937000	emulator you didn't pay for that
10937000	10939000	well that's not irony
10939000	10941000	somebody did program that
10941000	10943000	for homebrew stuff
10943000	10945000	and who knows what
10945000	10947000	that's a little bit of a different territory
10947000	10949000	than the ROMs themselves
10949000	10951000	yeah basically the ROMs are not the problem here
10951000	10953000	it's more like
10953000	10955000	they're pretty much lazy
10955000	10957000	and .emu has a really bad history
10957000	10959000	on laziness
10959000	10961000	doing ports and stuff
10961000	10963000	but that's not the issue here
10963000	10965000	the issue here is the emulator
10965000	10967000	and I'm gonna post
10967000	10969000	a post here on this thread that I linked on
10969000	10971000	on the chat
10971000	10973000	the problem is Nebula
10973000	10975000	uses the main
10975000	10977000	FM cores, Nebula being the emulator
10977000	10979000	they use
10979000	10981000	which even to this day we haven't got Jarek
10981000	10983000	a person who programmed
10983000	10985000	the emulator
10985000	10987000	to relicense for commercial use
10987000	10989000	it's one of the biggest sticking blocks
10989000	10991000	for relicense efforts
10991000	10993000	so unless Alsemi
10993000	10995000	another programmer there
10995000	10997000	specifically rewrote them
10997000	10999000	for this then it can simply
10999000	11001000	it can be legal
11001000	11003000	there's other main codes
11003000	11005000	in Nebula too so it's not really clear cut
11005000	11007000	as they make out
11007000	11009000	Nebula definitely uses main FM cores
11009000	11011000	and some of the main bits
11011000	11013000	I don't recall
11013000	11015000	so it probably wasn't legal for GameTap
11015000	11017000	to use it and it's likely
11017000	11019000	not for .emu
11019000	11021000	either unless they replaced
11021000	11023000	all of it
11023000	11025000	so a reply from that says
11025000	11027000	from Alsemi himself
11027000	11029000	one of the programmers
11029000	11031000	I can hardly remember who wrote them
11031000	11033000	it was many years ago
11033000	11035000	but GameTap had their own FM
11035000	11037000	68K
11037000	11039000	and C80 cores
11039000	11041000	that they plugged into Street Nebula
11041000	11043000	core and integrated them
11043000	11045000	in their platform
11045000	11047000	I just provided the code
11047000	11049000	and I was able to redistribute
11049000	11051000	only the code
11051000	11053000	written by me, Alsemi
11053000	11055000	and assistance on
11055000	11057000	how to plug the other cores
11057000	11059000	into their frontend
11059000	11061000	so to try and simplify
11061000	11063000	this for listeners who might have a hard time
11063000	11065000	following all this drama
11065000	11067000	especially with all these internal names of emulators
11067000	11069000	and so forth
11069000	11071000	I get the sense what's happening is that MAME
11071000	11073000	which of course is the multi arcade machine
11073000	11075000	emulator, very popular
11075000	11077000	multi arcade machine emulator
11077000	11079000	if I'm not mistaken it's open source
11079000	11081000	part of open source is that the source goes out there
11081000	11083000	but you don't have the right to resell it
11083000	11085000	am I correct?
11085000	11087000	basically
11087000	11089000	and so essentially if you're taking these MAME pieces
11089000	11091000	and putting it in your Neo Geo
11091000	11093000	emulator that I guess is being used
11093000	11095000	on the Steam platform
11095000	11097000	they're essentially selling MAME
11097000	11099000	and I'm really oversimplifying it
11099000	11101000	but they're essentially selling those MAME parts which is illegal
11101000	11103000	correct?
11103000	11105000	so that's kind of it
11105000	11107000	although if GameTap
11107000	11109000	in this case, sorry, DotEmu
11109000	11111000	says they got those licenses
11111000	11113000	from GameTap
11113000	11115000	which they acquired them legally
11115000	11117000	so there's not a big
11117000	11119000	problem here but
11119000	11121000	it's kind of shady because
11121000	11123000	they didn't
11123000	11125000	came through at first with this
11125000	11127000	and it's still
11127000	11129000	not clear where they got
11129000	11131000	at least in this case GameTap
11131000	11133000	how they got the code
11133000	11135000	or at least how they
11135000	11137000	they were selling those
11137000	11139000	ROMs
11139000	11141000	and enablers
11141000	11143000	well realistically I mean I could see it
11143000	11145000	one of two ways I could see that they just put the MAME
11145000	11147000	code in there because they were probably like fuck it
11147000	11149000	it's our game we'll do what we want
11149000	11151000	and I realize that's not what you're supposed to do
11151000	11153000	that could be
11153000	11155000	but I could also see that they could have contacted
11155000	11157000	GameTap to get that code because
11157000	11159000	I mean GameTap is
11159000	11161000	it's not with Turner anymore
11161000	11163000	they sold that years ago to an overseas company
11163000	11165000	they probably were able to get
11165000	11167000	they probably emailed somebody at GameTap
11167000	11169000	yo do you still have this code could we pay you like
11169000	11171000	pennies for this code and
11171000	11173000	GameTap was like oh yeah sure we don't have anything else
11173000	11175000	going on I mean
11175000	11177000	they could probably got
11177000	11179000	that GameTap code for pennies
11179000	11181000	I mean so
11181000	11183000	but I
11183000	11185000	don't know but this guy here
11185000	11187000	does say that he
11187000	11189000	gave the code written by him and assistance
11189000	11191000	on the other course so I don't know maybe they were able to get
11191000	11193000	the GameTap stuff but we don't know
11193000	11195000	and I don't think they're gonna exactly
11195000	11197000	be saying it I guess
11197000	11199000	we should be happy
11199000	11201000	I don't know to try and put a positive spin
11201000	11203000	on this even though I don't know there is one
11203000	11205000	it is being sold on Humble Bundle
11205000	11207000	which a lot of that goes to charity anyway
11207000	11209000	so yeah
11209000	11211000	that's something that a lot of people did
11211000	11213000	when they heard the story
11213000	11215000	break and when they
11215000	11217000	read my friend's Twitter
11217000	11219000	most people
11219000	11221000	they did want the game
11221000	11223000	so they
11223000	11225000	they gave all the money to charity
11225000	11227000	so at least something good came of it
11227000	11229000	so yeah
11229000	11231000	at least there's that but very
11231000	11233000	interesting I had no idea that that was
11233000	11235000	the drama but essentially it is that the
11235000	11237000	mame is basically being resold
11237000	11239000	potentially
11239000	11241000	and I can see where that's
11241000	11243000	ruffling a lot of feathers
11243000	11245000	thank you for the insight ActDeaf I'll make sure that the money
11245000	11247000	goes to charity when I pick it up
11247000	11249000	sure alright
11249000	11251000	well take care of my friend I'm gonna let you go so we can try to squeeze in
11251000	11253000	one more call ok?
11253000	11255000	hey thanks for coming on take care
11255000	11257000	alright there it is
11257000	11259000	one more call there
11259000	11261000	and we're gonna try to open it up for one more call
11261000	11263000	to squeeze in 1877 Game
11263000	11265000	OLR or a username on Skype
11265000	11267000	Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us
11267000	11269000	a call I don't know why I keep giving out the phone number because I just said
11269000	11271000	it didn't work but when you say one
11271000	11273000	thing for hundreds and hundreds of episodes it's pretty
11273000	11275000	hard to get it out of your vocabulary
11275000	11277000	Loki any last minute
11277000	11279000	things you're pulling up there while we're waiting for one more
11279000	11281000	call potentially here?
11281000	11283000	just the HTC Vive has gotten some
11283000	11285000	sort of improvements and because
11285000	11287000	of that I want to say that it was
11287000	11289000	going to be pushed from
11289000	11291000	to April 2016
11291000	11293000	as far as
11293000	11295000	the release date and they're going to be showing offset
11295000	11297000	improvements at CES
11297000	11299000	interesting
11299000	11301000	alright
11301000	11303000	one last shout out for calls
11303000	11305000	Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype
11305000	11307000	it looks like it's working that's the good news
11307000	11309000	the only downside is I'm getting some of the Skype noises
11309000	11311000	there as I have to unmute and mute
11311000	11313000	the cell phone feed
11313000	11315000	from the
11315000	11317000	mixing board but that also means
11317000	11319000	I can play stuff from my iPhone
11319000	11321000	right there into the mixing board
11321000	11323000	that's kind of fun do you want to play some Flappy Bird?
11323000	11325000	have some Flappy Bird sounds?
11325000	11327000	want to do Ingress?
11327000	11329000	well I'm dumping my keys out of my
11329000	11331000	capsules because I had to put
11331000	11333000	them all in there when I was doing that fielding
11333000	11335000	which by the way it made checkpoints so that's good
11335000	11337000	hey congrats that's great did you go up on the leaderboards?
11337000	11339000	31 nice
11339000	11341000	make 100 slots available so I can give you some gear
11341000	11343000	when the show's over oh I've got tons
11343000	11345000	hook you up!
11345000	11347000	let's see
11347000	11349000	I guess that's it
11349000	11351000	we're not getting any other calls so I guess
11351000	11353000	we're well after 9 o'clock anyway so I think
11353000	11355000	I'll go ahead and close up the Skype line
11355000	11357000	there and thank you guys who
11357000	11359000	did get in and if you didn't get in you
11359000	11361000	can always email the show
11361000	11363000	participate at orangeloungeradio.com
11363000	11365000	is the place to send us an email I'm very sorry
11365000	11367000	I didn't get to the tweets tonight but my phone was being
11367000	11369000	taken up for something else so I'll
11369000	11371000	try to get to those next week
11371000	11373000	but that's going to do it for another
11373000	11375000	episode of Orange Lounge Radio
11375000	11377000	we're back weekly we will be
11377000	11379000	here on Sunday I think many shows you
11379000	11381000	listen to will be having
11381000	11383000	the week off and they probably deserve it
11383000	11385000	but since we already have taken several weeks off
11385000	11387000	we're going to be here next week and
11387000	11389000	the week after right on into
11389000	11391000	2016 and the 14th
11391000	11393000	year of Orange Lounge

11395000	11397000	and going through that very awkward puberty phase
11397000	11399000	that is going to be our 2016
11399000	11401000	here at Orange Lounge Radio
11401000	11403000	maybe our voices will start changing

11427000	11429000	this program those reviews go an awful
11429000	11431000	long way and we appreciate them all

11451000	11453000	hardworking indie developers as we
11453000	11455000	get into 2016 I met a lot of great ones
11455000	11457000	at GX and I hope to meet more at
11457000	11459000	MAGFest and whatever shows I show
11459000	11461000	up at in 2016
11461000	11464000	Dark
11464000	11466000	Sakura had to leave early tonight but
11466000	11468000	I'm sure if she had a final
11468000	11470000	thought she'd say something like reject
11470000	11472000	false icons we'll leave it at that but
11472000	11474000	Loki how about you what's your final
11474000	11476000	thought tonight as we head on out for the night
11476000	11478000	at least it's a short week
11478000	11480000	it is
11480000	11482000	I was going to try to get my game
11482000	11484000	done this year but I don't think it's going to happen
11484000	11486000	you only got a week and a half left
11486000	11488000	I've been trying to work on it but I've just
11488000	11490000	been mentally exhausted so
11490000	11492000	I actually have been working out
11492000	11494000	very slowly like maybe a
11494000	11496000	minute or two at a time
11496000	11498000	because like I literally come home brain
11498000	11500000	dead and between calls I don't have
11500000	11502000	enough time to like shift focus
11502000	11504000	like that so it's been a
11504000	11506000	rough year in some ways I mean I was going through
11506000	11508000	a lot personally especially in the first half of
11508000	11510000	the year like you guys know how long
11510000	11512000	some things were taken to get done and
11512000	11514000	a lot of that I kind of blame on some of my personal
11514000	11516000	life circumstance and that's getting better but
11516000	11518000	you know I stay pretty
11518000	11520000	busy with work and so forth so a lot of that
11520000	11522000	like I wanted to do more streaming and more video
11522000	11524000	production but it's just kind of slack this year
11524000	11526000	I'm really hoping to kick that into gear next year
11526000	11528000	so we'll see what happens
11528000	11530000	so anyhow
11530000	11532000	my final thought tonight is
11532000	11534000	thank you for spending your
11534000	11536000	holidays here with us at Orange Laundry radio
11536000	11538000	and I am so appreciative of the time
11538000	11540000	that you spend to take to listen to our show
