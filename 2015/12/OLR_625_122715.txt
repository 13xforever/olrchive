Orange Lounge Radio
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
Twas the nightmare on Christmas when all through the net did the outrage explode the frustration was met
Join us for the news on this episode here now, the news and much more and it all starts right meow
On the show where every gamer has a voice
Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the very last Orange Lounge Radio episode of 2015
My name is Rob Roberts here with you in lovely Sacramento, California in Studio N7 joined by my co-host
Say hello over there to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
I have been freshly groomed
Yes, your hair looks amazing, I know it's radio so it doesn't do
I'll try to take a picture, someone can take a picture of the back of my head
Post a little selfie, put it on the tumblers, get some likes
Maybe, we'll see
But it's red and purple and I kind of have the Ramona Flowers haircut
Yeah, I like it
Except it's straight and I don't have the banks
And our mutual friend Monet who I've done Rocky Horror with, I went to Wizard World in Reno with
So I think she probably showed up on my Twitter at some point
She does the hair and she has amazing hair herself and so forth
Though I have to ask Rob
So if you're in Sacramento and you need a stylist
See Monet
We'll hook you up, yeah, see Monet
But by the way Rob, what's this about the Bible?
The Bi-
We're not telling that story on air
In the Bible
Cause Monet's really funny and she laughs at my really immature stuff
So when there was a Bible in the hotel room
Dot dot dot, that's all I meant to tell about the story
Rob had a moment
I don't want to offend folks that might be offended if I were to finish that story
I'm not gonna go into-
But I think it's just more funny that now I know
And I can tease you relentlessly cause it was pretty funny
Yeah, and I didn't ruin or do anything that would make somebody not want to touch it
Why do you have to tell that story right at the top of the show?
I'm not telling the story
These people that are tuning into Orange Lounge Radio for the first time are like
Oh, what a bunch of sacrilegious-
And on Christmas, on Christmas
It's not Christmas
These sacrilegious assholes
It's only still Christmas if you're Catholic, Lutheran, or Anglican
And I'm Jewish, so it doesn't matter
Well, did you have a good week in spite of everything being closed on Thursday?
Christmas did kind of blow
But I got toys
And a lot of chocolate
And sometimes a lot of chocolate makes up for the stuff that blows
That's good, chocolate's amazing
And no, it wasn't Bible in the sex motel
Thank you, Ikuma
We don't have love hotels like that here in the US
We just have-
Have you been to West Sacramento?
We have these seedy little rundown hourly things
But they're not nice like a real love hotel
Ah, okay, fair enough
You put a quarter in the bed and it shakes
Or so I've heard
Love hotels are apparently pretty nice
Like, they're the ones over there
Okay
Not here, alright, anyway
But we're not here to talk about love hotels
We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
As we do every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network
Live.vognetwork.com
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern is when we tape
On Sunday nights, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
And if you are listening live, you should join us in chat
Live.vognetwork.com
You might be asking yourself right about now
Why didn't Rob introduce Loki?
Well, Loki is not here tonight
He does have the night off, he went to do a-
He was stuffed into a trunk and left in the ocean
Yes, he's flying somewhere over the North Pole right now
Probably trying to capture an ingress node
So he's on hiatus tonight
No, he had other family stuff going on
As I'm sure a lot of people do
During this time between Christmas and New Years
However, since we were off for a bunch of weeks in November
Due to other circumstances, we wanted to make sure
We were still giving you guys a show this week
So, we are joined in studio though by some special guests
To help us fill the void left by Loki's absence tonight
Some familiar faces here in studio
I'm sure you guys will be happy to hear from
Say hello to
Vognetwork superfan
Flaco Jones is in the house tonight
OMG, it's Flaco, how are you doing, Flaco?
I'm doing great, how are you doing?
Great, it's so good to see you
Yeah, it's like I haven't seen you in such a long time
I haven't seen you in like a whole day
No, seriously, thank you for hosting the little holiday
Choir way last night
I guess it was a holiday thing, I don't know
Well, we did gaming
Yeah, we did some gaming
We played Jackbox Party Pack 2
Fancy Wine Party
Which I won, you're waxed, thank you very much
You did
And I won the other one
Quiplash
Yes
And then Alan won
Sketch
You won the Warioware
Warioware sketch
Yeah, we played Warioware
Which I keep forgetting that's a thing
Warioware Pictionary, yeah, pretty much
Yeah, but you can actually play that with one gamepad
You can pass it around
Yeah, it's super fun
Yeah, good times
We'll get to your gaming week in a little while
But how was your holiday?
Did you get any good gaming stuff going on for your holiday?
I got a new controller for my PS4
Oh yeah
It's the 20th anniversary one that looks like a PS1 controller
I thought you could only get that if you got the full on PlayStation 4
No, they made a bunch more of them
Oh, okay, cool
They were really expensive originally
But they were on sale for, I think, 44 bucks at Best Buy
Right when the holiday shopping season started
Who's gonna complain about that?
I know, I was like, that's pretty awesome
I love it when Steam sales carry over into retail
As well
Yeah, so I thought, you know, oh, this will be cool
But then I was like, wait, I can't play any PS1 games
On my PS4
Except Final Fantasy VII
Which actually reminded me
It's like, oh yeah, you can play Final Fantasy VII
That's the one you can play
So I was like, well, that would be fun
And I heard it's kind of cool with the cheats that they have in that game
Actually, yeah, I know some folks on Twitter that are replaying it right now
And the cheats apparently help a lot
Yeah, because then you don't have to worry about the whole grind again
You're like, oh, I can just cheat
I've already played the game
Yeah, you're not really cheating
You're just fast-forwarding
No, no, it's not just that
It lets you heal your whole party
Yeah, but you don't have to use that
You don't have to use any of them
You don't have to use any of them
If you want to fight the weapons and all that
I wouldn't say it
It just makes it real easy
Now, what is it?
You have your Vita with you
Oh, yeah, my Vita
But it looks like a Game Gear
Like, what did you do to your Vita?
I bought a thing a while ago
It's Trigger Grips, I think that's what it's called
Yeah
And yeah, it just makes it feel more like a controller
Huh
Because I don't like it
Ever since the PSP, I've hated the design
Yeah
This little circle thing
I used to have to test games on it at Konami
We played Frogger on PSP
Right
And some of the Winx games
And it was so uncomfortable to hold for all those hours at work
And so when I got a Vita
I was like, the first thing I want to buy is some kind of grip
And I looked it up and these Trigger Grips
Trigger Grips
They also make the triggers easier to push
At some point, just play around
And try putting your hands on that Heaven's Word Vita from Japan
That I have right there
Is that a
Because that's the newer model that they never released here
Okay
And, like, you have to have really tiny hands
I think to be able to effectively use that
That's like a Slim, right?
Yeah, it's like the
They released a Slim here
It's just not white
Oh, did they?
Yeah, X4 has one
I didn't think they released the other model
Yeah, you have one too
Yeah, no, it is lighter and it's a little bit smaller
Alright, well
I still think it's uncomfortable to hold
So much for me paying attention
I guess I missed that
But, I mean, again, it's not like
It's not like I was planning on getting a second Vita
Yeah
It just kind of happens for my birthday
Where Alan was like, I know Rob really wants that Heaven's Word Vita
That's what they say about children
They just kind of happen
They do
Well, that's how
My brother and sister were adopted
Like 14, 16 years later
I was an oops
Yeah, me too
I always say, I was a mistake
And my mom goes, no, Rob, you are a pleasant surprise
But then I made your father have the surgery
Anyway, let's see
This is a good time to introduce our chat room as well
Over at live.vognetwork.com
We were having some technical difficulties earlier in the studio
We got a little bit of a late start
The podcasters won't hear that
But some continued issues from my Skype nightmare last week
Carried into this week
And ended up changing some audio settings unknowingly
But that caused Tigerclaw to say in our chat room
Over at live.vognetwork.com
Flaco Jones on the show
No wonder the show didn't start properly initially
Oh, the curse continues
Make sure the recording is also working
And Alex P
And your UPS, don't forget that
Alex P Carson in chat says
Rob scared me when he said last show
Of 2015
That's what was printed on the card
I just had to read what was on the card
That's what was printed on the card
We do have another guest here in studio with us
That comes to say hello a lot on the show
We're happy to have back Shane tonight
I just woke up
I know, and now you're going to be very monotone dry, Shane
I'm a little sleepy
Well, to help you wake up, Shane
I'm going to give you 30 seconds to talk about Power Rangers
Ready, go
So today we went looking for more toys
And I found one that I was looking for at Toys R Us
And it was awesome
And I still don't have the ones at Target
Because they don't have them around here yet
And it's really making me mad
Because one of them is really cool
He's Navy
And he's awesome
And it's just so infuriating
And time's up
But you actually
You've gotten so into this toy collecting thing
That you use websites to track Target inventory and stuff
Yes, I do
That can be very helpful for Amiibo and things like that too
Yeah, Power Rangers is more important
Any gaming stuff for your holiday?
Have you splurged on any of the sales or things like that?
No
No?
Wait
I'm waiting
Fantavision, but it really wasn't part of the holiday
It was just a new release and it was on sale
It's still nice to see more games being released during the holiday
Even if digitally
Because usually this is just a dead period
Once you hit Black Friday
There's no games released in December usually
Sometimes you might have a fringe game that's running a little late
But otherwise there's no games
So it's kind of nice to have some digital treats
Even if it's old games being done new again
vidpower and our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says there's websites to track Target inventory
Now you're going to have to share on Twitter or something
I don't know
Yes there is
It's called BrickSeek
And you have to know Target DPCI numbers or it doesn't really work well
Which is some type of internal thing
Yes
So you have to go make friends with the Target person
Or go read their little labels if you're looking for specific things
Alright
Dually noted
We can use that for possibly game hunting later on
He called that out in chat room over
Is he the one that told you about that?
No
Because apparently he told you about the amiibo figures
I know I didn't take credit
And then you told me
Yeah I didn't take credit
Well but I just assumed it was a you thing
No and then I backed him up when he said that
Well that's fine so I appreciate it both
Because I actually got one of the figures I ordered today
I got a Palutena from Japan
No no that was something later
That was me telling you that one
He told me about the Dedede and Rosalina
Oh okay I got those
I want a Dedede
Check Amazon they may still have them pretty cheap
Yeah I bought one today
So yeah my amiibo collection keeps growing
I think I'm up to
$75,000
No it's not $70,000 it's $60,000 something
Maybe $69,000 we'll just say $69,000
I have two What's Your Faces?
From Animal Crossing the pink one
Lottie
Lottie yeah two Lotties
Because Dan bought me one and I already had one
Oh okay
So I have to go trade her in at Target
Oh there you go
And if you know the number you know which Target already has them on shelves
And which ones don't
Alright there it is
That is not helpful for that situation
You're using it wrong
Alan Alchemy again great radio
Alan Alchemy is calling out in chat
Flaco what do you think of the collection on the shelves?
I did that yes
The other night
Oh okay so those of you guys that listened to Hoard House
When it was still around about six months ago
Grandpa was in town on Christmas
Because he was spending it with some friends he had here in Sacramento
So of course what does he want to do with me in the evening?
He wants to go drinking
Yeah
So and Alan's like hmm thanks but no thanks right
So which I can understand
So I went downtown to have some drinks with Grandpa
And while I was gone Alan decided he was going to completely
Reconfigure my amiibo collection
Which usually you would think that would drive my OCD a little bonkers
But like actually he even made it like anal retentively better
He spaced the shelves all equally
He put an equal amount of amiibo on each shelf
And spaced them in the same manner
And he tried to group them together best he could
Except I was like when I did get home I was like
Mewtwo is a Pokemon and so he shouldn't be up there
He should be down here with the other Pokemon
And Alan was like but this shelf is villains
And I'm like I'm sorry but Mewtwo
Pokemon is more important than villains
So he needs to go on the Pokemon shelf
And Alan's like hmm
And you need to get a new
Is that in the other room?
Our OCDs battle sometimes
Yeah it's in the other room
We have to check it later
You have to check it later
Because it's more important that we get into our kickoff topic tonight
It is the last show of 2015
And as we typically do with our last shows of the year
We want to take a look back at the year in video games
And I'm sure a lot of your gaming press sites
A lot of your gaming podcasts
Are all doing a similar thing this week
And that is that they are recapping
The best games of 2015
However we here at Orange Lounge Radio
Have a different view
Because you know what
You can't possibly have time
Unless you're paid to do it
To play every single video game that's out there
Every single release and so forth
So I think it's very hard to say what the best game is of 2015
It's all subjective
It is, it is
So tonight we're going to present
As we do every year
Our favorite games of 2015
Because that's what they are
And that way it's neither right nor wrong
It's our favorite
And F you if you don't agree
Right, right Dark Sakura?
That's it
And keep in mind
Yeah, foo
Foo
Keep in mind
Sometimes we blur the lines a little bit
Games that were released at the end of 2014
Or even, who knows
Could creep into 2015
Just because this is the year we discovered them
I think that happened with like Mass Effect 1 year or something
They'll creepy creep
They'll creepy creep a little bit
So that's all part of the rules
And tonight I actually have a bumper for this
So, without further ado
Live from Studio N7
It's the Orange Lounge Radio Best Video Games of 2015
Yay
It's not our favorites
Alright
You did that whole long explanation
After I just did that whole explanation
Shane is going to be combative
No, Shane is like
This is the right answer
And if you don't agree
Then you're wrong
That's pretty much how it is
Alright
So we're going to go around the room
And since Loki isn't with us this week
Of course we'll catch up with him next week
But for those of us gathered here tonight
We want to recap our top 3 favorite games of 2015
And why
Wait, it's not our best now?
It's our favorite
I said it was our favorite
Whether or not they came out
Pay attention
It's gone from favorite
To best
To top
Oh, to top now
X is what, in your opinion
Is the most enjoyable thing
That you have participated in
In recent history
This past year
Thank you
Lay down the goddamn law, DarkSakura
I need it
What the fuck I'd do
Alright
Let's get to it
The best
Top
Favorite
Mostest
Do I have to name them all?
No, just number 3
DarkSakura, what is your third favorite game of 2015?
Number 3 is Undertale
Undertale
A game I have yet to play
I've only barely played it
I'm on my neutral playthrough
So that I can go to the pacifist playthrough
But it just fucking exploded my tumblr
And that's why I have it
I know more about the game now
Without having hardly played any of it
But the fact that it's basically
Hit like the Five Nights at Freddy's level
Of immediate super stardom
You know, fanocity
It actually makes me feel a little home stucky
Okay
And so until Hiveswap comes out
This is going to be my replacement
So there it is
Undertale is your third favorite game of the year
And yeah, it's pretty hard to escape
A lot of the fandom of Undertale
I'm more of a twitter guy than a tumblr guy
But I try to use both
And it's hard to escape it
So it does seem like every year
There's that one indie game
And there ought to be more
Because indie games are great
But there's always that one indie game
That just really breaks through
And actually this year I'd argue there's two
Because one of them is on my list
But anyway
There's Minecraft a few years ago
Five Nights at Freddy's obviously
I read that book
I forgot
That was part of my gaming week
We haven't done gaming weeks yet
Oh but you talked about what Christmas
Video game things I did
And that's kind of the same thing
Are you just here to correct me tonight?
That's what I do every night
When you're talking
Anyway, let's check out some other number threes
I was going to do Shane next
But since I'm mad at him right now
We're going to go to Flaco next
Flaco
Your third favorite game
You look like you still haven't decided yet
It's been the toughest decision for me
Number three
Because there's so many good games
I think I narrowed it down like on the drive here
I've been flip flopping this week too
For what it's worth
I love the PS4 remake of Tearaway
Loved it
Got some bugs in it that bugged me
It's hard knowing that five million people
List bugged me
It's hard knowing that five million people
Listen to this show
And your opinion can sway people that much
On the interwebs
So the time has come
To make a choice
Number three is
It's Rocket League
Rocket League
Rocket League has gone up and down on my list
I think it's just based on
How many people are playing it
I think I settled in at number three
What is it about Rocket League?
If I like Yoshi more
I should play it more
Rocket League is just a fun
Goofy indie game
Great online experience
So it's like a lot of the online stuff
That really wins that game over for you
Yeah I like playing online
It's just crazy to see
The moves you can make
The last second comebacks
It's just a fun game
They've added some new maps now
That actually put some new terrain
Not every map is the same dimension anymore
Which is nice
Is that something I was kind of down on it
When it first came out
And they made that free
You can pay for the Mad Max update
And get the cars and everything like that
But you get the map for free
PlayStation Plus really got
A really sweet deal with that
Because everybody else has pretty much
Had to pay for it at this point
To get that base game on Steam
I actually enjoyed the game so much
Actually I don't think I bought it on Steam
I think Jason gifted it to me
But I would have bought it for myself
If Jason wasn't so goddamn nice
But I got to get it on both platforms that way
I think it was awesome that it came on PlayStation Plus this year
I'm considering getting it on Xbox One too
It just came out on that right?
That's what I do with games I like
I buy them everywhere
So you're like extra fur
Do you know the Mass Effect 3 story?
Oh that's right I know that
Go into some comments from our chat
On the games announced so far on our list
Over at live.vognetwork.com
I act deaf responding to Dark Sakura's selection of Undertale
I was like Dark Sakura
I knew a lot about the game
Before I even played it myself
So that game just has a lot of word of mouth right now
Let's see Tigerclaw says
Rocket League has to be on everyone's list
That's a game that came out of nowhere
And became a huge success
Well who knows it may show up on a list
Somewhere else to make
I actually do not know
I think I know it's on Shane's list
I talk to him way too much
I don't know everybody else's list in here
So we may have some overlap
But it is time to get to Shane
And Shane your number 3 favorite game of 2015
I would say it's going to be
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
You finally settled on Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
Well I actually was pretty sure
That was my number 3 for a while now
It's 2 and 1 that I'm going back and forth on
So Everybody's Gone to the Rapture on the PlayStation 4
What is it about Everybody's Gone to the Rapture?
I love the story, I love the atmosphere
I love the music
I don't care that some people may say
That all you do is walk around
I mean that's more fun
Than a lot of other games I played this year
So I think it was just a beautifully done game
It's a great experience
There's little
I mean they have little secrets throughout the entire game
And you get a better
Understanding of the whole story the more you find
And it's just
It was beautiful from start to finish
Loved it
Well Shane I think that's a really good pick
Because my number 3 favorite game of the year is
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
On PlayStation 4 and I actually didn't know
That's what Shane was going to pick for number 3
But that is also my number 3 pick
For favorite game of the year
I actually flip flopped on this a lot
There's another game that was really close
And I just didn't end up putting it
I chose Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
Some people may not consider it a game
But kind of like Shane said
Exploration is a huge part of it
And I think exploration
And that sense of
What goes into a game
Is why games like Minecraft are huge
Exploration is a huge part of that
And there's still objectives too
It's not just like you're watching everything happen
Yeah and Minecraft has
I understand creation there's more to it
I'm not trying to compare the two games
But I just feel that Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
Was a gaming experience
Where at the end of it
I just had to talk to somebody about it
And you don't get that a lot in games
You know where it's like
I need to call Shane
And talk to him about it
I need to go on the internet and find people talking about the ending
Because there's so much that's left
Open to interpretation with the ending
And honestly
One of the best soundtracks to a game
I've heard in a very
Very long time
And something else
The audio in this game
I mean the visuals are gorgeous too
But the audio in this game
From the soundtrack to the voice acting
Is top notch
So you know what for a download title
Even if it's a little short
And some folks may be like
Where's the action? Where's the quick time event?
Some people may be left with that
I still think this is a game
Well worth your time to check out
And it's one of my top three of the year
Because even though there are no enemies
And nothing that can hurt you in that game
There were times where I was kind of scared to continue
Because I was like what's going to happen
Is something going to jump out at me
There's nothing that does
But I was literally creeped out many times
Well you need to go the wrong way and miss the story element too
Oh yeah
And that's something about that game
You kind of have to find everything
That's why I don't think there's any question it's a game
Because if you don't find all the right stuff
You don't get the whole story
Then it really won't make sense
But the challenge is really finding all those things
If you take the wrong path
You have to double back and find the right thing
There was one scene
One scene that Shane got that I didn't get
That completely changed the interpretation of the ending
I know it's the one where the guy disappears
In front of the priest
Yes, so we're trying to keep it a little
That's the beginning
That's the first chapter
And I missed that
And it completely changed the interpretation of the ending
So I mean it is important
So if you haven't played this game
Play it
And what's funny is I was talking to a game maker
At GX3 a couple weeks ago
And I won't say what the game is
But I'm excited about this game too
And we'll hopefully have him on the show at some point
But I actually said
Playing this reminds me a lot
Of everybody's gone to the rapture
And have you played it and he said no
And I said you've got to play it
If you're going to make a game like this
And he said he would
So we'll see
Anyway I was seeing if there was any comments
On this game but everybody in chat is suddenly
Talking about Niko Atsume
Neko Atsume
Which is the cat game on iPhone
It's not so much of a game
It's just more like
One of those shitty iPhone collector games
No
You just put out stuff for cats
And then you
Kind of fuck off for an hour, come back
So it's cat lady simulator
It's cat lady simulator
Oh my god my cat has a bag on its head
Alright let's move on
To our number two
Picks for 2015
Dark Soccer your second
Favorite game of 2015
That's going to be Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer
Why?
Just because it takes all the things that people like
The most about Animal Crossing
Which is the amassing of shit and decorating your house
And just blows it up
And I like having the cards
Because I finally used my amiibo card reader
And had
I decorated for DJKK
And gave him the ultimate hipster apartment
It's just fun
I mean it's fun and easy
It's
I would say it's casual because you can play it in like
15 minute increments
But for me
I just like being creative with the space there
And working in the limited
Availability with an entire
You know
Inventory behind me to do whatever I wanted to with
You know and I'm looking at our chat over at
live.vognetwork.com
And actdef says I didn't like Animal Crossing
Happy Home Designer that much
You know and I can see where maybe people kind of feel
Differently about this game based on
Like what you said it takes one element
Of the original Animal Crossing and kind of expands
On that and I have to admit I don't know
If I'd be super into it either because
I was always more about I want to run around
The island I want to find things
It's kind of more that exploration thing too
Like I love the Game Boy Advance thing
Connecting I love going on the internet and going to other
People's places I would like to have
Another Animal Crossing game
Because I mean I played like for
A year and a half I played
New Leaf
And I would really like to have a new one
But for the interim this just sort of gives me
My little bit of
Animal Crossing you know in small
Easy to carry around
Doses that I can play during my break at work
Well and I wonder at this point if they're just going to skip
The Wii U and move to Nintendo's next console
If that console is truly going to be next year
No we need to have it on Wii U
Because we need the island on the gamepad
We'll see
Listen to me Nintendo make this happen
We'll see you never know
Carson in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
New Leaf for the win and Act F does admit
It's entertaining enough and I can see the appeal
Of it so there you go
Alright let's move around with some more
Number two favorite games of the year Flaco
My number two game of the year is
Until Dawn
Until Dawn on the PlayStation 4
The horror movie
Blend genre
Cross over thing
Super fun interactive movie thing
So yeah it was a blast to play
I uh you know
Played through the whole game
Got one ending and I've since gone back
And I've like tweaked some things
Once you go back in you can kind of
Chapter jump around so I
Kind of redid the ending because I had almost everything right
And I did an ending where everybody lives
So it's not a spoiler because you can have
Any like variation of people like living
Or dying at the end of that game
So I got the everybody lives like trophy so that was really
Fun to do too so now I want to get like
Everybody dies so I'm like
That one's a little bit harder to get actually because you have to
Make some choices early on so I can't
Go back to the game I had I had to go back and start over
Again and in the process I'm looking for more stuff
So the fact that I've been able to
Not just play it the one time through which you think
Most people just do because there's so many
Different branching ways it can go and different
Like people can survive and you have
Different endings then yeah it's got
Me to replay it so it's got great replay
Replayability the acting is great
It's sometimes it's hilarious but cheesy
Like a regular just like a
Some teenage slasher movie from the 90s that's what it feels
Like yeah and I mean you know I think for
A lot of us that are PlayStation 4 owners
Many of us were kind of around when
Those 90 horrors films were
You know like when Scream really broke
Through and so forth and all the
You know knockoffs of that came
Through so I can
Definitely see the appeal of that
And why fans of that are going to be really
Into this also interesting
Too because you know with the PlayStation 4 and the
Xbox One and this new
Era of consoles
Social gaming is very big and I
Noticed there was a lot of and I think part
Of the reason Until Dawn
Even caught on bigger than I think
We all know Sony expected because Sony
Yeah I mean remember how much they
They didn't quite devil's third it
Not quite but I mean
Remember how much they were promoting that order
In 1886 and that game like flopped
For all I could tell and then this
Game they just kind of dump at the end of August
Like oh here's this one we're barely going to
Advertise it even though they had like statues
For the order and all these collector's
Edition and all this other stuff and then
When they brought out Until Dawn it's like oh
Yeah Europe gets a collector's edition but the US
Does it and here it is and whatever
And it ended up being a pretty big hit and now
It's got apparently a sequel in the works so
And oh and then there's the
VR PlayStation VR
Which is probably some other
Game they just slapped Until Dawn's name on
Okay whatever whatever it just goes to show
But it shows that now the brand is successful
And if they can do something like that if that's what they're doing
But I think and I never really finished my point but I think
The whole social and the sharing and
All that was a big contributor to why
The game did so well I think
This game really owes a success
To Twitch, YouTube
And social play throughs
Thanks to that
And I think Sony knows that that's a good thing
I think it's Nintendo that has to be educated
A little more on that stuff but that's alright
Okay some comments from
Until Dawn in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
Wyland says I loved
Until Dawn
AkumaJP with another perspective saying
Until Dawn in Japan is not selling well
Censorship killed it
That's true you know a lot of times
We here are very envious of the things they
Get in Japan but Japan's version
Of Until Dawn was censored because
The violence is
You know not
As well received so they do some
Fade to black in some parts
Oh that's terrible
Yeah like there's one particular scene and it is really gross
And I would not want to see it anyway
But it fades to black
I wonder if it's the one they show you over and over and over again
After it happens in the previously vlogs
Yeah they do a lot of that previously stuff
I wonder what the previously would happen when you
In the previously because each chapter
Is like an episode
And on the like previously on
It kind of shows you the big decisions you make
And it always shows you the death that happened
Over and over again
It's kind of funny I mean like I said
The acting in a lot of places is over the top
But I think appropriate and fun
For a game like that sure
It's totally like it knows what it is
It doesn't try to take itself too seriously which I love
Fair enough let's go to Shane with your number
Two pick of
2015 and I'm so excited to hear
What you finally settled on
My number two pick is Until Dawn
You also picked Until Dawn
I did
And why did you pick Until Dawn
Because I love that game
The story is fantastic it's engaging
It's hilarious it's really creepy at times
I watch it
A lot still even
Now months later on Twitch
Just watching people play
Because it's like watching a fun movie
And it's neat to see
People's reactions
Or things people do differently that you didn't do
The first time you played through
The cast is great
The writing is there
I don't know if it's good or bad but it's definitely there
And I'm really excited for a sequel
Or whatever they do with the second one now
But aren't you a little worried that maybe
The sequel is not going to have the magic of this
First game because I mean
Part of why I think this first game was successful
Is because the bar was so low
Now the bar is going to be higher
And this may be a really unfair comparison
But the Blair Witch Project you remember that
Remember when that movie came out it was like the biggest
Fucking thing in cinema for like the year
And this whole like found footage phenomenon
And some people didn't know if it was real
Or not and all this
And then they made a sequel and it was god awful
But see the thing with Until Dawn is
Strip away this cast
And the lore around it
And keep that same formula and I'll be fine
That's all I need
Give me something just slightly different with new characters
That don't know what they're getting into
And we're good
But like they could stand to not show the same death scenes
Over and over again
In the previously on
Not that they're gross it's just like
The first time you see it's like oh my god I can't believe it
But like 30 minutes later when you've seen it four more times
Because they showed it to you again
Four more times you're like okay
I get it that person definitely
Is you know not alive anymore maybe
That person is very dead
Very very dead
Alright
And then going to our chat room with some comments
Over at live.vognetwork.com
Another comment on
Until Dawn, Wyland says
I think the sequel to Until Dawn should be something completely
New, make the series
In an anthology series
Well I don't want the
Same story, get rid of the
Characters too even though I'm gonna
Miss Mike a lot
I would like new characters
Alan Alchemy in
Chats making a little
Tongue and cheek reference to heavy censorship
In another country saying
Until Dawn in Australia is just them
Showing up to the cabin and having cocoa
And then it's like thank you for playing by
Because
That'd be kind of funny
That'd be it
That could be Until Dusk or something like that who knows
Anyway let's move on
Here it is
My number two pick of 2015
And it's actually one that's
Shown up on somebody else's list already
So we have a lot of consistency but my number two
Pick best game of 2015
Is Rocket League
I think Rocket League is
One of the best games of the year
It's actually the second best game of the year I believe
My favorite
And the reason why is I think a huge part of that
Is accessibility
Because a lot of people that don't
Really play a lot of games
I find are really drawn to
Rocket League because it's so stupidly simple
It's Mario Kart meets soccer
And everybody
You may not know a lot about soccer
But you know the general rules
Place ball in goal
Okay that's very easy
And then most people have played some type of racing game in their life
So it's a really
Stupidly simple concept
But then it has a lot of depth to it
With people doing the air trick shots
And the rolls and things like that
And the game looks great
And yeah
I have loved Rocket League
And I love that it's another
Indie success story of the year
Along right up there with Undertale
And a lot of the things we've mentioned previously
So that is why
I placed Rocket League number two
On my favorite games list
Tigerclaw in chat says
They released an update to Rocket League
That adds hockey mode
The ball turns into a giant puck
I heard about that but I haven't played it yet
I'm excited to check it out
Smaller ball, that was really hard
Oh my god
It's harder to hit
There's no way you're going to get an air trick on those things
Some people still did
It's easy to pick up
But it's so hard to master
But when you see someone that can master that game
I've been in a game where we lost 9-1 no problem
One player on their team just has
Ultimate control, it's insane
Kaijuto in chat says
That game needs planes, then I'd buy it
I could see it happening
You can fly in that game
You get a full thing of boost
You do a little jump, you can boost in the air
You can really take off, I did it in practice
It's just so hard to do in actual game play
It would make a lot of sense to have planes in the game
But then I think it would be too hard
It's hard enough to play with the ball in three dimensions anyway
Planes is going to make it really hard
Alright
Here it is
The moment you've all been waiting for
The number one
Most favoritest game
Of 2015
From Dark Sakura
You know what this is
I have a good feeling, but what is it Dark Sakura?
Dragon Age Inquisition
For all of the DLC that came out this year
Fair enough
Even though it was a release from last year
Don't care
It's been made new again for DLC this year
Because the DLCs by themselves have been
Pretty crazy and new adventures
And stuff and it's just added
So much more to the game
Dragon Age Inquisition game of the year edition
This year which had all that DLC in it
Yeah I paid for all of it
Of course you did
Trespasser if you
Were romancing Solas
Is like hi I didn't need my heart anymore
Step on it and set it on fire
And then shit on it
Hahahaha
However if you're romancing
Cullen then ahhhh
Nice
So are you excited about the future
Of Dragon Age? I mean I know we've got another
Mass effect cycle
To get through before we get there but
Eventually
Yeah you know they're going to do another one because they pretty much
How can they not?
I know the ending there
Yeah they're going to have to do more
And Inquisition I'm sure sold plenty
The Inquisition
Alright well nobody expects
The Dragon Age Inquisition on Dark Sakura's list
But there it is
Number one
Well I thought you would go
From this year and I thought you might pick the game
That I'm going to pick but I guess not
Alright we'll see
Let's move on
Most favoriteist
Flaco Jones number one
This is going to be such a surprise
5 million people hinging
5 million people
It's almost as many people that follow me on Twitter
And all those people know
That all I ever talk about is Splatoon
Not only is it my favorite game of the year
But it's one of my favorite games of all time
I just love it that much
It's the best Wii U game
I have a blast playing it all the time
I don't know what else to say about it
I think it's a near perfect game
Thank god someone took a chance on a new IP
Exactly
And it was Nintendo of all people
I mean
I guess all three games
Rocket League is not a new IP
But the other two are new IP
Yeah so
It's just a great game
Again it's one of those kind of easy to pick up
Hard to master
You can just have a fun time
Just playing turf wars all you want or you can really get into ranked mode
Which I didn't think I would do originally
Because I don't like shooters
But I started playing this and it's like
I'll test out ranked mode and suddenly I'm getting better
And I start looking stuff up online
How the gear works
The special stats you get for each piece
And then I went from just like
Oh I'm just going to play rollers
I'm going to shoot all the time
It's just a great game
For someone who doesn't like shooters
It still worked out really well for me
When I'm not in a mode of
I can't just splat everybody
Or kill everybody
I can just paint
And help out my team that way
Or help out my team in support ways
There are some guns that work better at support
I've done all the research on this stuff
I'm always in all the different community boards
And the reddit stuff
Tower controls right now
Bye guys!
And I do like
That this game
Has kept itself relevant
You can make fun of Nintendo
For only having 2 or 3 Wii U games
This year
But they've supported those games really well
With these frequent updates
We're constantly talking about Splatoon
Here on OLR because they did this splat fest
And now we have an entire
Internet war breaking out
About planes vs cars
Or what was the other
There was one where like
Our vs science was right down the middle
Right down the middle
51-49 on both counts
There was one I swear to god I said to act deaf
Fucking fight me
Pizza vs hamburgers
Cats vs dogs
That was a big one
Pirates and Ninjas was the one that really
Toured the internet up
Because ninjas were so
Popular but popularity is really
A curse in that game because it kind of hurts your team
And so
They lost because what counts more
Than anything is winning which I think
Kind of is the way it should be it wasn't originally that way
That's why
That's why dogs won
Even though the cats won way more games
The dogs won the splat fest because they were more popular
Well that's not really fun like the most popular
Team just wins without having to play
Well but I kind of see now why it was
That way I wish there was a little bit more of a
But in the end just win more games
That's what's important
A lot of people in chat lighting up about Splatoon
Kai Judo says Splatoon is the bestest of the best of the best
That's an exact quote
Act deaf says Splatoon is my number two game of the year
Some people talking about the recent Naughty vs Nights
Nice splat fest that went on
Vid Power says Splatoon is a post-apocalyptic world I'd like to live in
And even the little story that they tacked on there
It's kind of fun too if you read all the behind the scenes
Like the sunken scrolls and all that stuff
It's kind of weird like what's going on
Back there with the squid people
It's kind of creepy
Alright
Shane your turn here it is drum roll please
Your number one game of 2015 is
I want to say first that
Had I beat
Soma and Xenoblade Chronicles X
I'm pretty sure my list would be different
From my top three
We'll get to honorable mentions in a minute
Well then I didn't say that
But for my number one
It's Splatoon
Because I play it so freaking much
And despite the fact I have problems with a lot of things about it
Like the matchmaking is terrible
Absolutely awful
The splat fest
The way they do it I don't like it either
Because if you like
We were just talking about if you pick the more popular team
You're pretty much guaranteed to lose at this point
And I think that's dumb
And that actually goes back to the matchmaking
But
I get so pumped up when I'm playing
I just have such a good time
Nintendo really hit it out of the park
With this new IP
And I really hope
That we get a Splatoon 2
On NX as a launch title
Because then you don't need any other games after that
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
Shane's best game is PT
You know we talked about that
Yeah that was last year
Yeah we talked about this
It would be funny if PT was your top game this year
And last year
You can't do that
I know you can't
Well DarkSakura did actually
She just did it
Except mine had new content out this year
That is true
And mine just got removed from the Playstation store
Actually
YYR said he was able to download it
Yeah there's some new technique
Yeah you can get it again
Like literally
In the span of a year
Literally everybody hates
Everybody hates a company they used to love
In that game
In large part
But back to Splatoon
Splatoon is just so much fun
You can't stop playing it
You play with Flaco Jones online a lot
Oh yeah
Twin Squad
Because you can't do anything more than Twin
Or else you get screwed over
Because of their matchmaking system
Oh my god Nintendo learn online stuff finally please
Because it would really go a long way
Yeah the trisquads are the worst
Splatoon is so bad
You're just against an organized team
Yeah that's not so bad
But yeah Trisquad why can't they just throw in an extra person
An extra body helps
Or why
Do I have to play on Splatfest
If I accidentally pick the most popular team
Why do I have to just play with my own people
Why can't I just wait for another match
Against the other team so I can actually contribute
To the wins losses
For my team
To try to win Splatfest
Why as you know not a very high ranked person
In ranked mode are you throwing S's
And S pluses at me
When you know I can
Barely hold my own sometimes against like
A minuses
So even though it's your favorite game there are still plenty of things
Oh yeah there's a lot of things wrong with that game
But it doesn't stop me from playing hours
A day
Well it's my turn
My favorite game of the year and guess what
You guys I picked a game that's
On the Wii U
My favorite game of the year
I really think
Is it Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival
I almost named it because it's fun
It was close no
My favorite game of the year is Super Mario Maker
I think is the best thing
That's happened to gaming this year
And I think because
There's so much
That kind of little big planet
Kind of started
But I think the trouble that little big planet had
In a way is that it was a new universe
And something that was completely new
And it almost had
A level of over complication
With a lot of the stuff they added later
Now don't get me wrong I'm pretty sure little big planet
Was my favorite game of the year whatever year it came out
And it still is a fantastic
Series but I think what I really love
About Super Mario Maker is that it took a formula
Literally anybody that's ever
Touched a video game knows
And really opened it up
For people to create anything
And you know we started off
This year talking a lot about
Creation and you know we've heard
The saga of Loki's game and
Lord knows if he's going to finish it or not
But he's apparently really pushing to get something out by the end of the year
And you know we saw some of the
Results of what happened with the VoG jam
Earlier this year we were talking a lot about
Creating your own game
And those experiences and I think Super Mario Maker
I think really bookends that
Because you take something
Pretty much every gamer out there knows
And yet you learn a lot about
Game creation through the things that you go through
Online with the game
Like I gotta say for me
What a trip it is to watch
Somebody else play your level
On Twitch or YouTube
And do things with it that you
Weren't expecting them to do
You know and I think that social element
We talked about this before with Until Dawn
I think that social element and I wish Nintendo
Would get on board with this a little more and I think
I get the sense they're starting to warm up to it more and more
But I think the social element has really
Sky-rocketed something like Super Mario Maker
To just
Like its own
Genre in a way
It's just crazy what an impact that game has had
And I love that the game has been continually
Supported with regular updates
Be it the new costume characters you can put in the game
Some of the new things they've been putting in the levels
Like the checkpoints and so forth
I mean Nintendo
God bless them they've only put out like three games this year
On the Wii U but they have supported those games
So so so well
That it really is like a model that other
Companies should probably look at for
The way they support their games
So yeah I just
I can't not
Say that Super Mario Maker is
It's my favorite game of the year absolutely
Just all the experiences
Just the other day one more quick story about the game
Just the other day I was playing
It and I was doing some of the random courses
The eight stage
Course which is on easy right
So you get a lot of like auto
Play courses and you get a lot of really
Dippy courses
But one course kind of struck me a little bit
And that was it was a
A French player had made the course
Because you can see their little country flag
And it was something and I don't speak
French but it was basically
Paris Je t'aime or something like
Paris we love you type of thing
And it was obviously something that was made in
Response to the tragedy
That happened in Paris and it was
An auto play course but it went through
Like this Eiffel Tower scene
That was made out of coins and I
Think you know they had some other landmarks
That were there as well and it was like
Spelled out and I just I was
Kind of taken aback by
We have all these arguments
About our video games art
And what is art? Art
Is expression right it's a way
Of expressing yourself
Somebody chose to
In response to what happened
In their country this horrible
Horrible thing that happened they chose
To express their feelings
In a video game
And not a lot of games
Have brought it to us on that
Level yes I know about other construction
Sets hell there were things like you know pinball
Construction set back in the 80s and we've
We've had games where you can make other games
But I don't think we've ever had
Something on that level of
Mario where you can
Do that so I was just really taken aback that
You know somebody went to
Mario maker to express their
Feelings it was just like it was a really
Neat thing to see even if it wasn't
The greatest level per
Say because I didn't play it was just auto
I was just like wow this is this is
Art video games are totally
Art and this is this is
What it is so
Looking at our chat room over at
Live dot vog network dot com
Tiger kalon chat says I
Just played some super mario maker today
I played the new levels that were created
By some of you guys
And ikuma
Jp says maybe it's time to get a wii u
You know we're gonna talk about
Honorable
Mentions in a minute here but I saw
A configuration I was really thinking
Through the games this year I saw
A configuration where easily my number
One two and three games could have all been wii u
Games I mean really
And it's it's kind of close
For for
Some of you guys I'm sure
Let's see also going to chat over at live dot vog network dot com
DarkTetsuya says
I know I saw a level like that when Satoru
Iwata passed away someone
Did a tribute level to him and I remember
Playing it over the fall season
So there you go
Some other comments there on the
Art that is super mario maker my favorite game
Of 2015 so there it is so
A lot of overlaps on our list
But I think those are some good
Lists you guys does anybody want to take a second
And I'll just open the floor to general
Comments does anyone want to take a second to call out honorable
Mentions any honorable
Mentions things that you were really going back and forth on
Mario maker was a consideration
And I thought that might end up being your game
But I it wasn't my
Favorite I didn't really play a whole bunch of it
Um Dan played it a lot more
Than I did um
There was and it's actually more of a
Hack but Dan was playing this today tech mobile
2015 uh huh
Um that's basically
Just takes like tech mobile and hacked in like
Modern teams sure and their
Players and what not it was kind of funny to watch them play
It yeah um
I really I really am happy with the ones
That I picked especially since you know the new
Content for dragon age really kept
It like um you know
Like another chapter of the game you know
And it was all content from this year
So I was pretty happy with that
Uh look at our chat over at
Live.vognetwork.com William murder face
And chat says what did you think about Witcher 3
You know I have to be honest as
Gorgeous as the game is as I was playing
Through it I just didn't get to really
Spend enough quality time with the game and like I said
When we started this segment the reason why
We call it our favorite and not the best
Is because
We don't have time to play everything and I just did not
Get to sink the hours into Witcher 3 that it
Probably deserved probably because
Of the exact same time one of my honorable
Mention games I was playing a ton of
And that would be Final Fantasy Heavensward
And a big part of the reason I really didn't
Feel comfortable putting that in my top 3 is
A. Expansions fall in a really
Weird place I think I put the Diablo 3
Expansion in one year but that
Just changed the game fundamentally
Heavensward has had a weak follow up
Uh it's having a lot of problems right now
In some of the patching content but I think the
Initial game
That came out with the voice acting
The dungeon design the music
Was really just
A premier MMO
Experience and it kind of sucks that it's
It's having some problems here a few months out
But I think because that game
Was sucking down like all my time
I don't really think I got to give
Witcher 3 a fair break
What about some other honorable mentions from you guys?
Any? Well I said Soma
Just because I'm pretty sure I would end up
Loving the story if I finished it
Xenoblade honestly I've put so much time
Into Xenoblade Chronicles
X has amazing music
I don't care what people say the story is really
Good it takes a little bit to get into especially if
You are somebody that likes exploring
Open worlds which I usually don't by doing this
Game but
I can see it easily becoming my
Number one for this year
I will say Xenoblade was really close
For me and one of those 1, 2, 3 configurations
Would have had Xenoblade on it but I just
Felt the hurdle
You have to get through in the beginning is too great
And it just kept
That off me and you heard me express this
On the show previously I love
Where I'm at now in the game and I think
There is a lot to really love about
Xenoblade but you really
Have to work at it I think to
Love it and I think a really great
Game you shouldn't have to work at it
And the only other game I would have considered
Probably because I just haven't
Played it enough yet because when I
Got it I was definitely
On a lot of painkillers was
Rise of the Tomb Raider
And because I haven't played
Enough of it I can't really say
I think I see it on a lot of people's lists
I'm pretty sure I'd put it on mine too
Yeah I honestly have not gotten around
To playing it yet just too much other stuff
Going on Flaco
Yeah like I mentioned Tearaway Unfolded was really
Cool on PS4 and it did a lot of stuff
Different than the Vita version but since the Vita version
Is better I was like I'll still knock that one down
I mean it's definitely a different game
And they change a lot and they actually make it a lot harder
And then let's see
Yoshi's Woolly World
Liked that game a lot
Cracked top 3 there
And the other game that's definitely
Right on the border top 3 is
Jackbox Party Pack 2
We just talked at the top of the show
Bomb Corp alone is like
I think is worthy of being in that top 5
Of my favorite games of the year
So I just add in
With Quiplash XL which is amazing
And that's it
Earwax is not good
Earwax is great and Fibbage is just Fibbage
It's great so
I guess that's the one
That's why it wouldn't crack the top 3
Not every game on it is good
I kind of wanted to put as my number 1
ResVR but
I've only played one stage
You did play it
But I didn't beat it
Because they wouldn't let you beat it
If they would have let me sit there and play all the stages
I would have gladly done that
Alright
Let's see
The only other honorable mention I did come very close to putting
In the top 3 but Shane I think you outlined all the issues beautifully
With Splatoon
Well I think your issue with Splatoon is
You just stick to a roller and you don't try anything
I have tried the other stuff and I don't like it
Just not enough
You've seen me play the other stuff and you even said
You should probably go back to roller
I probably did
I think that game also
If you get frustrated really easily
You probably shouldn't be playing it either
The matchmaking thing really bugs me
I mean come on
They did improve matchmaking
With the last patch though
And that's sad that it's improved and it's still really bad
No it wasn't because I only played
Even though there was a huge difference in the popularity
I only played my own team once
And there was the exact same disparities
That's why I didn't think there was one
And I followed another streamer
And he only played the other team once
I think they've gotten better with that
The game missed my top 3 narrowly
It's not a bad game by any means
But I do have some issues that made me go
I liked it as much as the 3 that I did choose
The matchmaking has gotten a lot better
That last Splatfest was definitely true
That's good
So just to recap real quick
Running down the 3-2-1 real quick
Dark Sakura 3-2-1 was
Undertale, Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer
And Dragon Age Inquisition
All the DLC that came out
Flaco 3-2-1 was
Rocket League
Until Dawn and Splatoon
And Shane, pretty similar
I thought you were going to say 3-2-1
I was going to say contact
Gotcha
Yeah, everybody's gone to the rapture
Until Dawn and Splatoon
And mine was everybody's gone to the rapture
Rocket League
And Super Mario Maker
Which was not on anybody else's list
How does that happen?
What? You didn't like it?
Oh my god
I don't own it either
My list was all new IPs
Just saying
Take that everybody
Let's see
Wait, Rocket League
It's a sequel
And Mario Maker is definitely not a new IP
It's kind of Mario
Fair enough
Not that anyone played the original Rocket League
Or Mario
That's it
I hope you guys enjoyed that
We're going to get to some of your picks a little later
In the FUGL question of the week
Ingress will catch up with Loki and his top 3 games of the year
Does anybody want to?
He might be listening out there, I doubt he is
But does anybody want to guess?
Because I feel like last year we were in the same situation
I think he was gone over the holiday show
And we guessed
And we were close
Loki's top 3
I would guess Ingress
Which I'm going to give him so much hell about
He would not put that on there
I think he will, I think he's going to put Ingress
But it didn't come
But mine had new content this year
And it was the content that was on my top of the list
They do upgrade Ingress
I still feel like
All this aside
I think the way the rules are set
He's going to put Ingress in there
He's put a lot of time into that
I think he will put Fallout in there as well
Mario Maker
That would be 3
Is there a new Grand Theft Auto?
Not this year
Grand Theft Auto again
There was a new Earth Defense Force
But it didn't sound like he liked it
There was something else he was playing this year
I wish I could remember what it was
There was one other game
I can't remember now
Lego, he might put the Lego game he's been playing with his son in
A lot, I wonder if he put that in
I don't know
Going to our chat over at
live.vognetwork.com
Kostan in chat says
And like I expected, no one picked the Talos principle
Never played it
Well to be fair, that was a
Last year game
It is on PS4 now
I thought about it
Bobby picked that as his game of the year
Last year I think
There is some love for that game over at VOG
And it is on my Steam wishlist, I hope to get to it soon
I played it at an expo
One of the expos I was at
I want to say it was running on the Rift
Or one of those VR things, I could be completely wrong
But I just feel like
That's how I experienced that game
That's like a whole other category
Games I wish I had played
That probably would have been on my list
Like for me Tomb Raider, I don't have an Xbox One
Or uh, gosh what's the one I just had
Killer Instinct season 2 would have been a good one too
I really enjoyed season 2 of Killer Instinct
Life is Strange is another game
I think I would really like
I just haven't gotten around to it
And now I'm seeing the disc release is going to come out January
I might just wait for that
And then AkumaJP suggesting Minecraft
For Loki, well there is Minecraft story mode
But I feel like Loki kind of dissed that a little bit
So we'll see
He said something about the voice acting he didn't care for
Yeah, so we'll see
We'll get the results from Loki next week
When he's back on the show
Alright, let's get into our gaming week
So getting back to a little more recently
Let's talk about the video games that we have been playing this week
We always like to start off the show after our kickoff topic
Which, well we have a long kickoff topic tonight
But with good reason
The news this week
Is a little light
You guys are going to split up Loki's stories right?
I don't know if Flaco even knew that
Ok, good
I tried to say it really quickly, quietly
Ok, good
Otherwise I guess I'm going to have to read them
So anyway, we're going to get to some news
But the news as you can imagine is a little bit lighter this week
Although there were some big events
But we do like to start off before we get into the news
Talking about our gaming weeks
And the types of video games we have been playing
This week specifically
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
Kind of busy
Even though I was actually busy with many other things
I didn't play any Dragon Age this week
Wow
I played Happy Home Designer, which I'm still super loving
I got Catlateral Damage
Which I haven't played yet
But downloaded
And then we've just been playing all kinds of old school stuff
On the
The Everdrives
I did download a bunch of stuff I had wanted to try on iOS
So I was playing some R-Type the other day
Which I love R-Type so much
And I got Hearthstone
I started it off and then I realized that I had to
Because I have a new iPhone
I had to bring
Open up my old one
Get my authenticator code
And start my authenticator
So I'm considering actually starting off Hearthstone
Like 50 million other people I work with
Play Hearthstone
That's a good toilet game
I did also take Diablo 3 off of my PC
Gasp
In order to make room for
The Star Wars MMO
But Diablo 3
Although Old Republic is pretty good too
But you just need a bigger hard drive
You need a bigger hard drive
Even though
That goes without saying
But the other thing though
Is that I'm going to be starting back into Final Fantasy 14
As a usual Wednesday night thing for myself
So
Trying to rework some stuff
And I've got
A design project to do
So my gaming time is going to get kind of
Narrowed down a bit
I think this is the time when a lot of people
Are thinking about the 2016
Like what am I going to do in games this year
And then they'll completely
At least I did
I don't think I did any of the things I talked about
I was going to do in games
You know what I'm going to do in 2016?
Live
That's a good goal
Yeah my resolution
For 2016 is
Not getting hit by a bus
Or getting cancer
Well good luck
To you in that
I'd say those are pretty good resolutions
Alright well good luck
Moving on let's go to Flaco
How was your gaming week?
My gaming week was pretty good
Recently on the Playstation sale
I got Parappa 2
Which I'm terrible at
You know the PS2 classic one
I'm just bad at rhythm games
That's what Shane had me do and it works much better
I tried
It wouldn't let me mess with him
I don't know if that's set on game it kind of just stays on
Okay I have a Samsung TV
And you put it into game mode
See I have mine in game mode
I'm just bad at rhythm games
You're just a baddie
So there's that
Oh I bought Tetris
The ultimate casual game Tetris
I got it, I've been playing it tonight
I'm a Vita and it's also on the PS4
But now that's the really shitty
Ubisoft one that came out last year
That has an amazing commercial though
Yes it has a great commercial
So the Vita version is fine
The Vita version is really nice, it doesn't have those weird
Lighting effects, I'm not listening to the music
The music is terrible
It sounds like some dystopian 80's movie
It's really bad
I hope while you're sitting in
Studio N7 during OLR
You're not listening to the bad sound
I'm not, I have the volume down
But I am playing the game while I'm sitting in Studio N7
Well maybe they made it for the Vita
And then some genius decided let's just blow it up
You know what they did though, they delayed the Vita version
And I think that helped because I think they actually
Took feedback from the other version and fixed this one
Because it doesn't have the weird lighting effects
I feel like just trying to put it on
Next Gen at the time on PS4
They tried to overdo it with the graphics
Because the graphics, it's really hard on your eyes
When you're playing it, like there's these little light
Strobes that come off of it
When you're really focused on Tetris
It just makes it kind of dizzying when you're playing
And a little nauseating
But when I played the Vita version, it's pretty tight
And I think Vita is like the way you want to be anyway
Because that's just how I remember Tetris
It's handheld, portable
That's like my favorite way to play it
That's been pretty great
Otherwise there's lots of Splatoon
And Marvel Puzzle Quest on my phone
Still play that like crazy
Did you ever check out the PS4 version?
No, because they charge you 15 stupid dollars for it
That's so dumb
You can't import your other thing
I already have Hulk, like almost maxed out
Why would I want to then buy Hulk for like another $5 or whatever
I thought that was so dumb
So I was really angry
I wanted to watch you play it
But it wasn't working that one night
We tried to do SharePlay and it wouldn't work
SharePlay didn't like me
I want to see what this feels like
It's just Marvel Puzzle Quest
I just like playing on my phone
Hearthstone is good too
I'm excited you got into it
You know what's really fun on that
Is the solo adventure modes
I know they cost money
But I've done it all through in-game gold
But that takes a lot of time to earn
I used to play Hearthstone a lot
I had a lot of gold saved up
But the adventure modes are really worth it
There's lots of great voice acting in them
I just loaded it up
And then stopped when I realized
I needed my authenticator code
Aren't the first parts free?
Or am I wrong?
Maybe on Nax it was originally
But they don't do that anymore
You got to pay for it
But again, you can earn all through in-game gold
I've never spent a set on Hearthstone
Even as much as I like it
I love the game, but Blizzard got enough money
They don't need mine
So I just play the game
In the competitive mode
Because it's too cutthroat
And people who do spend money have an advantage
Because they can just get more cards more quickly
And it gets a little cutthroat in there
So I've just kind of stuck to
You know, the solo modes
They're really fun
They actually put a single player experience in there
That yeah, it helps you have better cards to do it
But if you play naturally through the game
You get some good cards, so
It's a good game
To register participation
Check out this week's episode of Orange Andrade
At vognetwork.com
Use the passphrase, birth
Shane, how about you?
How was your gaming week?
So I played the tail end
Of the Street Fighter V beta
This past weekend
Love that Vega is no longer a charge character
Makes him way more fun to play
And I played Splatoon
A lot
And I played 14
Again some more
I'm going to go back into that
Even though I'm not happy with it
Even though he said he was going to quit
Cancelled his account
I did for like three months
The very next day renewed
Well that was because
I didn't want my retainers
And Square Enix's support is very unhelpful
You know, answering questions
Or being polite
So I figured it out though
So I don't have my extra retainers
Anyway
What else did I play?
Parappa 2, I beat it in like 40 minutes
I was like, man, this game is so short
But I love it
And now Parappa has a blue hat
So he's a better version of himself
And I got Fantavision
Which is also really fun
And
I feel like
I missed around a little bit on Super Beat Sonic
That's like a disappointment
For me this year
That game is not as great as I hoped it was going to be
But
I think
That's really it
I may have also driven to McDonald's to get a Pokemon
Because they were doing a download
Only at McDonald's
And that was dumb, so I went inside
And I got the Pokemon and mozzarella sticks
Don't get mozzarella sticks at McDonald's
They are nasty
The one by my house does
And it was so gross
Who else used to have mozzarella sticks?
Was it Jack in the Box?
Was it Jack in the Box? Most of all it was Jack in the Box
I don't think they do anymore
Sonic does, and their mozzarella sticks are amazing
McDonald's
Learn from Sonic
Sounds so healthy, fried cheese
You know what though?
This show
I feel like
Exists in large part due to mozzarella sticks
And I mean that
Because not just our obsession with food
But because when we used to play
DDR at Roseville Golf Land
And how Loki, Darsakha, and I all met
We would go to the little diner that was in the parking lot
It's a local thing called Brookfield's
And they have some bomb ass mozzarella sticks
Like to this day, oh my god
Probably the best ones I've ever had are there
And so we would burn off all these calories
Playing DDR
And then put them right back on
Eating the mozzarella sticks
Now they have a soup that I've fallen in love with
Probably, what?
Now they have a soup that I've fallen in love with
It's that one that you didn't like
That I brought when you were sick
Oh, is that Brookfield's?
I'm gonna mispronounce it
It's like the
Ovolo-lemono or something
But it's like an
Egg and lemon soup
Chicken soup
Hey now, they're not paying for this plug
I don't care, it's delicious as fuck and I want some
I'll add a counterpoint then, I hate Brookfield's
Their breakfast is so terrible
They don't know how to cook anything
Alright, fair enough
Mark Tetsuya in chat pointing out that
A&W cheese curds are better
Actually, those are pretty bomb too
I've never heard of that, that just doesn't sound appealing
No, they're really good
But they're curds
And that sounds good, no matter what they are
The word sounds really disgusting
Just like cheesecake
Cheesecake's good
I can't get over the fact that it's like
A block of cheddar with frosting on it though
Wasn't our soccer night supposed to have cheesecake today and we didn't?
Yeah, we didn't
I got Chinese food though on Christmas
That made me feel happy
Oh, that's good
I went to Panda
They were open on Christmas?
Yes
I was like, oh my god, where's chicken?
Alright, My Gaming Week
A lot of the same stuff I always talk about on this show
Final Fantasy XIV, but I also downloaded Parappa 2
I didn't play a whole lot of it
Because the timing was throwing me off
But then Shane
But then I came to the rescue
Alright
But one game that I played a lot of this week
And I'm enjoying it quite a bit
Is Fast Racing Neo
On the Wii U
I wasn't sure if I was going to dig this game or not
Because it's the game
That somebody else made
Because Nintendo refuses to make a new F-Zero
For some unexplainable reason
So instead, these guys made Fast Racing Neo
And when I first started playing it
I was like, wow, these menus are
Super basic
I was like, this doesn't really feel like
As
I don't know what the word would be
As rich or as immersive as an F-Zero game
Robust
Robust is a good word
But once you actually get into the game
I was like, okay, well the meat of the game
It is what it says it is
It is Fast Racing
Super Neo
Yeah, it is, it is very Neo
But when I play it on my 62 inch TV
Or however big that thing is
I even get a little motion sick
It moves so fucking fast
And it's really smooth
Considering it's a Wii U game
Which doesn't have the same chips inside
Like a Playstation 4 and Xbox One
They really get things moving very well
In that game
It felt a little more wipe out
To me than F-Zero
But that's not a bad thing
I really like the wipe out games as well
It's pretty much what you would expect
In those Fast Racing games
The mechanic in Fast Racing Neo
Is that you can flip the engine on your car
From blue colored to orange colors
And it's kind of like an Ikaruga type of thing
Like that will trigger the blue
Or orange boosters on the course
The one thing I don't like about the game
Is the controls
And that's what really annoys me about it
Is the controls have this really odd configuration to it
So that part really annoyed me
But otherwise, yeah
I'm really enjoying the game
I watched you play it today
I just don't think it's that great of a game
Even though I didn't play it
So maybe my opinion shouldn't matter as much
But graphically, so beautiful
It's the best looking Wii U game
Hands down
No it is, you can't deny it
But it's lifeless
The music is not great
It looks like it was a text demo
I don't think Wii U is as bad as you said
It's pretty bad
But it looks like
This is what you could do
For a Wii U game
You can make games look this pretty
But this isn't like a game
It's just a tech demo
That's kind of like soulless, lifeless
It's not anything that special
I feel like
So anyway, as I'm sitting here talking about it
I think I actually downloaded this last Sunday
So I think I got into this a little bit on last week's OLR
So sorry if I'm repeating myself a bit
But I did play more of it
And I'm enjoying it enough
There's still some things
Kind of what
Shane is alluding to a little bit there
But I don't
I don't think the negatives are as bad as he says
So there you go
Fast Facing Neo, I've been having some fun with that game
And playing more Mario Maker
Some other
Stuff too
A few of the games on Steam
I was playing Super Slam Dunk Touchdown
Because we had the Maker on last week
I was playing that Black Ice game
I liked that because we'd seen that in GamerX
And then Tron Run R
Which got an update I need to check out
Alright
Carson in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
Holy shit, I just checked it out
And as Rob said, it's really fucking fast
Well it's in the title
Fast Racing Neo, you expect it's going to be a little bit fast
Alright, some quick housekeeping
We will not be taking any shows off
Through the month of January
The next show where we will not be here
Live is in February
Because of MAGFest
So if you are going to be out in MAGFest in DC
I've officially booked my flight, hotel, all that stuff
I'm going to be at MAGFest in February
I'm very excited about that
I will be absent on the show on the 10th
That's right
You are going to Disneyland
To mourn the passing
Of Bucket of Meat
You know that story is going around Facebook this week
About all the stuff they're closing down
To make Star Wars land
And Big Thunder Railroad too
They're only temporarily closing that
I was going to say, they're not closing that right now
But I want to go on it before it's closed down for a while
They just had that closed for like a year
When they were doing refurbishments
It's kind of weird that they're closing that again
Alright
I just went on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad recently
Did you?
I went at night
And the most amazing part was they started doing the fireworks show
When I was on the ride
We came out of a tunnel
A Mickey shaped firework
Just appeared
Right in front of us as we came out
That happened to me and Dan a few years ago
Yeah, we all lost our minds
It was the best
That's such a storybook thing
It was, I'm like how can this happen?
They planned it, they know
Did it go faster at night?
Of course it did
My son loved that ride, but at night he got a little scared
I have certain places I have to sit
On certain rides
Always in the back and always with my husband
Cause he has a bigger lap
And it has the two person lap bar
So I get air
I used to be scared of that ride when I was a kid
Cause I'd ride with my dad and he was much bigger than me
Obviously he was my dad
And I was just a little kid
I was scared of it, cause I was like oh I'm gonna fall out
It's like no that's just more fun
As I got older I'm like oh that is more fun
You get air, that's what's so great about Tower of Terror
Is when it drops and you get off your seat
It's so fun
I had a panic attack on the elevator when it fell two stories
So I tried to go on it to overcome my fear
Of falling like that
I had a panic attack
In the gift shop
Wow, my wife refuses to even go on it
We got all the way to the door and she's like nope
So we had to be escorted out
She got a little scared of that one
She doesn't want to drop like that
You just need to get a glass of wine in her first
Alright, let's see
Some other quick things I want to mention
This is very important because this guy has been a support
For a very long time
And also projects that
I have done
On the side, Horde House
He was a huge
Impact on that show
And I just want to take a minute to acknowledge
Pod Culture
Hit their 10 year mark
This week, that show started on Christmas
I didn't realize that, but their show actually started on Christmas
And so their 10 year
Anniversary show was this week
So I want to give huge props to Brad
And his whole crew
Adam, Christina, Glen, everybody over
At Pod Culture for hitting
10 years this week
It's a fantastic accomplishment, yay
Clap clap clap
Pod Culture
Pod Culture, I love the way he says it too
It's so good
So yes, congratulations Brad
And everybody from Pod Culture
And I really hope I get to see you
At Dragon Con this year
Although I know real life is more important
But I'm still going to cross my fingers on my toes
That you're able to make it to Dragon Con this year
Alright, and let's see
What else do I want to mention here
Just briefly, it has nothing to do with games
But I do feel as a nerd
It is my responsibility to tell you all
I saw Star Wars
It was so good
I've seen it twice
I know you went with me
So I didn't have to go alone
Because Alan works at night
So nobody else could really go to the movies with me
I saw Star Wars, which is notable because I never get out
And see movies
But I did go out and see Star Wars
And I will admit, I really liked it
It was my favorite out of all seven of them
It really was
So, kudos to Abrams
I didn't see one lens flare
And this was very subtle
Are you blind?
I wasn't really looking for him
You don't have to
I guess not
It wasn't Star Trek bad
They're not just on the bridge with lights
In every camera
When big lasers and stuff go off
You can see it pretty clearly
Of course I'm not going to spoil it
I'm just going to say one thing
Not a spoiler
I just have to thank Star Wars
For bringing Poe
Into my life
And I'm not talking about the poet
And I'm not talking about the musician
Who disappeared somewhere in the late 90s
I'm talking about Poe Dameron
The super hot guy
From the movie
So that's all I'm going to say
Thank you
I really want to get his Disney Infinity figure
Just because it's Poe
I hope it means more people watch Inside Llewyn Davis
Because that's a great movie
He got an Oscar nomination for
Adam Driver is in that as well
The guy who plays Kylo Ren
I didn't even realize that
It's a Coen Brothers movie
I saw it on opening week
Shane I feel a little bit like you
I have never been super obsessed
With Star Wars
Star Wars is awful
I really hate Star Wars
Except for this one
I definitely wouldn't go that far
You will go there
I was always more of a Star Trek person
Grandpa doesn't even have to pay me money to say that
I was always more of a Star Trek person
Than Star Wars
I was like okay I'll go see the new one
Just because it's a culture thing
And everybody's really into it
And as a nerd I feel a responsibility to go see it
So I saw it
And now I'm like
When we were at Toys R Us today
I'm like I really want the Poe
Star Wars figure
He keeps going into my best spy cart online
We have no Rey
Yes you do because
She's not a stand alone
Rey and Finn are in a Star Wars bundle
And I was like I can't get Poe
And not get Finn
Well you get those and give me Rey
Listen
I like Rey though
Rey is their female companion
Listen fully Black Widow her
From the toy line
Is that her only toy?
If that is that's pretty sad again
Women totally get
Shafted when it comes to having
Action figures
Not in Power Rangers
It is absolute bullshit
You're preaching to the choir in this case
Because in the movie
Again I'm not going to spoil
But I don't think it's a spoiler to say
She kind of
She's like the main character
She kind of
I don't want to say she carries that movie
But without her I don't think it would be as good as it is
So
It's bullshit there's no figure
Of her just like there are for the boys
That are also very important in that movie
Well even Poe's not that important
But he's got many figures
Don't forget about the figure that they did for
Sir Not Appearing in this film
Yeah they made a figure for
Somebody that got cut I think
Alright alright we got to watch the spoilers
It's not a spoiler
The character's not in the movie
But they made an action figure for him
And as I've been calling him he's Sir Not Appearing
They should have made an action figure
For the cameo that I freak out
Over every time I see that movie
What Chanel number 3?
Spoilers but yes
That's not a spoiler
She's Carrie Fish's daughter
Not a spoiler
It's great nepotism
I just need to have the Captain Phasma figure
To put on my cubicle
Even though she was like
I'm not going to spoil it but I love her
Alright now our chat
Is starting to get hypersensitive about spoilers
I mean if we really wanted to spoil you
There's other stuff we can say
We haven't spoiled anything
So go
Quick go see it before you see some freaking meme
Or something online
Or you can see Krampus
We're close though to the
Statute of limitations on spoilers
So go see it
Before we start
No we're not a movie show
Before I start
Jamie will come to your house, knock on your door
And scream it if you don't see it
In the next 30 days
Although I do have to say that Ray is very similar
I used to play the Star Wars RPG tabletop
She's very similar to a character
That I played like 10 years ago
Nice
Alright
Back to games
Let's get into the news this week
And I'm going to start us off with a big thing
That happened on the Christmas holiday
That I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard about
It was probably the big story of the week
And that is the fact that Steam
Had some major issues this week
Steam wasn't hacked per se
Or at least that's not what they're saying is happening
Something happened with Steam's caching servers
And what happened
In a nutshell is that when you would go
On Steam, you're presented
With pages from other people's
Random accounts
Basically
And there's screenshots out there on like
NeoGaf and some other Twitter I think has some too
Where you see random people
Thankfully, and thank you Twitter people for doing this
They blacked out the really sensitive
Information, but you can clearly see that they're
Able to see somebody's account name
And they can see the address, phone number
And email address that
Goes with an account
And so what basically happened
Is that as people
Were logging in and using Steam
To go about their business and make transactions
Because after all there is a Steam sale
Going on, some people's data
Would be saved to the cache server
And then that data was then accidentally
Delivered to other people that had
Nothing to do with that transaction
I'm really oversimplifying this
I can't tell you what really happened because
Valve is, in my opinion
Valve is being really dodgy about what happened
I'm trying to cut them a break
Because it's fucking Christmas
And I understand like nobody's in the office
But at the same time, they are
Running a major sale right now
So I do expect that, you know
If they're gonna ask for money, they do kind of owe it to us
A little bit to explain exactly
What's going on
And I kind of feel like their statement right now
Is more, it's not happening anymore
Don't look behind the curtain
But whatever
So anyway, yeah
So basically on Steam
Other people's private information
Was being displayed to unrelated people
And I gotta say, when I found out about this
I went super cyan
Pissed off on Twitter
And I was mad
And I even kind of said some pretty mean things
On Twitter because
I saw some people were kind of going
Well, it's a good thing I don't use Steam
And I'm on Nintendo
Nintendo doesn't have these problems
Well, PlayStation 4 fixed that issue
Why can't Steam fix that issue
And I was like, no!
There is a big difference between
What happened on those networks
And what happened on Steam
And what's funny is, I'm actually on the side of
What happened on Steam is way worse
What happened on PlayStation 4
I don't know if it's ever happened on Nintendo
Probably maintenance and stuff
But downtime, DDoS attacks
That's one thing
It takes the server down
People are upset, whatever
Oh no, so forth
But this was displaying people's
Personal information
Full on display
To other people
And you guys know I am a big advocate for privacy
And so forth, and I've talked about
Some of the issues I've had in the past
And why I like to use a fake name online and so forth
So obviously to use my credit card on Steam
I don't use that
And I'm sure that potentially
And thankfully I took the Internet's advice
And just didn't use Steam on Christmas
I mean it helped that I was on the road all day anyway
But I didn't use Steam
At all that day
So I don't think my information was out there
But I was really pissed off
Thinking that that possibility
Was even there
That somebody could have seen my address
My phone number, and even the last four of my credit cards
What the actual fuck
I think Steam has some huge explaining
To do with this
And what they've said so far isn't enough
Like this really
And you guys might think I'm blowing this out of proportion
I don't think I am
Because I take privacy and this type of stuff
Like very seriously
And you might be thinking
Well Rob, if you don't want to do that
You probably shouldn't give them that information
You have to give them that
To use your credit card on the store in the first place
I mean I guess I should have used a prepaid card
Or something like that
I didn't learn there oh well
But I mean
Steam has boasted
About its security before
Outright boasted
They've come up on stage and said
Our two-factor authentication is so awesome
I don't remember who he was
I don't know if he was the CEO
I don't think anybody at Valve has titles
So he was some guy speaking on security
He's like, here is my account
And my password
It's secure, you'll never get in there
And I know to date
The two-factor authentication has been so good
Nobody's got in there
And I do have two-factor authentication enabled on my account
Guess what, it wouldn't have fucking mattered in this case
And that's why I'm really
Really upset about what happened with Steam
Isn't part of it also
The fact like
The thing that happened with Steam
Wasn't that just something on their part
That screwed up
Whereas the other network issues that happened
Like Xbox Live and Playstation Network
Think it's funny
So it's like a huge difference there too
It wasn't because somebody outright attacked
The services, Steam screwed up
And I'm gonna say
Something that might blow your mind here
But this is honestly how I feel
Because I think the closest thing to this
That has happened in gaming in the past few years
Is when the Playstation store was hacked
And all those credit card numbers were stolen
And so forth
I would rather somebody
Steal my credit card information
Than see my address and phone number
That's how I honestly feel
Because credit cards, guess what
They are like stupid easy to
Say this is a fraudulent charge
It's not me because that also happened to me
Earlier in the year, it had nothing to do with games
But somebody charged $50
At like a Chuck E. Cheese in Pasadena
And then some random store in St. Louis
And I'm like what the fuck, so I called my bank
Easy, done, no problem
Easy peasy fix
That's why credit card companies get money
It's to fix these situations like this
So honestly
If somebody gets the credit card number
I honestly don't think it's as big of a deal
As somebody potentially knowing
What my phone number is and where my house is
And maybe that's just because of some of the experiences
I've gone through in life and so forth
But like this is worse in my opinion
And I have some huge trust issues with Steam now
Because A, they're not fucking explaining
What really happened
And they're not
They're not explaining how it's not gonna happen
Again and trying to earn my trust back
I don't need a free fucking game
Or Steam money
Or training, I just
Want reassurance
This is not gonna happen again
I wanna know how it happened and how it's not
Gonna happen again because
For them to get up on stage
And the chat room is telling me it was Gabe Newell
Who actually got up there on stage, sorry
It was a long time ago, to get up on stage
You're just a random employee though
We are the most secure company
Because of two-actor authentication
I'm the president and I'm gonna give you
My password because the two-factor's so
Strong so if you use it, you'll have the same security
To have that fail
Is a real violation
Of my trust, I think
And that is why I'm super cyan pissed off
At what happened on Steam
If you think I'm going overboard, oh well, it's my opinion
So I don't know, anybody else wanna comment on
What's going on with the Steam stuff?
I mean, it was fixed after a short amount of time
Was my information on
Display? Probably not because I didn't use
The service during that particular hour
But I have been on
Steam off and on throughout
The sale, I was doing the trading cards every
Day, since Christmas
I kinda
Stopped
I've bought three things since that went down
Yeah, and it's, I just, I don't know
Are you, are you, do you
Think I'm too upset
Dark soccer or what?
I think that they've dealt with the problem
And that your information probably didn't get out there
It's what
I tell people
You're like, oh well this could have happened
Did it happen?
No
If it's not going to happen
Again, if they now
Know of the issue and know how to prevent it
From happening
I honestly think that
There's really no
Use getting too worked up over it
It's the past
I'm sort of like half with you
Because I get that it didn't happen
To me, and I know I'm sitting here going
It could have, but
To be fair, the people that it did happen to
They don't know
Because that's the other end of this
You don't know whose information got displayed
Is Valve going to alert these people?
They haven't said
And if it was me
Is Valve going to know who got reflected?
I don't think they do
I don't think they do either
In my opinion
They're going to get sued over it
And they should
I see you rolling your eyes
I wasn't rolling my eyes
The whole thing is
Chances are it was noticed
By a few people
I doubt that everyone looking at it is so malicious
That they're going to actively start looking
For people that they want to see
It only happened for people who had recently made
Purchases, right?
So it was just cached data
So it's not anything
That they're going to be able to do much with
Apart from
Now, I understand
There are stalker situations
But those are
More often than not
First of all, they would have to have actively
Been looking for the person that they're trying to stalk
Knowing the username
And then finding that data that way
It would still require work
To get this information
So it would have to be somebody actively trying to go after
Who knows the person's username on Steam
And you can change your username on Steam
Right. Now there's a lot of
Talk and chat back and forth
Was it a hack? Was it not a hack?
My understanding was that
It was an internal failing
Now, could something from the outside
Have tipped that internal failing?
I don't think so
Based on what we know about the situation
But when Valve has given us a very
Short answer and I really feel like
They're trying to sweep this under the rug
I really want to see what happens next week
Because, uh-uh, you are not sweeping this under the rug
Valve, you are not sweeping this under the rug
You need to explain how the fuck
This happened a lot better
So we're clear, you know, if it was a hack or not
And if it wasn't, then what happened?
What's being done to this in the future?
So, anyway
There you go
Alright
Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf in chat
Says, this was one employee who was
Most likely an employee who is no longer employed
By Valve, you set something incorrectly
On Akamai
I don't know how you actually pronounce that
But the name of the actual caching system
So, we'll see
I don't know, we'll see what comes in the coming weeks
But I do not want this story to go away
Because I need to know
If I'm to continue to use Steam, which I'm not sure
I want to in the moment
How they're going to prevent this from happening again
And once they address the issue, I'll probably
Simmer down, I forgave PlayStation
As a lot of people did, you know
I still shop at Target, but
I bought three things today
On Steam
Right now
So, I mean
I haven't gotten any weird mail
There's probably a lot of people
In your boat, and that's fine
But I'm
Choosing not to
Until I have that reassurance back
Steam has lost some of my trust
Alright, moving on
Darcyra
Well, Bayonetta
As we all know, she is
Now going to be in Super Smash Bros
However, her inclusion
Nearly changed the rating of the game in Japan
They
Actually
Were
Because she's very
What's a good word for it?
Sexual
You know
They thought that it would
That putting her in the game
Would basically remove it for the
A for All rating
However, after
Discussion
And working on it, they figure
She's, I guess, safe enough to
Hang out with Cloud, so
They've NSFW'd
Or they've taken out the NSFW
And sterilized her a little bit
Which I find really odd for Japan
Given
That, at least
In my experience
Well
I don't know, I would think that
Having a character that might be
A little bit more risque
Wouldn't be as
Big of a deal, given that things
Like, well then again
In America we have a tendency
To sexualize
Nudity, which in and of itself
Is not a sexual thing
You know
And
She doesn't really get naked
She gets maybe less
Clothed the more she uses her hair
You never see your titties
In the game
And she's flirty and does a little bit of bad talk
But she's not like
Overtly
I don't know
I'm just really surprised at that
But you know what's interesting, we did talk about
Until Dawn being censored in Japan earlier
So we do have some cases
Where, I mean that's violence
I was always of the opinion
That things like, you know, blood and gore
I mean if you look at the history
Of, at least back for the 16-bit era
Games would be censored
When they came here instead of how they were there
I mean look at Splatterhouse
Or look at, well even
Mortal Kombat
Or Samurai Shodown, that was one
Cause on Samurai Shodown
Too, I actually have the Samurai Spirits
Neo Geo cartridge
And if you play it in Japanese mode
Then it's got red blood
And if you play it in the American mode
It's sweat
So, you know
I'm very, I'm just a little bit surprised by that
But I mean, it is what it is
I mean, I guess maybe
You know, her smacking down
People with the guillotine
Or her demon boot
Is a little bit too much
AkumaJP in chat
Who is in Japan
And listens to this program live sometimes
Thanks for being here
I mean, the billboards here in Akihabara
Breast, naked chicks everywhere
So, uh
Yeah, maybe there's, you know what
A lot of those same double standards exist here
In the US too, just for what it's worth
I, we're
Nintendo
Bayonetta will not corrupt the youth
They were already there
Deal with it
Well I am super excited for Bayonetta and Smash
And, you know, I'm pretty sure
It's not like she's gonna have, like you said
She's not gonna have her guillotine move
Or a lot of the super violent stuff she has in her games
They're not gonna bring that to Smash
You're not gonna be able to chop Peach's head off
With some move
Although it'd be kind of rad if that were a thing
No, I'm just kidding, you can't do that to
Mario and friends
You can't do that, alright
Let's move on, who's doing our next story? When are you guys, right?
Oh, I was trying to tweet
Oh, well, sorry, but
You know, during live radio, you never know
When it's gonna get deeper
Let's just stop the show
Let's go to a break
So, Shane can finish his tweet
So, with
Amplitude already out
And coming out soon
For people that didn't pay
$40 or more to back it
Like me
They are adding
And have added
This story sucks
A mode to make it look like frequency
So, in Amplitude
Your tracks are all laid out
Horizontally
But in
Frequency
You were kind of in this
Tube
Going around in circles
To hit the tracks
Well, Harmonics said that
They initially changed it in Amplitude
To allow for better
Track recognition
But between the fans and even the developers
It was pretty much split
On which way people
Preferred, the frequency way or amplitude way
So, for this
New reboot, they've actually
Added a mode that makes it so you can play it like frequency
And for me, I'm
Super excited because I preferred the frequency
Method a lot more
It took a lot of getting used to for Amplitude
And I'll be happy
To play this game the way I
Would have preferred to back when
They released the original version
The end
Have you played? You were a big backer
Of Amplitude, have you played?
I paid $20 for it
Wait, so did you
Get the PS4 version?
No, because you had to do $40
Two weeks, one week early
So I'll get it when it comes out
In January, next
Next week I think it is
But I played it at
PlayStation Experience
And it was Amplitude
There it was
Not much different
At all, so I mean
I'm fine with that
I have a feeling I will be a little
Disappointed based on some of the things
I've been seeing
And already disappointed just kind of
At the song list in general because
Something that really stuck out
In frequency and amplitude for me
Was the inclusion of
Random genres of music
That I never would have listened to
Or never thought would be good in a music
Game like Quarashi
Or they had a lot of hard rock stuff
Randomly
And this is mostly
In house music
This time
That was something that concerned me too
About going into the game is that they
Weren't going to have the money to do all that license stuff
So I really wanted to see
Part of the reason I didn't back it
I wanted to see what the quality of the game
Was going to be first
If it was going to be able to live up to the original
I get in the sense it is from a lot of the YouTubes
And stuff that I'm seeing but
There's also a part of me that's like
It's just a lot
Just rock band blitz
And
I kind of just want to see them do rock band
Blitz on Playstation 4 and
Xbox One I kind of wish they'd do that
I don't know what's going on over at Harmonix
But I feel like they're just losing their touch
Overall
And you see some people out there abandoning ship a little bit
Which is a little weird so
I also don't like, and I understand that
This is part of the nature of Kickstarter
But I don't like that the super
Uber backers get an extra song
That we apparently will never get
I think
That's kind of a bad decision
And also
Makes me feel like
Maybe they do another Kickstarter
Maybe I won't support it because
I'm not going to pay $200
To get an extra song
But they expect
Me to throw them money to get what now
I feel is an incomplete game
ActDeft in chat
Over at live.vognetwork.com says
Having licensed music
Costs money, lots of money
Not lots of money
I saw how much it cost
At Konami when we did DDR
Some of that stuff is super cheap you'd be surprised
So maybe
But also
And you don't have to go for well known stuff
Yeah, DDR also never really went for the AAA stuff
Like
Yeah we had garbage in that, that was cool
We had David Bowie in
Amplitude or Frequency, that was cool
But at the time
I'm sure Quarashi didn't cost
$3,000 to put in the game
They still win
They'd probably pay you $3,000 to get in the game
Because they probably aren't doing anything
It's stuff like that
Don't go for big names, but go for
A name
It would just kind of help balance it a bit
I think
I kind of skimmed the soundtrack
Or the song list rather
At Playstation Experience
A lot of it just sounded like electronic music
That's cool
But I want something more
I think that's what really brought a lot of the charm to the game
And I don't see that there
Bobby Blackwolf
Offering a different perspective saying
It may have been cheap before music games took off
But the music licensing landscape changed
With regards to video games
Rock Band and Guitar Hero
They always go for a very big AAA genre
I think back to some of the greatest
DDR games
I still think the best one they ever did here in the US was Ultramix 2
And with that series
It was a lot of really unknown
That game alone
Introduced me to so many new
Bands that were amazing
Granted, some of those bands were
Part of a label that maybe
Konami had a partnership with
To get cheaper stuff
Again, you don't have to go for huge things
Go for
They're based out in Boston
Go for local random Boston artists
It doesn't matter
It just brings something different
That's why Freezepop is always in the game
Go get some random hip hop artist
In Boston that's not a big name
Or a hard rock artist
Something like that
Just get me something that's not just electronic music
Just diversify
The soundtrack a little bit
Alright, well let's move on to another story
That talks about the NX
We brought up Nintendo's successor
To the Wii U a little earlier
The NX, although of course that won't be the final name
But that's what everybody's calling it right now
Because the hype is growing more and more
About the NX possibly
Releasing next year
But, the analysts are coming out
And the analysts are having their say
On what's going on
And you know this guy always
Has to say something when it comes to video game analytics
And that's Michael Patcher
He's still something?
Yeah, and I don't know the guy
And whatever, I know other podcasts
Have had him on, he's probably very pleasant
But at the same time
I really think what he's doing isn't all that different
Than what you and I are doing
He's just got some more schooling
And experience in financial industries
But I see him commenting on
Entertainment stuff all the time too
It's not just video games
But anyway, here's what Patcher says
First, mobile game will flop
Miitomo will get 100 million downloads
So it'll be a success
But it'll drop out of the top 100 grossing games
On iOS and Android by the year end
I think people will try it, but I don't think they'll find
Social chat compelling enough to spend money
In my opinion, Miitomo offers
Little that isn't already widely available on Facebook
Younger consumers not on Facebook
Will probably find it appealing, but they typically have
Little or no access to credit
So Nintendo will have trouble monetizing Miitomo
To his credit
I actually kind of see that perspective
A little bit, but I also think we know
Way too little about Miitomo
To say that it's going to do nothing
Instead of just the social stuff
So I don't know, we'll see though
Nintendo's second mobile game
Will be a resounding success
I actually think Miitomo is intended to be a platform
That allows people to create a personalized image or character
And use it on other Nintendo games
I am hopeful that the second effort
Is something more familiar, such as the
Super Mario platformer
I think the game will attract 200 million downloads
And will be a top 20 or possibly top 10
Grossing game on both iOS and Android
But here's the other big one
The NX won't come out in 2016
Nintendo has a history of announcing
Consoles in one year and launching the next
And I don't see the NX
As deviating from that pattern
William Ritterface
With a comment or chat over at
Live.FogNetwork.com
Why should we care what he says?
That's an excellent question
No matter what I say and all this stuff about him
Because his analytics
Are so well respected and so forth
Investors listen
To what he says
And invest their money
Sometimes as a result of his
Predictions, so to speak
That's a lot of what the stock market is
And a lot of these analytics
Come in
When we talk about the stock market
That's the reality
Whether you agree with it or not
We're in turn mentioning this
Because these comments
Get picked up on Wall Street
Journal-esque type of sites
And could
Possibly impact investorship
On into 2016
And even Dungeon Buster in chat
Says, Patrick's a Wall Street analyst so he's just
Looking at it from an investor standpoint
Interesting
Though that last comment there, I don't want to gloss over
This, NX won't come out in 2016
Nintendo has a history
Of announcing consoles in one year
And launching the next
And I don't see the NX as deviating
From that pattern
Announcing how though? Because they kind of announced
It already
And that's a very good counterpoint
They've said more about NX
At this point than they said about Wii U
This far out
So they have kind of already said
This is something we're working on
Even though
You always know these big companies are working on
Successors, Playstation 5
Xbox
Whatever they call it, 2
They're in development right now
But you know, obviously
It's going to be a while before we see the results of that
So obviously
Nintendo is working on a successor
It's just usually not talked about so publicly
So that's why I think we feel like it's coming
A little sooner than it might
But to be fair, the Wii U was shown
A long time before it came out
Because I think they wanted to
Get more developers on board
Because Nintendo is always that
We've got a silly concept type of thing
And so Nintendo shows it
So that the developers can start
Thinking about how they want to use it
I also think it's for consumer benefit too
Because you just throw something out there
That
Out there
And they're not going to understand what to do with it
So if this isn't super crazy
Like the Wii or Wii U
Maybe they wouldn't need that extra time
Alright, well
We'll see what happens
Obviously this is all just
Miss Cleo future predicting
Until E3
Which is when we're probably going to hear
What it's really called instead of NX
Let's just hope they give it a good name
And we'll see
What the catch is about the system
And what's to expect
Alright, let's move on
Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates
Well, we have a statement that was
Put out
By
Kimishima
The new Nintendo president
Who had a few things
To say about the year in review
It was something that was released
To shareholders and investors
The big thing on here though
Is that he made a mention
I'm just
Going to read this section
Because it's going to illustrate it
Of course, very good
We leverage Nintendo IP
In various ways beyond our traditional
Use of them
Predominantly within the dedicated video game platform business
Furthermore
In our attempt to establish
A sustainable and continual relationship
With our customers
Sorry, consumers
We are creating a new membership service
Called My Nintendo
And a new account system
Which will work as a bridge between our dedicated
Video game platforms and other devices
Where our consumers can get in touch with Nintendo IP
And thus
Will work as a mechanism to
Maximize the number of people
That interact with Nintendo's IP
That
Seems to me that
They're
Already, I think, looking outside
Of just standard video game stuff
They did start off as a card company
But I think that they're trying
To work for
Everything, toys, figures
Non-video games
Things like that
It seems to me that
We're going to be hearing a lot more about
My Nintendo
I'd say
Yeah, I mean, they've had such success
With the toy thing
And they're hoping to have a lot of success with mobile
I don't know how Pokemon Go
Is going to play into that
I understand Pokemon Company is their own separate thing
But it would be very interesting to see if that does tie back
Into the Nintendo infrastructure
One way or another
But we, of course, know about Miitomo
And they want to grow that as well
So you basically have Nintendo across
All these platforms
Which, to be fair,
Microsoft's probably the closest
Otherwise
Because your Xbox, Microsoft account
Can work on your Windows
And works in a lot of those other places
I don't think Sony's really there with what they've got going on on PlayStation
Because Sony hasn't really penetrated
Other parts of
Your living room and your office
If that makes sense
Haha, penetrated
You want me to say it again, Dar Sakura?
Penetrated
Sony has not yet
Penetrated, but they hope to
They're hoping to get some
Yes
The other thing, though, is that
They did mention NX
In the statement
Without going into too much detail about it
But just as it says on here
Nintendo is currently developing
A gaming platform codenamed NX
With a brand new concept
And our unique software-led hardware
Software integrated business
Will continue to constitute the core business
For Nintendo
So
I think they're banking a lot on NX
On top of that
So there's a few things to be read into this
Speculation, of course
Which, again, they're talking about all this now
I think it actually supports that we could be seeing
NX, whatever it is, a little sooner rather than later
But I also
I can still
Also understand the whole, don't get your hopes up
That it's a sure thing for
December 2016, because maybe
The focus is really going to be on
Zelda on the Wii U
At this point, it wouldn't surprise me one bit
If Zelda is all the way holiday
Next year, be ready for that
And mobile
Their renewed focus on mobile
The transition to NX in 2017, who knows
Anyway
Let's move on, we're going to travel around the world
And check out some release dates
But I think it's probably going to be
A little slow this week
I tried to look at the US release dates for Loki
And nothing's out this week
In the US
Hooray, because I didn't see anything to look up
There isn't, I checked the sources
Which, of course, there's nothing new this week
And going over to Japan
Nothing coming out in Japan
So I don't know, does Europe
Have any games to save this segment this week?
Do we have any late December releases?
Yes, now there's nothing for
The New Year, I checked on that
But we do have a release for the 30th
And that's Story of Seasons for 3DS
That's
It
One lone 3DS title in the entire world
Is launching this week
It's so lonely
It's a lonely story
That's right, it's the best game
In the entire world
For the last week of the year
Alright
Just a couple more stories for you guys
Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week
Let's get to it
Who's going next, Flaco?
There's this giant picture on the article
Oh wait, it looks like it's gone away
Okay, so
Tekken Cross Street Fighter is still happening
No, don't pop up on my thing
It's still happening
Actually no, Tekken Cross Street Fighter
Is supposed to be better than Street Fighter Cross Tekken
Because I have more faith in Namco
Than Capcom right now
Well I guess they recently revealed that Akuma
Is going to be joining the Tekken 7 cast
I don't know anything about these games
Just sound like you do
I totally know everything about
Tekken Cross Street Fighter
I did see Street Fighter
At the PlayStation experience, I saw a little bit of the
Tournament
Did you see the Street Fighter movie?
I did watch the movie
So I'm very well informed now
Although I did see that movie
I just don't play fighting games that much
People were wondering if
They were still going to make
Oh wait is it
Tekken Cross Street Fighter
So they're still making that one
The quote here is from
Senior designer Michael Murray
Said, it's still in development
That's the quote
Please look forward to it
It's been a period to launch the game
Since Tekken 7 was released
For the moment we are focused on Tekken 7
But he says it's still in development
But we might recycle the engine and use it
For Tekken Cross Street Fighter
As Capcom did with Street Fighter 4
But it seems like there's been a lot of fighting games
Doing well lately it seems like
Especially on PlayStation 4
I would be curious about
Tekken Cross Street Fighter
I think that could be interesting
Who do I have to sleep with
For Capcom vs SNK to happen again
That's the one that I want more than anything
I want to play Tekken 7
Because they have a really hot character
In it named Shaheen
He is super good looking
Shaheen? What?
He's the Middle Eastern fighter
Yes he is
He is super gorgeous
I'll tell you what impressed me about that one
Is that they actually did interview
People from the region he's supposed to be from
To make an accurate character
Doing their research
Indeed doing their homework
Being ethnically sensitive
Tekken Cross Street Fighter was first revealed
In 2010 or unveiled whatever
Alongside Street Fighter Cross Tekken
Street Fighter Cross Tekken took only two years
Afterwards to come out
This has been going almost six years
What are we going to get first?
Let's say but what will we get first?
Okay here we go
Will we see
Tekken Cross Street Fighter
Kingdom Hearts 3
Or Final Fantasy 15
15 first
Then Kingdom Hearts 3 we've seen enough of
That we know it's going to come out eventually
I got one more
The Final Fantasy 7 Remake
Episode 1
I bet it will come out before all those other ones
Probably so
You think Final Fantasy 7 Episode 1 is going to be first?
I think it will be before 15
You guys are high
I think Final Fantasy 15 is the first
15 they have to put a whole game out
7 Remake Episode 1
You guys are high
I think it's going to be
That's wishful thinking
It's going to be Final Fantasy 15
Then the 7 Remake
And Dark Dead Studio you can time stamp this
For Shane to play later when I'm wrong
It's fine
But it's going to be 15 first then the 7 Remake
Then Tekken Cross Street Fighter
No then Kingdom Hearts
Because we've seen footage of Kingdom Hearts
When's the last time you saw Tekken Cross Street Fighter
Never
I saw Tekken 7 footage and you know they're just going to shove
Chun Li into Tekken 7's engine
That's what's going to happen
That sounds gross
Well he did recently mention
It is quote, pretty far
In development
They drew the logo
Hold on we have to do this again
What do we have now?
We have Tekken Cross Street Fighter
Final Fantasy 7 Remake Episode 1
Final Fantasy 15
Kingdom Hearts 3
And you ready for one more?
Half Life 3
That doesn't even count that's a myth
But no Last Guardian
Where does that fall?
After Final Fantasy 15
Before 7's Remake
No Man's Sky
Alright
That's enough
I forgot about that game
Because it's never coming out
I swear they're trying to
Wedge that into VR somehow
Probably
Oh my gosh that'd be fun
Dark Tetsuya sums up
This segment perfectly by saying
Oh for fuck's sake
That's something I would
Expect Dark Sakura to sigh over there in the corner
I would say
For fuck's sake but I don't give a fuck
I'm looking at Buzzfeed
Y'all can just keep arguing about whatever
I feel like
Oh these top 25
gifts from Game of Thrones that showed when I
didn't give a fuck like is that what you're looking at right now?
No I'm actually looking at
this picture of gorillas
inserted into
The
The Force Awakens
I know how she feels
Alright
All joking aside I feel like this should be a segment
Because I feel like Loki would have a lot of fun with this
Like what will happen first
This
This or Half Life 3
And that should be the
We're gonna play this more often
Maybe we can get a game
widget on the site
Maybe Bobby will have another rainy day project there
We can have a
This, this or Half Life 3 what's gonna happen first
You know what I just thought of an idea of a segment
Just now
Da fuck is that
Where we get the weirdest of all weird
Vaguely video game related things
And just say da fuck is that
We can start with that dish you have
that came with the Dreamcast game
Da fuck is that
Oh that's just Japanese marketing
Alright
Ikuma-san tell us
Don't like isn't it a really big thing to have weird
collector's editions of everything
popular in Japan
Some
Some folks in chat are very supportive about the
new segment idea we might have to make that happen
Tigerclass says I'm surprised you guys didn't do
a list list for what you want to see happen in 2016
You know that actually was on the agenda for tonight
when I thought Loki was still gonna be here
I didn't want to do it without him so we'll probably roll that over to next
week so plus we're actually
We're already at 8 o'clock and haven't even taken a break yet
I'm hungry
Alright well let's quickly then talk
about Killer Instinct a fighting game
which none of you have mentioned
I did
Yeah god you don't pay attention
Yes he just mentioned it
Honorable mentions
I know
I said season
I said season 2 was like an honorable mention
Okay so what's gonna happen
first the Final Fantasy 7 remake
Half Life 3 or Rob
listens to Shane
It's not the last one
So anyway
well alright then since Shane is hanging
on everything this game does Killer Instinct
will be bringing a combo assist
mode to the game I guess to make
pulling off combos in the game a little easier
so you can button mash even more
to your heart's content but the good news is
the old way of doing combos will still work
for those of you guys that got used to it
so assisted
combos basically you tap a second attack button
during the cancel window of a first
and that will transition your character into a
special move after that another
button press will do an auto double
now that's already in the game but yet another
will do an auto linker and then ending
the combo it's as easy as forward
and doing a heavy punch or kick and they
they have some visuals and I'm sure this will be
in the game to be explained as well but they're
making comboing in Killer Instinct a lot
easier and all joking aside with
me listening or not listening to Shane
Shane did convince me
to pick up I think it's
Season 2 I got on Xbox One
Cinder, that's all you need is Cinder
and I've been having fun with that
it's a good fighting game
and they did such a better job with Season 2
with the story mode because
it's actually like interesting
whereas Season 1 was really dull
and bare bones
alright the combo assist coming
to Killer Instinct in their next update
which I don't think is dated as
of yet but I imagine it's in the coming days probably next
month alright so
let's get to a time when
games they didn't get these regular
monthly updates
you had a cartridge and that was
it take it or fucking leave it
it's the classic game of the
week Dark Sakura
she don't give a fuck about these new
games so she's gonna
go into the gaming vault
she's gonna go into the gaming vault and find
a game that she thinks hey
you kids should all be playing this game this week
Dark Sakura what is the classic
game of the week
I think you should let the video answer that question for us
there you go I have to hit play that helps
huh?
well
well done
I picked
Kirby's Avalanche because yes I've already done
Puyo Puyo and I've mentioned
Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's
Mean Bean Machine in that segment
but I wanted to do Kirby's Avalanche in particular
because it is my favorite of all the Puyo Puyo games
it was my introduction
to Puyo Puyo and I think a lot of people
stateside who didn't follow the import scene
really I think it was this or Dr. Robotnik's
Mean Bean Machine so it's a fair pick
exactly and also
I did it in honor of
Act Deft for sending me
the delicious gift of his
Oreos that Dan and I might have eaten all of
if you find more
I will seriously do another trade with you
and I will send you those
rich cream flavored
Oreo things
and I found the blueberry cheesecake one so I'll send you
those too this is like a million more Kirby
games she can make the classic game of the week so there you go
I've done other Kirby games
there's still more I bet
like Act Deft
like has pictures of Dark Sakura
by his bed not in a creepy way but
just like cause he loves her so much for all the
Kirby games she always picks
that's still in a creepy way if they're by the bed
hey I'm allowed to be worshipped
no
that would be in a closet with candles
that you'd have to have like a double door
Act Deft take pictures of you trying to make cookies
actually
I'll just settle for more cookies cause those
were amazing
short tangent
Dan who's like stop buying cookies
why do we have all these cookies he's like
oh my god those are the best cookies I've ever eaten in my life
how dare any human say to
another stop buying cookies
what kind of is this fascism
I married that I love you Dan
hearts
anyway Kirby's Avalanche
was known in Europe as
Kirby's Ghost Trap
and it is of course a puzzle game that was done
by HAL Laboratory
and by HAL because high is Puyo Puyo
and bad presto
it came out on February 1st
1995 in Europe
so it came out in Europe first
and April 25th 1995 in North America
which I actually got this game
right after my birthday
right after I graduated
high school
it is basically the Western
release of Super Puyo Puyo
and technically the 4th Kirby game
that was released for the Super Nintendo
basically
I mean it really is just Puyo Puyo
you have two colored blobs
that fall from the top of the screen
and you gotta rotate them and match them up
and once you get 4 or more of the same color touching
they'll disappear and the blobs from above
will fall down and you can do
combos that way and drop like big
like kinda clear-ish rock
blobs on whoever you're playing against
so you have a
storyline for this
and basically
it has almost the same
storyline for Super Puyo Puyo
so basically
King Dedede
challenged Kirby and
all the other people who live in Dreamland
to an avalanche competition
at the Fountain of Dreams and Kirby
says you know what I'm gonna do this
although Kirby's kind of a
dick to Wispy Woods come to think of it
cause like Wispy Woods
is like hey don't step on my
root and Kirby's like bitch
I'm stepping on your root
oh yeah we'll play avalanche then
or Puyo Puyo
so yeah
I think Dark Soccer should explain lots of games
bitch
I'm gonna step on your root
Kirby was kind of a dick to
Wispy Woods
by the way there's this little gif going around
of Wispy Woods all decorated for Christmas
and Kirby going
his little sucky thing and turning into
a Christmas tree
Kirby as Bayonetta
is really effing adorable
just so we're clear
Kirby does suck
literally that's his power
is sucking
who can make sucking be so cool
why did he just say before he challenged Wispy Woods
he says I like apple pie
that's what he said
yeah he was like don't tread on my roots
yeah the tree was like don't tread on my roots
and Kirby was like I like apple pie
that made no sense
yeah
anyway
there are some differences
so with Super Puyo Puyo
it basically was Arl
and carbuncle
the big Puyo Puyo characters
basically going through
all of the story
challenging different characters
the Kirby's avalanche
it was all the typical Kirby characters
and the game did come out
much later in the Super Nintendo
so it had really
great colors
the music was good and did you hear
how good the voice was
the digitized
voice in this is great
the last Metroid is in captivity
the galaxy is at peace
well
at any rate though
this version
all the music in it was original
all Kirby-ish music
except the panic music
oh no
it's another interlude
who blocked the path with this boulder
your road to glory ends here
oh hi are you ready
for a game of avalanche
I love this story
I like gumdrops and cake
no he didn't say that but he might as well
well they kind of do look like gumdrops
falling through the sky
there's one track from Puyo Puyo left
and that's the panic music
that's what it's about to do
but you're about to die anyway
so it's got the cinematics
as you can see
and
basically this is probably some of the
most conversation that you get out of
Kirby in a game
and yeah as you can see
he comes off a little bit dickish
a little bit more confrontational
he's a wee bit of a twat
does he talk in any other games?
I
don't know a ton about Kirby
because I only played the first couple games
but does he talk?
not very much
but he is a bit of a tit
the only dark soccer
I could get away with saying that
well Kirby he is a bit of a tit
anyway you can also
find the game on Wii Virtual Console
it came out in 2007 in July
um
and uh oh actually
I take that back in North America it came out September 24th
for 800 Wii points
and it is identical
to the original game except
that it has a cheat code that you
can get after completing competition mode
um
so that was pretty cool but Kirby's Avalanche is
you know
I actually I have to read this quote because
GamePro said it great
um although Kirby's Avalanche
is a rehash of a
dick
so he challenges this
broom and like I can't believe
I've got to clean up this entire forest
and then Kirby goes well you better clean up your
avalanche skills first
yeah what a dick
yeah
so anyway um I just like the way that this
is was said
although Kirby's Avalanche is a rehash
of an overdone puzzler theme
it's so well done that it's worth playing
that is if you don't already have three
puzzle games just like it
I think that is actually while it's
an interesting description for it
I think that Kirby's Avalanche especially
since we didn't get any other
P.O.P.O. games that I'm aware of in the U.S.
apart from Dr. Robotnik's
Mean Bean Machine
that this was something that's absolutely
uh a must buy
for uh
for people with the Super Nintendo
or you know
other things
on the Wii Virtual Console
um but absolutely worth it
in fact if you can the cartridge as I'm aware
actually I think goes for some money
now um but if you can
find it definitely get it it's
totally worth
having in your collection and it
is very challenging even in
easy mode it can get really difficult so
go for it
it's Kirby's Avalanche
there it is your classic game of the week
Kirby's Avalanche
and to sum that all up
DarkTetsuya in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
I can't even with this
conversation right now you know I'm just
gonna that's gonna be the pull quote I'm just gonna put
on the box it's gonna be right there on the
OLR album art I can't even with this
conversation right now
tell us what is Orange Lounge Radio about
well it's a video game podcast and I
can't even with this conversation right now
alright uh let's see
after two hours and ten minutes we are
finally to the end of the first half of Orange Lounge
Radio and I almost have to
go because of work
alright well we're gonna take a quick break and when we
come back we're just gonna have to jam through the news
in part B so we're gonna fast forward part B
and get to your calls when we
come back after this quick break with more
of Orange Lounge Radio right after this
try not to suck like Kirby
welcome back everybody to
Orange Lounge Radio
episode number 625
if you can believe it already
in progress for this December the 27th
of 2015 the last
Orange Lounge Radio of
2015 and
Loki not here tonight as he had a family
engagement but he'll be back next week Dark
Sakura however joining me in studio
as well as our frequent
guest host and we love having him here Shane and
Flaco Jones your collection's being ogled
yes uh Allen said Flaco go
look at the collection so he's in the other room checking
that out now uh because the
first half I'm using my
quotey fingers of our show actually ran for
over two hours which doesn't usually happen
uh and we're gonna make a small edit to our
flow and we're actually gonna be
because a lot of our news stories that we had in part B
were kinda not
huge news yeah cause
cause you know it's been a slower news week
we're actually gonna fast forward the show a little bit
so we can get to your calls and actually Dark Sakura
has to leave here
anyway yes cause I have to go to work
so I'm gonna be left without Loki and Dark
Sakura and I can't
just be left alone with Shane to run the show
well you won't be just alone with Shane
that's true we'll have Flaco he'll help me out but
I'll be here we will be hiding under your bed
we just realized that our microphone
colors are one of the Splatoon matchups we
get all the time macaroni and cheese versus dark blue
oh my gosh alright and
as you probably heard in the first half of the show
uh Splatoon topping
uh both Jim and
Shane's uh top games
of uh 2015 their favorites
and uh I don't know the top best
favorite top best most favoritest
um and I don't I don't think there was really any
game all three of us had on list so we really
couldn't come to a consensus so
cause like we both
had rocket league we both had everybody's gonna
the rapture you guys both had Splatoon
and until dawn until dawn
Jamie had to be unique that's okay
mine was legitimate
Rob so was mine
legitimately mine was legitimate
leer
words so we're gonna go right into
some more news with dark
Sakura well you
know um there'd been this uh
patent suit going on about
the Miis um there was a company
called
Recogni Corps who was suing Nintendo
because they said it violated
their uh patent
for storing facial sketch data
um when Nintendo
started making the MiI characters
well the uh
uh Judge Jones
who was in charge of the case
was like um
yeah no not really this is completely
different and Nintendo didn't
uh infringe on any uh
copyright so
of course they're very
happy with the uh
with the ruling and
um we don't know if uh Recogni
Corps will uh
appeal cause they can still appeal
but chances
are I mean the hope is that they won't
because I mean
Nintendo's got got the power
and it is quite different
than their method
their version was
um
more of from what I can
understand just storing data
to apply where Nintendo's
is actually
picking presets and putting them in
place so I mean if you really had
to do that for the MiI you'd have to do
that for any type of video game character
creation you know character creation
so yeah they they didn't really
have anything to stand on
As we see a lot of times
in these patent infringement suits
where it's like there may be
this one little derivative but
on the whole it's a completely different thing we see
this happen in gaming like a lot but
patent law it's complicated yo
and uh I don't think I've heard a lot you know
with all the talk and buzz about 2016
presidential elections maybe I've
missed it because people are talking about a lot of
stuff but I'm not really
hearing anybody talking about patent
reform and I guess maybe because that's not
you know people want to hear more about I don't know
healthcare or international
conflict and so forth but
I don't know I'd be curious to hear what
maybe some of these candidates want to do about
patent law and trademark
and some of that in this country because
the rules were not written in an internet
age and it's very obvious but anyhow
uh I
guess these patent things though for the
time being they're still going to continue and
that's why these companies have very large legal departments
indeed they do they
sure do alright let's
get into the FUs
of the week every week
uh we rant here a little bit on this show
why well uh because we can
sometimes we get angry
here is punishment
here
this is fucked up
dark soccer
um FU
to just how early
I have to be up in the morning
and I do like
having my week split kind of
with the two separate days off because
it makes my weeks feel shorter at the
same time I don't feel like
I get enough rest on my day off so just FU
be tired and sore
and heavy so that's it
and having to leave the show earlier
because I miss having
my Mondays as my day off
and your schedule
changes every few months so this won't last forever
yeah but part of me does
like though having to be split up so it all depends
you know honestly enough
if I worked on Sunday and kept
my same early shift
I would definitely be able to get to the show
and I'll have to
stay safe alright
uh I have two FUs this week before we get to my guests
my first one goes to my neck
it's still been like really sore ever since
you know that fall it was probably like three weeks ago right
now I've got this I probably have
even dark soccer I feel this because she probably knows more about
this stuff than I do I have this weird like bump
thing on the back of my neck
you feel that dark soccer right
hold on she's I'm getting a medical
exam here at Live Institute it's right
here yeah you
feel that isn't that weird
yeah now yeah that's what
it could be a cyst or something in there so
that's just great so FU to that
cause it's causing me like increased neck pain
it's horrible I would honestly
enough get that seen
yeah no I know I need to be a completely benign cyst
but it could also be um swelling
on the tendon itself yeah
no I know I need to get it seen but then here's the other
crappy thing my insurance completely
changes the first of the year so if I see
somebody now it's gonna be
something yeah exactly so good urgent
care yeah it might be what I have to do
which is if I didn't have another
stuff and I am not
a doctor but I was a massage therapist
for quite a while probably gonna wanna
ice that yeah good
times in 10 minute in no longer
than 10 minute increments and that would be
every hour I've had this for like
four days though
but anyway I know
I'm gonna say this now if ever you think
you have any kind of health
problem and something that
your body is doing abnormally if it
does not go away within a couple
of days get it seen
well I was hoping it would go away I keep
convincing myself it's getting smaller but anyway
not every problem goes away by ignoring
it some do
aren't you leaving no I'm just kidding
you know what I have
you're number one
in my book
she gave me a one finger to show me how much she loves me
alright moving on we got more FUs
Flocko
let's see FU2 oh yeah
you know you can connect your phone
on a little cord in your car
I don't know who else does that I do
charge you the phone and please use it
well mine keeps saying unsupported
version it's super annoying
happens all the time
yeah iPhone
alright I think it's dirty but
I always have to clean the dumb thing out
anyway are you using an official cable
yes
yeah it's weird I think it's my car
I probably just need to update the
firmware on my car but FU
it could be I have a loose connection
with the cord because it's been ripped out by my
fat foot so many times that I think
it's the car plug not the phone plug
that's causing me problems
yeah I think it might be the car plug
or like I said I've never updated the car's firmware
which I'm sure you could do if you plug a USB
god that's so weird I gotta update the car's
firmware I need to update the firmware on my TV
gotta download the new car
and I know that's a big thing with like Tesla's now
and a lot of other new vehicles
it's like you know I gotta
my car is gonna
evolve like it's a Pokemon overnight
while it's plugged in I have a super old TV
and when I got a PS4 it looked terrible on there
I had to update the firmware because it was
downgrading the graphics
it was really strange that's so weird to me
yeah my TV
is an internet TV so I had to
download it from the internet put it on the thumb drive
and then plug the thumb drive into the USB port
on the TV and then it like magically worked
it's funny if you take that the other way
we were using
these LCD monitors
with our Atari 5200
and it didn't look
nearly as I mean it was
crisp but it didn't look nearly as good as it would
on an old CRT
I think that's still the case yeah
it just looks terrible
and last but not least Shane you're FU of the week
FU2 the local targets
for not having the two Power Ranger toys I've been
looking for and they're all over like
the south and the east coast but
somehow just not over here yet and it's
making me really annoyed
Shane I will tell you something
put it into order and have them deliver it local
they can't even order it
it's not on the website if you even
look it up on my little brick seek thing
it has the price
but if you usually put items in there
it'll say the name and the picture
doesn't even do that yet
so it's almost like it's a placeholder
but it's what shows if they have it or not
I am really surprised you haven't just driven
to Southern California
it was in Burbank so
and I don't put it past you to drive
to LA for a freaking Power Rangers toy
let me know what they are
there is a target near Disneyland
and I will make every attempt to stop
at that target for you and look for your
Power Rangers toys
I will hit you up on that probably
that is true it's right there on
what is that Harbor? Catalla?
the one right before you hop back on five
I will go look right now on my phone
to see if they even have it
I know you are not going right now
but you could tomorrow
you could go to the target and then
you could see Victoria who lives right there
such a long drive for one day
it is
but I would still do it
it's Power Rangers Shane
we are going to get to the FUGA
question of the week in just a moment
but I do want to do one quick news story here
and this is about a game I think
they end up on Flaco's 2016
best games list it might be too soon
to tell but Uncharted 4
a thief's end
now PlayStation they ran on their
official blog this week a little
update on Uncharted 4
and they said hey good news we are wrapping up
production and it is shaping up to be the proper
send off for Nathan Drake that we promised you
the bad news
we need more time in the new release date
is April 26th 2016
so they have pushed it back a little
more to 4-26-2016
that's a lot of
March 23rd so like another month
they did the same to The Last of Us right towards the end
I think it was going to come out April
oh no it's going to be May something
or maybe it was May and then they pushed it to June
I don't remember
so at this point is there really a big difference between March and April
probably not and if that's what they need to make the
game right then go ahead
but I wonder how much
my birthday is in April and that makes it important
actually my sister's birthday by the way
oh there you go so then this
can make the perfect present for both of you
reverse present
she doesn't play video games
reverse present media on Uncharted
my half birthday was yesterday
what did I get for a reverse present
I don't know
I never actually purchased an Uncharted game before
I always just rent them, play through them and then be done with it
I don't like
goodbye
I don't like shooters
so I just like to play the story
and then be done with it
so what you're telling me is you're going to wait for this to be free on Playstation Plus
that is what happened with the other one
yeah that would take a long time
3 took a while to come
I bet the trilogy will be
the Playstation Plus game in April leading into this
that would be great what a great idea
found it
and for the record those toys are not there yet
I'm trying to do my stuff
I know
I know alright
let's get to the FUGL question
FUGL question of the week
every week we ask a question of you guys on our
Facebook and our Google Plus community
communities and we read
some of your answers right here right now
is there no other place you want to be
Rob?
he said right here right now
we're going to read the answers
I know you're singing a song over there
you think you're so funny I'm hilarious
alright
this week
since obviously we knew we were going to be talking about
the best games of 2015 tonight
we decided to ask you guys on our social
community what is your
favorite game of
2015
let's get to Andy R. who starts off
on Facebook saying super beat
Zonic
fighting words I guess
everybody's entitled to their opinion
I don't have to respect anybody's opinion
first of all and secondly
it's fine there are some positives
it just is a disappointment
alright so Andy R. says
this really was the year of rhythm games for me
I got seven rhythm games on Vita
three on PS4, one on 3DS just this year
as a big DJ Max fan
Zonic might be my favorite of those
but overall those eleven games
really defined my gaming year
I have to be honest I didn't realize there were that many music games
that released this year there was Persona 4, Dancing All Night
which was really good, Super Beat Zonic
like a couple
whatever the fake chick is
what's her name?
Hatsune Miku?
yeah I think she had a few games
Parappa came back out
alright anyway
moving on Redertainment says
Destiny begun under good intentions
with lots of promise, lots of expectation
and lots of anticipation
after spending some time digging into the experience
of it many outside observers
found it to be disappointing
nitpicking the details of it in ways that are completely annoying
however somebody with an insider's perspective
knows it was still a good experience
the entire thing wasn't all bad
especially compared to the experience of others
it's all just a matter of perspective
also the future of it holds the possibility
for a richer experience
very similar to when I named the Diablo expansion
one of my favorites one year
the fact that Destiny
not to alter Redertainment's answer
but he would probably mean
Destiny of the Taken King
the expansion that kind of changed a lot
some year-end lists
I've seen that too
Dart Tetsuya says gotta give it to Splatoon
never expected Nintendo to take a shot
at the team-based shooter genre and put a fun twist on it
I also really dug the Surf City vibe
in the visuals and music
Shane really likes that too
he listens to the soundtrack of this game
Fifth Dream says
I have to say Fallout 4
while I played a lot of games this year
probably more than ever in my 30 plus years of gaming
nothing in a long time held my attention
for an entire month straight
like Fallout 4 did
there's a lot of people that are saying Fallout 4
I know you are not alone with that
let's see, going to
Fabrice A who says
Assassin's Creed Syndicate
I gave the series another chance because I'm into the Victorian era
was not disappointed
nice mood and I like the protagonist a lot
Mike B says
Star Wars Battlefront Xbox One
awesome game
they got this one right
The movie was awesome
William Murderface says
Witcher 3
I love RPGs with stories
that you can actually affect with small decisions
and this one more than any other
that I have ever played allowed this
and even encouraged it
the choices were also given in such a way
that you could not be sure which provided
the desired outcome which added suspense
and tension to the experience
this to me makes this game more than the game of the year
it makes it the best game of the last 10 years
to me it set the new mark
to which I will measure all other RPGs
that is quite the praise
for Witcher 3, there's a lot of people
loving Witcher 3
Renji221 says
I'm going to have to go with WWE 2K16
since the game is almost better
in every way than the game last year was
since the roster is bigger
and career mode is better
Hitstun says
Splatoon gets my vote too
leave it to Nintendo to fix the problems
I have with shooters on console
it's bright, it's colorful, the motion controls
are almost as good as keyboard and mouse
squid mode makes movement fun
and I actually don't miss voice chat
Undertale is a close second place
super don't miss voice chat except for like
when we're playing Twin Squad
but that's skypable
I just like doing the booyahs a lot anyway
and I'm laughing to myself
at the imagery of driving down
the freeway really fast too
the Splatoon soundtrack
which sounds just like that by the way
I was one of the singers
it's like K.K. Snyder music
for a second I thought they were in the room with us
what's going on?
it's like I'm really playing Splatoon
it's like a really bad drag impression
alright
let's go over to Google Plus
where Popper starts us off
on Google Plus saying
Rise of the Tomb Raider is the game
I waited all year for
and it was well worth it
Act F says two gaming things
to find my year both from Nintendo
I said one
who said you got two
when everybody else gets one?
put the coin to read which one then
well I'll read the first one because you'll agree with it
Splatoon from the single player
to multiplayer I've had
so many experiences both good and bad
from it and of course Amiibo
not only collecting but being part of
local hunters and training community
participating and hosting tournaments
well I'll give
Act F the other one he's been a long time supporter
of the show my game of the year
though goes to Undertale
that game is unique and quite amazing
and everyone should play it and the soundtrack is
one of the best there is out there
he also did apologize for the long response
so fair enough
I do want to play Undertale but when will I ever
come to console?
Undertale's appeal at all
you do that a lot with games
I watched the opening
and I thought it looked amazing
like when you first meet Flowey
I kept trying to watch it on Twitch because I was like
oh my god Undertale's like okay what is this
and I could not find one that looked interesting
that's probably just the Twitch people
are not interesting but anyway
not all I'm sorry
I didn't just diss every single person
on Twitch just the ones at that moment
that Shane was looking
not leastly Prince Peach Fuzz
I do love that name it's one of my favorite
handles on the show
says PT
someone had to say it
thank god someone went there
that'll be an honorable mention every year
I think it should every year on this show
at the end we all say
in unison and PT
until Silent Hills comes out
or whatever they call it
well not Silent Hills whatever Kojima can make with his new company
well let's hear Prince Peach Fuzz's rationale
PT
partially because it was the only game
I was able to beat this year
as well
well that's a great accomplishment with that ending part
and an excellent experience
I'd like to give Metal Gear Solid 5
an honorable mention
that's so funny I'm sorry
I'm not laughing at Metal Gear Solid 5
because obviously a lot of people love that game
but I'm laughing at the fact that you put the Konami demo
above like what's probably going to be
their last AAA game they ever release
that's not soccer
so I don't think they'll do soccer anymore
alright
there it is
Google question of the week thanks to all you guys for answering
love hearing the diversity there
but definitely sounds like we probably heard Splatoon
from more people than anybody tonight
but Undertale a lot a lot of people as well
so I would say that seems to be the number one and two across the board
but we'll see what Loki says when he gets back next week
I have a feeling neither of those games
are on his list
maybe Splatoon maybe
act deft in our chat over at live.voggenetwork.com
encouraging Shane Undertale is a game you need to
experience yourself
so maybe you just need to
I don't want to
I want to but they won't let me because it's not on console
I don't have a PC
maybe that'll be a big E3 land for somebody
they're going to get Undertale
but it was all made in Game Maker
like it was made in one of those construction set type of things
and it's huge
I'm kind of surprised somebody isn't trying to throw that guy
a bunch of money to port it
or do yeah I don't know we'll see we'll see
alright well we would do
the mail bag usually but unfortunately
we got no emails this week
alright I understand y'all were busy because of the holidays
but now that you have time
to calm down from your food comas
and your gift givings and all that
you need to email us
participate at orangeloungeradio.com
make sure you lend your voice
to the program again that's participate
at orangeloungeradio.com
I have an unfinished draft
in my email
to send to you
I have to remember now
I think it's about couch co-op games
I don't even remember specifically what I was going to talk about
I have to look at my draft again
if it was couch co-op it was probably going to be
Rob you need to stop being so harsh on Splatoon
oh no I think it was
that's got the worst couch co-op mode
it's so bad
though I got my kids to play that
and they had a really good time with it
I think it was about
it was a Fugu question from forever ago
and nobody mentioned
Secret of Mana
and I was like
for me that's like the couch co-op
top of the pyramid for me
we did have a question on couch co-op a few weeks ago
it was a while ago
and that's like how could nobody mention this game
that's the thing that really got me into couch co-op
I remember we rented
a multi-tap adapter
from a video store
like 45 minutes away because I lived up in the boonies
so I had to drive to another different
part of also boonies
and get this thing and then we just kept
it forever and they kept calling
my roommate but they didn't
take a credit card so we pretty much just got to steal it
well then eventually he felt bad so he
went to go drop it off like
3 months later and they were out of business so
we got to keep it
yay stealing
but I just
loved it because it was just so fun to play with 3 people
yeah no
I never got to do the multi-tap thing
with that I don't even know if I ever played
with the multi-tap thing I never even played that game
really? man I love that game
well it was just kind of like
it was annoying with 2 people because you had to kind of switch
around and you had the third
that was always computer controlled and terrible
but when you had the third person
and we got a second
when I got a second roommate there
we had 3 of us living in one house
we beat the whole game with 3 people all the way
it's really kind of odd to me
in a way that they didn't really continue
the Mana series past I mean I know they had
Secret of Evermore which was the
USA thing and it wasn't very well received
even though I think it was horribly
the Seiken Densetsu series still goes on
in Japan still today?
yeah there's a 9 phone version
I beat the DS version too
was it Legend of Mana on the DS?
you guys didn't let me finish there was 2nd Assistant 3 on Super Nintendo
I know and then there was Legend of Mana
on Playstation was fucking horrible
I'm sorry I hated the Playstation 1
it was the one on the DS it was something else of Mana
I played that one and I liked that one
I beat that entirely
while commuting on Muni
when I lived in San Francisco
yeah it was a good game
well let's do one more story for you guys
then we're going to open up the skype line over at 1877 Game OLR
or username on skype
Orange Lounge Radio
and I'm having to do the little rig that I did last week
but it should work fine tonight
we know from last week it worked ok
so let me talk about
Diablo 3
and season 5 is coming out soon
for Diablo 3
and it sounds like patch 2.4 is going to coincide
with season 5
I don't know how many of y'all are still playing
Diablo 3 or interested in all the games
Shane are you going to come back to Diablo for season 5?
no why not?
I've got Xenoblade and
Splatoon and Heavensward
to play
and so every other game just kind of does not take precedent
alright well some big changes
first off seasonal
legendaries have been eliminated from
the game all new legendaries in
patch 2.4 will be available to everybody
whether you're participating in the season
or not which makes sense because that's what happens
on consoles and I should point out when we talk
about seasons this is only for the
PC consoles don't support seasons
because of the exploits that happen on
consoles because the console versions don't
have to always be online like the
PC version now what's interesting
is that now in the season journey
which is to encourage you to replay through the game
starting in chapter 3 some of the
objectives in the season journey will
reward you with two pieces
of one of your class
sets and that class set has been
pre-established so you
will get guaranteed a full
green season
class set for your character
by playing through the game so that's
really interesting you don't have
to grind for these drops anymore
if you want to get the other sets you do
but I find that very very interesting
and that's because also coming out with this
patch are going to be the new
dungeons that are geared specifically
for these gear sets
so that's going to be pretty interesting
I'm excited to play season 5
even if Shane is being a hater
but there are going to be new cosmetic rewards
as well there will be a
little companion that kind of looks like Groot
to me a little bit it's a little tree dude
a new little non combat pet
and I love the new frame the new frame
is really pretty it looks like the wicked queens mirror
or something there so
I like that so there you go
some things to look forward to
in Diablo 3 a game that's still
clicking along a few years
after the fact you know I praise Super Mario
Maker and even Splatoon earlier
in the show for Nintendo still supporting
their games with regular patches
and so forth well after release
I understand Splatoon they've said don't expect
anymore after January although
I have a feeling the Splatfest might continue for a little bit
they said Splatfest is still going on
well that's good so that will be a thing still
but you know
they're probably not going to have all the frequent
updates they've been having but look at Diablo
you know how many years are we after release now
and they're still doing new stuff for it hopefully
another expansion my fingers are crossed
alright let's do it let's go to the
phones you can give us a call right now on
Skype orange lounge radio all one word
on Skype I actually don't think the 800 number
is working tonight because again I'm not able to
get in on PC so I can't
disable the spam guard that I usually
disable when we go on air because we get
a lot of spam
calls robo faxes and things like that
but it does look like we are getting a call
on Skype right now so we're going to get to
it here in the studio just takes me a little
longer to connect than usual
so oh
gosh and I did something weird on the
screen here but we're going to get to it
hi you're on orange lounge radio who's
this dammit I'm halfway
naked here
oh wait wait we can barely
hear you you said you're halfway naked
I am halfway naked Rob Roberts
Jesus Christ dude so
okay so because I'm on the iPad
tonight I'm sending video
but that Ramy you don't have to send yours
back if you don't want to it's fine please
yeah cause um
I'd rather not
make Alan jealous
he's not here
what's on your mind tonight buddy
hey hey hey hey hey
hey hey what's up
buddy what's on your mind tonight
I kind of want to throw out there
like my top three games
but my top three
games are slightly different they're from a
mobile point of view because for the
last year all I've been able to do
is play mobile games
you know that's the story that a lot
of people have so I'm not totally surprised
to hear that and I even joked that
Ingress is probably going to end up on Loki's
top three although I don't know yet so we'll see
what is it what are three mobile games
we all need to be playing
well one thing about Ingress I have to put it back
on my phone cause I took it off for a while
then I'm like you know I'm going to have
to put it back
you never know that might be the way you get into
Pokemon Go early
yeah pretty much
but um
let's go ahead and give
my number three my number three
is a game I've talked about
I've called about the show before
and I said it's a game that you have to check out
number three
is Love Live
School Idol Festival for Android
and iOS
you did mention that and I have to apologize I don't think
I ever did get around to playing it but I think I like
downloaded it so I got like you know
I got close
it is a fun game and what I like
is that this rhythm game
is pretty much identical to the original
Japanese they
did have to tweak the story a little bit
because some people got offended
cause they were
alluding in the story to
same sex relationships and they didn't
want to freak people out
oh no what'll happen
cause we all know
Massachusetts fell into the ocean ever since they
legalized it however many years ago
yeah and a lot of
people decided to go ahead and download the
Japanese version so you know
either or make em happy
it's still a fun rhythm game
it's right up there
alright fair enough what's your number two
number two
is another mobile game
it's a game
Alan plays
I see him pop up from time to time
and I give him lives when I need to
is it that Sailor Moon game?
yes Sailor Moon drops
he plays that a lot
my friend
Yaten sits there and plays it
forever and ever
she played it to the point where she
unlocked a Christmas wallpaper
gave it to her wife Seiya
and when Seiya says she got it I was begging her for
if she could send a copy of it to me
so I could have it on both of my phones
that is so funny because
I didn't think Alan was connected
with other people on that and I even asked him
does it have like social interactions and stuff
I guess he finally hooked it up to Facebook and now
you can send each other lives and stuff that's great
alright
and then your number one
my number one game
is LBX
Little Battlers Exchange for the
Nintendo 3DS
wow okay
what is it about this? I don't even know if I know this game
do you know this game Shane?
I've played it, I played a quick demo of it
alright well what is it about this game
well
it's what
as I like to call it
or some people might fan them
it's like this if you ever watch the anime
Angelic Lair or
Gundam Build Fighters it's right up there
it's pretty much a time where
you buy like these custom
robo kits and you add weapons and armor
and you put them in little
cardboard arenas and you battle them back
and forth and it's an interesting storyline
where the main hero is looking to find his
father who originally created
the entire game genre
and so forth okay that sounds
kind of fun
yeah and as you're running around through the game
you're using your LBX to get
through certain areas
like if there's like traps and there's like
sentients you use your LBX
to battle the little robots to keep
going forward
ActDeft is giving some more insight in our chat room on this game
saying Nintendo promoted it during E3
but it didn't get that much publicity after
though it's based on an anime isn't it?
yeah that's correct I didn't notice
after the fact the anime is on its
season on Nicktoons as LBX
the original
anime is called
Denkai Senkai Wars
which I have acquired and I will be watching
soon to check it out
and let's see Kaijuto you may have
won him over because he said oh yeah I forgot
about that game I wanted it so there you go
so reminding people yes that is a thing
I just love the fact
that you can just customize the character any way
you want and it's just
all the fight scenes are just pure action
oriented and when
you go through the same levels
to you know to build
your character up usually when you're
fighting the other person the levels
are usually within 2 to 5
of yours so it's not like you're
level 20 and you're going back to fight
the level 5 character again
right
alright so that sounds like some really
good time wasters for filthy
casuals I'm just kidding
yes and filthy casuals who at work
sit there and play Mario Kart 7
and Smash Brothers during the break in
the break room nice nice
that's how to do it
I was just poking fun because Zach Defton chat said
Rama turned into a casual and made a face but said
JK so he didn't really mean it you know what
it's all good you game wherever
you can exactly
alright well Rama
will talk to you another time
but thank you so much for the call and of course anime
jam session on Tuesday night so you guys here
this week I know you did your holiday thing last
week no we are on
vacation right now for the next couple
of weeks we're looking to come back around the second
week of January because
Mako-chan needs to chill
I need to catch up on some videos
and post them online and we
gotta get prepped for the 2016 convention
season who said you get time off
who gave who approved that
Mr. Black Wolf
approved of that cause I filed the proper
paperwork for it I'm gonna
have a chat with him alright no I'm just kidding
have a good vacation you guys we'll see you in a couple of weeks
take care everyone take care my friend
bye bye alright there it is
Rama giving us a call
there on the Skype line over at
Orange Lawn Tradio all one word on Skype
let's see if we can squeeze in another call I know it's after
9 o'clock but I wanna see if we can squeeze in at least
one more call here on the show
so let's get to it I see another call coming
in so I'm gonna try to answer it here
and it does take another minute to connect
that it doesn't usually let's get to it hi
Orange Lawn Tradio who's this?
Hey Akdef how you doing?
pretty great
what's on your mind?
well
I have already talked about Undertale that much
but
just a quick note
it has a demo so if Flacco
and Shane want to try it out
it has a demo on Undertale.com
so
you can try it out it isn't that
big of a mending game so
I'm pretty sure any PC can run it
I don't have APC
does it run on Macs at all?
it runs on Mac
so yeah
I have a really old Mac I wouldn't risk it
alright well you can try at least a demo
Shane you gonna still be a hater over there?
or you try a demo?
when am I gonna work in the time for a demo?
when are you gonna have the time for a demo in between all the
Xenoblade and 14
and Toy Hunting
I know I know
well I don't know Akdef
I have the full game thanks to Dark Saga
so I do fully intend on trying it at some point
well it's a really great game
my number one but I'm gonna
I'm gonna take my number
my number three since I didn't mention
that over on the full question
what's that?
and it's Taiko no Tatsujin beta version
really?
yeah I really
really really love that game a lot
it's one of my
my favorite games of this year
and it pretty much gave
my beta a lot of life
so I'm
really really grateful about it
and I hope there's
new versions for the beta
or at least
new Taiko games coming out
and
again
it's a game that
I really really liked
and I still play it a lot
and if you know Taiko no Tatsujin
or Taiko Drone Master
it's pretty much the same game
it has some new things
like quest mode
it's like an RPG adventure
so it has that
it has multiplayer also
so it's a great game
probably not for everyone but
it's definitely my number three this year
wasn't there a 3DS one that
like was released
maybe I'm crossing wires here
maybe I'm thinking of the Vita one but I thought it was on 3DS
but I seem to remember talking about that one
but I know in
the Fugu question of the week
Andy Arde mentioned like 7 Vita games
were music games so
I'm sure Taiko no Tatsujin is one of them
so yeah that's pretty cool
that the Vita's kind of living
on with all these different music
games but it's interesting that they're all
overseas because we don't really get the Vita
support here in the US
that we do in other places
and like all these games are basically imports
except Shane was Super Beat Sonic
localized? That was a local release right?
cause DJ Max was
well only two DJ Max's were
sorry the one I remember
sorry three were
I can't count
yeah I actually got
Super Beat Sonic this week because it
was cheap on Amazon
so yeah I'm gonna try that too
but yeah there was also a lot of
games, Persona 4, Dancing All Night
there was also
AIBT
which got really popular
when it got released so I really want to
try that one too
but yeah the Vita is getting
pretty much a niche
niche machine
it's getting a lot of
import releases and
it's a great console not
the best but it's great for
if you like
imports gaming
so yeah
I actually remember too that
since Dark Sakura talked about Puyo
or Kirby's Island launch today
I
need to get Tetris Puyo Pop
or Puyo Puyo
since that's an import
only and it has
a Vita release so yeah
yeah Puyo Puyo did have
a Vita release and I thought there was like a Puyo Puyo
versus something that came out on all those
handhelds as well like it was like two puzzle
games blended together but I don't remember
in the moment so
alright well thank you ACDEF
for calling in and sharing your number 3 pick with us
and I hope you're having a good holiday season
we'll talk to you next year
hey hopefully that's the case
alright sounds good we'll talk to you soon
take care ACDEF thanks for calling in tonight
thanks for having me alright anytime take care
alright and
if you want to give us a call maybe
I'll squeeze in one call if somebody gets in here fast
we'll squeeze in one more call Orange Lounge
Radio all one word on
Skype and Dark Tetsuya says
Puyo Puyo cross Tetris
and Akuma
JP says there's so many Puyo
Puyo on mobile
I'm not surprised to hear that
actually I don't know do we have a lot of Puyo Puyo on
mobile here I think there's
at least one I think I've seen at least one
so anyway Orange Lounge
Radio all one word on Skype if you
want to give us a call here in these closing minutes
of the show otherwise
I think we'll probably wrap up because we're getting to be after
nine o'clock on the west coast
we're getting to be hungry are you getting to be hungry
yes you making plans on where you're going to go eat
no not yet I haven't figured
out haven't figured that out yet alright
one more shout out for calls
and we'll probably wrap things up Orange Lounge Radio
all one word on Skype
and next
week we will be here and
talking about whatever comes up in the next
week although I anticipate it's probably going to be another
slow news week so we will probably do some
sort of list list next week with
our predictions I'm sorry we didn't get to do that
tonight I know Flaco is looking
forward to that but that's okay I only do it
without I can just not be right this year
it's fine were you right
last year I don't know probably not
I have to go back and pull up like I've ever been right
yeah I was like
since it's super easy I thought that the Xbox
one would be like a hundred dollars with like a
like a service plan type thing
that's so wrong well you know
over there actually is an Orange Lounge
Radio wiki where some of the inside
jokes and things are tracked you can see every
classic game of the week ever but
you can also see they actually have a page and I say they
because I actually I don't really do anything
with this this is all like Dark Tetsuya
and I think Orange Riot does work
with this like there's a few people and I'm sorry if I'm not aiming
everybody in the moment there's a few people
that work on this and
yeah they actually keep track of a
lot of the like inside jokes and things
that come up on the show and so one of them is
listless and so
in episode 582
oh thank you AJ Mix Dark Tetsuya says always does a
classic game of the week every week thank you AJ Mix
582 was OLR's
2015 predictions
number one now it doesn't say every
answer and it doesn't say who contributed it it just
says here's the scientific results after the
chat room voted number
one one of those DDoS
brats gets the death penalty
that was the number one that was you I remember that
that was me I do remember that one and
unfortunately that didn't happen but I thought one of them
got the book thrown at him didn't he? one of them did get the book
thrown at him but it wasn't the death penalty
that was the ridiculous part of the answer
well if they die in jail it would count right?
I shouldn't be so morbid
I'm sorry I'm sorry
number two which was a tie
was yet another 3DS
skew which
duh that was like a gimme
either Alan or Loki I don't know
I think I think Alan said that one
and that was kind of unfair because
that was already out in Japan by that point too
that was a duh
and it tied with punishing
silence from valve on
anything but financials
that's a winner right there punishing
silence from valve absolutely
how appropriate it is for your
financials because they leak into everybody
yes
that one won OLR was
right shout it on
twitter hashtag OLR was right
punishing silence from valve
came true in 2015
it took till the end of the year but
alright and then let's see
lastly number three which ended up being
number four because of a tie Microsoft
announces Minecraft 2
ok we didn't get Minecraft 2 but
we got Minecraft on that
hololens thing and we got Minecraft
story mode so kind of
close kind of close
nah get out
get out alright
full on Minecraft 2
if you want to look back
on the year do you know what other
we only did listless three times this year
apparently episode 600
which was a big landmark episode
what game will we be obsessed with
on episode 1000
and the top three were PT
number one I feel like
that was on the shortlist that was on there
but number one was pixel
shits the mmo number two
was dance dance revolution the
aww answer and then number three was
president cat 2 arena's revenge
so it was like all instances I won the
last listless I know that not that
long ago was the worst NES
game of all time and that was when you were here Flaco
and it was a huge tie because it was Bible
adventures way up here
and then like everything else tied Bart
vs the space man that was my answer barbie
back to the future 2 and 3
and cheetah men 2 yeah
like all tied so but not first place
that was me that's right
this is the first time I think I even got in the top
three on this list and I
won it ahh looking back
on 2015 thanks Bible there it is
I want to thank the Bible
thank you God
were you really just
that guy on the award show
alright
all joking and laughing aside that's it I'm going to
close up the skype line because clearly
nobody else is calling in now we're just laughing at ourselves
but I do want to thank you guys
for your support of orange lounge radio
for the whole dang year and
as we move into next week
our 14th year of
broadcasting begins
I mean our birthday is really in June but
when you're around this long you get to
celebrate a little early so we kick off our 14th
year of broadcasting next week and thank
you guys again for your support it's been
a ton through 2015
if you did like what you heard here at orange lounge radio
tonight I'm not sure what's wrong with you
but thank you no I'm kidding thank you very much
I appreciate that please tell
a friend or two about the show that's all we ask
help us spread the word about orange lounge
radio because this is a show where every gamer
has a voice but we can't share those voices
if they're not out there listening so
help recruit more people for the OL
army it's appreciated
let's go around and get everybody's final
thought tonight first off Dark
Sakura thanks for being here sadly she's
left I don't know what she'd say
but she left her coffee right
there on the table geez Dark
Sakura alright
Loki will be back next
week and we've missed him tonight but he'll
be back next week thank you guys
our guests for filling in tonight Shane I know
you're dying of hunger over there thank you for toughing it out
for three hours even though I offered you food
during the break but
coffee or water?
is he like Christian Bale for trying to
lose weight for a roll?
can I get something to eat and I would have been like
no coffee or water that's all
you can freeze the coffee
and eat coffee ice
alright Shane
he doesn't like coffee grinds
oh yeah you want to eat some coffee grinds?
just get them all on your teeth
that's so nasty
Shane do you have a final thought for us tonight?
thanks for being here I really hope
my targets get those toys this week
I want my blue spino
zord so bad like
it hurts and PT
for game of the year 2016 right?
yes we'll start the campaign now
alright Flaco
thank you for being here as well you're welcome
always a five hour show when you're here
I know I just talk too much
that's okay we all talk too much
you have a podcast for three hours
I'm like you don't even know how much we can fucking talk
try to keep it down for three hours
well we had a fault start tonight
the podcast listeners won't hear it
but we had a fault start with dead audio
because Skype screwed up the audio on my computer
so we started like ten minutes late
there we go we're at the end of the show
so Flaco any final thoughts
for our listeners tonight?
a shout out to Alan
I don't know if he's still listening but I went and checked out that
amiibo setup that is impressive
oh yeah? so good job by him
do you like how OCD it is? yes I love it
I think it's amazing I really do
why don't we change it before we leave? I'll fucking notice
no don't don't do it
it looks beautiful I love it
it'll be like when we were at GamerX
and I had all the postcards
neatly configured on the table
up down up down
I had them all configured and I would like
to turn around for just a second
and then I turn back around and one of them is just slightly tilted
and that was me
and it's like Jane I fucking know what you just did
like achoo
that's what you did at the end yes
alright
and my final thought tonight is
I'm gonna go with what I see in the chat room there
I like apple pie
that's my final thought tonight
I want some pie that sounds really good
I think there's cake in the fridge
clean up your avalanche skills
