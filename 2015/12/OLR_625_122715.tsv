7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Twas the nightmare on Christmas when all through the net did the outrage explode the frustration was met
19000	24000	Join us for the news on this episode here now, the news and much more and it all starts right meow
24000	27000	On the show where every gamer has a voice
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	40000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the very last Orange Lounge Radio episode of 2015
40000	47000	My name is Rob Roberts here with you in lovely Sacramento, California in Studio N7 joined by my co-host
47000	51000	Say hello over there to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
51000	53000	I have been freshly groomed
53000	56000	Yes, your hair looks amazing, I know it's radio so it doesn't do
56000	60000	I'll try to take a picture, someone can take a picture of the back of my head
60000	63000	Post a little selfie, put it on the tumblers, get some likes
63000	65000	Maybe, we'll see
65000	69000	But it's red and purple and I kind of have the Ramona Flowers haircut
69000	70000	Yeah, I like it
70000	72000	Except it's straight and I don't have the banks
72000	77000	And our mutual friend Monet who I've done Rocky Horror with, I went to Wizard World in Reno with
77000	79000	So I think she probably showed up on my Twitter at some point
79000	82000	She does the hair and she has amazing hair herself and so forth
82000	84000	Though I have to ask Rob
84000	86000	So if you're in Sacramento and you need a stylist
86000	87000	See Monet
87000	88000	We'll hook you up, yeah, see Monet
88000	91000	But by the way Rob, what's this about the Bible?
91000	92000	The Bi-
96000	99000	We're not telling that story on air
99000	100000	In the Bible
100000	104000	Cause Monet's really funny and she laughs at my really immature stuff
104000	106000	So when there was a Bible in the hotel room
106000	109000	Dot dot dot, that's all I meant to tell about the story
109000	110000	Rob had a moment
110000	114000	I don't want to offend folks that might be offended if I were to finish that story
114000	116000	I'm not gonna go into-
116000	119000	But I think it's just more funny that now I know
119000	121000	And I can tease you relentlessly cause it was pretty funny
121000	125000	Yeah, and I didn't ruin or do anything that would make somebody not want to touch it
125000	127000	Why do you have to tell that story right at the top of the show?
127000	128000	I'm not telling the story
128000	130000	These people that are tuning into Orange Lounge Radio for the first time are like
130000	131000	Oh, what a bunch of sacrilegious-
131000	133000	And on Christmas, on Christmas
133000	134000	It's not Christmas
134000	136000	These sacrilegious assholes
136000	139000	It's only still Christmas if you're Catholic, Lutheran, or Anglican
140000	142000	And I'm Jewish, so it doesn't matter
142000	148000	Well, did you have a good week in spite of everything being closed on Thursday?
148000	150000	Christmas did kind of blow
150000	152000	But I got toys
152000	154000	And a lot of chocolate
154000	156000	And sometimes a lot of chocolate makes up for the stuff that blows
156000	158000	That's good, chocolate's amazing
158000	160000	And no, it wasn't Bible in the sex motel
160000	162000	Thank you, Ikuma
162000	165000	We don't have love hotels like that here in the US
165000	166000	We just have-
166000	168000	Have you been to West Sacramento?
169000	171000	We have these seedy little rundown hourly things
171000	173000	But they're not nice like a real love hotel
173000	175000	Ah, okay, fair enough
175000	177000	You put a quarter in the bed and it shakes
177000	178000	Or so I've heard
178000	180000	Love hotels are apparently pretty nice
180000	182000	Like, they're the ones over there
182000	183000	Okay
183000	185000	Not here, alright, anyway
185000	187000	But we're not here to talk about love hotels
187000	190000	We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
190000	193000	As we do every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network
193000	196000	Live.vognetwork.com
196000	198000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern is when we tape
198000	201000	On Sunday nights, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
201000	203000	And if you are listening live, you should join us in chat
203000	205000	Live.vognetwork.com
205000	207000	You might be asking yourself right about now
207000	209000	Why didn't Rob introduce Loki?
209000	211000	Well, Loki is not here tonight
211000	213000	He does have the night off, he went to do a-
213000	215000	He was stuffed into a trunk and left in the ocean
215000	218000	Yes, he's flying somewhere over the North Pole right now
218000	220000	Probably trying to capture an ingress node
220000	223000	So he's on hiatus tonight
223000	225000	No, he had other family stuff going on
225000	227000	As I'm sure a lot of people do
227000	229000	During this time between Christmas and New Years
229000	232000	However, since we were off for a bunch of weeks in November
232000	234000	Due to other circumstances, we wanted to make sure
234000	236000	We were still giving you guys a show this week
236000	239000	So, we are joined in studio though by some special guests
239000	243000	To help us fill the void left by Loki's absence tonight
243000	245000	Some familiar faces here in studio
245000	247000	I'm sure you guys will be happy to hear from
247000	249000	Say hello to
249000	251000	Vognetwork superfan
251000	253000	Flaco Jones is in the house tonight
254000	256000	OMG, it's Flaco, how are you doing, Flaco?
256000	257000	I'm doing great, how are you doing?
257000	259000	Great, it's so good to see you
259000	261000	Yeah, it's like I haven't seen you in such a long time
261000	263000	I haven't seen you in like a whole day
263000	265000	No, seriously, thank you for hosting the little holiday
265000	267000	Choir way last night
267000	268000	I guess it was a holiday thing, I don't know
268000	269000	Well, we did gaming
269000	270000	Yeah, we did some gaming
270000	272000	We played Jackbox Party Pack 2
272000	273000	Fancy Wine Party
273000	275000	Which I won, you're waxed, thank you very much
275000	276000	You did
276000	278000	And I won the other one
278000	279000	Quiplash
279000	280000	Yes
280000	282000	And then Alan won
282000	283000	Sketch
283000	284000	You won the Warioware
284000	285000	Warioware sketch
285000	286000	Yeah, we played Warioware
286000	288000	Which I keep forgetting that's a thing
288000	290000	Warioware Pictionary, yeah, pretty much
290000	292000	Yeah, but you can actually play that with one gamepad
292000	293000	You can pass it around
293000	294000	Yeah, it's super fun
294000	295000	Yeah, good times
295000	298000	We'll get to your gaming week in a little while
298000	299000	But how was your holiday?
299000	301000	Did you get any good gaming stuff going on for your holiday?
301000	303000	I got a new controller for my PS4
303000	304000	Oh yeah
304000	307000	It's the 20th anniversary one that looks like a PS1 controller
307000	310000	I thought you could only get that if you got the full on PlayStation 4
310000	311000	No, they made a bunch more of them
311000	312000	Oh, okay, cool
312000	313000	They were really expensive originally
313000	316000	But they were on sale for, I think, 44 bucks at Best Buy
316000	321000	Right when the holiday shopping season started
321000	322000	Who's gonna complain about that?
322000	324000	I know, I was like, that's pretty awesome
324000	327000	I love it when Steam sales carry over into retail
327000	328000	As well
328000	331000	Yeah, so I thought, you know, oh, this will be cool
331000	334000	But then I was like, wait, I can't play any PS1 games
334000	336000	On my PS4
336000	338000	Except Final Fantasy VII
338000	339000	Which actually reminded me
339000	341000	It's like, oh yeah, you can play Final Fantasy VII
341000	343000	That's the one you can play
343000	345000	So I was like, well, that would be fun
345000	348000	And I heard it's kind of cool with the cheats that they have in that game
348000	352000	Actually, yeah, I know some folks on Twitter that are replaying it right now
352000	354000	And the cheats apparently help a lot
354000	356000	Yeah, because then you don't have to worry about the whole grind again
356000	357000	You're like, oh, I can just cheat
357000	358000	I've already played the game
358000	360000	Yeah, you're not really cheating
360000	362000	You're just fast-forwarding
362000	363000	No, no, it's not just that
363000	364000	It lets you heal your whole party
364000	366000	Yeah, but you don't have to use that
366000	367000	You don't have to use any of them
367000	368000	You don't have to use any of them
368000	369000	If you want to fight the weapons and all that
369000	370000	I wouldn't say it
370000	371000	It just makes it real easy
371000	372000	Now, what is it?
372000	374000	You have your Vita with you
374000	375000	Oh, yeah, my Vita
375000	376000	But it looks like a Game Gear
376000	377000	Like, what did you do to your Vita?
377000	379000	I bought a thing a while ago
379000	381000	It's Trigger Grips, I think that's what it's called
381000	382000	Yeah
382000	384000	And yeah, it just makes it feel more like a controller
384000	385000	Huh
385000	386000	Because I don't like it
386000	388000	Ever since the PSP, I've hated the design
388000	389000	Yeah
389000	390000	This little circle thing
390000	392000	I used to have to test games on it at Konami
392000	394000	We played Frogger on PSP
394000	395000	Right
395000	396000	And some of the Winx games
396000	400000	And it was so uncomfortable to hold for all those hours at work
400000	401000	And so when I got a Vita
401000	404000	I was like, the first thing I want to buy is some kind of grip
404000	406000	And I looked it up and these Trigger Grips
406000	407000	Trigger Grips
407000	409000	They also make the triggers easier to push
409000	411000	At some point, just play around
411000	414000	And try putting your hands on that Heaven's Word Vita from Japan
414000	415000	That I have right there
415000	416000	Is that a
416000	418000	Because that's the newer model that they never released here
418000	419000	Okay
419000	421000	And, like, you have to have really tiny hands
421000	422000	I think to be able to effectively use that
422000	423000	That's like a Slim, right?
423000	424000	Yeah, it's like the
424000	425000	They released a Slim here
425000	426000	It's just not white
426000	427000	Oh, did they?
427000	428000	Yeah, X4 has one
428000	429000	I didn't think they released the other model
429000	430000	Yeah, you have one too
430000	432000	Yeah, no, it is lighter and it's a little bit smaller
432000	433000	Alright, well
433000	434000	I still think it's uncomfortable to hold
434000	436000	So much for me paying attention
436000	437000	I guess I missed that
437000	438000	But, I mean, again, it's not like
438000	441000	It's not like I was planning on getting a second Vita
441000	442000	Yeah
442000	444000	It just kind of happens for my birthday
444000	447000	Where Alan was like, I know Rob really wants that Heaven's Word Vita
447000	448000	That's what they say about children
448000	449000	They just kind of happen
449000	450000	They do
450000	451000	Well, that's how
451000	452000	My brother and sister were adopted
452000	454000	Like 14, 16 years later
454000	455000	I was an oops
455000	456000	Yeah, me too
456000	459000	I always say, I was a mistake
459000	463000	And my mom goes, no, Rob, you are a pleasant surprise
463000	466000	But then I made your father have the surgery
466000	471000	Anyway, let's see
471000	473000	This is a good time to introduce our chat room as well
473000	475000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
475000	478000	We were having some technical difficulties earlier in the studio
478000	480000	We got a little bit of a late start
480000	481000	The podcasters won't hear that
481000	484000	But some continued issues from my Skype nightmare last week
484000	485000	Carried into this week
485000	488000	And ended up changing some audio settings unknowingly
488000	492000	But that caused Tigerclaw to say in our chat room
492000	493000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
493000	495000	Flaco Jones on the show
495000	497000	No wonder the show didn't start properly initially
497000	499000	Oh, the curse continues
499000	501000	Make sure the recording is also working
501000	503000	And Alex P
503000	504000	And your UPS, don't forget that
504000	506000	Alex P Carson in chat says
506000	509000	Rob scared me when he said last show
509000	511000	Of 2015
511000	513000	That's what was printed on the card
513000	515000	I just had to read what was on the card
515000	516000	That's what was printed on the card
516000	519000	We do have another guest here in studio with us
519000	521000	That comes to say hello a lot on the show
521000	523000	We're happy to have back Shane tonight
523000	524000	I just woke up
524000	529000	I know, and now you're going to be very monotone dry, Shane
529000	531000	I'm a little sleepy
531000	533000	Well, to help you wake up, Shane
533000	536000	I'm going to give you 30 seconds to talk about Power Rangers
536000	537000	Ready, go
537000	539000	So today we went looking for more toys
539000	542000	And I found one that I was looking for at Toys R Us
542000	544000	And it was awesome
544000	548000	And I still don't have the ones at Target
548000	550000	Because they don't have them around here yet
550000	552000	And it's really making me mad
552000	553000	Because one of them is really cool
553000	554000	He's Navy
554000	556000	And he's awesome
556000	560000	And it's just so infuriating
560000	561000	And time's up
561000	563000	But you actually
563000	566000	You've gotten so into this toy collecting thing
566000	570000	That you use websites to track Target inventory and stuff
570000	571000	Yes, I do
571000	574000	That can be very helpful for Amiibo and things like that too
574000	578000	Yeah, Power Rangers is more important
578000	580000	Any gaming stuff for your holiday?
582000	585000	Have you splurged on any of the sales or things like that?
585000	586000	No
586000	587000	No?
587000	588000	Wait
588000	589000	I'm waiting
589000	591000	Fantavision, but it really wasn't part of the holiday
591000	593000	It was just a new release and it was on sale
593000	597000	It's still nice to see more games being released during the holiday
597000	598000	Even if digitally
598000	600000	Because usually this is just a dead period
600000	603000	Once you hit Black Friday
603000	605000	There's no games released in December usually
605000	608000	Sometimes you might have a fringe game that's running a little late
608000	610000	But otherwise there's no games
610000	613000	So it's kind of nice to have some digital treats
613000	616000	Even if it's old games being done new again
616000	620000	vidpower and our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says there's websites to track Target inventory
621000	623000	Now you're going to have to share on Twitter or something
623000	624000	I don't know
624000	625000	Yes there is
625000	626000	It's called BrickSeek
626000	632000	And you have to know Target DPCI numbers or it doesn't really work well
632000	634000	Which is some type of internal thing
634000	635000	Yes
635000	638000	So you have to go make friends with the Target person
638000	642000	Or go read their little labels if you're looking for specific things
642000	643000	Alright
643000	644000	Dually noted
644000	647000	We can use that for possibly game hunting later on
648000	650000	He called that out in chat room over
650000	651000	Is he the one that told you about that?
651000	652000	No
652000	654000	Because apparently he told you about the amiibo figures
654000	655000	I know I didn't take credit
655000	656000	And then you told me
656000	657000	Yeah I didn't take credit
657000	659000	Well but I just assumed it was a you thing
659000	661000	No and then I backed him up when he said that
661000	662000	Well that's fine so I appreciate it both
662000	664000	Because I actually got one of the figures I ordered today
664000	666000	I got a Palutena from Japan
666000	668000	No no that was something later
668000	669000	That was me telling you that one
669000	673000	He told me about the Dedede and Rosalina
673000	674000	Oh okay I got those
674000	676000	I want a Dedede
676000	678000	Check Amazon they may still have them pretty cheap
678000	679000	Yeah I bought one today
682000	684000	So yeah my amiibo collection keeps growing
684000	685000	I think I'm up to
685000	687000	$75,000
687000	689000	No it's not $70,000 it's $60,000 something
689000	690000	Maybe $69,000 we'll just say $69,000
690000	692000	I have two What's Your Faces?
692000	694000	From Animal Crossing the pink one
694000	695000	Lottie
695000	696000	Lottie yeah two Lotties
696000	698000	Because Dan bought me one and I already had one
698000	699000	Oh okay
699000	701000	So I have to go trade her in at Target
701000	702000	Oh there you go
702000	705000	And if you know the number you know which Target already has them on shelves
705000	706000	And which ones don't
706000	707000	Alright there it is
707000	710000	That is not helpful for that situation
710000	712000	You're using it wrong
712000	714000	Alan Alchemy again great radio
714000	716000	Alan Alchemy is calling out in chat
716000	719000	Flaco what do you think of the collection on the shelves?
719000	720000	I did that yes
720000	721000	The other night
721000	724000	Oh okay so those of you guys that listened to Hoard House
724000	726000	When it was still around about six months ago
726000	727000	Grandpa was in town on Christmas
727000	730000	Because he was spending it with some friends he had here in Sacramento
730000	732000	So of course what does he want to do with me in the evening?
732000	734000	He wants to go drinking
734000	735000	Yeah
735000	738000	So and Alan's like hmm thanks but no thanks right
738000	740000	So which I can understand
740000	743000	So I went downtown to have some drinks with Grandpa
743000	746000	And while I was gone Alan decided he was going to completely
746000	749000	Reconfigure my amiibo collection
749000	753000	Which usually you would think that would drive my OCD a little bonkers
753000	758000	But like actually he even made it like anal retentively better
758000	760000	He spaced the shelves all equally
760000	763000	He put an equal amount of amiibo on each shelf
763000	765000	And spaced them in the same manner
765000	769000	And he tried to group them together best he could
769000	772000	Except I was like when I did get home I was like
772000	775000	Mewtwo is a Pokemon and so he shouldn't be up there
775000	777000	He should be down here with the other Pokemon
777000	779000	And Alan was like but this shelf is villains
779000	781000	And I'm like I'm sorry but Mewtwo
781000	783000	Pokemon is more important than villains
783000	785000	So he needs to go on the Pokemon shelf
785000	786000	And Alan's like hmm
786000	787000	And you need to get a new
787000	788000	Is that in the other room?
788000	790000	Our OCDs battle sometimes
790000	791000	Yeah it's in the other room
791000	793000	We have to check it later
793000	794000	You have to check it later
794000	798000	Because it's more important that we get into our kickoff topic tonight
798000	801000	It is the last show of 2015
801000	805000	And as we typically do with our last shows of the year
805000	808000	We want to take a look back at the year in video games
808000	811000	And I'm sure a lot of your gaming press sites
811000	813000	A lot of your gaming podcasts
813000	815000	Are all doing a similar thing this week
815000	817000	And that is that they are recapping
817000	820000	The best games of 2015
820000	822000	However we here at Orange Lounge Radio
822000	823000	Have a different view
823000	825000	Because you know what
825000	828000	You can't possibly have time
828000	829000	Unless you're paid to do it
829000	832000	To play every single video game that's out there
832000	834000	Every single release and so forth
834000	838000	So I think it's very hard to say what the best game is of 2015
838000	839000	It's all subjective
839000	840000	It is, it is
840000	842000	So tonight we're going to present
842000	843000	As we do every year
843000	846000	Our favorite games of 2015
846000	847000	Because that's what they are
847000	849000	And that way it's neither right nor wrong
849000	850000	It's our favorite
850000	853000	And F you if you don't agree
853000	854000	Right, right Dark Sakura?
854000	855000	That's it
855000	856000	And keep in mind
856000	857000	Yeah, foo
857000	858000	Foo
858000	859000	Keep in mind
859000	861000	Sometimes we blur the lines a little bit
861000	864000	Games that were released at the end of 2014
864000	865000	Or even, who knows
865000	867000	Could creep into 2015
867000	869000	Just because this is the year we discovered them
869000	871000	I think that happened with like Mass Effect 1 year or something
871000	872000	They'll creepy creep
872000	873000	They'll creepy creep a little bit
873000	875000	So that's all part of the rules
875000	878000	And tonight I actually have a bumper for this
878000	880000	So, without further ado
885000	888000	Live from Studio N7
888000	894000	It's the Orange Lounge Radio Best Video Games of 2015
894000	896000	Yay
898000	900000	It's not our favorites
900000	901000	Alright
901000	903000	You did that whole long explanation
903000	906000	After I just did that whole explanation
906000	907000	Shane is going to be combative
907000	908000	No, Shane is like
908000	909000	This is the right answer
909000	910000	And if you don't agree
910000	911000	Then you're wrong
911000	912000	That's pretty much how it is
912000	913000	Alright
913000	914000	So we're going to go around the room
914000	916000	And since Loki isn't with us this week
916000	918000	Of course we'll catch up with him next week
918000	920000	But for those of us gathered here tonight
920000	924000	We want to recap our top 3 favorite games of 2015
924000	925000	And why
925000	927000	Wait, it's not our best now?
927000	928000	It's our favorite
928000	929000	I said it was our favorite
929000	930000	Whether or not they came out
930000	931000	Pay attention
931000	932000	It's gone from favorite
932000	933000	To best
933000	934000	To top
934000	935000	Oh, to top now
936000	938000	X is what, in your opinion
938000	940000	Is the most enjoyable thing
940000	942000	That you have participated in
942000	943000	In recent history
943000	944000	This past year
944000	945000	Thank you
945000	947000	Lay down the goddamn law, DarkSakura
947000	948000	I need it
948000	949000	What the fuck I'd do
949000	950000	Alright
950000	951000	Let's get to it
951000	952000	The best
952000	953000	Top
953000	954000	Favorite
954000	955000	Mostest
955000	956000	Do I have to name them all?
956000	957000	No, just number 3
957000	959000	DarkSakura, what is your third favorite game of 2015?
959000	961000	Number 3 is Undertale
961000	962000	Undertale
962000	964000	A game I have yet to play
964000	965000	I've only barely played it
965000	967000	I'm on my neutral playthrough
967000	969000	So that I can go to the pacifist playthrough
969000	972000	But it just fucking exploded my tumblr
972000	974000	And that's why I have it
974000	977000	I know more about the game now
977000	979000	Without having hardly played any of it
979000	981000	But the fact that it's basically
981000	983000	Hit like the Five Nights at Freddy's level
983000	985000	Of immediate super stardom
985000	987000	You know, fanocity
987000	991000	It actually makes me feel a little home stucky
991000	992000	Okay
992000	995000	And so until Hiveswap comes out
995000	997000	This is going to be my replacement
997000	998000	So there it is
998000	1000000	Undertale is your third favorite game of the year
1000000	1003000	And yeah, it's pretty hard to escape
1003000	1005000	A lot of the fandom of Undertale
1005000	1007000	I'm more of a twitter guy than a tumblr guy
1007000	1008000	But I try to use both
1008000	1009000	And it's hard to escape it
1009000	1011000	So it does seem like every year
1011000	1013000	There's that one indie game
1013000	1014000	And there ought to be more
1014000	1015000	Because indie games are great
1015000	1017000	But there's always that one indie game
1017000	1019000	That just really breaks through
1019000	1021000	And actually this year I'd argue there's two
1021000	1022000	Because one of them is on my list
1022000	1024000	But anyway
1024000	1026000	There's Minecraft a few years ago
1026000	1028000	Five Nights at Freddy's obviously
1028000	1029000	I read that book
1029000	1030000	I forgot
1030000	1032000	That was part of my gaming week
1032000	1033000	We haven't done gaming weeks yet
1033000	1035000	Oh but you talked about what Christmas
1035000	1036000	Video game things I did
1036000	1037000	And that's kind of the same thing
1037000	1039000	Are you just here to correct me tonight?
1039000	1041000	That's what I do every night
1041000	1043000	When you're talking
1043000	1047000	Anyway, let's check out some other number threes
1047000	1049000	I was going to do Shane next
1049000	1050000	But since I'm mad at him right now
1050000	1051000	We're going to go to Flaco next
1051000	1052000	Flaco
1052000	1054000	Your third favorite game
1054000	1056000	You look like you still haven't decided yet
1056000	1058000	It's been the toughest decision for me
1058000	1060000	Number three
1060000	1062000	Because there's so many good games
1062000	1064000	I think I narrowed it down like on the drive here
1064000	1066000	I've been flip flopping this week too
1066000	1067000	For what it's worth
1067000	1071000	I love the PS4 remake of Tearaway
1071000	1072000	Loved it
1072000	1074000	Got some bugs in it that bugged me
1074000	1076000	It's hard knowing that five million people
1076000	1078000	List bugged me
1078000	1080000	It's hard knowing that five million people
1080000	1082000	Listen to this show
1082000	1084000	And your opinion can sway people that much
1084000	1086000	On the interwebs
1086000	1088000	So the time has come
1088000	1090000	To make a choice
1090000	1092000	Number three is
1092000	1094000	It's Rocket League
1094000	1096000	Rocket League
1096000	1098000	Rocket League has gone up and down on my list
1098000	1100000	I think it's just based on
1100000	1102000	How many people are playing it
1102000	1104000	I think I settled in at number three
1104000	1106000	What is it about Rocket League?
1107000	1109000	If I like Yoshi more
1109000	1111000	I should play it more
1111000	1113000	Rocket League is just a fun
1113000	1115000	Goofy indie game
1115000	1117000	Great online experience
1117000	1119000	So it's like a lot of the online stuff
1119000	1121000	That really wins that game over for you
1121000	1123000	Yeah I like playing online
1123000	1125000	It's just crazy to see
1125000	1127000	The moves you can make
1127000	1129000	The last second comebacks
1129000	1131000	It's just a fun game
1131000	1133000	They've added some new maps now
1133000	1135000	That actually put some new terrain
1136000	1138000	Not every map is the same dimension anymore
1138000	1140000	Which is nice
1140000	1142000	Is that something I was kind of down on it
1142000	1144000	When it first came out
1144000	1146000	And they made that free
1146000	1148000	You can pay for the Mad Max update
1148000	1150000	And get the cars and everything like that
1150000	1152000	But you get the map for free
1152000	1154000	PlayStation Plus really got
1154000	1156000	A really sweet deal with that
1156000	1158000	Because everybody else has pretty much
1158000	1160000	Had to pay for it at this point
1160000	1162000	To get that base game on Steam
1162000	1164000	I actually enjoyed the game so much
1164000	1166000	Actually I don't think I bought it on Steam
1166000	1168000	I think Jason gifted it to me
1168000	1170000	But I would have bought it for myself
1170000	1172000	If Jason wasn't so goddamn nice
1172000	1175000	But I got to get it on both platforms that way
1175000	1178000	I think it was awesome that it came on PlayStation Plus this year
1178000	1180000	I'm considering getting it on Xbox One too
1180000	1182000	It just came out on that right?
1182000	1184000	That's what I do with games I like
1184000	1186000	I buy them everywhere
1186000	1188000	So you're like extra fur
1188000	1190000	Do you know the Mass Effect 3 story?
1190000	1192000	Oh that's right I know that
1192000	1194000	Go into some comments from our chat
1194000	1196000	On the games announced so far on our list
1196000	1198000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
1198000	1200000	I act deaf responding to Dark Sakura's selection of Undertale
1200000	1202000	I was like Dark Sakura
1202000	1204000	I knew a lot about the game
1204000	1206000	Before I even played it myself
1206000	1208000	So that game just has a lot of word of mouth right now
1208000	1210000	Let's see Tigerclaw says
1210000	1212000	Rocket League has to be on everyone's list
1212000	1214000	That's a game that came out of nowhere
1214000	1216000	And became a huge success
1216000	1218000	Well who knows it may show up on a list
1218000	1220000	Somewhere else to make
1220000	1222000	I actually do not know
1222000	1224000	I think I know it's on Shane's list
1224000	1226000	I talk to him way too much
1226000	1228000	I don't know everybody else's list in here
1228000	1230000	So we may have some overlap
1230000	1232000	But it is time to get to Shane
1232000	1234000	And Shane your number 3 favorite game of 2015
1234000	1236000	I would say it's going to be
1236000	1238000	Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
1238000	1240000	You finally settled on Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
1240000	1242000	Well I actually was pretty sure
1242000	1244000	That was my number 3 for a while now
1244000	1246000	It's 2 and 1 that I'm going back and forth on
1246000	1248000	So Everybody's Gone to the Rapture on the PlayStation 4
1248000	1250000	What is it about Everybody's Gone to the Rapture?
1250000	1252000	I love the story, I love the atmosphere
1252000	1254000	I love the music
1254000	1256000	I don't care that some people may say
1256000	1258000	That all you do is walk around
1258000	1260000	I mean that's more fun
1260000	1262000	Than a lot of other games I played this year
1262000	1266000	So I think it was just a beautifully done game
1266000	1268000	It's a great experience
1268000	1270000	There's little
1270000	1272000	I mean they have little secrets throughout the entire game
1272000	1274000	And you get a better
1274000	1276000	Understanding of the whole story the more you find
1276000	1278000	And it's just
1278000	1280000	It was beautiful from start to finish
1280000	1282000	Loved it
1282000	1284000	Well Shane I think that's a really good pick
1284000	1286000	Because my number 3 favorite game of the year is
1286000	1288000	Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
1288000	1290000	On PlayStation 4 and I actually didn't know
1290000	1292000	That's what Shane was going to pick for number 3
1292000	1294000	But that is also my number 3 pick
1294000	1296000	For favorite game of the year
1296000	1298000	I actually flip flopped on this a lot
1298000	1300000	There's another game that was really close
1300000	1302000	And I just didn't end up putting it
1302000	1304000	I chose Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
1304000	1306000	Some people may not consider it a game
1306000	1308000	But kind of like Shane said
1308000	1310000	Exploration is a huge part of it
1310000	1312000	And I think exploration
1312000	1314000	And that sense of
1314000	1316000	What goes into a game
1316000	1318000	Is why games like Minecraft are huge
1318000	1320000	Exploration is a huge part of that
1320000	1322000	And there's still objectives too
1322000	1324000	It's not just like you're watching everything happen
1324000	1326000	Yeah and Minecraft has
1326000	1328000	I understand creation there's more to it
1328000	1330000	I'm not trying to compare the two games
1330000	1332000	But I just feel that Everybody's Gone to the Rapture
1332000	1334000	Was a gaming experience
1334000	1336000	Where at the end of it
1336000	1338000	I just had to talk to somebody about it
1338000	1340000	And you don't get that a lot in games
1340000	1342000	You know where it's like
1342000	1344000	I need to call Shane
1344000	1346000	And talk to him about it
1346000	1348000	I need to go on the internet and find people talking about the ending
1348000	1350000	Because there's so much that's left
1350000	1352000	Open to interpretation with the ending
1352000	1354000	And honestly
1354000	1356000	One of the best soundtracks to a game
1356000	1358000	I've heard in a very
1358000	1360000	Very long time
1360000	1362000	And something else
1362000	1364000	The audio in this game
1364000	1366000	I mean the visuals are gorgeous too
1366000	1368000	But the audio in this game
1368000	1370000	From the soundtrack to the voice acting
1370000	1372000	Is top notch
1372000	1374000	So you know what for a download title
1374000	1376000	Even if it's a little short
1376000	1378000	And some folks may be like
1378000	1380000	Where's the action? Where's the quick time event?
1380000	1382000	Some people may be left with that
1382000	1384000	I still think this is a game
1384000	1386000	Well worth your time to check out
1386000	1388000	And it's one of my top three of the year
1388000	1390000	Because even though there are no enemies
1390000	1392000	And nothing that can hurt you in that game
1392000	1394000	There were times where I was kind of scared to continue
1394000	1396000	Because I was like what's going to happen
1396000	1398000	Is something going to jump out at me
1398000	1400000	There's nothing that does
1400000	1402000	But I was literally creeped out many times
1402000	1404000	Well you need to go the wrong way and miss the story element too
1404000	1406000	Oh yeah
1406000	1408000	And that's something about that game
1408000	1410000	You kind of have to find everything
1410000	1412000	That's why I don't think there's any question it's a game
1412000	1414000	Because if you don't find all the right stuff
1414000	1416000	You don't get the whole story
1416000	1418000	Then it really won't make sense
1418000	1420000	But the challenge is really finding all those things
1420000	1422000	If you take the wrong path
1422000	1424000	You have to double back and find the right thing
1424000	1426000	There was one scene
1426000	1428000	One scene that Shane got that I didn't get
1428000	1430000	That completely changed the interpretation of the ending
1430000	1432000	I know it's the one where the guy disappears
1432000	1434000	In front of the priest
1434000	1436000	Yes, so we're trying to keep it a little
1436000	1438000	That's the beginning
1438000	1440000	That's the first chapter
1440000	1442000	And I missed that
1442000	1444000	And it completely changed the interpretation of the ending
1444000	1446000	So I mean it is important
1446000	1448000	So if you haven't played this game
1448000	1450000	Play it
1450000	1452000	And what's funny is I was talking to a game maker
1452000	1454000	At GX3 a couple weeks ago
1454000	1456000	And I won't say what the game is
1456000	1458000	But I'm excited about this game too
1458000	1460000	And we'll hopefully have him on the show at some point
1460000	1462000	But I actually said
1462000	1464000	Playing this reminds me a lot
1464000	1466000	Of everybody's gone to the rapture
1466000	1468000	And have you played it and he said no
1468000	1470000	And I said you've got to play it
1470000	1472000	If you're going to make a game like this
1472000	1474000	And he said he would
1474000	1476000	So we'll see
1476000	1478000	Anyway I was seeing if there was any comments
1478000	1480000	On this game but everybody in chat is suddenly
1480000	1482000	Talking about Niko Atsume
1482000	1484000	Neko Atsume
1484000	1486000	Which is the cat game on iPhone
1486000	1488000	It's not so much of a game
1488000	1490000	It's just more like
1490000	1492000	One of those shitty iPhone collector games
1492000	1494000	No
1494000	1496000	You just put out stuff for cats
1496000	1498000	And then you
1498000	1500000	Kind of fuck off for an hour, come back
1500000	1502000	So it's cat lady simulator
1502000	1504000	It's cat lady simulator
1504000	1506000	Oh my god my cat has a bag on its head
1506000	1508000	Alright let's move on
1508000	1510000	To our number two
1510000	1512000	Picks for 2015
1512000	1514000	Dark Soccer your second
1514000	1516000	Favorite game of 2015
1516000	1518000	That's going to be Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer
1518000	1520000	Why?
1520000	1522000	Just because it takes all the things that people like
1522000	1524000	The most about Animal Crossing
1524000	1526000	Which is the amassing of shit and decorating your house
1526000	1528000	And just blows it up
1528000	1530000	And I like having the cards
1530000	1532000	Because I finally used my amiibo card reader
1532000	1534000	And had
1534000	1536000	I decorated for DJKK
1536000	1538000	And gave him the ultimate hipster apartment
1538000	1540000	It's just fun
1540000	1542000	I mean it's fun and easy
1542000	1544000	It's
1544000	1546000	I would say it's casual because you can play it in like
1546000	1548000	15 minute increments
1548000	1550000	But for me
1550000	1552000	I just like being creative with the space there
1552000	1554000	And working in the limited
1554000	1556000	Availability with an entire
1556000	1558000	You know
1558000	1560000	Inventory behind me to do whatever I wanted to with
1560000	1562000	You know and I'm looking at our chat over at
1562000	1564000	live.vognetwork.com
1564000	1566000	And actdef says I didn't like Animal Crossing
1566000	1568000	Happy Home Designer that much
1568000	1570000	You know and I can see where maybe people kind of feel
1570000	1572000	Differently about this game based on
1572000	1574000	Like what you said it takes one element
1574000	1576000	Of the original Animal Crossing and kind of expands
1576000	1578000	On that and I have to admit I don't know
1578000	1580000	If I'd be super into it either because
1580000	1582000	I was always more about I want to run around
1582000	1584000	The island I want to find things
1584000	1586000	It's kind of more that exploration thing too
1586000	1588000	Like I love the Game Boy Advance thing
1588000	1590000	Connecting I love going on the internet and going to other
1590000	1592000	People's places I would like to have
1592000	1594000	Another Animal Crossing game
1594000	1596000	Because I mean I played like for
1596000	1598000	A year and a half I played
1598000	1600000	New Leaf
1600000	1602000	And I would really like to have a new one
1602000	1604000	But for the interim this just sort of gives me
1604000	1606000	My little bit of
1606000	1608000	Animal Crossing you know in small
1608000	1610000	Easy to carry around
1610000	1612000	Doses that I can play during my break at work
1612000	1614000	Well and I wonder at this point if they're just going to skip
1614000	1616000	The Wii U and move to Nintendo's next console
1616000	1618000	If that console is truly going to be next year
1618000	1620000	No we need to have it on Wii U
1620000	1622000	Because we need the island on the gamepad
1622000	1624000	We'll see
1624000	1626000	Listen to me Nintendo make this happen
1626000	1628000	We'll see you never know
1628000	1630000	Carson in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says
1630000	1632000	New Leaf for the win and Act F does admit
1632000	1634000	It's entertaining enough and I can see the appeal
1634000	1636000	Of it so there you go
1636000	1638000	Alright let's move around with some more
1638000	1640000	Number two favorite games of the year Flaco
1640000	1642000	My number two game of the year is
1642000	1644000	Until Dawn
1644000	1646000	Until Dawn on the PlayStation 4
1646000	1648000	The horror movie
1648000	1650000	Blend genre
1650000	1652000	Cross over thing
1652000	1654000	Super fun interactive movie thing
1654000	1656000	So yeah it was a blast to play
1656000	1658000	I uh you know
1658000	1660000	Played through the whole game
1660000	1662000	Got one ending and I've since gone back
1662000	1664000	And I've like tweaked some things
1664000	1666000	Once you go back in you can kind of
1666000	1668000	Chapter jump around so I
1668000	1670000	Kind of redid the ending because I had almost everything right
1670000	1672000	And I did an ending where everybody lives
1672000	1674000	So it's not a spoiler because you can have
1674000	1676000	Any like variation of people like living
1676000	1678000	Or dying at the end of that game
1678000	1680000	So I got the everybody lives like trophy so that was really
1680000	1682000	Fun to do too so now I want to get like
1682000	1684000	Everybody dies so I'm like
1684000	1686000	That one's a little bit harder to get actually because you have to
1686000	1688000	Make some choices early on so I can't
1688000	1690000	Go back to the game I had I had to go back and start over
1690000	1692000	Again and in the process I'm looking for more stuff
1692000	1694000	So the fact that I've been able to
1694000	1696000	Not just play it the one time through which you think
1696000	1698000	Most people just do because there's so many
1698000	1700000	Different branching ways it can go and different
1700000	1702000	Like people can survive and you have
1702000	1704000	Different endings then yeah it's got
1704000	1706000	Me to replay it so it's got great replay
1706000	1708000	Replayability the acting is great
1708000	1710000	It's sometimes it's hilarious but cheesy
1710000	1712000	Like a regular just like a
1712000	1714000	Some teenage slasher movie from the 90s that's what it feels
1714000	1716000	Like yeah and I mean you know I think for
1716000	1718000	A lot of us that are PlayStation 4 owners
1718000	1720000	Many of us were kind of around when
1720000	1722000	Those 90 horrors films were
1722000	1724000	You know like when Scream really broke
1724000	1726000	Through and so forth and all the
1726000	1728000	You know knockoffs of that came
1728000	1730000	Through so I can
1730000	1732000	Definitely see the appeal of that
1732000	1734000	And why fans of that are going to be really
1734000	1736000	Into this also interesting
1736000	1738000	Too because you know with the PlayStation 4 and the
1738000	1740000	Xbox One and this new
1740000	1742000	Era of consoles
1742000	1744000	Social gaming is very big and I
1744000	1746000	Noticed there was a lot of and I think part
1746000	1748000	Of the reason Until Dawn
1748000	1750000	Even caught on bigger than I think
1750000	1752000	We all know Sony expected because Sony
1752000	1754000	Yeah I mean remember how much they
1754000	1756000	They didn't quite devil's third it
1756000	1758000	Not quite but I mean
1758000	1760000	Remember how much they were promoting that order
1760000	1762000	In 1886 and that game like flopped
1762000	1764000	For all I could tell and then this
1764000	1766000	Game they just kind of dump at the end of August
1766000	1768000	Like oh here's this one we're barely going to
1768000	1770000	Advertise it even though they had like statues
1770000	1772000	For the order and all these collector's
1772000	1774000	Edition and all this other stuff and then
1774000	1776000	When they brought out Until Dawn it's like oh
1776000	1778000	Yeah Europe gets a collector's edition but the US
1778000	1780000	Does it and here it is and whatever
1780000	1782000	And it ended up being a pretty big hit and now
1782000	1784000	It's got apparently a sequel in the works so
1784000	1786000	And oh and then there's the
1786000	1788000	VR PlayStation VR
1788000	1790000	Which is probably some other
1790000	1792000	Game they just slapped Until Dawn's name on
1792000	1794000	Okay whatever whatever it just goes to show
1794000	1796000	But it shows that now the brand is successful
1796000	1798000	And if they can do something like that if that's what they're doing
1798000	1800000	But I think and I never really finished my point but I think
1800000	1802000	The whole social and the sharing and
1802000	1804000	All that was a big contributor to why
1804000	1806000	The game did so well I think
1806000	1808000	This game really owes a success
1808000	1810000	To Twitch, YouTube
1810000	1812000	And social play throughs
1838000	1840000	Thanks to that
1840000	1842000	And I think Sony knows that that's a good thing
1842000	1844000	I think it's Nintendo that has to be educated
1844000	1846000	A little more on that stuff but that's alright
1846000	1848000	Okay some comments from
1848000	1850000	Until Dawn in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
1850000	1852000	Wyland says I loved
1852000	1854000	Until Dawn
1854000	1856000	AkumaJP with another perspective saying
1856000	1858000	Until Dawn in Japan is not selling well
1858000	1860000	Censorship killed it
1860000	1862000	That's true you know a lot of times
1862000	1864000	We here are very envious of the things they
1864000	1866000	Get in Japan but Japan's version
1866000	1868000	Of Until Dawn was censored because
1868000	1870000	The violence is
1870000	1872000	You know not
1872000	1874000	As well received so they do some
1874000	1876000	Fade to black in some parts
1876000	1878000	Oh that's terrible
1878000	1880000	Yeah like there's one particular scene and it is really gross
1880000	1882000	And I would not want to see it anyway
1882000	1884000	But it fades to black
1884000	1886000	I wonder if it's the one they show you over and over and over again
1886000	1888000	After it happens in the previously vlogs
1888000	1890000	Yeah they do a lot of that previously stuff
1890000	1892000	I wonder what the previously would happen when you
1892000	1894000	In the previously because each chapter
1894000	1896000	Is like an episode
1896000	1898000	And on the like previously on
1898000	1900000	It kind of shows you the big decisions you make
1900000	1902000	And it always shows you the death that happened
1902000	1904000	Over and over again
1904000	1906000	It's kind of funny I mean like I said
1906000	1908000	The acting in a lot of places is over the top
1908000	1910000	But I think appropriate and fun
1910000	1912000	For a game like that sure
1912000	1914000	It's totally like it knows what it is
1914000	1916000	It doesn't try to take itself too seriously which I love
1916000	1918000	Fair enough let's go to Shane with your number
1918000	1920000	Two pick of
1920000	1922000	2015 and I'm so excited to hear
1922000	1924000	What you finally settled on
1924000	1926000	My number two pick is Until Dawn
1926000	1928000	You also picked Until Dawn
1928000	1930000	I did
1930000	1932000	And why did you pick Until Dawn
1932000	1934000	Because I love that game
1934000	1936000	The story is fantastic it's engaging
1936000	1938000	It's hilarious it's really creepy at times
1938000	1940000	I watch it
1940000	1942000	A lot still even
1942000	1944000	Now months later on Twitch
1944000	1946000	Just watching people play
1946000	1948000	Because it's like watching a fun movie
1948000	1950000	And it's neat to see
1950000	1952000	People's reactions
1952000	1954000	Or things people do differently that you didn't do
1954000	1956000	The first time you played through
1956000	1958000	The cast is great
1958000	1960000	The writing is there
1960000	1962000	I don't know if it's good or bad but it's definitely there
1962000	1964000	And I'm really excited for a sequel
1964000	1966000	Or whatever they do with the second one now
1966000	1968000	But aren't you a little worried that maybe
1968000	1970000	The sequel is not going to have the magic of this
1970000	1972000	First game because I mean
1972000	1974000	Part of why I think this first game was successful
1974000	1976000	Is because the bar was so low
1976000	1978000	Now the bar is going to be higher
1978000	1980000	And this may be a really unfair comparison
1980000	1982000	But the Blair Witch Project you remember that
1982000	1984000	Remember when that movie came out it was like the biggest
1984000	1986000	Fucking thing in cinema for like the year
1986000	1988000	And this whole like found footage phenomenon
1988000	1990000	And some people didn't know if it was real
1990000	1992000	Or not and all this
1992000	1994000	And then they made a sequel and it was god awful
1994000	1996000	But see the thing with Until Dawn is
1996000	1998000	Strip away this cast
1998000	2000000	And the lore around it
2000000	2002000	And keep that same formula and I'll be fine
2002000	2004000	That's all I need
2004000	2006000	Give me something just slightly different with new characters
2006000	2008000	That don't know what they're getting into
2008000	2010000	And we're good
2010000	2012000	But like they could stand to not show the same death scenes
2012000	2014000	Over and over again
2014000	2016000	In the previously on
2016000	2018000	Not that they're gross it's just like
2018000	2020000	The first time you see it's like oh my god I can't believe it
2020000	2022000	But like 30 minutes later when you've seen it four more times
2022000	2024000	Because they showed it to you again
2024000	2026000	Four more times you're like okay
2026000	2028000	I get it that person definitely
2028000	2030000	Is you know not alive anymore maybe
2030000	2032000	That person is very dead
2032000	2034000	Very very dead
2034000	2036000	Alright
2036000	2038000	And then going to our chat room with some comments
2038000	2040000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
2040000	2042000	Another comment on
2042000	2044000	Until Dawn, Wyland says
2044000	2046000	I think the sequel to Until Dawn should be something completely
2046000	2048000	New, make the series
2048000	2050000	In an anthology series
2050000	2052000	Well I don't want the
2052000	2054000	Same story, get rid of the
2054000	2056000	Characters too even though I'm gonna
2056000	2058000	Miss Mike a lot
2058000	2060000	I would like new characters
2060000	2062000	Alan Alchemy in
2062000	2064000	Chats making a little
2064000	2066000	Tongue and cheek reference to heavy censorship
2066000	2068000	In another country saying
2068000	2070000	Until Dawn in Australia is just them
2070000	2072000	Showing up to the cabin and having cocoa
2072000	2074000	And then it's like thank you for playing by
2074000	2076000	Because
2076000	2078000	That'd be kind of funny
2078000	2080000	That'd be it
2080000	2082000	That could be Until Dusk or something like that who knows
2082000	2084000	Anyway let's move on
2084000	2086000	Here it is
2086000	2088000	My number two pick of 2015
2088000	2090000	And it's actually one that's
2090000	2092000	Shown up on somebody else's list already
2092000	2094000	So we have a lot of consistency but my number two
2094000	2096000	Pick best game of 2015
2096000	2098000	Is Rocket League
2098000	2100000	I think Rocket League is
2100000	2102000	One of the best games of the year
2102000	2104000	It's actually the second best game of the year I believe
2104000	2106000	My favorite
2106000	2108000	And the reason why is I think a huge part of that
2108000	2110000	Is accessibility
2110000	2112000	Because a lot of people that don't
2112000	2114000	Really play a lot of games
2114000	2116000	I find are really drawn to
2116000	2118000	Rocket League because it's so stupidly simple
2118000	2120000	It's Mario Kart meets soccer
2120000	2122000	And everybody
2122000	2124000	You may not know a lot about soccer
2124000	2126000	But you know the general rules
2126000	2128000	Place ball in goal
2128000	2130000	Okay that's very easy
2130000	2132000	And then most people have played some type of racing game in their life
2132000	2134000	So it's a really
2134000	2136000	Stupidly simple concept
2136000	2138000	But then it has a lot of depth to it
2138000	2140000	With people doing the air trick shots
2140000	2142000	And the rolls and things like that
2142000	2144000	And the game looks great
2144000	2146000	And yeah
2146000	2148000	I have loved Rocket League
2148000	2150000	And I love that it's another
2150000	2152000	Indie success story of the year
2152000	2154000	Along right up there with Undertale
2154000	2156000	And a lot of the things we've mentioned previously
2156000	2158000	So that is why
2158000	2160000	I placed Rocket League number two
2160000	2162000	On my favorite games list
2162000	2164000	Tigerclaw in chat says
2164000	2166000	They released an update to Rocket League
2166000	2168000	That adds hockey mode
2168000	2170000	The ball turns into a giant puck
2170000	2172000	I heard about that but I haven't played it yet
2172000	2174000	I'm excited to check it out
2174000	2176000	Smaller ball, that was really hard
2176000	2178000	Oh my god
2178000	2180000	It's harder to hit
2180000	2182000	There's no way you're going to get an air trick on those things
2182000	2184000	Some people still did
2184000	2186000	It's easy to pick up
2186000	2188000	But it's so hard to master
2188000	2190000	But when you see someone that can master that game
2190000	2192000	I've been in a game where we lost 9-1 no problem
2192000	2194000	One player on their team just has
2194000	2196000	Ultimate control, it's insane
2196000	2198000	Kaijuto in chat says
2198000	2200000	That game needs planes, then I'd buy it
2200000	2202000	I could see it happening
2202000	2204000	You can fly in that game
2204000	2206000	You get a full thing of boost
2206000	2208000	You do a little jump, you can boost in the air
2208000	2210000	You can really take off, I did it in practice
2210000	2212000	It's just so hard to do in actual game play
2212000	2214000	It would make a lot of sense to have planes in the game
2214000	2216000	But then I think it would be too hard
2216000	2218000	It's hard enough to play with the ball in three dimensions anyway
2218000	2220000	Planes is going to make it really hard
2220000	2222000	Alright
2222000	2224000	Here it is
2224000	2226000	The moment you've all been waiting for
2226000	2228000	The number one
2228000	2230000	Most favoritest game
2230000	2232000	Of 2015
2232000	2234000	From Dark Sakura
2234000	2236000	You know what this is
2236000	2238000	I have a good feeling, but what is it Dark Sakura?
2238000	2240000	Dragon Age Inquisition
2240000	2242000	For all of the DLC that came out this year
2242000	2244000	Fair enough
2244000	2246000	Even though it was a release from last year
2246000	2248000	Don't care
2248000	2250000	It's been made new again for DLC this year
2250000	2252000	Because the DLCs by themselves have been
2252000	2254000	Pretty crazy and new adventures
2254000	2256000	And stuff and it's just added
2256000	2258000	So much more to the game
2258000	2260000	Dragon Age Inquisition game of the year edition
2260000	2262000	This year which had all that DLC in it
2262000	2264000	Yeah I paid for all of it
2264000	2266000	Of course you did
2266000	2268000	Trespasser if you
2268000	2270000	Were romancing Solas
2270000	2272000	Is like hi I didn't need my heart anymore
2272000	2274000	Step on it and set it on fire
2274000	2276000	And then shit on it
2276000	2278000	Hahahaha
2278000	2280000	However if you're romancing
2280000	2282000	Cullen then ahhhh
2282000	2284000	Nice
2284000	2286000	So are you excited about the future
2286000	2288000	Of Dragon Age? I mean I know we've got another
2288000	2290000	Mass effect cycle
2290000	2292000	To get through before we get there but
2292000	2294000	Eventually
2294000	2296000	Yeah you know they're going to do another one because they pretty much
2296000	2298000	How can they not?
2298000	2300000	I know the ending there
2300000	2302000	Yeah they're going to have to do more
2302000	2304000	And Inquisition I'm sure sold plenty
2304000	2306000	The Inquisition
2306000	2308000	Alright well nobody expects
2308000	2310000	The Dragon Age Inquisition on Dark Sakura's list
2310000	2312000	But there it is
2312000	2314000	Number one
2314000	2316000	Well I thought you would go
2316000	2318000	From this year and I thought you might pick the game
2318000	2320000	That I'm going to pick but I guess not
2320000	2322000	Alright we'll see
2322000	2324000	Let's move on
2324000	2326000	Most favoriteist
2326000	2328000	Flaco Jones number one
2328000	2330000	This is going to be such a surprise
2330000	2332000	5 million people hinging
2332000	2334000	5 million people
2334000	2336000	It's almost as many people that follow me on Twitter
2336000	2338000	And all those people know
2338000	2340000	That all I ever talk about is Splatoon
2340000	2342000	Not only is it my favorite game of the year
2342000	2344000	But it's one of my favorite games of all time
2344000	2346000	I just love it that much
2346000	2348000	It's the best Wii U game
2348000	2350000	I have a blast playing it all the time
2350000	2352000	I don't know what else to say about it
2352000	2354000	I think it's a near perfect game
2354000	2356000	Thank god someone took a chance on a new IP
2356000	2358000	Exactly
2358000	2360000	And it was Nintendo of all people
2360000	2362000	I mean
2362000	2364000	I guess all three games
2364000	2366000	Rocket League is not a new IP
2366000	2368000	But the other two are new IP
2368000	2370000	Yeah so
2370000	2372000	It's just a great game
2372000	2374000	Again it's one of those kind of easy to pick up
2374000	2376000	Hard to master
2376000	2378000	You can just have a fun time
2378000	2380000	Just playing turf wars all you want or you can really get into ranked mode
2380000	2382000	Which I didn't think I would do originally
2382000	2384000	Because I don't like shooters
2384000	2386000	But I started playing this and it's like
2386000	2388000	I'll test out ranked mode and suddenly I'm getting better
2388000	2390000	And I start looking stuff up online
2390000	2392000	How the gear works
2392000	2394000	The special stats you get for each piece
2394000	2396000	And then I went from just like
2396000	2398000	Oh I'm just going to play rollers
2398000	2400000	I'm going to shoot all the time
2400000	2402000	It's just a great game
2402000	2404000	For someone who doesn't like shooters
2404000	2406000	It still worked out really well for me
2406000	2408000	When I'm not in a mode of
2408000	2410000	I can't just splat everybody
2410000	2412000	Or kill everybody
2412000	2414000	I can just paint
2414000	2416000	And help out my team that way
2416000	2418000	Or help out my team in support ways
2418000	2420000	There are some guns that work better at support
2420000	2422000	I've done all the research on this stuff
2422000	2424000	I'm always in all the different community boards
2424000	2426000	And the reddit stuff
2426000	2428000	Tower controls right now
2428000	2430000	Bye guys!
2430000	2432000	And I do like
2432000	2434000	That this game
2434000	2436000	Has kept itself relevant
2436000	2438000	You can make fun of Nintendo
2438000	2440000	For only having 2 or 3 Wii U games
2440000	2442000	This year
2442000	2444000	But they've supported those games really well
2444000	2446000	With these frequent updates
2446000	2448000	We're constantly talking about Splatoon
2448000	2450000	Here on OLR because they did this splat fest
2450000	2452000	And now we have an entire
2452000	2454000	Internet war breaking out
2454000	2456000	About planes vs cars
2456000	2458000	Or what was the other
2458000	2460000	There was one where like
2460000	2462000	Our vs science was right down the middle
2462000	2464000	Right down the middle
2464000	2466000	51-49 on both counts
2466000	2468000	There was one I swear to god I said to act deaf
2468000	2470000	Fucking fight me
2470000	2472000	Pizza vs hamburgers
2472000	2474000	Cats vs dogs
2474000	2476000	That was a big one
2476000	2478000	Pirates and Ninjas was the one that really
2478000	2480000	Toured the internet up
2480000	2482000	Because ninjas were so
2482000	2484000	Popular but popularity is really
2484000	2486000	A curse in that game because it kind of hurts your team
2486000	2488000	And so
2488000	2490000	They lost because what counts more
2490000	2492000	Than anything is winning which I think
2492000	2494000	Kind of is the way it should be it wasn't originally that way
2494000	2496000	That's why
2496000	2498000	That's why dogs won
2498000	2500000	Even though the cats won way more games
2500000	2502000	The dogs won the splat fest because they were more popular
2502000	2504000	Well that's not really fun like the most popular
2504000	2506000	Team just wins without having to play
2506000	2508000	Well but I kind of see now why it was
2508000	2510000	That way I wish there was a little bit more of a
2511000	2513000	But in the end just win more games
2513000	2515000	That's what's important
2515000	2517000	A lot of people in chat lighting up about Splatoon
2517000	2519000	Kai Judo says Splatoon is the bestest of the best of the best
2519000	2521000	That's an exact quote
2521000	2524000	Act deaf says Splatoon is my number two game of the year
2524000	2526000	Some people talking about the recent Naughty vs Nights
2526000	2528000	Nice splat fest that went on
2528000	2533000	Vid Power says Splatoon is a post-apocalyptic world I'd like to live in
2536000	2538000	And even the little story that they tacked on there
2538000	2540000	It's kind of fun too if you read all the behind the scenes
2540000	2542000	Like the sunken scrolls and all that stuff
2542000	2544000	It's kind of weird like what's going on
2544000	2546000	Back there with the squid people
2546000	2548000	It's kind of creepy
2548000	2550000	Alright
2550000	2552000	Shane your turn here it is drum roll please
2552000	2555000	Your number one game of 2015 is
2555000	2557000	I want to say first that
2557000	2559000	Had I beat
2559000	2561000	Soma and Xenoblade Chronicles X
2561000	2563000	I'm pretty sure my list would be different
2563000	2565000	From my top three
2565000	2567000	We'll get to honorable mentions in a minute
2567000	2569000	Well then I didn't say that
2569000	2571000	But for my number one
2571000	2573000	It's Splatoon
2573000	2575000	Because I play it so freaking much
2575000	2578000	And despite the fact I have problems with a lot of things about it
2578000	2580000	Like the matchmaking is terrible
2580000	2582000	Absolutely awful
2582000	2584000	The splat fest
2584000	2586000	The way they do it I don't like it either
2586000	2588000	Because if you like
2588000	2590000	We were just talking about if you pick the more popular team
2590000	2592000	You're pretty much guaranteed to lose at this point
2592000	2594000	And I think that's dumb
2594000	2596000	And that actually goes back to the matchmaking
2596000	2598000	But
2598000	2600000	I get so pumped up when I'm playing
2600000	2602000	I just have such a good time
2602000	2604000	Nintendo really hit it out of the park
2604000	2606000	With this new IP
2606000	2608000	And I really hope
2608000	2610000	That we get a Splatoon 2
2610000	2612000	On NX as a launch title
2612000	2614000	Because then you don't need any other games after that
2614000	2616000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says
2616000	2618000	Shane's best game is PT
2618000	2620000	You know we talked about that
2620000	2622000	Yeah that was last year
2622000	2624000	Yeah we talked about this
2624000	2626000	It would be funny if PT was your top game this year
2626000	2627000	And last year
2627000	2628000	You can't do that
2628000	2629000	I know you can't
2629000	2630000	Well DarkSakura did actually
2630000	2632000	She just did it
2632000	2634000	Except mine had new content out this year
2634000	2635000	That is true
2635000	2637000	And mine just got removed from the Playstation store
2637000	2639000	Actually
2639000	2641000	YYR said he was able to download it
2641000	2643000	Yeah there's some new technique
2643000	2645000	Yeah you can get it again
2645000	2647000	Like literally
2647000	2649000	In the span of a year
2649000	2651000	Literally everybody hates
2651000	2653000	Everybody hates a company they used to love
2653000	2655000	In that game
2655000	2657000	In large part
2657000	2659000	But back to Splatoon
2659000	2661000	Splatoon is just so much fun
2661000	2663000	You can't stop playing it
2663000	2665000	You play with Flaco Jones online a lot
2665000	2667000	Oh yeah
2667000	2669000	Twin Squad
2669000	2671000	Because you can't do anything more than Twin
2671000	2673000	Or else you get screwed over
2673000	2675000	Because of their matchmaking system
2675000	2677000	Oh my god Nintendo learn online stuff finally please
2677000	2679000	Because it would really go a long way
2679000	2681000	Yeah the trisquads are the worst
2681000	2683000	Splatoon is so bad
2683000	2685000	You're just against an organized team
2685000	2687000	Yeah that's not so bad
2687000	2689000	But yeah Trisquad why can't they just throw in an extra person
2689000	2691000	An extra body helps
2691000	2693000	Or why
2693000	2695000	Do I have to play on Splatfest
2695000	2697000	If I accidentally pick the most popular team
2697000	2699000	Why do I have to just play with my own people
2699000	2701000	Why can't I just wait for another match
2701000	2703000	Against the other team so I can actually contribute
2703000	2705000	To the wins losses
2705000	2707000	For my team
2707000	2709000	To try to win Splatfest
2709000	2711000	Why as you know not a very high ranked person
2711000	2713000	In ranked mode are you throwing S's
2713000	2715000	And S pluses at me
2715000	2717000	When you know I can
2717000	2719000	Barely hold my own sometimes against like
2719000	2721000	A minuses
2721000	2723000	So even though it's your favorite game there are still plenty of things
2723000	2725000	Oh yeah there's a lot of things wrong with that game
2725000	2727000	But it doesn't stop me from playing hours
2727000	2729000	A day
2729000	2731000	Well it's my turn
2731000	2733000	My favorite game of the year and guess what
2733000	2735000	You guys I picked a game that's
2735000	2737000	On the Wii U
2737000	2739000	My favorite game of the year
2739000	2741000	I really think
2741000	2743000	Is it Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival
2743000	2745000	I almost named it because it's fun
2745000	2747000	It was close no
2747000	2749000	My favorite game of the year is Super Mario Maker
2749000	2751000	I think is the best thing
2751000	2753000	That's happened to gaming this year
2753000	2755000	And I think because
2755000	2757000	There's so much
2757000	2759000	That kind of little big planet
2759000	2761000	Kind of started
2761000	2763000	But I think the trouble that little big planet had
2763000	2765000	In a way is that it was a new universe
2765000	2767000	And something that was completely new
2767000	2769000	And it almost had
2769000	2771000	A level of over complication
2771000	2773000	With a lot of the stuff they added later
2773000	2775000	Now don't get me wrong I'm pretty sure little big planet
2775000	2777000	Was my favorite game of the year whatever year it came out
2777000	2779000	And it still is a fantastic
2779000	2781000	Series but I think what I really love
2781000	2783000	About Super Mario Maker is that it took a formula
2783000	2785000	Literally anybody that's ever
2785000	2787000	Touched a video game knows
2787000	2789000	And really opened it up
2789000	2791000	For people to create anything
2791000	2793000	And you know we started off
2793000	2795000	This year talking a lot about
2795000	2797000	Creation and you know we've heard
2797000	2799000	The saga of Loki's game and
2799000	2801000	Lord knows if he's going to finish it or not
2801000	2803000	But he's apparently really pushing to get something out by the end of the year
2803000	2805000	And you know we saw some of the
2805000	2807000	Results of what happened with the VoG jam
2807000	2809000	Earlier this year we were talking a lot about
2809000	2811000	Creating your own game
2811000	2813000	And those experiences and I think Super Mario Maker
2813000	2815000	I think really bookends that
2815000	2817000	Because you take something
2817000	2819000	Pretty much every gamer out there knows
2819000	2821000	And yet you learn a lot about
2821000	2823000	Game creation through the things that you go through
2823000	2825000	Online with the game
2825000	2827000	Like I gotta say for me
2827000	2829000	What a trip it is to watch
2829000	2831000	Somebody else play your level
2831000	2833000	On Twitch or YouTube
2833000	2835000	And do things with it that you
2835000	2837000	Weren't expecting them to do
2837000	2839000	You know and I think that social element
2839000	2841000	We talked about this before with Until Dawn
2841000	2843000	I think that social element and I wish Nintendo
2843000	2845000	Would get on board with this a little more and I think
2845000	2847000	I get the sense they're starting to warm up to it more and more
2847000	2849000	But I think the social element has really
2849000	2851000	Sky-rocketed something like Super Mario Maker
2851000	2853000	To just
2853000	2855000	Like its own
2855000	2857000	Genre in a way
2857000	2859000	It's just crazy what an impact that game has had
2859000	2861000	And I love that the game has been continually
2861000	2863000	Supported with regular updates
2863000	2865000	Be it the new costume characters you can put in the game
2865000	2867000	Some of the new things they've been putting in the levels
2867000	2869000	Like the checkpoints and so forth
2869000	2871000	I mean Nintendo
2871000	2873000	God bless them they've only put out like three games this year
2873000	2875000	On the Wii U but they have supported those games
2875000	2877000	So so so well
2877000	2879000	That it really is like a model that other
2879000	2881000	Companies should probably look at for
2881000	2883000	The way they support their games
2883000	2885000	So yeah I just
2885000	2887000	I can't not
2887000	2889000	Say that Super Mario Maker is
2889000	2891000	It's my favorite game of the year absolutely
2891000	2893000	Just all the experiences
2893000	2895000	Just the other day one more quick story about the game
2895000	2897000	Just the other day I was playing
2897000	2899000	It and I was doing some of the random courses
2899000	2901000	The eight stage
2901000	2903000	Course which is on easy right
2903000	2905000	So you get a lot of like auto
2905000	2907000	Play courses and you get a lot of really
2907000	2909000	Dippy courses
2909000	2911000	But one course kind of struck me a little bit
2911000	2913000	And that was it was a
2913000	2915000	A French player had made the course
2915000	2917000	Because you can see their little country flag
2917000	2919000	And it was something and I don't speak
2919000	2921000	French but it was basically
2921000	2923000	Paris Je t'aime or something like
2923000	2925000	Paris we love you type of thing
2925000	2927000	And it was obviously something that was made in
2927000	2929000	Response to the tragedy
2929000	2931000	That happened in Paris and it was
2931000	2933000	An auto play course but it went through
2933000	2935000	Like this Eiffel Tower scene
2935000	2937000	That was made out of coins and I
2937000	2939000	Think you know they had some other landmarks
2939000	2941000	That were there as well and it was like
2941000	2943000	Spelled out and I just I was
2943000	2945000	Kind of taken aback by
2945000	2947000	We have all these arguments
2947000	2949000	About our video games art
2949000	2951000	And what is art? Art
2951000	2953000	Is expression right it's a way
2953000	2955000	Of expressing yourself
2955000	2957000	Somebody chose to
2957000	2959000	In response to what happened
2959000	2961000	In their country this horrible
2961000	2963000	Horrible thing that happened they chose
2963000	2965000	To express their feelings
2965000	2967000	In a video game
2967000	2969000	And not a lot of games
2969000	2971000	Have brought it to us on that
2971000	2973000	Level yes I know about other construction
2973000	2975000	Sets hell there were things like you know pinball
2975000	2977000	Construction set back in the 80s and we've
2977000	2979000	We've had games where you can make other games
2979000	2981000	But I don't think we've ever had
2981000	2983000	Something on that level of
2983000	2985000	Mario where you can
2985000	2987000	Do that so I was just really taken aback that
2987000	2989000	You know somebody went to
2989000	2991000	Mario maker to express their
2991000	2993000	Feelings it was just like it was a really
2993000	2995000	Neat thing to see even if it wasn't
2995000	2997000	The greatest level per
2997000	2999000	Say because I didn't play it was just auto
2999000	3001000	I was just like wow this is this is
3001000	3003000	Art video games are totally
3003000	3005000	Art and this is this is
3005000	3007000	What it is so
3007000	3009000	Looking at our chat room over at
3009000	3011000	Live dot vog network dot com
3011000	3013000	Tiger kalon chat says I
3013000	3015000	Just played some super mario maker today
3015000	3017000	I played the new levels that were created
3017000	3019000	By some of you guys
3019000	3021000	And ikuma
3021000	3023000	Jp says maybe it's time to get a wii u
3023000	3025000	You know we're gonna talk about
3025000	3027000	Honorable
3027000	3029000	Mentions in a minute here but I saw
3029000	3031000	A configuration I was really thinking
3031000	3033000	Through the games this year I saw
3033000	3035000	A configuration where easily my number
3035000	3037000	One two and three games could have all been wii u
3037000	3039000	Games I mean really
3039000	3041000	And it's it's kind of close
3041000	3043000	For for
3043000	3045000	Some of you guys I'm sure
3045000	3047000	Let's see also going to chat over at live dot vog network dot com
3047000	3049000	DarkTetsuya says
3049000	3051000	I know I saw a level like that when Satoru
3051000	3053000	Iwata passed away someone
3053000	3055000	Did a tribute level to him and I remember
3055000	3057000	Playing it over the fall season
3057000	3059000	So there you go
3059000	3061000	Some other comments there on the
3061000	3063000	Art that is super mario maker my favorite game
3063000	3065000	Of 2015 so there it is so
3065000	3067000	A lot of overlaps on our list
3067000	3069000	But I think those are some good
3069000	3071000	Lists you guys does anybody want to take a second
3071000	3073000	And I'll just open the floor to general
3073000	3075000	Comments does anyone want to take a second to call out honorable
3075000	3077000	Mentions any honorable
3077000	3079000	Mentions things that you were really going back and forth on
3079000	3081000	Mario maker was a consideration
3081000	3083000	And I thought that might end up being your game
3083000	3085000	But I it wasn't my
3085000	3087000	Favorite I didn't really play a whole bunch of it
3087000	3089000	Um Dan played it a lot more
3089000	3091000	Than I did um
3093000	3095000	There was and it's actually more of a
3095000	3097000	Hack but Dan was playing this today tech mobile
3097000	3099000	2015 uh huh
3099000	3101000	Um that's basically
3101000	3103000	Just takes like tech mobile and hacked in like
3103000	3105000	Modern teams sure and their
3105000	3107000	Players and what not it was kind of funny to watch them play
3107000	3109000	It yeah um
3111000	3113000	I really I really am happy with the ones
3113000	3115000	That I picked especially since you know the new
3115000	3117000	Content for dragon age really kept
3117000	3119000	It like um you know
3119000	3121000	Like another chapter of the game you know
3121000	3123000	And it was all content from this year
3123000	3125000	So I was pretty happy with that
3125000	3127000	Uh look at our chat over at
3127000	3129000	Live.vognetwork.com William murder face
3129000	3131000	And chat says what did you think about Witcher 3
3131000	3133000	You know I have to be honest as
3133000	3135000	Gorgeous as the game is as I was playing
3135000	3137000	Through it I just didn't get to really
3137000	3139000	Spend enough quality time with the game and like I said
3139000	3141000	When we started this segment the reason why
3141000	3143000	We call it our favorite and not the best
3143000	3145000	Is because
3145000	3147000	We don't have time to play everything and I just did not
3147000	3149000	Get to sink the hours into Witcher 3 that it
3149000	3151000	Probably deserved probably because
3151000	3153000	Of the exact same time one of my honorable
3153000	3155000	Mention games I was playing a ton of
3155000	3157000	And that would be Final Fantasy Heavensward
3157000	3159000	And a big part of the reason I really didn't
3159000	3161000	Feel comfortable putting that in my top 3 is
3161000	3163000	A. Expansions fall in a really
3163000	3165000	Weird place I think I put the Diablo 3
3165000	3167000	Expansion in one year but that
3167000	3169000	Just changed the game fundamentally
3169000	3171000	Heavensward has had a weak follow up
3171000	3173000	Uh it's having a lot of problems right now
3173000	3175000	In some of the patching content but I think the
3175000	3177000	Initial game
3177000	3179000	That came out with the voice acting
3179000	3181000	The dungeon design the music
3181000	3183000	Was really just
3183000	3185000	A premier MMO
3185000	3187000	Experience and it kind of sucks that it's
3187000	3189000	It's having some problems here a few months out
3189000	3191000	But I think because that game
3191000	3193000	Was sucking down like all my time
3193000	3195000	I don't really think I got to give
3195000	3197000	Witcher 3 a fair break
3197000	3199000	What about some other honorable mentions from you guys?
3199000	3201000	Any? Well I said Soma
3201000	3203000	Just because I'm pretty sure I would end up
3203000	3205000	Loving the story if I finished it
3205000	3207000	Xenoblade honestly I've put so much time
3207000	3209000	Into Xenoblade Chronicles
3209000	3211000	X has amazing music
3211000	3213000	I don't care what people say the story is really
3213000	3215000	Good it takes a little bit to get into especially if
3215000	3217000	You are somebody that likes exploring
3217000	3219000	Open worlds which I usually don't by doing this
3219000	3221000	Game but
3221000	3223000	I can see it easily becoming my
3223000	3225000	Number one for this year
3225000	3227000	I will say Xenoblade was really close
3227000	3229000	For me and one of those 1, 2, 3 configurations
3229000	3231000	Would have had Xenoblade on it but I just
3231000	3233000	Felt the hurdle
3233000	3235000	You have to get through in the beginning is too great
3235000	3237000	And it just kept
3237000	3239000	That off me and you heard me express this
3239000	3241000	On the show previously I love
3241000	3243000	Where I'm at now in the game and I think
3243000	3245000	There is a lot to really love about
3245000	3247000	Xenoblade but you really
3247000	3249000	Have to work at it I think to
3249000	3251000	Love it and I think a really great
3251000	3253000	Game you shouldn't have to work at it
3253000	3255000	And the only other game I would have considered
3255000	3257000	Probably because I just haven't
3257000	3259000	Played it enough yet because when I
3259000	3261000	Got it I was definitely
3261000	3263000	On a lot of painkillers was
3263000	3265000	Rise of the Tomb Raider
3265000	3267000	And because I haven't played
3267000	3269000	Enough of it I can't really say
3269000	3271000	I think I see it on a lot of people's lists
3271000	3273000	I'm pretty sure I'd put it on mine too
3273000	3275000	Yeah I honestly have not gotten around
3275000	3277000	To playing it yet just too much other stuff
3277000	3279000	Going on Flaco
3279000	3281000	Yeah like I mentioned Tearaway Unfolded was really
3281000	3283000	Cool on PS4 and it did a lot of stuff
3283000	3285000	Different than the Vita version but since the Vita version
3285000	3287000	Is better I was like I'll still knock that one down
3287000	3289000	I mean it's definitely a different game
3289000	3291000	And they change a lot and they actually make it a lot harder
3291000	3293000	And then let's see
3293000	3295000	Yoshi's Woolly World
3295000	3297000	Liked that game a lot
3297000	3299000	Cracked top 3 there
3299000	3301000	And the other game that's definitely
3301000	3303000	Right on the border top 3 is
3303000	3305000	Jackbox Party Pack 2
3305000	3307000	We just talked at the top of the show
3307000	3309000	Bomb Corp alone is like
3309000	3311000	I think is worthy of being in that top 5
3311000	3313000	Of my favorite games of the year
3313000	3315000	So I just add in
3315000	3317000	With Quiplash XL which is amazing
3317000	3319000	And that's it
3319000	3321000	Earwax is not good
3321000	3323000	Earwax is great and Fibbage is just Fibbage
3323000	3325000	It's great so
3325000	3327000	I guess that's the one
3327000	3329000	That's why it wouldn't crack the top 3
3329000	3331000	Not every game on it is good
3331000	3333000	I kind of wanted to put as my number 1
3333000	3335000	ResVR but
3335000	3337000	I've only played one stage
3337000	3339000	You did play it
3339000	3341000	But I didn't beat it
3341000	3343000	Because they wouldn't let you beat it
3343000	3345000	If they would have let me sit there and play all the stages
3345000	3347000	I would have gladly done that
3347000	3349000	Alright
3349000	3351000	Let's see
3351000	3353000	The only other honorable mention I did come very close to putting
3353000	3355000	In the top 3 but Shane I think you outlined all the issues beautifully
3355000	3357000	With Splatoon
3357000	3359000	Well I think your issue with Splatoon is
3359000	3361000	You just stick to a roller and you don't try anything
3361000	3363000	I have tried the other stuff and I don't like it
3363000	3365000	Just not enough
3365000	3367000	You've seen me play the other stuff and you even said
3367000	3369000	You should probably go back to roller
3369000	3371000	I probably did
3371000	3373000	I think that game also
3373000	3375000	If you get frustrated really easily
3375000	3377000	You probably shouldn't be playing it either
3377000	3379000	The matchmaking thing really bugs me
3379000	3381000	I mean come on
3382000	3384000	They did improve matchmaking
3384000	3386000	With the last patch though
3386000	3388000	And that's sad that it's improved and it's still really bad
3388000	3390000	No it wasn't because I only played
3390000	3392000	Even though there was a huge difference in the popularity
3392000	3394000	I only played my own team once
3394000	3396000	And there was the exact same disparities
3396000	3398000	That's why I didn't think there was one
3398000	3400000	And I followed another streamer
3400000	3402000	And he only played the other team once
3402000	3404000	I think they've gotten better with that
3404000	3406000	The game missed my top 3 narrowly
3406000	3408000	It's not a bad game by any means
3408000	3410000	But I do have some issues that made me go
3410000	3412000	I liked it as much as the 3 that I did choose
3412000	3414000	The matchmaking has gotten a lot better
3414000	3416000	That last Splatfest was definitely true
3416000	3418000	That's good
3418000	3420000	So just to recap real quick
3420000	3422000	Running down the 3-2-1 real quick
3422000	3424000	Dark Sakura 3-2-1 was
3424000	3426000	Undertale, Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer
3426000	3428000	And Dragon Age Inquisition
3428000	3430000	All the DLC that came out
3430000	3432000	Flaco 3-2-1 was
3432000	3434000	Rocket League
3434000	3436000	Until Dawn and Splatoon
3436000	3438000	And Shane, pretty similar
3438000	3440000	I thought you were going to say 3-2-1
3440000	3442000	I was going to say contact
3442000	3444000	Gotcha
3444000	3446000	Yeah, everybody's gone to the rapture
3446000	3448000	Until Dawn and Splatoon
3448000	3450000	And mine was everybody's gone to the rapture
3450000	3452000	Rocket League
3452000	3454000	And Super Mario Maker
3454000	3456000	Which was not on anybody else's list
3456000	3458000	How does that happen?
3458000	3460000	What? You didn't like it?
3460000	3462000	Oh my god
3462000	3464000	I don't own it either
3464000	3466000	My list was all new IPs
3466000	3468000	Just saying
3468000	3470000	Take that everybody
3470000	3472000	Let's see
3472000	3474000	Wait, Rocket League
3474000	3476000	It's a sequel
3476000	3478000	And Mario Maker is definitely not a new IP
3478000	3480000	It's kind of Mario
3480000	3482000	Fair enough
3482000	3484000	Not that anyone played the original Rocket League
3484000	3486000	Or Mario
3486000	3488000	That's it
3488000	3490000	I hope you guys enjoyed that
3490000	3492000	We're going to get to some of your picks a little later
3492000	3494000	In the FUGL question of the week
3494000	3496000	Ingress will catch up with Loki and his top 3 games of the year
3496000	3498000	Does anybody want to?
3498000	3500000	He might be listening out there, I doubt he is
3500000	3502000	But does anybody want to guess?
3502000	3504000	Because I feel like last year we were in the same situation
3504000	3506000	I think he was gone over the holiday show
3506000	3508000	And we guessed
3508000	3510000	And we were close
3510000	3512000	Loki's top 3
3512000	3514000	I would guess Ingress
3514000	3516000	Which I'm going to give him so much hell about
3516000	3518000	He would not put that on there
3518000	3520000	I think he will, I think he's going to put Ingress
3520000	3522000	But it didn't come
3522000	3524000	But mine had new content this year
3524000	3526000	And it was the content that was on my top of the list
3526000	3528000	They do upgrade Ingress
3528000	3530000	I still feel like
3530000	3532000	All this aside
3532000	3534000	I think the way the rules are set
3534000	3536000	He's going to put Ingress in there
3536000	3538000	He's put a lot of time into that
3538000	3540000	I think he will put Fallout in there as well
3540000	3542000	Mario Maker
3542000	3544000	That would be 3
3544000	3546000	Is there a new Grand Theft Auto?
3546000	3548000	Not this year
3548000	3550000	Grand Theft Auto again
3550000	3552000	There was a new Earth Defense Force
3552000	3554000	But it didn't sound like he liked it
3554000	3556000	There was something else he was playing this year
3556000	3558000	I wish I could remember what it was
3558000	3560000	There was one other game
3560000	3562000	I can't remember now
3562000	3564000	Lego, he might put the Lego game he's been playing with his son in
3564000	3566000	A lot, I wonder if he put that in
3566000	3568000	I don't know
3568000	3570000	Going to our chat over at
3570000	3572000	live.vognetwork.com
3572000	3574000	Kostan in chat says
3574000	3576000	And like I expected, no one picked the Talos principle
3576000	3578000	Never played it
3578000	3580000	Well to be fair, that was a
3580000	3582000	Last year game
3582000	3584000	It is on PS4 now
3584000	3586000	I thought about it
3586000	3588000	Bobby picked that as his game of the year
3588000	3590000	Last year I think
3590000	3592000	There is some love for that game over at VOG
3592000	3594000	And it is on my Steam wishlist, I hope to get to it soon
3594000	3596000	I played it at an expo
3596000	3598000	One of the expos I was at
3598000	3600000	I want to say it was running on the Rift
3600000	3602000	Or one of those VR things, I could be completely wrong
3602000	3604000	But I just feel like
3604000	3606000	That's how I experienced that game
3606000	3608000	That's like a whole other category
3608000	3610000	Games I wish I had played
3610000	3612000	That probably would have been on my list
3612000	3614000	Like for me Tomb Raider, I don't have an Xbox One
3614000	3616000	Or uh, gosh what's the one I just had
3616000	3618000	Killer Instinct season 2 would have been a good one too
3618000	3620000	I really enjoyed season 2 of Killer Instinct
3620000	3622000	Life is Strange is another game
3622000	3624000	I think I would really like
3624000	3626000	I just haven't gotten around to it
3626000	3628000	And now I'm seeing the disc release is going to come out January
3628000	3630000	I might just wait for that
3630000	3632000	And then AkumaJP suggesting Minecraft
3632000	3634000	For Loki, well there is Minecraft story mode
3634000	3636000	But I feel like Loki kind of dissed that a little bit
3636000	3638000	So we'll see
3638000	3640000	He said something about the voice acting he didn't care for
3640000	3642000	Yeah, so we'll see
3642000	3644000	We'll get the results from Loki next week
3644000	3646000	When he's back on the show
3646000	3648000	Alright, let's get into our gaming week
3648000	3650000	So getting back to a little more recently
3650000	3652000	Let's talk about the video games that we have been playing this week
3652000	3654000	We always like to start off the show after our kickoff topic
3654000	3656000	Which, well we have a long kickoff topic tonight
3656000	3658000	But with good reason
3658000	3660000	The news this week
3660000	3662000	Is a little light
3662000	3664000	You guys are going to split up Loki's stories right?
3664000	3666000	I don't know if Flaco even knew that
3666000	3668000	Ok, good
3668000	3670000	I tried to say it really quickly, quietly
3670000	3672000	Ok, good
3672000	3674000	Otherwise I guess I'm going to have to read them
3674000	3676000	So anyway, we're going to get to some news
3676000	3678000	But the news as you can imagine is a little bit lighter this week
3678000	3680000	Although there were some big events
3680000	3682000	But we do like to start off before we get into the news
3682000	3684000	Talking about our gaming weeks
3684000	3686000	And the types of video games we have been playing
3686000	3688000	This week specifically
3688000	3690000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
3690000	3692000	Kind of busy
3692000	3694000	Even though I was actually busy with many other things
3694000	3696000	I didn't play any Dragon Age this week
3696000	3698000	Wow
3698000	3700000	I played Happy Home Designer, which I'm still super loving
3700000	3702000	I got Catlateral Damage
3702000	3704000	Which I haven't played yet
3704000	3706000	But downloaded
3706000	3708000	And then we've just been playing all kinds of old school stuff
3708000	3710000	On the
3710000	3712000	The Everdrives
3712000	3718000	I did download a bunch of stuff I had wanted to try on iOS
3718000	3722000	So I was playing some R-Type the other day
3722000	3724000	Which I love R-Type so much
3724000	3726000	And I got Hearthstone
3726000	3728000	I started it off and then I realized that I had to
3728000	3730000	Because I have a new iPhone
3730000	3732000	I had to bring
3732000	3734000	Open up my old one
3734000	3736000	Get my authenticator code
3736000	3738000	And start my authenticator
3738000	3740000	So I'm considering actually starting off Hearthstone
3740000	3742000	Like 50 million other people I work with
3742000	3744000	Play Hearthstone
3744000	3746000	That's a good toilet game
3746000	3750000	I did also take Diablo 3 off of my PC
3750000	3752000	Gasp
3752000	3754000	In order to make room for
3754000	3756000	The Star Wars MMO
3756000	3758000	But Diablo 3
3758000	3760000	Although Old Republic is pretty good too
3760000	3762000	But you just need a bigger hard drive
3762000	3764000	You need a bigger hard drive
3764000	3766000	Even though
3766000	3768000	That goes without saying
3768000	3770000	But the other thing though
3770000	3772000	Is that I'm going to be starting back into Final Fantasy 14
3772000	3774000	As a usual Wednesday night thing for myself
3774000	3776000	So
3776000	3778000	Trying to rework some stuff
3778000	3780000	And I've got
3780000	3782000	A design project to do
3782000	3784000	So my gaming time is going to get kind of
3784000	3786000	Narrowed down a bit
3786000	3788000	I think this is the time when a lot of people
3788000	3790000	Are thinking about the 2016
3790000	3792000	Like what am I going to do in games this year
3792000	3794000	And then they'll completely
3794000	3796000	At least I did
3796000	3798000	I don't think I did any of the things I talked about
3798000	3800000	I was going to do in games
3800000	3802000	You know what I'm going to do in 2016?
3802000	3804000	Live
3804000	3806000	That's a good goal
3806000	3808000	Yeah my resolution
3808000	3810000	For 2016 is
3810000	3812000	Not getting hit by a bus
3812000	3814000	Or getting cancer
3814000	3816000	Well good luck
3816000	3818000	To you in that
3818000	3820000	I'd say those are pretty good resolutions
3820000	3822000	Alright well good luck
3822000	3824000	Moving on let's go to Flaco
3824000	3826000	How was your gaming week?
3826000	3828000	My gaming week was pretty good
3828000	3830000	Recently on the Playstation sale
3830000	3832000	I got Parappa 2
3832000	3834000	Which I'm terrible at
3834000	3836000	You know the PS2 classic one
3836000	3838000	I'm just bad at rhythm games
3838000	3840000	That's what Shane had me do and it works much better
3840000	3842000	I tried
3842000	3844000	It wouldn't let me mess with him
3844000	3846000	I don't know if that's set on game it kind of just stays on
3846000	3848000	Okay I have a Samsung TV
3848000	3850000	And you put it into game mode
3850000	3852000	See I have mine in game mode
3852000	3854000	I'm just bad at rhythm games
3854000	3856000	You're just a baddie
3856000	3858000	So there's that
3858000	3860000	Oh I bought Tetris
3860000	3862000	The ultimate casual game Tetris
3862000	3864000	I got it, I've been playing it tonight
3864000	3866000	I'm a Vita and it's also on the PS4
3866000	3868000	But now that's the really shitty
3868000	3870000	Ubisoft one that came out last year
3870000	3872000	That has an amazing commercial though
3872000	3874000	Yes it has a great commercial
3874000	3876000	So the Vita version is fine
3876000	3878000	The Vita version is really nice, it doesn't have those weird
3878000	3880000	Lighting effects, I'm not listening to the music
3880000	3882000	The music is terrible
3882000	3884000	It sounds like some dystopian 80's movie
3884000	3886000	It's really bad
3886000	3888000	I hope while you're sitting in
3888000	3890000	Studio N7 during OLR
3890000	3892000	You're not listening to the bad sound
3892000	3894000	I'm not, I have the volume down
3894000	3896000	But I am playing the game while I'm sitting in Studio N7
3896000	3898000	Well maybe they made it for the Vita
3898000	3900000	And then some genius decided let's just blow it up
3900000	3902000	You know what they did though, they delayed the Vita version
3902000	3904000	And I think that helped because I think they actually
3904000	3906000	Took feedback from the other version and fixed this one
3906000	3908000	Because it doesn't have the weird lighting effects
3908000	3910000	I feel like just trying to put it on
3910000	3912000	Next Gen at the time on PS4
3912000	3914000	They tried to overdo it with the graphics
3914000	3916000	Because the graphics, it's really hard on your eyes
3916000	3918000	When you're playing it, like there's these little light
3918000	3920000	Strobes that come off of it
3920000	3922000	When you're really focused on Tetris
3922000	3924000	It just makes it kind of dizzying when you're playing
3924000	3926000	And a little nauseating
3926000	3928000	But when I played the Vita version, it's pretty tight
3928000	3930000	And I think Vita is like the way you want to be anyway
3930000	3932000	Because that's just how I remember Tetris
3932000	3934000	It's handheld, portable
3934000	3936000	That's like my favorite way to play it
3936000	3938000	That's been pretty great
3938000	3940000	Otherwise there's lots of Splatoon
3940000	3942000	And Marvel Puzzle Quest on my phone
3942000	3944000	Still play that like crazy
3944000	3946000	Did you ever check out the PS4 version?
3946000	3948000	No, because they charge you 15 stupid dollars for it
3948000	3950000	That's so dumb
3950000	3952000	You can't import your other thing
3952000	3954000	I already have Hulk, like almost maxed out
3954000	3956000	Why would I want to then buy Hulk for like another $5 or whatever
3956000	3958000	I thought that was so dumb
3958000	3960000	So I was really angry
3960000	3962000	I wanted to watch you play it
3962000	3964000	But it wasn't working that one night
3964000	3966000	We tried to do SharePlay and it wouldn't work
3966000	3968000	SharePlay didn't like me
3968000	3970000	I want to see what this feels like
3970000	3972000	It's just Marvel Puzzle Quest
3972000	3974000	I just like playing on my phone
3974000	3976000	Hearthstone is good too
3976000	3978000	I'm excited you got into it
3978000	3980000	You know what's really fun on that
3980000	3982000	Is the solo adventure modes
3982000	3984000	I know they cost money
3984000	3986000	But I've done it all through in-game gold
3986000	3988000	But that takes a lot of time to earn
3988000	3990000	I used to play Hearthstone a lot
3990000	3992000	I had a lot of gold saved up
3992000	3994000	But the adventure modes are really worth it
3994000	3996000	There's lots of great voice acting in them
3996000	3998000	I just loaded it up
3998000	4000000	And then stopped when I realized
4000000	4002000	I needed my authenticator code
4002000	4004000	Aren't the first parts free?
4004000	4006000	Or am I wrong?
4006000	4008000	Maybe on Nax it was originally
4008000	4010000	But they don't do that anymore
4010000	4012000	You got to pay for it
4012000	4014000	But again, you can earn all through in-game gold
4014000	4016000	I've never spent a set on Hearthstone
4016000	4018000	Even as much as I like it
4018000	4020000	I love the game, but Blizzard got enough money
4020000	4022000	They don't need mine
4022000	4024000	So I just play the game
4024000	4026000	In the competitive mode
4026000	4028000	Because it's too cutthroat
4028000	4030000	And people who do spend money have an advantage
4030000	4032000	Because they can just get more cards more quickly
4032000	4034000	And it gets a little cutthroat in there
4034000	4036000	So I've just kind of stuck to
4036000	4038000	You know, the solo modes
4038000	4040000	They're really fun
4040000	4042000	They actually put a single player experience in there
4042000	4044000	That yeah, it helps you have better cards to do it
4044000	4046000	But if you play naturally through the game
4046000	4048000	You get some good cards, so
4048000	4050000	It's a good game
4050000	4052000	To register participation
4052000	4054000	Check out this week's episode of Orange Andrade
4054000	4056000	At vognetwork.com
4056000	4058000	Use the passphrase, birth
4058000	4060000	Shane, how about you?
4060000	4062000	How was your gaming week?
4062000	4064000	So I played the tail end
4064000	4066000	Of the Street Fighter V beta
4066000	4068000	This past weekend
4068000	4070000	Love that Vega is no longer a charge character
4070000	4072000	Makes him way more fun to play
4072000	4074000	And I played Splatoon
4074000	4076000	A lot
4076000	4078000	And I played 14
4078000	4080000	Again some more
4080000	4082000	I'm going to go back into that
4082000	4084000	Even though I'm not happy with it
4084000	4086000	Even though he said he was going to quit
4086000	4088000	Cancelled his account
4088000	4090000	I did for like three months
4090000	4092000	The very next day renewed
4092000	4094000	Well that was because
4094000	4096000	I didn't want my retainers
4096000	4098000	And Square Enix's support is very unhelpful
4098000	4100000	You know, answering questions
4100000	4102000	Or being polite
4102000	4104000	So I figured it out though
4104000	4106000	So I don't have my extra retainers
4106000	4108000	Anyway
4108000	4110000	What else did I play?
4110000	4112000	Parappa 2, I beat it in like 40 minutes
4112000	4114000	I was like, man, this game is so short
4114000	4116000	But I love it
4116000	4118000	And now Parappa has a blue hat
4118000	4120000	So he's a better version of himself
4120000	4122000	And I got Fantavision
4122000	4124000	Which is also really fun
4124000	4126000	And
4126000	4128000	I feel like
4128000	4130000	I missed around a little bit on Super Beat Sonic
4130000	4132000	That's like a disappointment
4132000	4134000	For me this year
4134000	4136000	That game is not as great as I hoped it was going to be
4136000	4138000	But
4138000	4140000	I think
4140000	4142000	That's really it
4142000	4144000	I may have also driven to McDonald's to get a Pokemon
4144000	4146000	Because they were doing a download
4146000	4148000	Only at McDonald's
4148000	4150000	And that was dumb, so I went inside
4150000	4152000	And I got the Pokemon and mozzarella sticks
4152000	4154000	Don't get mozzarella sticks at McDonald's
4154000	4156000	They are nasty
4156000	4158000	The one by my house does
4158000	4160000	And it was so gross
4160000	4162000	Who else used to have mozzarella sticks?
4162000	4164000	Was it Jack in the Box?
4164000	4166000	Was it Jack in the Box? Most of all it was Jack in the Box
4166000	4168000	I don't think they do anymore
4168000	4170000	Sonic does, and their mozzarella sticks are amazing
4170000	4172000	McDonald's
4172000	4174000	Learn from Sonic
4174000	4176000	Sounds so healthy, fried cheese
4176000	4178000	You know what though?
4178000	4180000	This show
4180000	4182000	I feel like
4182000	4184000	Exists in large part due to mozzarella sticks
4184000	4186000	And I mean that
4186000	4188000	Because not just our obsession with food
4188000	4190000	But because when we used to play
4190000	4192000	DDR at Roseville Golf Land
4192000	4194000	And how Loki, Darsakha, and I all met
4194000	4196000	We would go to the little diner that was in the parking lot
4196000	4198000	It's a local thing called Brookfield's
4198000	4200000	And they have some bomb ass mozzarella sticks
4200000	4202000	Like to this day, oh my god
4202000	4204000	Probably the best ones I've ever had are there
4204000	4206000	And so we would burn off all these calories
4206000	4208000	Playing DDR
4208000	4210000	And then put them right back on
4210000	4212000	Eating the mozzarella sticks
4212000	4214000	Now they have a soup that I've fallen in love with
4214000	4216000	Probably, what?
4216000	4218000	Now they have a soup that I've fallen in love with
4218000	4220000	It's that one that you didn't like
4220000	4222000	That I brought when you were sick
4222000	4224000	Oh, is that Brookfield's?
4224000	4226000	I'm gonna mispronounce it
4226000	4228000	It's like the
4228000	4230000	Ovolo-lemono or something
4230000	4232000	But it's like an
4232000	4234000	Egg and lemon soup
4234000	4236000	Chicken soup
4236000	4238000	Hey now, they're not paying for this plug
4238000	4240000	I don't care, it's delicious as fuck and I want some
4240000	4242000	I'll add a counterpoint then, I hate Brookfield's
4242000	4244000	Their breakfast is so terrible
4244000	4246000	They don't know how to cook anything
4246000	4248000	Alright, fair enough
4248000	4250000	Mark Tetsuya in chat pointing out that
4250000	4252000	A&W cheese curds are better
4252000	4254000	Actually, those are pretty bomb too
4254000	4256000	I've never heard of that, that just doesn't sound appealing
4256000	4258000	No, they're really good
4258000	4260000	But they're curds
4260000	4262000	And that sounds good, no matter what they are
4262000	4264000	The word sounds really disgusting
4264000	4266000	Just like cheesecake
4266000	4268000	Cheesecake's good
4268000	4270000	I can't get over the fact that it's like
4270000	4272000	A block of cheddar with frosting on it though
4272000	4274000	Wasn't our soccer night supposed to have cheesecake today and we didn't?
4274000	4276000	Yeah, we didn't
4276000	4278000	I got Chinese food though on Christmas
4278000	4280000	That made me feel happy
4280000	4282000	Oh, that's good
4282000	4284000	I went to Panda
4284000	4286000	They were open on Christmas?
4286000	4288000	Yes
4288000	4290000	I was like, oh my god, where's chicken?
4290000	4292000	Alright, My Gaming Week
4292000	4294000	A lot of the same stuff I always talk about on this show
4294000	4296000	Final Fantasy XIV, but I also downloaded Parappa 2
4296000	4298000	I didn't play a whole lot of it
4298000	4300000	Because the timing was throwing me off
4300000	4302000	But then Shane
4302000	4304000	But then I came to the rescue
4304000	4306000	Alright
4306000	4308000	But one game that I played a lot of this week
4308000	4310000	And I'm enjoying it quite a bit
4310000	4312000	Is Fast Racing Neo
4312000	4314000	On the Wii U
4314000	4316000	I wasn't sure if I was going to dig this game or not
4316000	4318000	Because it's the game
4318000	4320000	That somebody else made
4320000	4322000	Because Nintendo refuses to make a new F-Zero
4322000	4324000	For some unexplainable reason
4324000	4326000	So instead, these guys made Fast Racing Neo
4326000	4328000	And when I first started playing it
4328000	4330000	I was like, wow, these menus are
4330000	4332000	Super basic
4332000	4334000	I was like, this doesn't really feel like
4334000	4336000	As
4336000	4338000	I don't know what the word would be
4338000	4340000	As rich or as immersive as an F-Zero game
4340000	4342000	Robust
4342000	4344000	Robust is a good word
4344000	4346000	But once you actually get into the game
4346000	4348000	I was like, okay, well the meat of the game
4348000	4350000	It is what it says it is
4350000	4352000	It is Fast Racing
4352000	4354000	Super Neo
4354000	4356000	Yeah, it is, it is very Neo
4356000	4358000	But when I play it on my 62 inch TV
4358000	4360000	Or however big that thing is
4360000	4362000	I even get a little motion sick
4362000	4364000	It moves so fucking fast
4364000	4366000	And it's really smooth
4366000	4368000	Considering it's a Wii U game
4368000	4370000	Which doesn't have the same chips inside
4370000	4372000	Like a Playstation 4 and Xbox One
4372000	4374000	They really get things moving very well
4374000	4376000	In that game
4376000	4378000	It felt a little more wipe out
4378000	4380000	To me than F-Zero
4380000	4382000	But that's not a bad thing
4382000	4384000	I really like the wipe out games as well
4384000	4386000	It's pretty much what you would expect
4386000	4388000	In those Fast Racing games
4388000	4390000	The mechanic in Fast Racing Neo
4390000	4392000	Is that you can flip the engine on your car
4392000	4394000	From blue colored to orange colors
4394000	4396000	And it's kind of like an Ikaruga type of thing
4396000	4398000	Like that will trigger the blue
4398000	4400000	Or orange boosters on the course
4400000	4402000	The one thing I don't like about the game
4402000	4404000	Is the controls
4404000	4406000	And that's what really annoys me about it
4406000	4408000	Is the controls have this really odd configuration to it
4408000	4410000	So that part really annoyed me
4410000	4412000	But otherwise, yeah
4412000	4414000	I'm really enjoying the game
4414000	4416000	I watched you play it today
4416000	4418000	I just don't think it's that great of a game
4418000	4420000	Even though I didn't play it
4420000	4422000	So maybe my opinion shouldn't matter as much
4422000	4424000	But graphically, so beautiful
4424000	4426000	It's the best looking Wii U game
4426000	4428000	Hands down
4428000	4430000	No it is, you can't deny it
4430000	4432000	But it's lifeless
4432000	4434000	The music is not great
4434000	4436000	It looks like it was a text demo
4436000	4438000	I don't think Wii U is as bad as you said
4438000	4440000	It's pretty bad
4440000	4442000	But it looks like
4442000	4444000	This is what you could do
4444000	4446000	For a Wii U game
4446000	4448000	You can make games look this pretty
4448000	4450000	But this isn't like a game
4450000	4452000	It's just a tech demo
4452000	4454000	That's kind of like soulless, lifeless
4454000	4456000	It's not anything that special
4456000	4458000	I feel like
4458000	4460000	So anyway, as I'm sitting here talking about it
4460000	4462000	I think I actually downloaded this last Sunday
4462000	4464000	So I think I got into this a little bit on last week's OLR
4464000	4466000	So sorry if I'm repeating myself a bit
4466000	4468000	But I did play more of it
4468000	4470000	And I'm enjoying it enough
4470000	4472000	There's still some things
4472000	4474000	Kind of what
4474000	4476000	Shane is alluding to a little bit there
4476000	4478000	But I don't
4478000	4480000	I don't think the negatives are as bad as he says
4480000	4482000	So there you go
4482000	4484000	Fast Facing Neo, I've been having some fun with that game
4484000	4486000	And playing more Mario Maker
4486000	4488000	Some other
4488000	4490000	Stuff too
4490000	4492000	A few of the games on Steam
4492000	4494000	I was playing Super Slam Dunk Touchdown
4494000	4496000	Because we had the Maker on last week
4496000	4498000	I was playing that Black Ice game
4498000	4500000	I liked that because we'd seen that in GamerX
4501000	4503000	And then Tron Run R
4503000	4505000	Which got an update I need to check out
4505000	4507000	Alright
4507000	4510000	Carson in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
4510000	4512000	Holy shit, I just checked it out
4512000	4514000	And as Rob said, it's really fucking fast
4514000	4516000	Well it's in the title
4516000	4518000	Fast Racing Neo, you expect it's going to be a little bit fast
4518000	4520000	Alright, some quick housekeeping
4522000	4524000	We will not be taking any shows off
4524000	4526000	Through the month of January
4526000	4528000	The next show where we will not be here
4528000	4530000	Live is in February
4530000	4532000	Because of MAGFest
4532000	4534000	So if you are going to be out in MAGFest in DC
4534000	4536000	I've officially booked my flight, hotel, all that stuff
4536000	4538000	I'm going to be at MAGFest in February
4538000	4540000	I'm very excited about that
4540000	4542000	I will be absent on the show on the 10th
4542000	4544000	That's right
4544000	4546000	You are going to Disneyland
4546000	4548000	To mourn the passing
4548000	4550000	Of Bucket of Meat
4550000	4552000	You know that story is going around Facebook this week
4552000	4554000	About all the stuff they're closing down
4554000	4556000	To make Star Wars land
4556000	4558000	And Big Thunder Railroad too
4558000	4560000	They're only temporarily closing that
4560000	4562000	I was going to say, they're not closing that right now
4562000	4564000	But I want to go on it before it's closed down for a while
4564000	4566000	They just had that closed for like a year
4566000	4568000	When they were doing refurbishments
4568000	4570000	It's kind of weird that they're closing that again
4570000	4572000	Alright
4572000	4574000	I just went on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad recently
4574000	4576000	Did you?
4576000	4578000	I went at night
4578000	4580000	And the most amazing part was they started doing the fireworks show
4580000	4582000	When I was on the ride
4582000	4584000	We came out of a tunnel
4584000	4586000	A Mickey shaped firework
4586000	4588000	Just appeared
4588000	4590000	Right in front of us as we came out
4590000	4592000	That happened to me and Dan a few years ago
4592000	4594000	Yeah, we all lost our minds
4594000	4596000	It was the best
4596000	4598000	That's such a storybook thing
4598000	4600000	It was, I'm like how can this happen?
4600000	4602000	They planned it, they know
4602000	4604000	Did it go faster at night?
4604000	4606000	Of course it did
4606000	4608000	My son loved that ride, but at night he got a little scared
4608000	4610000	I have certain places I have to sit
4610000	4612000	On certain rides
4612000	4614000	Always in the back and always with my husband
4614000	4616000	Cause he has a bigger lap
4616000	4618000	And it has the two person lap bar
4618000	4620000	So I get air
4620000	4622000	I used to be scared of that ride when I was a kid
4622000	4624000	Cause I'd ride with my dad and he was much bigger than me
4624000	4626000	Obviously he was my dad
4626000	4628000	And I was just a little kid
4628000	4630000	I was scared of it, cause I was like oh I'm gonna fall out
4630000	4632000	It's like no that's just more fun
4632000	4634000	As I got older I'm like oh that is more fun
4634000	4636000	You get air, that's what's so great about Tower of Terror
4636000	4638000	Is when it drops and you get off your seat
4638000	4640000	It's so fun
4640000	4642000	I had a panic attack on the elevator when it fell two stories
4642000	4644000	So I tried to go on it to overcome my fear
4644000	4646000	Of falling like that
4646000	4648000	I had a panic attack
4648000	4650000	In the gift shop
4650000	4652000	Wow, my wife refuses to even go on it
4652000	4654000	We got all the way to the door and she's like nope
4654000	4656000	So we had to be escorted out
4656000	4658000	She got a little scared of that one
4658000	4660000	She doesn't want to drop like that
4660000	4662000	You just need to get a glass of wine in her first
4662000	4664000	Alright, let's see
4664000	4666000	Some other quick things I want to mention
4666000	4668000	This is very important because this guy has been a support
4668000	4670000	For a very long time
4670000	4672000	And also projects that
4672000	4674000	I have done
4674000	4676000	On the side, Horde House
4676000	4678000	He was a huge
4678000	4680000	Impact on that show
4680000	4682000	And I just want to take a minute to acknowledge
4682000	4684000	Pod Culture
4684000	4686000	Hit their 10 year mark
4686000	4688000	This week, that show started on Christmas
4688000	4690000	I didn't realize that, but their show actually started on Christmas
4690000	4692000	And so their 10 year
4692000	4694000	Anniversary show was this week
4694000	4696000	So I want to give huge props to Brad
4696000	4698000	And his whole crew
4698000	4700000	Adam, Christina, Glen, everybody over
4700000	4702000	At Pod Culture for hitting
4702000	4704000	10 years this week
4704000	4706000	It's a fantastic accomplishment, yay
4706000	4708000	Clap clap clap
4708000	4710000	Pod Culture
4710000	4712000	Pod Culture, I love the way he says it too
4712000	4714000	It's so good
4714000	4716000	So yes, congratulations Brad
4716000	4718000	And everybody from Pod Culture
4718000	4720000	And I really hope I get to see you
4720000	4722000	At Dragon Con this year
4722000	4724000	Although I know real life is more important
4724000	4726000	But I'm still going to cross my fingers on my toes
4726000	4728000	That you're able to make it to Dragon Con this year
4728000	4730000	Alright, and let's see
4730000	4732000	What else do I want to mention here
4732000	4734000	Just briefly, it has nothing to do with games
4734000	4736000	But I do feel as a nerd
4736000	4738000	It is my responsibility to tell you all
4738000	4740000	I saw Star Wars
4740000	4742000	It was so good
4742000	4744000	I've seen it twice
4744000	4746000	I know you went with me
4746000	4748000	So I didn't have to go alone
4748000	4750000	Because Alan works at night
4750000	4752000	So nobody else could really go to the movies with me
4752000	4754000	I saw Star Wars, which is notable because I never get out
4754000	4756000	And see movies
4756000	4758000	But I did go out and see Star Wars
4758000	4760000	And I will admit, I really liked it
4760000	4762000	It was my favorite out of all seven of them
4762000	4764000	It really was
4764000	4766000	So, kudos to Abrams
4766000	4768000	I didn't see one lens flare
4768000	4770000	And this was very subtle
4770000	4772000	Are you blind?
4772000	4774000	I wasn't really looking for him
4774000	4776000	You don't have to
4776000	4778000	I guess not
4778000	4780000	It wasn't Star Trek bad
4780000	4782000	They're not just on the bridge with lights
4782000	4784000	In every camera
4784000	4786000	When big lasers and stuff go off
4786000	4788000	You can see it pretty clearly
4788000	4790000	Of course I'm not going to spoil it
4790000	4792000	I'm just going to say one thing
4792000	4794000	Not a spoiler
4794000	4796000	I just have to thank Star Wars
4796000	4798000	For bringing Poe
4798000	4800000	Into my life
4800000	4802000	And I'm not talking about the poet
4802000	4804000	And I'm not talking about the musician
4804000	4806000	Who disappeared somewhere in the late 90s
4806000	4808000	I'm talking about Poe Dameron
4809000	4811000	The super hot guy
4811000	4813000	From the movie
4813000	4815000	So that's all I'm going to say
4815000	4817000	Thank you
4817000	4819000	I really want to get his Disney Infinity figure
4819000	4821000	Just because it's Poe
4821000	4823000	I hope it means more people watch Inside Llewyn Davis
4823000	4825000	Because that's a great movie
4825000	4827000	He got an Oscar nomination for
4827000	4829000	Adam Driver is in that as well
4829000	4831000	The guy who plays Kylo Ren
4831000	4833000	I didn't even realize that
4833000	4835000	It's a Coen Brothers movie
4835000	4837000	I saw it on opening week
4838000	4840000	Shane I feel a little bit like you
4840000	4842000	I have never been super obsessed
4842000	4844000	With Star Wars
4844000	4846000	Star Wars is awful
4846000	4848000	I really hate Star Wars
4848000	4850000	Except for this one
4850000	4852000	I definitely wouldn't go that far
4852000	4854000	You will go there
4854000	4856000	I was always more of a Star Trek person
4856000	4858000	Grandpa doesn't even have to pay me money to say that
4858000	4860000	I was always more of a Star Trek person
4860000	4862000	Than Star Wars
4862000	4864000	I was like okay I'll go see the new one
4864000	4866000	Just because it's a culture thing
4866000	4868000	And everybody's really into it
4868000	4870000	And as a nerd I feel a responsibility to go see it
4870000	4872000	So I saw it
4872000	4874000	And now I'm like
4874000	4876000	When we were at Toys R Us today
4876000	4878000	I'm like I really want the Poe
4878000	4880000	Star Wars figure
4880000	4882000	He keeps going into my best spy cart online
4882000	4884000	We have no Rey
4884000	4886000	Yes you do because
4886000	4888000	She's not a stand alone
4888000	4890000	Rey and Finn are in a Star Wars bundle
4890000	4892000	And I was like I can't get Poe
4892000	4894000	And not get Finn
4894000	4896000	Well you get those and give me Rey
4896000	4898000	Listen
4898000	4900000	I like Rey though
4900000	4902000	Rey is their female companion
4902000	4904000	Listen fully Black Widow her
4904000	4906000	From the toy line
4906000	4908000	Is that her only toy?
4908000	4910000	If that is that's pretty sad again
4910000	4912000	Women totally get
4912000	4914000	Shafted when it comes to having
4914000	4916000	Action figures
4916000	4918000	Not in Power Rangers
4918000	4920000	It is absolute bullshit
4920000	4922000	You're preaching to the choir in this case
4922000	4924000	Because in the movie
4924000	4926000	Again I'm not going to spoil
4926000	4928000	But I don't think it's a spoiler to say
4928000	4930000	She kind of
4930000	4932000	She's like the main character
4932000	4934000	She kind of
4934000	4936000	I don't want to say she carries that movie
4936000	4938000	But without her I don't think it would be as good as it is
4938000	4940000	So
4940000	4942000	It's bullshit there's no figure
4942000	4944000	Of her just like there are for the boys
4944000	4946000	That are also very important in that movie
4946000	4948000	Well even Poe's not that important
4948000	4950000	But he's got many figures
4951000	4953000	Don't forget about the figure that they did for
4953000	4955000	Sir Not Appearing in this film
4955000	4957000	Yeah they made a figure for
4957000	4959000	Somebody that got cut I think
4959000	4961000	Alright alright we got to watch the spoilers
4961000	4963000	It's not a spoiler
4963000	4965000	The character's not in the movie
4965000	4967000	But they made an action figure for him
4967000	4969000	And as I've been calling him he's Sir Not Appearing
4969000	4971000	They should have made an action figure
4971000	4973000	For the cameo that I freak out
4973000	4975000	Over every time I see that movie
4975000	4977000	What Chanel number 3?
4977000	4979000	Spoilers but yes
4979000	4981000	That's not a spoiler
4981000	4983000	She's Carrie Fish's daughter
4983000	4985000	Not a spoiler
4985000	4987000	It's great nepotism
4987000	4989000	I just need to have the Captain Phasma figure
4989000	4991000	To put on my cubicle
4991000	4993000	Even though she was like
4993000	4995000	I'm not going to spoil it but I love her
4995000	4997000	Alright now our chat
4997000	4999000	Is starting to get hypersensitive about spoilers
4999000	5001000	I mean if we really wanted to spoil you
5001000	5003000	There's other stuff we can say
5003000	5005000	We haven't spoiled anything
5005000	5007000	So go
5007000	5009000	Quick go see it before you see some freaking meme
5009000	5011000	Or something online
5011000	5013000	Or you can see Krampus
5013000	5015000	We're close though to the
5015000	5017000	Statute of limitations on spoilers
5017000	5019000	So go see it
5019000	5021000	Before we start
5021000	5023000	No we're not a movie show
5023000	5025000	Before I start
5025000	5027000	Jamie will come to your house, knock on your door
5027000	5029000	And scream it if you don't see it
5029000	5031000	In the next 30 days
5031000	5033000	Although I do have to say that Ray is very similar
5033000	5035000	I used to play the Star Wars RPG tabletop
5035000	5037000	She's very similar to a character
5037000	5039000	That I played like 10 years ago
5039000	5041000	Nice
5041000	5043000	Alright
5043000	5045000	Back to games
5045000	5047000	Let's get into the news this week
5047000	5049000	And I'm going to start us off with a big thing
5049000	5051000	That happened on the Christmas holiday
5051000	5053000	That I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard about
5053000	5055000	It was probably the big story of the week
5055000	5057000	And that is the fact that Steam
5057000	5059000	Had some major issues this week
5059000	5061000	Steam wasn't hacked per se
5061000	5063000	Or at least that's not what they're saying is happening
5063000	5065000	Something happened with Steam's caching servers
5065000	5067000	And what happened
5067000	5069000	In a nutshell is that when you would go
5069000	5071000	On Steam, you're presented
5071000	5073000	With pages from other people's
5073000	5075000	Random accounts
5075000	5077000	Basically
5077000	5079000	And there's screenshots out there on like
5079000	5081000	NeoGaf and some other Twitter I think has some too
5081000	5083000	Where you see random people
5083000	5085000	Thankfully, and thank you Twitter people for doing this
5085000	5087000	They blacked out the really sensitive
5087000	5089000	Information, but you can clearly see that they're
5089000	5091000	Able to see somebody's account name
5091000	5093000	And they can see the address, phone number
5093000	5095000	And email address that
5095000	5097000	Goes with an account
5097000	5099000	And so what basically happened
5099000	5101000	Is that as people
5101000	5103000	Were logging in and using Steam
5103000	5105000	To go about their business and make transactions
5105000	5107000	Because after all there is a Steam sale
5107000	5109000	Going on, some people's data
5109000	5111000	Would be saved to the cache server
5111000	5113000	And then that data was then accidentally
5113000	5115000	Delivered to other people that had
5115000	5117000	Nothing to do with that transaction
5117000	5119000	I'm really oversimplifying this
5119000	5121000	I can't tell you what really happened because
5121000	5123000	Valve is, in my opinion
5123000	5125000	Valve is being really dodgy about what happened
5125000	5127000	I'm trying to cut them a break
5127000	5129000	Because it's fucking Christmas
5129000	5131000	And I understand like nobody's in the office
5131000	5133000	But at the same time, they are
5133000	5135000	Running a major sale right now
5135000	5137000	So I do expect that, you know
5137000	5139000	If they're gonna ask for money, they do kind of owe it to us
5139000	5141000	A little bit to explain exactly
5141000	5143000	What's going on
5143000	5145000	And I kind of feel like their statement right now
5145000	5147000	Is more, it's not happening anymore
5147000	5149000	Don't look behind the curtain
5149000	5151000	But whatever
5151000	5153000	So anyway, yeah
5153000	5155000	So basically on Steam
5155000	5157000	Other people's private information
5157000	5159000	Was being displayed to unrelated people
5159000	5161000	And I gotta say, when I found out about this
5161000	5163000	I went super cyan
5163000	5165000	Pissed off on Twitter
5165000	5167000	And I was mad
5167000	5169000	And I even kind of said some pretty mean things
5169000	5171000	On Twitter because
5171000	5173000	I saw some people were kind of going
5173000	5175000	Well, it's a good thing I don't use Steam
5175000	5177000	And I'm on Nintendo
5177000	5179000	Nintendo doesn't have these problems
5179000	5181000	Well, PlayStation 4 fixed that issue
5181000	5183000	Why can't Steam fix that issue
5183000	5185000	And I was like, no!
5185000	5187000	There is a big difference between
5187000	5189000	What happened on those networks
5189000	5191000	And what happened on Steam
5191000	5193000	And what's funny is, I'm actually on the side of
5193000	5195000	What happened on Steam is way worse
5195000	5197000	What happened on PlayStation 4
5197000	5199000	I don't know if it's ever happened on Nintendo
5199000	5201000	Probably maintenance and stuff
5201000	5203000	But downtime, DDoS attacks
5203000	5205000	That's one thing
5205000	5207000	It takes the server down
5207000	5209000	People are upset, whatever
5209000	5211000	Oh no, so forth
5211000	5213000	But this was displaying people's
5213000	5215000	Personal information
5215000	5217000	Full on display
5217000	5219000	To other people
5219000	5221000	And you guys know I am a big advocate for privacy
5221000	5223000	And so forth, and I've talked about
5223000	5225000	Some of the issues I've had in the past
5225000	5227000	And why I like to use a fake name online and so forth
5227000	5229000	So obviously to use my credit card on Steam
5229000	5231000	I don't use that
5231000	5233000	And I'm sure that potentially
5233000	5235000	And thankfully I took the Internet's advice
5235000	5237000	And just didn't use Steam on Christmas
5237000	5239000	I mean it helped that I was on the road all day anyway
5239000	5241000	But I didn't use Steam
5241000	5243000	At all that day
5243000	5245000	So I don't think my information was out there
5245000	5247000	But I was really pissed off
5247000	5249000	Thinking that that possibility
5249000	5251000	Was even there
5251000	5253000	That somebody could have seen my address
5253000	5255000	My phone number, and even the last four of my credit cards
5255000	5257000	What the actual fuck
5257000	5259000	I think Steam has some huge explaining
5259000	5261000	To do with this
5261000	5263000	And what they've said so far isn't enough
5263000	5265000	Like this really
5265000	5267000	And you guys might think I'm blowing this out of proportion
5267000	5269000	I don't think I am
5269000	5271000	Because I take privacy and this type of stuff
5271000	5273000	Like very seriously
5273000	5275000	And you might be thinking
5275000	5277000	Well Rob, if you don't want to do that
5277000	5279000	You probably shouldn't give them that information
5279000	5281000	You have to give them that
5281000	5283000	To use your credit card on the store in the first place
5283000	5285000	I mean I guess I should have used a prepaid card
5285000	5287000	Or something like that
5287000	5289000	I didn't learn there oh well
5289000	5291000	But I mean
5291000	5293000	Steam has boasted
5293000	5295000	About its security before
5295000	5297000	Outright boasted
5297000	5299000	They've come up on stage and said
5299000	5301000	Our two-factor authentication is so awesome
5301000	5303000	I don't remember who he was
5303000	5305000	I don't know if he was the CEO
5305000	5307000	I don't think anybody at Valve has titles
5307000	5309000	So he was some guy speaking on security
5309000	5311000	He's like, here is my account
5311000	5313000	And my password
5313000	5315000	It's secure, you'll never get in there
5315000	5317000	And I know to date
5317000	5319000	The two-factor authentication has been so good
5319000	5321000	Nobody's got in there
5321000	5323000	And I do have two-factor authentication enabled on my account
5323000	5325000	Guess what, it wouldn't have fucking mattered in this case
5325000	5327000	And that's why I'm really
5327000	5329000	Really upset about what happened with Steam
5329000	5331000	Isn't part of it also
5331000	5333000	The fact like
5333000	5335000	The thing that happened with Steam
5335000	5337000	Wasn't that just something on their part
5337000	5339000	That screwed up
5339000	5341000	Whereas the other network issues that happened
5341000	5343000	Like Xbox Live and Playstation Network
5343000	5345000	Think it's funny
5345000	5347000	So it's like a huge difference there too
5347000	5349000	It wasn't because somebody outright attacked
5349000	5351000	The services, Steam screwed up
5351000	5353000	And I'm gonna say
5353000	5355000	Something that might blow your mind here
5355000	5357000	But this is honestly how I feel
5357000	5359000	Because I think the closest thing to this
5359000	5361000	That has happened in gaming in the past few years
5361000	5363000	Is when the Playstation store was hacked
5363000	5365000	And all those credit card numbers were stolen
5365000	5367000	And so forth
5367000	5369000	I would rather somebody
5369000	5371000	Steal my credit card information
5371000	5373000	Than see my address and phone number
5373000	5375000	That's how I honestly feel
5375000	5377000	Because credit cards, guess what
5377000	5379000	They are like stupid easy to
5379000	5381000	Say this is a fraudulent charge
5381000	5383000	It's not me because that also happened to me
5383000	5385000	Earlier in the year, it had nothing to do with games
5385000	5387000	But somebody charged $50
5387000	5389000	At like a Chuck E. Cheese in Pasadena
5389000	5391000	And then some random store in St. Louis
5391000	5393000	And I'm like what the fuck, so I called my bank
5393000	5395000	Easy, done, no problem
5395000	5397000	Easy peasy fix
5397000	5399000	That's why credit card companies get money
5399000	5401000	It's to fix these situations like this
5401000	5403000	So honestly
5403000	5405000	If somebody gets the credit card number
5405000	5407000	I honestly don't think it's as big of a deal
5407000	5409000	As somebody potentially knowing
5409000	5411000	What my phone number is and where my house is
5411000	5413000	And maybe that's just because of some of the experiences
5413000	5415000	I've gone through in life and so forth
5415000	5417000	But like this is worse in my opinion
5417000	5419000	And I have some huge trust issues with Steam now
5419000	5421000	Because A, they're not fucking explaining
5421000	5423000	What really happened
5423000	5425000	And they're not
5425000	5427000	They're not explaining how it's not gonna happen
5427000	5429000	Again and trying to earn my trust back
5429000	5431000	I don't need a free fucking game
5431000	5433000	Or Steam money
5433000	5435000	Or training, I just
5435000	5437000	Want reassurance
5437000	5439000	This is not gonna happen again
5439000	5441000	I wanna know how it happened and how it's not
5441000	5443000	Gonna happen again because
5443000	5445000	For them to get up on stage
5445000	5447000	And the chat room is telling me it was Gabe Newell
5447000	5449000	Who actually got up there on stage, sorry
5449000	5451000	It was a long time ago, to get up on stage
5451000	5453000	You're just a random employee though
5453000	5455000	We are the most secure company
5455000	5457000	Because of two-actor authentication
5457000	5459000	I'm the president and I'm gonna give you
5459000	5461000	My password because the two-factor's so
5461000	5463000	Strong so if you use it, you'll have the same security
5463000	5465000	To have that fail
5465000	5467000	Is a real violation
5467000	5469000	Of my trust, I think
5469000	5471000	And that is why I'm super cyan pissed off
5471000	5473000	At what happened on Steam
5473000	5475000	If you think I'm going overboard, oh well, it's my opinion
5475000	5477000	So I don't know, anybody else wanna comment on
5477000	5479000	What's going on with the Steam stuff?
5479000	5481000	I mean, it was fixed after a short amount of time
5481000	5483000	Was my information on
5483000	5485000	Display? Probably not because I didn't use
5485000	5487000	The service during that particular hour
5487000	5489000	But I have been on
5489000	5491000	Steam off and on throughout
5491000	5493000	The sale, I was doing the trading cards every
5493000	5495000	Day, since Christmas
5495000	5497000	I kinda
5497000	5499000	Stopped
5499000	5501000	I've bought three things since that went down
5501000	5503000	Yeah, and it's, I just, I don't know
5503000	5505000	Are you, are you, do you
5505000	5507000	Think I'm too upset
5507000	5509000	Dark soccer or what?
5509000	5511000	I think that they've dealt with the problem
5511000	5513000	And that your information probably didn't get out there
5513000	5515000	It's what
5515000	5517000	I tell people
5517000	5519000	You're like, oh well this could have happened
5519000	5521000	Did it happen?
5521000	5523000	No
5523000	5525000	If it's not going to happen
5525000	5527000	Again, if they now
5527000	5529000	Know of the issue and know how to prevent it
5529000	5531000	From happening
5531000	5533000	I honestly think that
5533000	5535000	There's really no
5535000	5537000	Use getting too worked up over it
5537000	5539000	It's the past
5539000	5541000	I'm sort of like half with you
5541000	5543000	Because I get that it didn't happen
5543000	5545000	To me, and I know I'm sitting here going
5545000	5547000	It could have, but
5547000	5549000	To be fair, the people that it did happen to
5549000	5551000	They don't know
5551000	5553000	Because that's the other end of this
5553000	5555000	You don't know whose information got displayed
5555000	5557000	Is Valve going to alert these people?
5557000	5559000	They haven't said
5559000	5561000	And if it was me
5561000	5563000	Is Valve going to know who got reflected?
5563000	5565000	I don't think they do
5565000	5567000	I don't think they do either
5567000	5569000	In my opinion
5569000	5571000	They're going to get sued over it
5571000	5573000	And they should
5573000	5575000	I see you rolling your eyes
5575000	5577000	I wasn't rolling my eyes
5577000	5579000	The whole thing is
5579000	5581000	Chances are it was noticed
5581000	5583000	By a few people
5583000	5585000	I doubt that everyone looking at it is so malicious
5585000	5587000	That they're going to actively start looking
5587000	5589000	For people that they want to see
5589000	5591000	It only happened for people who had recently made
5591000	5593000	Purchases, right?
5593000	5595000	So it was just cached data
5595000	5597000	So it's not anything
5597000	5599000	That they're going to be able to do much with
5599000	5601000	Apart from
5601000	5603000	Now, I understand
5603000	5605000	There are stalker situations
5605000	5607000	But those are
5607000	5609000	More often than not
5609000	5611000	First of all, they would have to have actively
5611000	5613000	Been looking for the person that they're trying to stalk
5613000	5615000	Knowing the username
5615000	5617000	And then finding that data that way
5617000	5619000	It would still require work
5619000	5621000	To get this information
5621000	5623000	So it would have to be somebody actively trying to go after
5623000	5625000	Who knows the person's username on Steam
5625000	5627000	And you can change your username on Steam
5627000	5629000	Right. Now there's a lot of
5629000	5631000	Talk and chat back and forth
5631000	5633000	Was it a hack? Was it not a hack?
5633000	5635000	My understanding was that
5635000	5637000	It was an internal failing
5637000	5639000	Now, could something from the outside
5639000	5641000	Have tipped that internal failing?
5641000	5643000	I don't think so
5643000	5645000	Based on what we know about the situation
5645000	5647000	But when Valve has given us a very
5647000	5649000	Short answer and I really feel like
5649000	5651000	They're trying to sweep this under the rug
5651000	5653000	I really want to see what happens next week
5653000	5655000	Because, uh-uh, you are not sweeping this under the rug
5655000	5657000	Valve, you are not sweeping this under the rug
5657000	5659000	You need to explain how the fuck
5659000	5661000	This happened a lot better
5661000	5663000	So we're clear, you know, if it was a hack or not
5663000	5665000	And if it wasn't, then what happened?
5665000	5667000	What's being done to this in the future?
5667000	5669000	So, anyway
5669000	5671000	There you go
5671000	5673000	Alright
5673000	5675000	Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf in chat
5675000	5677000	Says, this was one employee who was
5677000	5679000	Most likely an employee who is no longer employed
5679000	5681000	By Valve, you set something incorrectly
5681000	5683000	On Akamai
5683000	5685000	I don't know how you actually pronounce that
5685000	5687000	But the name of the actual caching system
5687000	5689000	So, we'll see
5689000	5691000	I don't know, we'll see what comes in the coming weeks
5691000	5693000	But I do not want this story to go away
5693000	5695000	Because I need to know
5695000	5697000	If I'm to continue to use Steam, which I'm not sure
5697000	5699000	I want to in the moment
5699000	5701000	How they're going to prevent this from happening again
5701000	5703000	And once they address the issue, I'll probably
5703000	5705000	Simmer down, I forgave PlayStation
5705000	5707000	As a lot of people did, you know
5707000	5709000	I still shop at Target, but
5709000	5711000	I bought three things today
5711000	5713000	On Steam
5713000	5715000	Right now
5715000	5717000	So, I mean
5717000	5719000	I haven't gotten any weird mail
5719000	5721000	There's probably a lot of people
5721000	5723000	In your boat, and that's fine
5723000	5725000	But I'm
5725000	5727000	Choosing not to
5727000	5729000	Until I have that reassurance back
5729000	5731000	Steam has lost some of my trust
5731000	5733000	Alright, moving on
5733000	5735000	Darcyra
5735000	5737000	Well, Bayonetta
5737000	5739000	As we all know, she is
5739000	5741000	Now going to be in Super Smash Bros
5741000	5743000	However, her inclusion
5743000	5745000	Nearly changed the rating of the game in Japan
5745000	5747000	They
5747000	5749000	Actually
5749000	5751000	Were
5751000	5753000	Because she's very
5753000	5755000	What's a good word for it?
5755000	5757000	Sexual
5757000	5759000	You know
5759000	5761000	They thought that it would
5761000	5763000	That putting her in the game
5763000	5765000	Would basically remove it for the
5765000	5767000	A for All rating
5767000	5769000	However, after
5769000	5771000	Discussion
5771000	5773000	And working on it, they figure
5773000	5775000	She's, I guess, safe enough to
5775000	5777000	Hang out with Cloud, so
5777000	5779000	They've NSFW'd
5779000	5781000	Or they've taken out the NSFW
5781000	5783000	And sterilized her a little bit
5783000	5785000	Which I find really odd for Japan
5785000	5787000	Given
5787000	5789000	That, at least
5789000	5791000	In my experience
5791000	5793000	Well
5793000	5795000	I don't know, I would think that
5795000	5797000	Having a character that might be
5797000	5799000	A little bit more risque
5799000	5801000	Wouldn't be as
5801000	5803000	Big of a deal, given that things
5803000	5805000	Like, well then again
5805000	5807000	In America we have a tendency
5807000	5809000	To sexualize
5809000	5811000	Nudity, which in and of itself
5811000	5813000	Is not a sexual thing
5813000	5815000	You know
5815000	5817000	And
5817000	5819000	She doesn't really get naked
5819000	5821000	She gets maybe less
5821000	5823000	Clothed the more she uses her hair
5823000	5825000	You never see your titties
5825000	5827000	In the game
5827000	5829000	And she's flirty and does a little bit of bad talk
5829000	5831000	But she's not like
5831000	5833000	Overtly
5833000	5835000	I don't know
5835000	5837000	I'm just really surprised at that
5837000	5839000	But you know what's interesting, we did talk about
5839000	5841000	Until Dawn being censored in Japan earlier
5841000	5843000	So we do have some cases
5843000	5845000	Where, I mean that's violence
5845000	5847000	I was always of the opinion
5847000	5849000	That things like, you know, blood and gore
5849000	5851000	I mean if you look at the history
5851000	5853000	Of, at least back for the 16-bit era
5853000	5855000	Games would be censored
5855000	5857000	When they came here instead of how they were there
5857000	5859000	I mean look at Splatterhouse
5859000	5861000	Or look at, well even
5861000	5863000	Mortal Kombat
5863000	5865000	Or Samurai Shodown, that was one
5865000	5867000	Cause on Samurai Shodown
5867000	5869000	Too, I actually have the Samurai Spirits
5869000	5871000	Neo Geo cartridge
5871000	5873000	And if you play it in Japanese mode
5873000	5875000	Then it's got red blood
5875000	5877000	And if you play it in the American mode
5877000	5879000	It's sweat
5879000	5881000	So, you know
5881000	5883000	I'm very, I'm just a little bit surprised by that
5883000	5885000	But I mean, it is what it is
5885000	5887000	I mean, I guess maybe
5887000	5889000	You know, her smacking down
5889000	5891000	People with the guillotine
5891000	5893000	Or her demon boot
5893000	5895000	Is a little bit too much
5895000	5897000	AkumaJP in chat
5897000	5899000	Who is in Japan
5899000	5901000	And listens to this program live sometimes
5901000	5903000	Thanks for being here
5903000	5905000	I mean, the billboards here in Akihabara
5905000	5907000	Breast, naked chicks everywhere
5907000	5909000	So, uh
5909000	5911000	Yeah, maybe there's, you know what
5911000	5913000	A lot of those same double standards exist here
5913000	5915000	In the US too, just for what it's worth
5915000	5917000	I, we're
5917000	5919000	Nintendo
5919000	5921000	Bayonetta will not corrupt the youth
5921000	5923000	They were already there
5923000	5925000	Deal with it
5925000	5927000	Well I am super excited for Bayonetta and Smash
5927000	5929000	And, you know, I'm pretty sure
5929000	5931000	It's not like she's gonna have, like you said
5931000	5933000	She's not gonna have her guillotine move
5933000	5935000	Or a lot of the super violent stuff she has in her games
5935000	5937000	They're not gonna bring that to Smash
5937000	5939000	You're not gonna be able to chop Peach's head off
5939000	5941000	With some move
5941000	5943000	Although it'd be kind of rad if that were a thing
5943000	5945000	No, I'm just kidding, you can't do that to
5945000	5947000	Mario and friends
5947000	5949000	You can't do that, alright
5949000	5951000	Let's move on, who's doing our next story? When are you guys, right?
5951000	5953000	Oh, I was trying to tweet
5953000	5955000	Oh, well, sorry, but
5955000	5957000	You know, during live radio, you never know
5957000	5959000	When it's gonna get deeper
5959000	5961000	Let's just stop the show
5961000	5963000	Let's go to a break
5963000	5965000	So, Shane can finish his tweet
5965000	5967000	So, with
5967000	5969000	Amplitude already out
5969000	5971000	And coming out soon
5971000	5973000	For people that didn't pay
5973000	5975000	$40 or more to back it
5975000	5977000	Like me
5977000	5979000	They are adding
5979000	5981000	And have added
5981000	5983000	This story sucks
5983000	5985000	A mode to make it look like frequency
5985000	5987000	So, in Amplitude
5987000	5989000	Your tracks are all laid out
5989000	5991000	Horizontally
5991000	5993000	But in
5993000	5995000	Frequency
5995000	5997000	You were kind of in this
5997000	5999000	Tube
5999000	6001000	Going around in circles
6001000	6003000	To hit the tracks
6003000	6005000	Well, Harmonics said that
6005000	6007000	They initially changed it in Amplitude
6007000	6009000	To allow for better
6009000	6011000	Track recognition
6011000	6013000	But between the fans and even the developers
6013000	6015000	It was pretty much split
6015000	6017000	On which way people
6017000	6019000	Preferred, the frequency way or amplitude way
6019000	6021000	So, for this
6021000	6023000	New reboot, they've actually
6023000	6025000	Added a mode that makes it so you can play it like frequency
6025000	6027000	And for me, I'm
6027000	6029000	Super excited because I preferred the frequency
6029000	6031000	Method a lot more
6031000	6033000	It took a lot of getting used to for Amplitude
6033000	6035000	And I'll be happy
6035000	6037000	To play this game the way I
6037000	6039000	Would have preferred to back when
6039000	6041000	They released the original version
6041000	6043000	The end
6043000	6045000	Have you played? You were a big backer
6045000	6047000	Of Amplitude, have you played?
6047000	6049000	I paid $20 for it
6049000	6051000	Wait, so did you
6051000	6053000	Get the PS4 version?
6053000	6055000	No, because you had to do $40
6055000	6057000	Two weeks, one week early
6057000	6059000	So I'll get it when it comes out
6059000	6061000	In January, next
6061000	6063000	Next week I think it is
6063000	6065000	But I played it at
6065000	6067000	PlayStation Experience
6067000	6069000	And it was Amplitude
6069000	6071000	There it was
6071000	6073000	Not much different
6073000	6075000	At all, so I mean
6075000	6077000	I'm fine with that
6077000	6079000	I have a feeling I will be a little
6079000	6081000	Disappointed based on some of the things
6081000	6083000	I've been seeing
6083000	6085000	And already disappointed just kind of
6085000	6087000	At the song list in general because
6087000	6089000	Something that really stuck out
6089000	6091000	In frequency and amplitude for me
6091000	6093000	Was the inclusion of
6093000	6095000	Random genres of music
6095000	6097000	That I never would have listened to
6097000	6099000	Or never thought would be good in a music
6099000	6101000	Game like Quarashi
6101000	6103000	Or they had a lot of hard rock stuff
6103000	6105000	Randomly
6105000	6107000	And this is mostly
6107000	6109000	In house music
6109000	6111000	This time
6111000	6113000	That was something that concerned me too
6113000	6115000	About going into the game is that they
6115000	6117000	Weren't going to have the money to do all that license stuff
6117000	6119000	So I really wanted to see
6119000	6121000	Part of the reason I didn't back it
6121000	6123000	I wanted to see what the quality of the game
6123000	6125000	Was going to be first
6125000	6127000	If it was going to be able to live up to the original
6127000	6129000	I get in the sense it is from a lot of the YouTubes
6129000	6131000	And stuff that I'm seeing but
6131000	6133000	There's also a part of me that's like
6133000	6135000	It's just a lot
6135000	6137000	Just rock band blitz
6137000	6139000	And
6139000	6141000	I kind of just want to see them do rock band
6141000	6143000	Blitz on Playstation 4 and
6143000	6145000	Xbox One I kind of wish they'd do that
6145000	6147000	I don't know what's going on over at Harmonix
6147000	6149000	But I feel like they're just losing their touch
6149000	6151000	Overall
6151000	6153000	And you see some people out there abandoning ship a little bit
6153000	6155000	Which is a little weird so
6155000	6157000	I also don't like, and I understand that
6157000	6159000	This is part of the nature of Kickstarter
6159000	6161000	But I don't like that the super
6161000	6163000	Uber backers get an extra song
6163000	6165000	That we apparently will never get
6165000	6167000	I think
6167000	6169000	That's kind of a bad decision
6169000	6171000	And also
6171000	6173000	Makes me feel like
6173000	6175000	Maybe they do another Kickstarter
6175000	6177000	Maybe I won't support it because
6177000	6179000	I'm not going to pay $200
6179000	6181000	To get an extra song
6181000	6183000	But they expect
6183000	6185000	Me to throw them money to get what now
6185000	6187000	I feel is an incomplete game
6187000	6189000	ActDeft in chat
6189000	6191000	Over at live.vognetwork.com says
6191000	6193000	Having licensed music
6193000	6195000	Costs money, lots of money
6195000	6197000	Not lots of money
6197000	6199000	I saw how much it cost
6199000	6201000	At Konami when we did DDR
6201000	6203000	Some of that stuff is super cheap you'd be surprised
6203000	6205000	So maybe
6205000	6207000	But also
6207000	6209000	And you don't have to go for well known stuff
6209000	6211000	Yeah, DDR also never really went for the AAA stuff
6211000	6213000	Like
6213000	6215000	Yeah we had garbage in that, that was cool
6215000	6217000	We had David Bowie in
6217000	6219000	Amplitude or Frequency, that was cool
6219000	6221000	But at the time
6221000	6223000	I'm sure Quarashi didn't cost
6223000	6225000	$3,000 to put in the game
6225000	6227000	They still win
6227000	6229000	They'd probably pay you $3,000 to get in the game
6229000	6231000	Because they probably aren't doing anything
6231000	6233000	It's stuff like that
6233000	6235000	Don't go for big names, but go for
6235000	6237000	A name
6237000	6239000	It would just kind of help balance it a bit
6239000	6241000	I think
6241000	6243000	I kind of skimmed the soundtrack
6243000	6245000	Or the song list rather
6245000	6247000	At Playstation Experience
6247000	6249000	A lot of it just sounded like electronic music
6249000	6251000	That's cool
6251000	6253000	But I want something more
6253000	6255000	I think that's what really brought a lot of the charm to the game
6255000	6257000	And I don't see that there
6257000	6259000	Bobby Blackwolf
6259000	6261000	Offering a different perspective saying
6261000	6263000	It may have been cheap before music games took off
6263000	6265000	But the music licensing landscape changed
6265000	6267000	With regards to video games
6267000	6269000	Rock Band and Guitar Hero
6269000	6271000	They always go for a very big AAA genre
6271000	6273000	I think back to some of the greatest
6273000	6275000	DDR games
6275000	6277000	I still think the best one they ever did here in the US was Ultramix 2
6277000	6279000	And with that series
6279000	6281000	It was a lot of really unknown
6281000	6283000	That game alone
6283000	6285000	Introduced me to so many new
6285000	6287000	Bands that were amazing
6287000	6289000	Granted, some of those bands were
6289000	6291000	Part of a label that maybe
6291000	6293000	Konami had a partnership with
6293000	6295000	To get cheaper stuff
6295000	6297000	Again, you don't have to go for huge things
6297000	6299000	Go for
6299000	6301000	They're based out in Boston
6301000	6303000	Go for local random Boston artists
6303000	6305000	It doesn't matter
6305000	6307000	It just brings something different
6307000	6309000	That's why Freezepop is always in the game
6309000	6311000	Go get some random hip hop artist
6311000	6313000	In Boston that's not a big name
6313000	6315000	Or a hard rock artist
6315000	6317000	Something like that
6317000	6319000	Just get me something that's not just electronic music
6319000	6321000	Just diversify
6321000	6323000	The soundtrack a little bit
6323000	6325000	Alright, well let's move on to another story
6325000	6327000	That talks about the NX
6327000	6329000	We brought up Nintendo's successor
6329000	6331000	To the Wii U a little earlier
6331000	6333000	The NX, although of course that won't be the final name
6333000	6335000	But that's what everybody's calling it right now
6335000	6337000	Because the hype is growing more and more
6337000	6339000	About the NX possibly
6339000	6341000	Releasing next year
6341000	6343000	But, the analysts are coming out
6343000	6345000	And the analysts are having their say
6345000	6347000	On what's going on
6347000	6349000	And you know this guy always
6349000	6351000	Has to say something when it comes to video game analytics
6351000	6353000	And that's Michael Patcher
6353000	6355000	He's still something?
6355000	6357000	Yeah, and I don't know the guy
6357000	6359000	And whatever, I know other podcasts
6359000	6361000	Have had him on, he's probably very pleasant
6361000	6363000	But at the same time
6363000	6365000	I really think what he's doing isn't all that different
6365000	6367000	Than what you and I are doing
6367000	6369000	He's just got some more schooling
6369000	6371000	And experience in financial industries
6371000	6373000	But I see him commenting on
6373000	6375000	Entertainment stuff all the time too
6375000	6377000	It's not just video games
6377000	6379000	But anyway, here's what Patcher says
6379000	6381000	First, mobile game will flop
6381000	6383000	Miitomo will get 100 million downloads
6383000	6385000	So it'll be a success
6385000	6387000	But it'll drop out of the top 100 grossing games
6387000	6389000	On iOS and Android by the year end
6389000	6391000	I think people will try it, but I don't think they'll find
6391000	6393000	Social chat compelling enough to spend money
6393000	6395000	In my opinion, Miitomo offers
6395000	6397000	Little that isn't already widely available on Facebook
6397000	6399000	Younger consumers not on Facebook
6399000	6401000	Will probably find it appealing, but they typically have
6401000	6403000	Little or no access to credit
6403000	6405000	So Nintendo will have trouble monetizing Miitomo
6405000	6407000	To his credit
6407000	6409000	I actually kind of see that perspective
6409000	6411000	A little bit, but I also think we know
6411000	6413000	Way too little about Miitomo
6413000	6415000	To say that it's going to do nothing
6415000	6417000	Instead of just the social stuff
6417000	6419000	So I don't know, we'll see though
6419000	6421000	Nintendo's second mobile game
6421000	6423000	Will be a resounding success
6423000	6425000	I actually think Miitomo is intended to be a platform
6425000	6427000	That allows people to create a personalized image or character
6427000	6429000	And use it on other Nintendo games
6429000	6431000	I am hopeful that the second effort
6431000	6433000	Is something more familiar, such as the
6433000	6435000	Super Mario platformer
6435000	6437000	I think the game will attract 200 million downloads
6437000	6439000	And will be a top 20 or possibly top 10
6439000	6441000	Grossing game on both iOS and Android
6441000	6443000	But here's the other big one
6443000	6445000	The NX won't come out in 2016
6445000	6447000	Nintendo has a history of announcing
6447000	6449000	Consoles in one year and launching the next
6449000	6451000	And I don't see the NX
6451000	6453000	As deviating from that pattern
6453000	6455000	William Ritterface
6455000	6457000	With a comment or chat over at
6457000	6459000	Live.FogNetwork.com
6459000	6461000	Why should we care what he says?
6461000	6463000	That's an excellent question
6463000	6465000	No matter what I say and all this stuff about him
6465000	6467000	Because his analytics
6467000	6469000	Are so well respected and so forth
6469000	6471000	Investors listen
6471000	6473000	To what he says
6473000	6475000	And invest their money
6475000	6477000	Sometimes as a result of his
6477000	6479000	Predictions, so to speak
6479000	6481000	That's a lot of what the stock market is
6481000	6483000	And a lot of these analytics
6483000	6485000	Come in
6485000	6487000	When we talk about the stock market
6487000	6489000	That's the reality
6489000	6491000	Whether you agree with it or not
6491000	6493000	We're in turn mentioning this
6493000	6495000	Because these comments
6495000	6497000	Get picked up on Wall Street
6497000	6499000	Journal-esque type of sites
6499000	6501000	And could
6501000	6503000	Possibly impact investorship
6503000	6505000	On into 2016
6505000	6507000	And even Dungeon Buster in chat
6507000	6509000	Says, Patrick's a Wall Street analyst so he's just
6509000	6511000	Looking at it from an investor standpoint
6511000	6513000	Interesting
6513000	6515000	Though that last comment there, I don't want to gloss over
6515000	6517000	This, NX won't come out in 2016
6517000	6519000	Nintendo has a history
6519000	6521000	Of announcing consoles in one year
6521000	6523000	And launching the next
6523000	6525000	And I don't see the NX as deviating
6525000	6527000	From that pattern
6527000	6529000	Announcing how though? Because they kind of announced
6529000	6531000	It already
6531000	6533000	And that's a very good counterpoint
6533000	6535000	They've said more about NX
6535000	6537000	At this point than they said about Wii U
6537000	6539000	This far out
6539000	6541000	So they have kind of already said
6541000	6543000	This is something we're working on
6543000	6545000	Even though
6545000	6547000	You always know these big companies are working on
6547000	6549000	Successors, Playstation 5
6549000	6551000	Xbox
6551000	6553000	Whatever they call it, 2
6553000	6555000	They're in development right now
6555000	6557000	But you know, obviously
6557000	6559000	It's going to be a while before we see the results of that
6559000	6561000	So obviously
6561000	6563000	Nintendo is working on a successor
6563000	6565000	It's just usually not talked about so publicly
6565000	6567000	So that's why I think we feel like it's coming
6567000	6569000	A little sooner than it might
6569000	6571000	But to be fair, the Wii U was shown
6571000	6573000	A long time before it came out
6573000	6575000	Because I think they wanted to
6575000	6577000	Get more developers on board
6577000	6579000	Because Nintendo is always that
6579000	6581000	We've got a silly concept type of thing
6581000	6583000	And so Nintendo shows it
6583000	6585000	So that the developers can start
6585000	6587000	Thinking about how they want to use it
6587000	6589000	I also think it's for consumer benefit too
6589000	6591000	Because you just throw something out there
6591000	6593000	That
6593000	6595000	Out there
6595000	6597000	And they're not going to understand what to do with it
6597000	6599000	So if this isn't super crazy
6599000	6601000	Like the Wii or Wii U
6601000	6603000	Maybe they wouldn't need that extra time
6603000	6605000	Alright, well
6605000	6607000	We'll see what happens
6607000	6609000	Obviously this is all just
6609000	6611000	Miss Cleo future predicting
6611000	6613000	Until E3
6613000	6615000	Which is when we're probably going to hear
6615000	6617000	What it's really called instead of NX
6617000	6619000	Let's just hope they give it a good name
6619000	6621000	And we'll see
6621000	6623000	What the catch is about the system
6623000	6625000	And what's to expect
6625000	6627000	Alright, let's move on
6627000	6629000	Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates
6629000	6631000	Well, we have a statement that was
6631000	6633000	Put out
6633000	6635000	By
6635000	6637000	Kimishima
6637000	6639000	The new Nintendo president
6639000	6641000	Who had a few things
6641000	6643000	To say about the year in review
6643000	6645000	It was something that was released
6645000	6647000	To shareholders and investors
6647000	6649000	The big thing on here though
6649000	6651000	Is that he made a mention
6651000	6653000	I'm just
6653000	6655000	Going to read this section
6655000	6657000	Because it's going to illustrate it
6657000	6659000	Of course, very good
6659000	6661000	We leverage Nintendo IP
6661000	6663000	In various ways beyond our traditional
6663000	6665000	Use of them
6665000	6667000	Predominantly within the dedicated video game platform business
6667000	6669000	Furthermore
6669000	6671000	In our attempt to establish
6671000	6673000	A sustainable and continual relationship
6673000	6675000	With our customers
6675000	6677000	Sorry, consumers
6677000	6679000	We are creating a new membership service
6679000	6681000	Called My Nintendo
6681000	6683000	And a new account system
6683000	6685000	Which will work as a bridge between our dedicated
6685000	6687000	Video game platforms and other devices
6687000	6689000	Where our consumers can get in touch with Nintendo IP
6689000	6691000	And thus
6691000	6693000	Will work as a mechanism to
6693000	6695000	Maximize the number of people
6695000	6697000	That interact with Nintendo's IP
6697000	6699000	That
6699000	6701000	Seems to me that
6701000	6703000	They're
6703000	6705000	Already, I think, looking outside
6705000	6707000	Of just standard video game stuff
6707000	6709000	They did start off as a card company
6709000	6711000	But I think that they're trying
6711000	6713000	To work for
6713000	6715000	Everything, toys, figures
6715000	6717000	Non-video games
6717000	6719000	Things like that
6719000	6721000	It seems to me that
6721000	6723000	We're going to be hearing a lot more about
6723000	6725000	My Nintendo
6725000	6727000	I'd say
6727000	6729000	Yeah, I mean, they've had such success
6729000	6731000	With the toy thing
6731000	6733000	And they're hoping to have a lot of success with mobile
6733000	6735000	I don't know how Pokemon Go
6735000	6737000	Is going to play into that
6737000	6739000	I understand Pokemon Company is their own separate thing
6739000	6741000	But it would be very interesting to see if that does tie back
6741000	6743000	Into the Nintendo infrastructure
6743000	6745000	One way or another
6745000	6747000	But we, of course, know about Miitomo
6747000	6749000	And they want to grow that as well
6749000	6751000	So you basically have Nintendo across
6751000	6753000	All these platforms
6753000	6755000	Which, to be fair,
6755000	6757000	Microsoft's probably the closest
6757000	6759000	Otherwise
6759000	6761000	Because your Xbox, Microsoft account
6761000	6763000	Can work on your Windows
6763000	6765000	And works in a lot of those other places
6765000	6767000	I don't think Sony's really there with what they've got going on on PlayStation
6767000	6769000	Because Sony hasn't really penetrated
6769000	6771000	Other parts of
6771000	6773000	Your living room and your office
6773000	6775000	If that makes sense
6775000	6777000	Haha, penetrated
6777000	6779000	You want me to say it again, Dar Sakura?
6779000	6781000	Penetrated
6781000	6783000	Sony has not yet
6783000	6785000	Penetrated, but they hope to
6785000	6787000	They're hoping to get some
6787000	6789000	Yes
6789000	6791000	The other thing, though, is that
6791000	6793000	They did mention NX
6793000	6795000	In the statement
6795000	6799000	Without going into too much detail about it
6799000	6801000	But just as it says on here
6801000	6803000	Nintendo is currently developing
6803000	6805000	A gaming platform codenamed NX
6805000	6807000	With a brand new concept
6807000	6809000	And our unique software-led hardware
6809000	6811000	Software integrated business
6811000	6813000	Will continue to constitute the core business
6813000	6815000	For Nintendo
6815000	6817000	So
6817000	6819000	I think they're banking a lot on NX
6819000	6821000	On top of that
6821000	6823000	So there's a few things to be read into this
6823000	6825000	Speculation, of course
6825000	6827000	Which, again, they're talking about all this now
6827000	6829000	I think it actually supports that we could be seeing
6829000	6831000	NX, whatever it is, a little sooner rather than later
6831000	6833000	But I also
6833000	6835000	I can still
6835000	6837000	Also understand the whole, don't get your hopes up
6837000	6839000	That it's a sure thing for
6839000	6841000	December 2016, because maybe
6841000	6843000	The focus is really going to be on
6843000	6845000	Zelda on the Wii U
6845000	6847000	At this point, it wouldn't surprise me one bit
6847000	6849000	If Zelda is all the way holiday
6849000	6851000	Next year, be ready for that
6851000	6853000	And mobile
6853000	6855000	Their renewed focus on mobile
6855000	6857000	The transition to NX in 2017, who knows
6857000	6859000	Anyway
6859000	6861000	Let's move on, we're going to travel around the world
6861000	6863000	And check out some release dates
6863000	6865000	But I think it's probably going to be
6865000	6867000	A little slow this week
6867000	6869000	I tried to look at the US release dates for Loki
6869000	6871000	And nothing's out this week
6871000	6873000	In the US
6873000	6875000	Hooray, because I didn't see anything to look up
6875000	6877000	There isn't, I checked the sources
6877000	6879000	Which, of course, there's nothing new this week
6879000	6881000	And going over to Japan
6881000	6883000	Nothing coming out in Japan
6883000	6885000	So I don't know, does Europe
6885000	6887000	Have any games to save this segment this week?
6887000	6889000	Do we have any late December releases?
6889000	6891000	Yes, now there's nothing for
6893000	6895000	The New Year, I checked on that
6895000	6897000	But we do have a release for the 30th
6897000	6899000	And that's Story of Seasons for 3DS
6899000	6901000	That's
6901000	6903000	It
6903000	6905000	One lone 3DS title in the entire world
6905000	6907000	Is launching this week
6907000	6909000	It's so lonely
6909000	6911000	It's a lonely story
6911000	6913000	That's right, it's the best game
6913000	6915000	In the entire world
6915000	6917000	For the last week of the year
6917000	6919000	Alright
6919000	6921000	Just a couple more stories for you guys
6921000	6923000	Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week
6923000	6925000	Let's get to it
6925000	6927000	Who's going next, Flaco?
6927000	6929000	There's this giant picture on the article
6929000	6931000	Oh wait, it looks like it's gone away
6931000	6933000	Okay, so
6933000	6935000	Tekken Cross Street Fighter is still happening
6935000	6937000	No, don't pop up on my thing
6937000	6939000	It's still happening
6939000	6941000	Actually no, Tekken Cross Street Fighter
6941000	6943000	Is supposed to be better than Street Fighter Cross Tekken
6943000	6945000	Because I have more faith in Namco
6945000	6947000	Than Capcom right now
6947000	6949000	Well I guess they recently revealed that Akuma
6949000	6951000	Is going to be joining the Tekken 7 cast
6951000	6953000	I don't know anything about these games
6953000	6955000	Just sound like you do
6955000	6957000	I totally know everything about
6957000	6959000	Tekken Cross Street Fighter
6959000	6961000	I did see Street Fighter
6961000	6963000	At the PlayStation experience, I saw a little bit of the
6963000	6965000	Tournament
6965000	6967000	Did you see the Street Fighter movie?
6967000	6969000	I did watch the movie
6969000	6971000	So I'm very well informed now
6971000	6973000	Although I did see that movie
6973000	6975000	I just don't play fighting games that much
6975000	6977000	People were wondering if
6977000	6979000	They were still going to make
6979000	6981000	Oh wait is it
6981000	6983000	Tekken Cross Street Fighter
6983000	6985000	So they're still making that one
6985000	6987000	The quote here is from
6987000	6989000	Senior designer Michael Murray
6989000	6991000	Said, it's still in development
6991000	6993000	That's the quote
6993000	6995000	Please look forward to it
6995000	6997000	It's been a period to launch the game
6997000	6999000	Since Tekken 7 was released
6999000	7001000	For the moment we are focused on Tekken 7
7001000	7003000	But he says it's still in development
7003000	7005000	But we might recycle the engine and use it
7005000	7007000	For Tekken Cross Street Fighter
7007000	7009000	As Capcom did with Street Fighter 4
7009000	7011000	But it seems like there's been a lot of fighting games
7011000	7013000	Doing well lately it seems like
7013000	7015000	Especially on PlayStation 4
7015000	7017000	I would be curious about
7017000	7019000	Tekken Cross Street Fighter
7019000	7021000	I think that could be interesting
7021000	7023000	Who do I have to sleep with
7023000	7025000	For Capcom vs SNK to happen again
7025000	7027000	That's the one that I want more than anything
7027000	7029000	I want to play Tekken 7
7029000	7031000	Because they have a really hot character
7031000	7033000	In it named Shaheen
7033000	7035000	He is super good looking
7035000	7037000	Shaheen? What?
7037000	7039000	He's the Middle Eastern fighter
7039000	7041000	Yes he is
7041000	7043000	He is super gorgeous
7043000	7045000	I'll tell you what impressed me about that one
7045000	7047000	Is that they actually did interview
7047000	7049000	People from the region he's supposed to be from
7049000	7051000	To make an accurate character
7051000	7053000	Doing their research
7053000	7055000	Indeed doing their homework
7055000	7057000	Being ethnically sensitive
7057000	7059000	Tekken Cross Street Fighter was first revealed
7059000	7061000	In 2010 or unveiled whatever
7061000	7063000	Alongside Street Fighter Cross Tekken
7063000	7065000	Street Fighter Cross Tekken took only two years
7065000	7067000	Afterwards to come out
7067000	7069000	This has been going almost six years
7069000	7071000	What are we going to get first?
7071000	7073000	Let's say but what will we get first?
7073000	7075000	Okay here we go
7075000	7077000	Will we see
7077000	7079000	Tekken Cross Street Fighter
7079000	7081000	Kingdom Hearts 3
7081000	7083000	Or Final Fantasy 15
7083000	7085000	15 first
7085000	7087000	Then Kingdom Hearts 3 we've seen enough of
7087000	7089000	That we know it's going to come out eventually
7089000	7091000	I got one more
7091000	7093000	The Final Fantasy 7 Remake
7093000	7095000	Episode 1
7095000	7097000	I bet it will come out before all those other ones
7097000	7099000	Probably so
7099000	7101000	You think Final Fantasy 7 Episode 1 is going to be first?
7101000	7103000	I think it will be before 15
7103000	7105000	You guys are high
7105000	7107000	I think Final Fantasy 15 is the first
7107000	7109000	15 they have to put a whole game out
7109000	7111000	7 Remake Episode 1
7111000	7113000	You guys are high
7113000	7115000	I think it's going to be
7115000	7117000	That's wishful thinking
7117000	7119000	It's going to be Final Fantasy 15
7119000	7121000	Then the 7 Remake
7121000	7123000	And Dark Dead Studio you can time stamp this
7123000	7125000	For Shane to play later when I'm wrong
7125000	7127000	It's fine
7127000	7129000	But it's going to be 15 first then the 7 Remake
7129000	7131000	Then Tekken Cross Street Fighter
7131000	7133000	No then Kingdom Hearts
7133000	7135000	Because we've seen footage of Kingdom Hearts
7135000	7137000	When's the last time you saw Tekken Cross Street Fighter
7137000	7139000	Never
7139000	7141000	I saw Tekken 7 footage and you know they're just going to shove
7141000	7143000	Chun Li into Tekken 7's engine
7143000	7145000	That's what's going to happen
7145000	7147000	That sounds gross
7147000	7149000	Well he did recently mention
7149000	7151000	It is quote, pretty far
7151000	7153000	In development
7153000	7155000	They drew the logo
7155000	7157000	Hold on we have to do this again
7157000	7159000	What do we have now?
7159000	7161000	We have Tekken Cross Street Fighter
7161000	7163000	Final Fantasy 7 Remake Episode 1
7163000	7165000	Final Fantasy 15
7165000	7167000	Kingdom Hearts 3
7167000	7169000	And you ready for one more?
7169000	7171000	Half Life 3
7171000	7173000	That doesn't even count that's a myth
7173000	7175000	But no Last Guardian
7175000	7177000	Where does that fall?
7177000	7179000	After Final Fantasy 15
7179000	7181000	Before 7's Remake
7181000	7183000	No Man's Sky
7183000	7185000	Alright
7185000	7187000	That's enough
7187000	7189000	I forgot about that game
7189000	7191000	Because it's never coming out
7191000	7193000	I swear they're trying to
7193000	7195000	Wedge that into VR somehow
7195000	7197000	Probably
7197000	7199000	Oh my gosh that'd be fun
7199000	7201000	Dark Tetsuya sums up
7201000	7203000	This segment perfectly by saying
7203000	7205000	Oh for fuck's sake
7205000	7207000	That's something I would
7207000	7209000	Expect Dark Sakura to sigh over there in the corner
7209000	7211000	I would say
7211000	7213000	For fuck's sake but I don't give a fuck
7215000	7217000	I'm looking at Buzzfeed
7217000	7219000	Y'all can just keep arguing about whatever
7219000	7221000	I feel like
7221000	7223000	Oh these top 25
7223000	7225000	gifts from Game of Thrones that showed when I
7225000	7227000	didn't give a fuck like is that what you're looking at right now?
7227000	7229000	No I'm actually looking at
7229000	7231000	this picture of gorillas
7231000	7233000	inserted into
7233000	7235000	The
7235000	7237000	The Force Awakens
7237000	7239000	I know how she feels
7239000	7241000	Alright
7241000	7243000	All joking aside I feel like this should be a segment
7243000	7245000	Because I feel like Loki would have a lot of fun with this
7245000	7247000	Like what will happen first
7247000	7249000	This
7249000	7251000	This or Half Life 3
7251000	7253000	And that should be the
7253000	7255000	We're gonna play this more often
7255000	7257000	Maybe we can get a game
7257000	7259000	widget on the site
7259000	7261000	Maybe Bobby will have another rainy day project there
7261000	7263000	We can have a
7263000	7265000	This, this or Half Life 3 what's gonna happen first
7265000	7267000	You know what I just thought of an idea of a segment
7267000	7269000	Just now
7269000	7271000	Da fuck is that
7271000	7273000	Where we get the weirdest of all weird
7273000	7275000	Vaguely video game related things
7275000	7277000	And just say da fuck is that
7277000	7279000	We can start with that dish you have
7279000	7281000	that came with the Dreamcast game
7281000	7283000	Da fuck is that
7283000	7285000	Oh that's just Japanese marketing
7285000	7287000	Alright
7287000	7289000	Ikuma-san tell us
7289000	7291000	Don't like isn't it a really big thing to have weird
7291000	7293000	collector's editions of everything
7293000	7295000	popular in Japan
7295000	7297000	Some
7297000	7299000	Some folks in chat are very supportive about the
7299000	7301000	new segment idea we might have to make that happen
7301000	7303000	Tigerclass says I'm surprised you guys didn't do
7303000	7305000	a list list for what you want to see happen in 2016
7305000	7307000	You know that actually was on the agenda for tonight
7307000	7309000	when I thought Loki was still gonna be here
7309000	7311000	I didn't want to do it without him so we'll probably roll that over to next
7311000	7313000	week so plus we're actually
7313000	7315000	We're already at 8 o'clock and haven't even taken a break yet
7315000	7317000	I'm hungry
7317000	7319000	Alright well let's quickly then talk
7319000	7321000	about Killer Instinct a fighting game
7321000	7323000	which none of you have mentioned
7323000	7325000	I did
7325000	7327000	Yeah god you don't pay attention
7327000	7329000	Yes he just mentioned it
7329000	7331000	Honorable mentions
7331000	7333000	I know
7333000	7335000	I said season
7335000	7337000	I said season 2 was like an honorable mention
7337000	7339000	Okay so what's gonna happen
7339000	7341000	first the Final Fantasy 7 remake
7341000	7343000	Half Life 3 or Rob
7343000	7345000	listens to Shane
7345000	7347000	It's not the last one
7347000	7349000	So anyway
7349000	7351000	well alright then since Shane is hanging
7351000	7353000	on everything this game does Killer Instinct
7353000	7355000	will be bringing a combo assist
7355000	7357000	mode to the game I guess to make
7357000	7359000	pulling off combos in the game a little easier
7359000	7361000	so you can button mash even more
7361000	7363000	to your heart's content but the good news is
7363000	7365000	the old way of doing combos will still work
7365000	7367000	for those of you guys that got used to it
7367000	7369000	so assisted
7369000	7371000	combos basically you tap a second attack button
7371000	7373000	during the cancel window of a first
7373000	7375000	and that will transition your character into a
7375000	7377000	special move after that another
7377000	7379000	button press will do an auto double
7379000	7381000	now that's already in the game but yet another
7381000	7383000	will do an auto linker and then ending
7383000	7385000	the combo it's as easy as forward
7385000	7387000	and doing a heavy punch or kick and they
7387000	7389000	they have some visuals and I'm sure this will be
7389000	7391000	in the game to be explained as well but they're
7391000	7393000	making comboing in Killer Instinct a lot
7393000	7395000	easier and all joking aside with
7395000	7397000	me listening or not listening to Shane
7397000	7399000	Shane did convince me
7399000	7401000	to pick up I think it's
7401000	7403000	Season 2 I got on Xbox One
7403000	7405000	Cinder, that's all you need is Cinder
7405000	7407000	and I've been having fun with that
7407000	7409000	it's a good fighting game
7409000	7411000	and they did such a better job with Season 2
7411000	7413000	with the story mode because
7413000	7415000	it's actually like interesting
7415000	7417000	whereas Season 1 was really dull
7417000	7419000	and bare bones
7419000	7421000	alright the combo assist coming
7421000	7423000	to Killer Instinct in their next update
7423000	7425000	which I don't think is dated as
7425000	7427000	of yet but I imagine it's in the coming days probably next
7427000	7429000	month alright so
7429000	7431000	let's get to a time when
7431000	7433000	games they didn't get these regular
7433000	7435000	monthly updates
7435000	7437000	you had a cartridge and that was
7437000	7439000	it take it or fucking leave it
7439000	7441000	it's the classic game of the
7441000	7443000	week Dark Sakura
7443000	7445000	she don't give a fuck about these new
7445000	7447000	games so she's gonna
7447000	7449000	go into the gaming vault
7449000	7451000	she's gonna go into the gaming vault and find
7451000	7453000	a game that she thinks hey
7453000	7455000	you kids should all be playing this game this week
7455000	7457000	Dark Sakura what is the classic
7457000	7459000	game of the week
7459000	7461000	I think you should let the video answer that question for us
7465000	7467000	there you go I have to hit play that helps
7467000	7469000	huh?
7469000	7471000	well
7471000	7473000	well done
7473000	7475000	I picked
7475000	7477000	Kirby's Avalanche because yes I've already done
7477000	7479000	Puyo Puyo and I've mentioned
7479000	7481000	Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's
7481000	7483000	Mean Bean Machine in that segment
7483000	7485000	but I wanted to do Kirby's Avalanche in particular
7485000	7487000	because it is my favorite of all the Puyo Puyo games
7487000	7489000	it was my introduction
7489000	7491000	to Puyo Puyo and I think a lot of people
7491000	7493000	stateside who didn't follow the import scene
7493000	7495000	really I think it was this or Dr. Robotnik's
7495000	7497000	Mean Bean Machine so it's a fair pick
7497000	7499000	exactly and also
7499000	7501000	I did it in honor of
7501000	7503000	Act Deft for sending me
7503000	7505000	the delicious gift of his
7505000	7507000	Oreos that Dan and I might have eaten all of
7507000	7509000	if you find more
7509000	7511000	I will seriously do another trade with you
7511000	7513000	and I will send you those
7513000	7515000	rich cream flavored
7515000	7517000	Oreo things
7517000	7519000	and I found the blueberry cheesecake one so I'll send you
7519000	7521000	those too this is like a million more Kirby
7521000	7523000	games she can make the classic game of the week so there you go
7523000	7525000	I've done other Kirby games
7525000	7527000	there's still more I bet
7527000	7529000	like Act Deft
7529000	7531000	like has pictures of Dark Sakura
7531000	7533000	by his bed not in a creepy way but
7533000	7535000	just like cause he loves her so much for all the
7535000	7537000	Kirby games she always picks
7537000	7539000	that's still in a creepy way if they're by the bed
7539000	7541000	hey I'm allowed to be worshipped
7541000	7543000	no
7543000	7545000	that would be in a closet with candles
7545000	7547000	that you'd have to have like a double door
7547000	7549000	Act Deft take pictures of you trying to make cookies
7549000	7551000	actually
7551000	7553000	I'll just settle for more cookies cause those
7553000	7555000	were amazing
7555000	7557000	short tangent
7557000	7559000	Dan who's like stop buying cookies
7559000	7561000	why do we have all these cookies he's like
7561000	7563000	oh my god those are the best cookies I've ever eaten in my life
7563000	7565000	how dare any human say to
7565000	7567000	another stop buying cookies
7567000	7569000	what kind of is this fascism
7569000	7571000	I married that I love you Dan
7571000	7573000	hearts
7573000	7575000	anyway Kirby's Avalanche
7575000	7577000	was known in Europe as
7577000	7579000	Kirby's Ghost Trap
7579000	7581000	and it is of course a puzzle game that was done
7581000	7583000	by HAL Laboratory
7583000	7585000	and by HAL because high is Puyo Puyo
7585000	7587000	and bad presto
7587000	7589000	it came out on February 1st
7589000	7591000	1995 in Europe
7591000	7593000	so it came out in Europe first
7593000	7595000	and April 25th 1995 in North America
7595000	7597000	which I actually got this game
7597000	7599000	right after my birthday
7599000	7601000	right after I graduated
7601000	7603000	high school
7603000	7605000	it is basically the Western
7605000	7607000	release of Super Puyo Puyo
7607000	7609000	and technically the 4th Kirby game
7609000	7611000	that was released for the Super Nintendo
7611000	7613000	basically
7613000	7615000	I mean it really is just Puyo Puyo
7615000	7617000	you have two colored blobs
7617000	7619000	that fall from the top of the screen
7619000	7621000	and you gotta rotate them and match them up
7621000	7623000	and once you get 4 or more of the same color touching
7623000	7625000	they'll disappear and the blobs from above
7625000	7627000	will fall down and you can do
7627000	7629000	combos that way and drop like big
7629000	7631000	like kinda clear-ish rock
7631000	7633000	blobs on whoever you're playing against
7633000	7635000	so you have a
7635000	7637000	storyline for this
7637000	7639000	and basically
7639000	7641000	it has almost the same
7641000	7643000	storyline for Super Puyo Puyo
7643000	7645000	so basically
7645000	7647000	King Dedede
7647000	7649000	challenged Kirby and
7649000	7651000	all the other people who live in Dreamland
7651000	7653000	to an avalanche competition
7653000	7655000	at the Fountain of Dreams and Kirby
7655000	7657000	says you know what I'm gonna do this
7657000	7659000	although Kirby's kind of a
7659000	7661000	dick to Wispy Woods come to think of it
7661000	7663000	cause like Wispy Woods
7663000	7665000	is like hey don't step on my
7665000	7667000	root and Kirby's like bitch
7667000	7669000	I'm stepping on your root
7669000	7671000	oh yeah we'll play avalanche then
7671000	7673000	or Puyo Puyo
7673000	7675000	so yeah
7675000	7677000	I think Dark Soccer should explain lots of games
7677000	7679000	bitch
7679000	7681000	I'm gonna step on your root
7681000	7683000	Kirby was kind of a dick to
7683000	7685000	Wispy Woods
7685000	7687000	by the way there's this little gif going around
7687000	7689000	of Wispy Woods all decorated for Christmas
7689000	7691000	and Kirby going
7691000	7693000	his little sucky thing and turning into
7693000	7695000	a Christmas tree
7695000	7697000	Kirby as Bayonetta
7697000	7699000	is really effing adorable
7699000	7701000	just so we're clear
7701000	7703000	Kirby does suck
7703000	7705000	literally that's his power
7705000	7707000	is sucking
7707000	7709000	who can make sucking be so cool
7709000	7711000	why did he just say before he challenged Wispy Woods
7711000	7713000	he says I like apple pie
7713000	7715000	that's what he said
7715000	7717000	yeah he was like don't tread on my roots
7717000	7719000	yeah the tree was like don't tread on my roots
7719000	7721000	and Kirby was like I like apple pie
7721000	7723000	that made no sense
7723000	7725000	yeah
7725000	7727000	anyway
7727000	7729000	there are some differences
7729000	7731000	so with Super Puyo Puyo
7731000	7733000	it basically was Arl
7733000	7735000	and carbuncle
7735000	7737000	the big Puyo Puyo characters
7737000	7739000	basically going through
7739000	7741000	all of the story
7741000	7743000	challenging different characters
7743000	7745000	the Kirby's avalanche
7745000	7747000	it was all the typical Kirby characters
7747000	7749000	and the game did come out
7749000	7751000	much later in the Super Nintendo
7751000	7753000	so it had really
7753000	7755000	great colors
7755000	7757000	the music was good and did you hear
7757000	7759000	how good the voice was
7759000	7761000	the digitized
7761000	7763000	voice in this is great
7763000	7765000	the last Metroid is in captivity
7765000	7767000	the galaxy is at peace
7767000	7769000	well
7769000	7771000	at any rate though
7771000	7773000	this version
7773000	7775000	all the music in it was original
7775000	7777000	all Kirby-ish music
7777000	7779000	except the panic music
7779000	7781000	oh no
7781000	7783000	it's another interlude
7783000	7785000	who blocked the path with this boulder
7785000	7787000	your road to glory ends here
7789000	7791000	oh hi are you ready
7791000	7793000	for a game of avalanche
7793000	7795000	I love this story
7795000	7797000	I like gumdrops and cake
7797000	7799000	no he didn't say that but he might as well
7799000	7801000	well they kind of do look like gumdrops
7801000	7803000	falling through the sky
7803000	7805000	there's one track from Puyo Puyo left
7805000	7807000	and that's the panic music
7807000	7809000	that's what it's about to do
7809000	7811000	but you're about to die anyway
7811000	7813000	so it's got the cinematics
7813000	7815000	as you can see
7815000	7817000	and
7817000	7819000	basically this is probably some of the
7819000	7821000	most conversation that you get out of
7821000	7823000	Kirby in a game
7823000	7825000	and yeah as you can see
7825000	7827000	he comes off a little bit dickish
7827000	7829000	a little bit more confrontational
7829000	7831000	he's a wee bit of a twat
7831000	7833000	does he talk in any other games?
7833000	7835000	I
7835000	7837000	don't know a ton about Kirby
7837000	7839000	because I only played the first couple games
7839000	7841000	but does he talk?
7841000	7843000	not very much
7843000	7845000	but he is a bit of a tit
7845000	7847000	the only dark soccer
7847000	7849000	I could get away with saying that
7849000	7851000	well Kirby he is a bit of a tit
7853000	7855000	anyway you can also
7855000	7857000	find the game on Wii Virtual Console
7857000	7859000	it came out in 2007 in July
7859000	7861000	um
7861000	7863000	and uh oh actually
7863000	7865000	I take that back in North America it came out September 24th
7865000	7867000	for 800 Wii points
7867000	7869000	and it is identical
7869000	7871000	to the original game except
7871000	7873000	that it has a cheat code that you
7873000	7875000	can get after completing competition mode
7875000	7877000	um
7877000	7879000	so that was pretty cool but Kirby's Avalanche is
7879000	7881000	you know
7881000	7883000	I actually I have to read this quote because
7883000	7885000	GamePro said it great
7885000	7887000	um although Kirby's Avalanche
7887000	7889000	is a rehash of a
7889000	7891000	dick
7891000	7893000	so he challenges this
7893000	7895000	broom and like I can't believe
7895000	7897000	I've got to clean up this entire forest
7897000	7899000	and then Kirby goes well you better clean up your
7899000	7901000	avalanche skills first
7901000	7903000	yeah what a dick
7903000	7905000	yeah
7905000	7907000	so anyway um I just like the way that this
7907000	7909000	is was said
7909000	7911000	although Kirby's Avalanche is a rehash
7911000	7913000	of an overdone puzzler theme
7913000	7915000	it's so well done that it's worth playing
7915000	7917000	that is if you don't already have three
7917000	7919000	puzzle games just like it
7919000	7921000	I think that is actually while it's
7921000	7923000	an interesting description for it
7923000	7925000	I think that Kirby's Avalanche especially
7925000	7927000	since we didn't get any other
7927000	7929000	P.O.P.O. games that I'm aware of in the U.S.
7929000	7931000	apart from Dr. Robotnik's
7931000	7933000	Mean Bean Machine
7933000	7935000	that this was something that's absolutely
7935000	7937000	uh a must buy
7937000	7939000	for uh
7939000	7941000	for people with the Super Nintendo
7941000	7943000	or you know
7943000	7945000	other things
7945000	7947000	on the Wii Virtual Console
7947000	7949000	um but absolutely worth it
7949000	7951000	in fact if you can the cartridge as I'm aware
7951000	7953000	actually I think goes for some money
7953000	7955000	now um but if you can
7955000	7957000	find it definitely get it it's
7957000	7959000	totally worth
7959000	7961000	having in your collection and it
7961000	7963000	is very challenging even in
7963000	7965000	easy mode it can get really difficult so
7965000	7967000	go for it
7967000	7969000	it's Kirby's Avalanche
7969000	7971000	there it is your classic game of the week
7971000	7973000	Kirby's Avalanche
7973000	7975000	and to sum that all up
7975000	7977000	DarkTetsuya in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
7977000	7979000	I can't even with this
7979000	7981000	conversation right now you know I'm just

8053000	8055000	yes uh Allen said Flaco go
8055000	8057000	look at the collection so he's in the other room checking
8057000	8059000	that out now uh because the
8059000	8061000	first half I'm using my
8061000	8063000	quotey fingers of our show actually ran for
8063000	8065000	over two hours which doesn't usually happen
8065000	8067000	uh and we're gonna make a small edit to our
8067000	8069000	flow and we're actually gonna be
8069000	8071000	because a lot of our news stories that we had in part B
8071000	8073000	were kinda not
8073000	8075000	huge news yeah cause
8075000	8077000	cause you know it's been a slower news week
8077000	8079000	we're actually gonna fast forward the show a little bit
8079000	8081000	so we can get to your calls and actually Dark Sakura
8081000	8083000	has to leave here
8083000	8085000	anyway yes cause I have to go to work
8085000	8087000	so I'm gonna be left without Loki and Dark
8087000	8089000	Sakura and I can't
8089000	8091000	just be left alone with Shane to run the show
8091000	8093000	well you won't be just alone with Shane
8093000	8095000	that's true we'll have Flaco he'll help me out but
8095000	8097000	I'll be here we will be hiding under your bed
8097000	8099000	we just realized that our microphone
8099000	8101000	colors are one of the Splatoon matchups we
8101000	8103000	get all the time macaroni and cheese versus dark blue
8103000	8105000	oh my gosh alright and
8105000	8107000	as you probably heard in the first half of the show
8107000	8109000	uh Splatoon topping
8109000	8111000	uh both Jim and
8111000	8113000	Shane's uh top games
8113000	8115000	of uh 2015 their favorites
8115000	8117000	and uh I don't know the top best
8117000	8119000	favorite top best most favoritest
8119000	8121000	um and I don't I don't think there was really any
8121000	8123000	game all three of us had on list so we really
8123000	8125000	couldn't come to a consensus so
8125000	8127000	cause like we both
8127000	8129000	had rocket league we both had everybody's gonna
8129000	8131000	the rapture you guys both had Splatoon
8131000	8133000	and until dawn until dawn
8133000	8135000	Jamie had to be unique that's okay
8135000	8137000	mine was legitimate
8137000	8139000	Rob so was mine
8139000	8141000	legitimately mine was legitimate
8141000	8143000	leer
8143000	8145000	words so we're gonna go right into
8145000	8147000	some more news with dark
8147000	8149000	Sakura well you
8149000	8151000	know um there'd been this uh
8151000	8153000	patent suit going on about
8153000	8155000	the Miis um there was a company
8155000	8157000	called
8157000	8159000	Recogni Corps who was suing Nintendo
8159000	8161000	because they said it violated
8161000	8163000	their uh patent
8163000	8165000	for storing facial sketch data
8165000	8167000	um when Nintendo
8167000	8169000	started making the MiI characters
8169000	8171000	well the uh
8171000	8173000	uh Judge Jones
8173000	8175000	who was in charge of the case
8175000	8177000	was like um
8177000	8179000	yeah no not really this is completely
8179000	8181000	different and Nintendo didn't
8181000	8183000	uh infringe on any uh
8183000	8185000	copyright so
8185000	8187000	of course they're very
8187000	8189000	happy with the uh
8189000	8191000	with the ruling and
8191000	8193000	um we don't know if uh Recogni
8193000	8195000	Corps will uh
8195000	8197000	appeal cause they can still appeal
8197000	8199000	but chances
8199000	8201000	are I mean the hope is that they won't
8201000	8203000	because I mean
8203000	8205000	Nintendo's got got the power
8205000	8207000	and it is quite different
8207000	8209000	than their method
8209000	8211000	their version was
8211000	8213000	um
8213000	8215000	more of from what I can
8215000	8217000	understand just storing data
8217000	8219000	to apply where Nintendo's
8219000	8221000	is actually
8221000	8223000	picking presets and putting them in
8223000	8225000	place so I mean if you really had
8225000	8227000	to do that for the MiI you'd have to do
8227000	8229000	that for any type of video game character
8229000	8231000	creation you know character creation
8231000	8233000	so yeah they they didn't really
8233000	8235000	have anything to stand on
8235000	8237000	As we see a lot of times
8237000	8239000	in these patent infringement suits
8239000	8241000	where it's like there may be
8241000	8243000	this one little derivative but
8243000	8245000	on the whole it's a completely different thing we see
8245000	8247000	this happen in gaming like a lot but
8247000	8249000	patent law it's complicated yo
8249000	8251000	and uh I don't think I've heard a lot you know
8251000	8253000	with all the talk and buzz about 2016
8253000	8255000	presidential elections maybe I've
8255000	8257000	missed it because people are talking about a lot of
8257000	8259000	stuff but I'm not really
8259000	8261000	hearing anybody talking about patent
8261000	8263000	reform and I guess maybe because that's not
8263000	8265000	you know people want to hear more about I don't know
8265000	8267000	healthcare or international
8267000	8269000	conflict and so forth but
8269000	8271000	I don't know I'd be curious to hear what
8271000	8273000	maybe some of these candidates want to do about
8273000	8275000	patent law and trademark
8275000	8277000	and some of that in this country because
8277000	8279000	the rules were not written in an internet
8279000	8281000	age and it's very obvious but anyhow
8281000	8283000	uh I
8283000	8285000	guess these patent things though for the
8285000	8287000	time being they're still going to continue and
8287000	8289000	that's why these companies have very large legal departments
8289000	8291000	indeed they do they
8291000	8293000	sure do alright let's
8293000	8295000	get into the FUs
8295000	8297000	of the week every week
8297000	8299000	uh we rant here a little bit on this show
8299000	8301000	why well uh because we can
8301000	8303000	sometimes we get angry
8311000	8313000	here is punishment
8313000	8315000	here
8315000	8317000	this is fucked up
8317000	8319000	dark soccer
8319000	8321000	um FU
8321000	8323000	to just how early
8323000	8325000	I have to be up in the morning
8325000	8327000	and I do like
8327000	8329000	having my week split kind of
8329000	8331000	with the two separate days off because
8331000	8333000	it makes my weeks feel shorter at the
8333000	8335000	same time I don't feel like
8335000	8337000	I get enough rest on my day off so just FU
8337000	8339000	be tired and sore
8339000	8341000	and heavy so that's it
8341000	8343000	and having to leave the show earlier
8343000	8345000	because I miss having
8345000	8347000	my Mondays as my day off
8347000	8349000	and your schedule
8349000	8351000	changes every few months so this won't last forever
8351000	8353000	yeah but part of me does
8353000	8355000	like though having to be split up so it all depends
8355000	8357000	you know honestly enough
8357000	8359000	if I worked on Sunday and kept
8359000	8361000	my same early shift
8361000	8363000	I would definitely be able to get to the show
8363000	8365000	and I'll have to
8365000	8367000	stay safe alright
8367000	8369000	uh I have two FUs this week before we get to my guests
8369000	8371000	my first one goes to my neck
8371000	8373000	it's still been like really sore ever since
8373000	8375000	you know that fall it was probably like three weeks ago right
8375000	8377000	now I've got this I probably have
8377000	8379000	even dark soccer I feel this because she probably knows more about
8379000	8381000	this stuff than I do I have this weird like bump
8381000	8383000	thing on the back of my neck
8383000	8385000	you feel that dark soccer right
8385000	8387000	hold on she's I'm getting a medical
8387000	8389000	exam here at Live Institute it's right
8389000	8391000	here yeah you
8391000	8393000	feel that isn't that weird
8393000	8395000	yeah now yeah that's what
8395000	8397000	it could be a cyst or something in there so
8397000	8399000	that's just great so FU to that
8399000	8401000	cause it's causing me like increased neck pain
8401000	8403000	it's horrible I would honestly
8403000	8405000	enough get that seen
8405000	8407000	yeah no I know I need to be a completely benign cyst
8407000	8409000	but it could also be um swelling
8409000	8411000	on the tendon itself yeah
8411000	8413000	no I know I need to get it seen but then here's the other
8413000	8415000	crappy thing my insurance completely
8415000	8417000	changes the first of the year so if I see
8417000	8419000	somebody now it's gonna be
8419000	8421000	something yeah exactly so good urgent
8421000	8423000	care yeah it might be what I have to do
8423000	8425000	which is if I didn't have another
8425000	8427000	stuff and I am not
8427000	8429000	a doctor but I was a massage therapist
8429000	8431000	for quite a while probably gonna wanna
8431000	8433000	ice that yeah good
8433000	8435000	times in 10 minute in no longer
8435000	8437000	than 10 minute increments and that would be
8437000	8439000	every hour I've had this for like
8439000	8441000	four days though
8443000	8445000	but anyway I know
8445000	8447000	I'm gonna say this now if ever you think
8447000	8449000	you have any kind of health
8449000	8451000	problem and something that
8451000	8453000	your body is doing abnormally if it
8453000	8455000	does not go away within a couple
8455000	8457000	of days get it seen
8457000	8459000	well I was hoping it would go away I keep
8459000	8461000	convincing myself it's getting smaller but anyway
8461000	8463000	not every problem goes away by ignoring
8463000	8465000	it some do
8465000	8467000	aren't you leaving no I'm just kidding
8467000	8469000	you know what I have
8469000	8471000	you're number one
8471000	8473000	in my book
8473000	8475000	she gave me a one finger to show me how much she loves me
8475000	8477000	alright moving on we got more FUs
8477000	8479000	Flocko
8479000	8481000	let's see FU2 oh yeah
8481000	8483000	you know you can connect your phone
8483000	8485000	on a little cord in your car
8485000	8487000	I don't know who else does that I do
8487000	8489000	charge you the phone and please use it
8489000	8491000	well mine keeps saying unsupported
8491000	8493000	version it's super annoying
8493000	8495000	happens all the time
8495000	8497000	yeah iPhone
8497000	8499000	alright I think it's dirty but
8499000	8501000	I always have to clean the dumb thing out
8501000	8503000	anyway are you using an official cable
8503000	8505000	yes
8505000	8507000	yeah it's weird I think it's my car
8507000	8509000	I probably just need to update the
8509000	8511000	firmware on my car but FU
8511000	8513000	it could be I have a loose connection
8513000	8515000	with the cord because it's been ripped out by my
8515000	8517000	fat foot so many times that I think
8517000	8519000	it's the car plug not the phone plug
8519000	8521000	that's causing me problems
8521000	8523000	yeah I think it might be the car plug
8523000	8525000	or like I said I've never updated the car's firmware
8525000	8527000	which I'm sure you could do if you plug a USB
8527000	8529000	god that's so weird I gotta update the car's
8529000	8531000	firmware I need to update the firmware on my TV
8531000	8533000	gotta download the new car
8533000	8535000	and I know that's a big thing with like Tesla's now
8535000	8537000	and a lot of other new vehicles
8537000	8539000	it's like you know I gotta
8539000	8541000	my car is gonna
8541000	8543000	evolve like it's a Pokemon overnight
8543000	8545000	while it's plugged in I have a super old TV
8545000	8547000	and when I got a PS4 it looked terrible on there
8547000	8549000	I had to update the firmware because it was
8549000	8551000	downgrading the graphics
8551000	8553000	it was really strange that's so weird to me
8553000	8555000	yeah my TV
8555000	8557000	is an internet TV so I had to
8557000	8559000	download it from the internet put it on the thumb drive
8559000	8561000	and then plug the thumb drive into the USB port
8561000	8563000	on the TV and then it like magically worked
8563000	8565000	it's funny if you take that the other way
8565000	8567000	we were using
8567000	8569000	these LCD monitors
8569000	8571000	with our Atari 5200
8571000	8573000	and it didn't look
8573000	8575000	nearly as I mean it was
8575000	8577000	crisp but it didn't look nearly as good as it would
8577000	8579000	on an old CRT
8579000	8581000	I think that's still the case yeah
8581000	8583000	it just looks terrible
8583000	8585000	and last but not least Shane you're FU of the week
8585000	8587000	FU2 the local targets
8587000	8589000	for not having the two Power Ranger toys I've been
8589000	8591000	looking for and they're all over like
8591000	8593000	the south and the east coast but
8593000	8595000	somehow just not over here yet and it's
8595000	8597000	making me really annoyed
8597000	8599000	Shane I will tell you something
8599000	8601000	put it into order and have them deliver it local
8601000	8603000	they can't even order it
8603000	8605000	it's not on the website if you even
8605000	8607000	look it up on my little brick seek thing
8607000	8609000	it has the price
8609000	8611000	but if you usually put items in there
8611000	8613000	it'll say the name and the picture
8613000	8615000	doesn't even do that yet
8615000	8617000	so it's almost like it's a placeholder
8617000	8619000	but it's what shows if they have it or not
8619000	8621000	I am really surprised you haven't just driven
8621000	8623000	to Southern California
8623000	8625000	it was in Burbank so
8625000	8627000	and I don't put it past you to drive
8627000	8629000	to LA for a freaking Power Rangers toy
8629000	8631000	let me know what they are
8631000	8633000	there is a target near Disneyland
8633000	8635000	and I will make every attempt to stop
8635000	8637000	at that target for you and look for your
8637000	8639000	Power Rangers toys
8639000	8641000	I will hit you up on that probably
8641000	8643000	that is true it's right there on
8643000	8645000	what is that Harbor? Catalla?
8645000	8647000	the one right before you hop back on five
8647000	8649000	I will go look right now on my phone
8649000	8651000	to see if they even have it
8651000	8653000	I know you are not going right now
8653000	8655000	but you could tomorrow
8655000	8657000	you could go to the target and then
8657000	8659000	you could see Victoria who lives right there
8659000	8661000	such a long drive for one day
8661000	8663000	it is
8663000	8665000	but I would still do it
8665000	8667000	it's Power Rangers Shane
8667000	8669000	we are going to get to the FUGA
8669000	8671000	question of the week in just a moment
8671000	8673000	but I do want to do one quick news story here
8673000	8675000	and this is about a game I think
8675000	8677000	they end up on Flaco's 2016
8677000	8679000	best games list it might be too soon
8679000	8681000	to tell but Uncharted 4
8681000	8683000	a thief's end
8683000	8685000	now PlayStation they ran on their
8685000	8687000	official blog this week a little
8687000	8689000	update on Uncharted 4
8689000	8691000	and they said hey good news we are wrapping up
8691000	8693000	production and it is shaping up to be the proper
8693000	8695000	send off for Nathan Drake that we promised you
8695000	8697000	the bad news
8697000	8699000	we need more time in the new release date
8699000	8701000	is April 26th 2016
8701000	8703000	so they have pushed it back a little
8703000	8705000	more to 4-26-2016
8705000	8707000	that's a lot of
8707000	8709000	March 23rd so like another month
8709000	8711000	they did the same to The Last of Us right towards the end
8711000	8713000	I think it was going to come out April
8713000	8715000	oh no it's going to be May something
8715000	8717000	or maybe it was May and then they pushed it to June
8717000	8719000	I don't remember
8719000	8721000	so at this point is there really a big difference between March and April
8721000	8723000	probably not and if that's what they need to make the
8723000	8725000	game right then go ahead
8725000	8727000	but I wonder how much
8727000	8729000	my birthday is in April and that makes it important
8729000	8731000	actually my sister's birthday by the way
8731000	8733000	oh there you go so then this
8733000	8735000	can make the perfect present for both of you
8735000	8737000	reverse present
8737000	8739000	she doesn't play video games
8739000	8741000	reverse present media on Uncharted
8741000	8743000	my half birthday was yesterday
8743000	8745000	what did I get for a reverse present
8745000	8747000	I don't know
8747000	8749000	I never actually purchased an Uncharted game before
8749000	8751000	I always just rent them, play through them and then be done with it
8751000	8753000	I don't like
8753000	8755000	goodbye
8755000	8757000	I don't like shooters
8757000	8759000	so I just like to play the story
8759000	8761000	and then be done with it
8761000	8763000	so what you're telling me is you're going to wait for this to be free on Playstation Plus
8763000	8765000	that is what happened with the other one
8765000	8767000	yeah that would take a long time
8767000	8769000	3 took a while to come
8769000	8771000	I bet the trilogy will be
8771000	8773000	the Playstation Plus game in April leading into this
8773000	8775000	that would be great what a great idea
8775000	8777000	found it
8777000	8779000	and for the record those toys are not there yet
8779000	8781000	I'm trying to do my stuff
8781000	8783000	I know
8783000	8785000	I know alright
8785000	8787000	let's get to the FUGL question

8831000	8833000	on Facebook saying super beat
8833000	8835000	Zonic
8835000	8837000	fighting words I guess
8837000	8839000	everybody's entitled to their opinion
8839000	8841000	I don't have to respect anybody's opinion
8841000	8843000	first of all and secondly
8843000	8845000	it's fine there are some positives
8845000	8847000	it just is a disappointment
8847000	8849000	alright so Andy R. says
8849000	8851000	this really was the year of rhythm games for me
8851000	8853000	I got seven rhythm games on Vita
8853000	8855000	three on PS4, one on 3DS just this year
8855000	8857000	as a big DJ Max fan
8857000	8859000	Zonic might be my favorite of those
8859000	8861000	but overall those eleven games
8861000	8863000	really defined my gaming year
8863000	8865000	I have to be honest I didn't realize there were that many music games
8865000	8867000	that released this year there was Persona 4, Dancing All Night
8867000	8869000	which was really good, Super Beat Zonic
8869000	8871000	like a couple
8871000	8873000	whatever the fake chick is
8873000	8875000	what's her name?
8875000	8877000	Hatsune Miku?
8877000	8879000	yeah I think she had a few games
8879000	8881000	Parappa came back out
8881000	8883000	alright anyway
8883000	8885000	moving on Redertainment says
8885000	8887000	Destiny begun under good intentions
8887000	8889000	with lots of promise, lots of expectation
8889000	8891000	and lots of anticipation
8891000	8893000	after spending some time digging into the experience
8893000	8895000	of it many outside observers
8895000	8897000	found it to be disappointing
8897000	8899000	nitpicking the details of it in ways that are completely annoying
8899000	8901000	however somebody with an insider's perspective
8901000	8903000	knows it was still a good experience
8903000	8905000	the entire thing wasn't all bad
8905000	8907000	especially compared to the experience of others
8907000	8909000	it's all just a matter of perspective
8909000	8911000	also the future of it holds the possibility
8911000	8913000	for a richer experience
8913000	8915000	very similar to when I named the Diablo expansion
8915000	8917000	one of my favorites one year
8917000	8919000	the fact that Destiny
8919000	8921000	not to alter Redertainment's answer
8921000	8923000	but he would probably mean
8923000	8925000	Destiny of the Taken King
8925000	8927000	the expansion that kind of changed a lot
8927000	8929000	some year-end lists
8929000	8931000	I've seen that too
8931000	8933000	Dart Tetsuya says gotta give it to Splatoon
8933000	8935000	never expected Nintendo to take a shot
8935000	8937000	at the team-based shooter genre and put a fun twist on it
8937000	8939000	I also really dug the Surf City vibe
8939000	8941000	in the visuals and music
8941000	8943000	Shane really likes that too
8943000	8945000	he listens to the soundtrack of this game
8945000	8947000	Fifth Dream says
8947000	8949000	I have to say Fallout 4
8949000	8951000	while I played a lot of games this year
8951000	8953000	probably more than ever in my 30 plus years of gaming
8953000	8955000	nothing in a long time held my attention
8955000	8957000	for an entire month straight
8957000	8959000	like Fallout 4 did
8959000	8961000	there's a lot of people that are saying Fallout 4
8961000	8963000	I know you are not alone with that
8963000	8965000	let's see, going to
8965000	8967000	Fabrice A who says
8967000	8969000	Assassin's Creed Syndicate
8969000	8971000	I gave the series another chance because I'm into the Victorian era
8971000	8973000	was not disappointed
8973000	8975000	nice mood and I like the protagonist a lot
8975000	8977000	Mike B says
8977000	8979000	Star Wars Battlefront Xbox One
8979000	8981000	awesome game
8981000	8983000	they got this one right
8983000	8985000	The movie was awesome
8985000	8987000	William Murderface says
8987000	8989000	Witcher 3
8989000	8991000	I love RPGs with stories
8991000	8993000	that you can actually affect with small decisions
8993000	8995000	and this one more than any other
8995000	8997000	that I have ever played allowed this
8997000	8999000	and even encouraged it
8999000	9001000	the choices were also given in such a way
9001000	9003000	that you could not be sure which provided
9003000	9005000	the desired outcome which added suspense
9005000	9007000	and tension to the experience
9007000	9009000	this to me makes this game more than the game of the year
9009000	9011000	it makes it the best game of the last 10 years
9011000	9013000	to me it set the new mark
9013000	9015000	to which I will measure all other RPGs
9015000	9017000	that is quite the praise
9017000	9019000	for Witcher 3, there's a lot of people
9019000	9021000	loving Witcher 3
9021000	9023000	Renji221 says
9023000	9025000	I'm going to have to go with WWE 2K16
9025000	9027000	since the game is almost better
9027000	9029000	in every way than the game last year was
9029000	9031000	since the roster is bigger
9031000	9033000	and career mode is better
9033000	9035000	Hitstun says
9035000	9037000	Splatoon gets my vote too
9037000	9039000	leave it to Nintendo to fix the problems
9039000	9041000	I have with shooters on console
9041000	9043000	it's bright, it's colorful, the motion controls
9043000	9045000	are almost as good as keyboard and mouse
9045000	9047000	squid mode makes movement fun
9047000	9049000	and I actually don't miss voice chat
9049000	9051000	Undertale is a close second place
9051000	9053000	super don't miss voice chat except for like
9053000	9055000	when we're playing Twin Squad
9055000	9057000	but that's skypable
9057000	9059000	I just like doing the booyahs a lot anyway
9059000	9061000	and I'm laughing to myself
9061000	9063000	at the imagery of driving down
9063000	9065000	the freeway really fast too
9065000	9069000	the Splatoon soundtrack
9069000	9071000	which sounds just like that by the way
9071000	9073000	I was one of the singers
9073000	9075000	it's like K.K. Snyder music
9075000	9077000	for a second I thought they were in the room with us
9077000	9079000	what's going on?
9079000	9081000	it's like I'm really playing Splatoon
9081000	9083000	it's like a really bad drag impression
9083000	9087000	alright
9087000	9089000	let's go over to Google Plus
9089000	9091000	where Popper starts us off
9091000	9093000	on Google Plus saying
9093000	9095000	Rise of the Tomb Raider is the game
9095000	9097000	I waited all year for
9097000	9099000	and it was well worth it
9099000	9101000	Act F says two gaming things
9101000	9103000	to find my year both from Nintendo
9103000	9105000	I said one
9105000	9107000	who said you got two
9107000	9109000	when everybody else gets one?
9109000	9111000	put the coin to read which one then
9111000	9113000	well I'll read the first one because you'll agree with it
9113000	9115000	Splatoon from the single player
9115000	9117000	to multiplayer I've had
9117000	9119000	so many experiences both good and bad
9119000	9121000	from it and of course Amiibo
9121000	9123000	not only collecting but being part of
9123000	9125000	local hunters and training community
9125000	9127000	participating and hosting tournaments
9127000	9129000	well I'll give
9129000	9131000	Act F the other one he's been a long time supporter
9131000	9133000	of the show my game of the year
9133000	9135000	though goes to Undertale
9135000	9137000	that game is unique and quite amazing
9137000	9139000	and everyone should play it and the soundtrack is
9139000	9141000	one of the best there is out there
9141000	9143000	he also did apologize for the long response
9143000	9145000	so fair enough
9145000	9147000	I do want to play Undertale but when will I ever
9147000	9149000	come to console?
9149000	9151000	Undertale's appeal at all
9151000	9153000	you do that a lot with games
9153000	9155000	I watched the opening
9155000	9157000	and I thought it looked amazing
9157000	9159000	like when you first meet Flowey
9159000	9161000	I kept trying to watch it on Twitch because I was like
9161000	9163000	oh my god Undertale's like okay what is this
9163000	9165000	and I could not find one that looked interesting
9165000	9167000	that's probably just the Twitch people
9167000	9169000	are not interesting but anyway
9169000	9171000	not all I'm sorry
9171000	9173000	I didn't just diss every single person
9173000	9175000	on Twitch just the ones at that moment
9175000	9177000	that Shane was looking
9177000	9179000	not leastly Prince Peach Fuzz
9179000	9181000	I do love that name it's one of my favorite
9181000	9183000	handles on the show
9183000	9185000	says PT
9187000	9189000	someone had to say it
9189000	9191000	thank god someone went there
9191000	9193000	that'll be an honorable mention every year
9193000	9195000	I think it should every year on this show
9195000	9197000	at the end we all say
9197000	9199000	in unison and PT
9199000	9201000	until Silent Hills comes out
9201000	9203000	or whatever they call it
9203000	9205000	well not Silent Hills whatever Kojima can make with his new company
9205000	9207000	well let's hear Prince Peach Fuzz's rationale
9207000	9209000	PT
9209000	9211000	partially because it was the only game
9211000	9213000	I was able to beat this year
9213000	9215000	as well
9215000	9217000	well that's a great accomplishment with that ending part
9217000	9219000	and an excellent experience
9219000	9221000	I'd like to give Metal Gear Solid 5
9221000	9223000	an honorable mention
9223000	9225000	that's so funny I'm sorry
9225000	9227000	I'm not laughing at Metal Gear Solid 5
9227000	9229000	because obviously a lot of people love that game
9229000	9231000	but I'm laughing at the fact that you put the Konami demo
9231000	9233000	above like what's probably going to be
9233000	9235000	their last AAA game they ever release
9235000	9237000	that's not soccer
9237000	9239000	so I don't think they'll do soccer anymore
9239000	9241000	alright
9241000	9243000	there it is
9243000	9245000	Google question of the week thanks to all you guys for answering
9245000	9247000	love hearing the diversity there
9247000	9249000	but definitely sounds like we probably heard Splatoon
9249000	9251000	from more people than anybody tonight
9251000	9253000	but Undertale a lot a lot of people as well
9253000	9255000	so I would say that seems to be the number one and two across the board
9255000	9257000	but we'll see what Loki says when he gets back next week
9257000	9259000	I have a feeling neither of those games
9259000	9261000	are on his list
9261000	9263000	maybe Splatoon maybe
9263000	9265000	act deft in our chat over at live.voggenetwork.com
9265000	9267000	encouraging Shane Undertale is a game you need to
9267000	9269000	experience yourself
9269000	9271000	so maybe you just need to
9271000	9273000	I don't want to
9273000	9275000	I want to but they won't let me because it's not on console
9275000	9277000	I don't have a PC
9277000	9279000	maybe that'll be a big E3 land for somebody
9279000	9281000	they're going to get Undertale
9281000	9283000	but it was all made in Game Maker
9283000	9285000	like it was made in one of those construction set type of things
9285000	9287000	and it's huge
9287000	9289000	I'm kind of surprised somebody isn't trying to throw that guy
9289000	9291000	a bunch of money to port it
9291000	9293000	or do yeah I don't know we'll see we'll see
9293000	9295000	alright well we would do
9295000	9297000	the mail bag usually but unfortunately
9297000	9299000	we got no emails this week
9299000	9301000	alright I understand y'all were busy because of the holidays
9301000	9303000	but now that you have time
9303000	9305000	to calm down from your food comas
9305000	9307000	and your gift givings and all that
9307000	9309000	you need to email us
9309000	9311000	participate at orangeloungeradio.com
9311000	9313000	make sure you lend your voice
9313000	9315000	to the program again that's participate
9315000	9317000	at orangeloungeradio.com
9317000	9319000	I have an unfinished draft
9319000	9321000	in my email
9321000	9323000	to send to you
9323000	9325000	I have to remember now
9325000	9327000	I think it's about couch co-op games
9327000	9329000	I don't even remember specifically what I was going to talk about
9329000	9331000	I have to look at my draft again
9331000	9333000	if it was couch co-op it was probably going to be
9333000	9335000	Rob you need to stop being so harsh on Splatoon
9335000	9337000	oh no I think it was
9337000	9339000	that's got the worst couch co-op mode
9339000	9341000	it's so bad
9341000	9343000	though I got my kids to play that
9343000	9345000	and they had a really good time with it
9345000	9347000	I think it was about
9347000	9349000	it was a Fugu question from forever ago
9349000	9351000	and nobody mentioned
9351000	9353000	Secret of Mana
9353000	9355000	and I was like
9355000	9357000	for me that's like the couch co-op
9357000	9359000	top of the pyramid for me
9359000	9361000	we did have a question on couch co-op a few weeks ago
9361000	9363000	it was a while ago
9363000	9365000	and that's like how could nobody mention this game
9365000	9367000	that's the thing that really got me into couch co-op
9367000	9369000	I remember we rented
9369000	9371000	a multi-tap adapter
9371000	9373000	from a video store
9373000	9375000	like 45 minutes away because I lived up in the boonies
9375000	9377000	so I had to drive to another different
9377000	9379000	part of also boonies
9379000	9381000	and get this thing and then we just kept
9381000	9383000	it forever and they kept calling
9383000	9385000	my roommate but they didn't
9385000	9387000	take a credit card so we pretty much just got to steal it
9387000	9389000	well then eventually he felt bad so he
9389000	9391000	went to go drop it off like
9391000	9393000	3 months later and they were out of business so
9393000	9395000	we got to keep it
9395000	9397000	yay stealing
9397000	9399000	but I just
9399000	9401000	loved it because it was just so fun to play with 3 people
9401000	9403000	yeah no
9403000	9405000	I never got to do the multi-tap thing
9405000	9407000	with that I don't even know if I ever played
9407000	9409000	with the multi-tap thing I never even played that game
9409000	9411000	really? man I love that game
9411000	9413000	well it was just kind of like
9413000	9415000	it was annoying with 2 people because you had to kind of switch
9415000	9417000	around and you had the third
9417000	9419000	that was always computer controlled and terrible
9419000	9421000	but when you had the third person
9421000	9423000	and we got a second
9423000	9425000	when I got a second roommate there
9425000	9427000	we had 3 of us living in one house
9427000	9429000	we beat the whole game with 3 people all the way
9429000	9431000	it's really kind of odd to me
9431000	9433000	in a way that they didn't really continue
9433000	9435000	the Mana series past I mean I know they had
9435000	9437000	Secret of Evermore which was the
9437000	9439000	USA thing and it wasn't very well received
9439000	9441000	even though I think it was horribly
9441000	9443000	the Seiken Densetsu series still goes on
9443000	9445000	in Japan still today?
9445000	9447000	yeah there's a 9 phone version
9447000	9449000	I beat the DS version too
9449000	9451000	was it Legend of Mana on the DS?
9451000	9453000	you guys didn't let me finish there was 2nd Assistant 3 on Super Nintendo
9453000	9455000	I know and then there was Legend of Mana
9455000	9457000	on Playstation was fucking horrible
9457000	9459000	I'm sorry I hated the Playstation 1
9459000	9461000	it was the one on the DS it was something else of Mana
9461000	9463000	I played that one and I liked that one
9463000	9465000	I beat that entirely
9465000	9467000	while commuting on Muni
9467000	9469000	when I lived in San Francisco
9469000	9471000	yeah it was a good game
9471000	9473000	well let's do one more story for you guys
9473000	9475000	then we're going to open up the skype line over at 1877 Game OLR
9475000	9477000	or username on skype
9477000	9479000	Orange Lounge Radio
9479000	9481000	and I'm having to do the little rig that I did last week
9481000	9483000	but it should work fine tonight
9483000	9485000	we know from last week it worked ok
9485000	9487000	so let me talk about
9487000	9489000	Diablo 3
9489000	9491000	and season 5 is coming out soon
9491000	9493000	for Diablo 3
9493000	9495000	and it sounds like patch 2.4 is going to coincide
9495000	9497000	with season 5
9497000	9499000	I don't know how many of y'all are still playing
9499000	9501000	Diablo 3 or interested in all the games
9501000	9503000	Shane are you going to come back to Diablo for season 5?
9503000	9505000	no why not?
9505000	9507000	I've got Xenoblade and
9507000	9509000	Splatoon and Heavensward
9509000	9511000	to play
9511000	9513000	and so every other game just kind of does not take precedent
9513000	9515000	alright well some big changes
9515000	9517000	first off seasonal
9517000	9519000	legendaries have been eliminated from
9519000	9521000	the game all new legendaries in
9521000	9523000	patch 2.4 will be available to everybody
9523000	9525000	whether you're participating in the season
9525000	9527000	or not which makes sense because that's what happens
9527000	9529000	on consoles and I should point out when we talk
9529000	9531000	about seasons this is only for the
9531000	9533000	PC consoles don't support seasons
9533000	9535000	because of the exploits that happen on
9535000	9537000	consoles because the console versions don't
9537000	9539000	have to always be online like the
9539000	9541000	PC version now what's interesting
9541000	9543000	is that now in the season journey
9543000	9545000	which is to encourage you to replay through the game
9545000	9547000	starting in chapter 3 some of the
9547000	9549000	objectives in the season journey will
9549000	9551000	reward you with two pieces
9551000	9553000	of one of your class
9553000	9555000	sets and that class set has been
9555000	9557000	pre-established so you
9557000	9559000	will get guaranteed a full
9559000	9561000	green season
9561000	9563000	class set for your character
9563000	9565000	by playing through the game so that's
9565000	9567000	really interesting you don't have
9567000	9569000	to grind for these drops anymore
9569000	9571000	if you want to get the other sets you do
9571000	9573000	but I find that very very interesting
9573000	9575000	and that's because also coming out with this
9575000	9577000	patch are going to be the new
9577000	9579000	dungeons that are geared specifically
9579000	9581000	for these gear sets
9581000	9583000	so that's going to be pretty interesting
9583000	9585000	I'm excited to play season 5
9585000	9587000	even if Shane is being a hater
9587000	9589000	but there are going to be new cosmetic rewards
9589000	9591000	as well there will be a
9591000	9593000	little companion that kind of looks like Groot
9593000	9595000	to me a little bit it's a little tree dude
9595000	9597000	a new little non combat pet
9597000	9599000	and I love the new frame the new frame
9599000	9601000	is really pretty it looks like the wicked queens mirror
9601000	9603000	or something there so
9603000	9605000	I like that so there you go
9605000	9607000	some things to look forward to
9607000	9609000	in Diablo 3 a game that's still
9609000	9611000	clicking along a few years
9611000	9613000	after the fact you know I praise Super Mario
9613000	9615000	Maker and even Splatoon earlier
9615000	9617000	in the show for Nintendo still supporting
9617000	9619000	their games with regular patches
9619000	9621000	and so forth well after release
9621000	9623000	I understand Splatoon they've said don't expect
9623000	9625000	anymore after January although
9625000	9627000	I have a feeling the Splatfest might continue for a little bit
9627000	9629000	they said Splatfest is still going on
9629000	9631000	well that's good so that will be a thing still
9631000	9633000	but you know
9633000	9635000	they're probably not going to have all the frequent
9635000	9637000	updates they've been having but look at Diablo
9637000	9639000	you know how many years are we after release now
9639000	9641000	and they're still doing new stuff for it hopefully
9641000	9643000	another expansion my fingers are crossed
9643000	9645000	alright let's do it let's go to the
9645000	9647000	phones you can give us a call right now on
9647000	9649000	Skype orange lounge radio all one word
9649000	9651000	on Skype I actually don't think the 800 number
9651000	9653000	is working tonight because again I'm not able to
9653000	9655000	get in on PC so I can't
9655000	9657000	disable the spam guard that I usually
9657000	9659000	disable when we go on air because we get
9659000	9661000	a lot of spam
9661000	9663000	calls robo faxes and things like that
9663000	9665000	but it does look like we are getting a call
9665000	9667000	on Skype right now so we're going to get to
9667000	9669000	it here in the studio just takes me a little
9669000	9671000	longer to connect than usual
9671000	9673000	so oh
9673000	9675000	gosh and I did something weird on the
9675000	9677000	screen here but we're going to get to it
9677000	9679000	hi you're on orange lounge radio who's
9679000	9681000	this dammit I'm halfway
9681000	9683000	naked here
9683000	9685000	oh wait wait we can barely
9685000	9687000	hear you you said you're halfway naked
9687000	9689000	I am halfway naked Rob Roberts
9689000	9691000	Jesus Christ dude so
9691000	9693000	okay so because I'm on the iPad
9693000	9695000	tonight I'm sending video
9695000	9697000	but that Ramy you don't have to send yours
9697000	9699000	back if you don't want to it's fine please
9699000	9701000	yeah cause um
9701000	9703000	I'd rather not
9703000	9705000	make Alan jealous
9705000	9707000	he's not here
9707000	9709000	what's on your mind tonight buddy
9709000	9711000	hey hey hey hey hey
9711000	9713000	hey hey what's up
9713000	9715000	buddy what's on your mind tonight
9715000	9717000	I kind of want to throw out there
9717000	9719000	like my top three games
9719000	9721000	but my top three
9721000	9723000	games are slightly different they're from a
9723000	9725000	mobile point of view because for the
9725000	9727000	last year all I've been able to do
9727000	9729000	is play mobile games
9729000	9731000	you know that's the story that a lot
9731000	9733000	of people have so I'm not totally surprised
9733000	9735000	to hear that and I even joked that
9735000	9737000	Ingress is probably going to end up on Loki's
9737000	9739000	top three although I don't know yet so we'll see
9739000	9741000	what is it what are three mobile games
9741000	9743000	we all need to be playing
9743000	9745000	well one thing about Ingress I have to put it back
9745000	9747000	on my phone cause I took it off for a while
9747000	9749000	then I'm like you know I'm going to have
9749000	9751000	to put it back
9751000	9753000	you never know that might be the way you get into
9753000	9755000	Pokemon Go early
9755000	9757000	yeah pretty much
9757000	9759000	but um
9759000	9761000	let's go ahead and give
9761000	9763000	my number three my number three
9763000	9765000	is a game I've talked about
9765000	9767000	I've called about the show before
9767000	9769000	and I said it's a game that you have to check out
9769000	9771000	number three
9771000	9773000	is Love Live
9773000	9775000	School Idol Festival for Android
9775000	9777000	and iOS
9777000	9779000	you did mention that and I have to apologize I don't think
9779000	9781000	I ever did get around to playing it but I think I like
9781000	9783000	downloaded it so I got like you know
9783000	9785000	I got close
9785000	9787000	it is a fun game and what I like
9787000	9789000	is that this rhythm game
9789000	9791000	is pretty much identical to the original
9791000	9793000	Japanese they
9793000	9795000	did have to tweak the story a little bit
9795000	9797000	because some people got offended
9797000	9799000	cause they were
9799000	9801000	alluding in the story to
9801000	9803000	same sex relationships and they didn't
9803000	9805000	want to freak people out
9805000	9807000	oh no what'll happen
9807000	9809000	cause we all know
9809000	9811000	Massachusetts fell into the ocean ever since they
9811000	9813000	legalized it however many years ago
9813000	9815000	yeah and a lot of
9815000	9817000	people decided to go ahead and download the
9817000	9819000	Japanese version so you know
9819000	9821000	either or make em happy
9821000	9823000	it's still a fun rhythm game
9823000	9825000	it's right up there
9825000	9827000	alright fair enough what's your number two
9827000	9829000	number two
9829000	9831000	is another mobile game
9831000	9833000	it's a game
9833000	9835000	Alan plays
9835000	9837000	I see him pop up from time to time
9837000	9839000	and I give him lives when I need to
9839000	9841000	is it that Sailor Moon game?
9841000	9843000	yes Sailor Moon drops
9843000	9845000	he plays that a lot
9845000	9847000	my friend
9847000	9849000	Yaten sits there and plays it
9849000	9851000	forever and ever
9851000	9853000	she played it to the point where she
9853000	9855000	unlocked a Christmas wallpaper
9855000	9857000	gave it to her wife Seiya
9857000	9859000	and when Seiya says she got it I was begging her for
9859000	9861000	if she could send a copy of it to me
9861000	9863000	so I could have it on both of my phones
9863000	9865000	that is so funny because
9865000	9867000	I didn't think Alan was connected
9867000	9869000	with other people on that and I even asked him
9869000	9871000	does it have like social interactions and stuff
9871000	9873000	I guess he finally hooked it up to Facebook and now
9873000	9875000	you can send each other lives and stuff that's great
9875000	9877000	alright
9877000	9879000	and then your number one
9879000	9881000	my number one game
9881000	9883000	is LBX
9883000	9885000	Little Battlers Exchange for the
9885000	9887000	Nintendo 3DS
9887000	9889000	wow okay
9889000	9891000	what is it about this? I don't even know if I know this game
9891000	9893000	do you know this game Shane?
9893000	9895000	I've played it, I played a quick demo of it
9895000	9897000	alright well what is it about this game
9897000	9899000	well
9899000	9901000	it's what
9901000	9903000	as I like to call it
9903000	9905000	or some people might fan them
9905000	9907000	it's like this if you ever watch the anime
9907000	9909000	Angelic Lair or
9909000	9911000	Gundam Build Fighters it's right up there
9911000	9913000	it's pretty much a time where
9913000	9915000	you buy like these custom
9915000	9917000	robo kits and you add weapons and armor
9917000	9919000	and you put them in little
9919000	9921000	cardboard arenas and you battle them back
9921000	9923000	and forth and it's an interesting storyline
9923000	9925000	where the main hero is looking to find his
9925000	9927000	father who originally created
9927000	9929000	the entire game genre
9929000	9931000	and so forth okay that sounds
9931000	9933000	kind of fun
9933000	9935000	yeah and as you're running around through the game
9935000	9937000	you're using your LBX to get
9937000	9939000	through certain areas
9939000	9941000	like if there's like traps and there's like
9941000	9943000	sentients you use your LBX
9943000	9945000	to battle the little robots to keep
9945000	9947000	going forward
9947000	9949000	ActDeft is giving some more insight in our chat room on this game
9949000	9951000	saying Nintendo promoted it during E3
9951000	9953000	but it didn't get that much publicity after
9953000	9955000	though it's based on an anime isn't it?
9955000	9957000	yeah that's correct I didn't notice
9957000	9959000	after the fact the anime is on its
9959000	9961000	season on Nicktoons as LBX
9961000	9963000	the original
9963000	9965000	anime is called
9965000	9967000	Denkai Senkai Wars
9967000	9969000	which I have acquired and I will be watching
9969000	9971000	soon to check it out
9971000	9973000	and let's see Kaijuto you may have
9973000	9975000	won him over because he said oh yeah I forgot
9975000	9977000	about that game I wanted it so there you go
9977000	9979000	so reminding people yes that is a thing
9979000	9981000	I just love the fact
9981000	9983000	that you can just customize the character any way
9983000	9985000	you want and it's just
9985000	9987000	all the fight scenes are just pure action
9987000	9989000	oriented and when
9989000	9991000	you go through the same levels
9991000	9993000	to you know to build
9993000	9995000	your character up usually when you're
9995000	9997000	fighting the other person the levels
9997000	9999000	are usually within 2 to 5
9999000	10001000	of yours so it's not like you're
10001000	10003000	level 20 and you're going back to fight
10003000	10005000	the level 5 character again
10005000	10007000	right
10007000	10009000	alright so that sounds like some really
10009000	10011000	good time wasters for filthy
10011000	10013000	casuals I'm just kidding
10013000	10015000	yes and filthy casuals who at work
10015000	10017000	sit there and play Mario Kart 7
10017000	10019000	and Smash Brothers during the break in
10019000	10021000	the break room nice nice
10021000	10023000	that's how to do it
10023000	10025000	I was just poking fun because Zach Defton chat said
10025000	10027000	Rama turned into a casual and made a face but said
10027000	10029000	JK so he didn't really mean it you know what
10029000	10031000	it's all good you game wherever
10031000	10033000	you can exactly
10033000	10035000	alright well Rama
10035000	10037000	will talk to you another time
10037000	10039000	but thank you so much for the call and of course anime

10097000	10099000	Orange Lawn Tradio who's this?
10099000	10101000	Hey Akdef how you doing?
10101000	10103000	pretty great
10103000	10105000	what's on your mind?
10105000	10107000	well
10107000	10109000	I have already talked about Undertale that much
10109000	10111000	but
10111000	10113000	just a quick note
10113000	10115000	it has a demo so if Flacco
10115000	10117000	and Shane want to try it out
10117000	10119000	it has a demo on Undertale.com
10119000	10121000	so
10121000	10123000	you can try it out it isn't that
10123000	10125000	big of a mending game so
10125000	10127000	I'm pretty sure any PC can run it
10127000	10129000	I don't have APC
10129000	10131000	does it run on Macs at all?
10131000	10133000	it runs on Mac
10133000	10135000	so yeah
10135000	10137000	I have a really old Mac I wouldn't risk it
10137000	10139000	alright well you can try at least a demo
10139000	10141000	Shane you gonna still be a hater over there?
10141000	10143000	or you try a demo?
10143000	10145000	when am I gonna work in the time for a demo?
10145000	10147000	when are you gonna have the time for a demo in between all the
10147000	10149000	Xenoblade and 14
10149000	10151000	and Toy Hunting
10151000	10153000	I know I know
10153000	10155000	well I don't know Akdef
10155000	10157000	I have the full game thanks to Dark Saga
10157000	10159000	so I do fully intend on trying it at some point
10159000	10161000	well it's a really great game
10161000	10163000	my number one but I'm gonna
10163000	10165000	I'm gonna take my number
10165000	10167000	my number three since I didn't mention
10167000	10169000	that over on the full question
10169000	10171000	what's that?
10171000	10173000	and it's Taiko no Tatsujin beta version
10173000	10175000	really?
10175000	10177000	yeah I really
10177000	10179000	really really love that game a lot
10179000	10181000	it's one of my
10181000	10183000	my favorite games of this year
10183000	10185000	and it pretty much gave
10185000	10187000	my beta a lot of life
10187000	10189000	so I'm
10189000	10191000	really really grateful about it
10191000	10193000	and I hope there's
10193000	10195000	new versions for the beta
10195000	10197000	or at least
10197000	10199000	new Taiko games coming out
10199000	10201000	and
10201000	10203000	again
10203000	10205000	it's a game that
10205000	10207000	I really really liked
10207000	10209000	and I still play it a lot
10209000	10211000	and if you know Taiko no Tatsujin
10211000	10213000	or Taiko Drone Master
10213000	10215000	it's pretty much the same game
10215000	10217000	it has some new things
10217000	10219000	like quest mode
10219000	10221000	it's like an RPG adventure
10221000	10223000	so it has that
10223000	10225000	it has multiplayer also
10225000	10227000	so it's a great game
10227000	10229000	probably not for everyone but
10229000	10231000	it's definitely my number three this year
10231000	10233000	wasn't there a 3DS one that
10233000	10235000	like was released
10235000	10237000	maybe I'm crossing wires here
10237000	10239000	maybe I'm thinking of the Vita one but I thought it was on 3DS
10239000	10241000	but I seem to remember talking about that one
10241000	10243000	but I know in
10243000	10245000	the Fugu question of the week
10245000	10247000	Andy Arde mentioned like 7 Vita games
10247000	10249000	were music games so
10249000	10251000	I'm sure Taiko no Tatsujin is one of them
10251000	10253000	so yeah that's pretty cool
10253000	10255000	that the Vita's kind of living
10255000	10257000	on with all these different music
10257000	10259000	games but it's interesting that they're all
10259000	10261000	overseas because we don't really get the Vita
10261000	10263000	support here in the US
10263000	10265000	that we do in other places
10265000	10267000	and like all these games are basically imports
10267000	10269000	except Shane was Super Beat Sonic
10269000	10271000	localized? That was a local release right?
10271000	10273000	cause DJ Max was
10273000	10275000	well only two DJ Max's were
10275000	10277000	sorry the one I remember
10277000	10279000	sorry three were
10279000	10281000	I can't count
10281000	10283000	yeah I actually got
10283000	10285000	Super Beat Sonic this week because it
10285000	10287000	was cheap on Amazon
10287000	10289000	so yeah I'm gonna try that too
10289000	10291000	but yeah there was also a lot of
10291000	10293000	games, Persona 4, Dancing All Night
10293000	10295000	there was also
10295000	10297000	AIBT
10297000	10299000	which got really popular
10299000	10301000	when it got released so I really want to
10301000	10303000	try that one too
10303000	10305000	but yeah the Vita is getting
10305000	10307000	pretty much a niche
10307000	10309000	niche machine
10309000	10311000	it's getting a lot of
10311000	10313000	import releases and
10313000	10315000	it's a great console not
10315000	10317000	the best but it's great for
10317000	10319000	if you like
10319000	10321000	imports gaming
10321000	10323000	so yeah
10323000	10325000	I actually remember too that
10325000	10327000	since Dark Sakura talked about Puyo
10327000	10329000	or Kirby's Island launch today
10329000	10331000	I
10331000	10333000	need to get Tetris Puyo Pop
10333000	10335000	or Puyo Puyo
10335000	10337000	since that's an import
10337000	10339000	only and it has
10339000	10341000	a Vita release so yeah
10341000	10343000	yeah Puyo Puyo did have
10343000	10345000	a Vita release and I thought there was like a Puyo Puyo
10345000	10347000	versus something that came out on all those
10347000	10349000	handhelds as well like it was like two puzzle
10349000	10351000	games blended together but I don't remember
10351000	10353000	in the moment so
10353000	10355000	alright well thank you ACDEF

10387000	10389000	Puyo on mobile
10389000	10391000	I'm not surprised to hear that
10391000	10393000	actually I don't know do we have a lot of Puyo Puyo on
10393000	10395000	mobile here I think there's
10395000	10397000	at least one I think I've seen at least one
10397000	10399000	so anyway Orange Lounge
10399000	10401000	Radio all one word on Skype if you
10401000	10403000	want to give us a call here in these closing minutes
10403000	10405000	of the show otherwise
10405000	10407000	I think we'll probably wrap up because we're getting to be after
10407000	10409000	nine o'clock on the west coast
10409000	10411000	we're getting to be hungry are you getting to be hungry
10411000	10413000	yes you making plans on where you're going to go eat
10413000	10415000	no not yet I haven't figured
10415000	10417000	out haven't figured that out yet alright
10417000	10419000	one more shout out for calls
10419000	10421000	and we'll probably wrap things up Orange Lounge Radio
10421000	10423000	all one word on Skype
10423000	10425000	and next
10425000	10427000	week we will be here and
10427000	10429000	talking about whatever comes up in the next
10429000	10431000	week although I anticipate it's probably going to be another
10431000	10433000	slow news week so we will probably do some
10433000	10435000	sort of list list next week with
10435000	10437000	our predictions I'm sorry we didn't get to do that
10437000	10439000	tonight I know Flaco is looking
10439000	10441000	forward to that but that's okay I only do it
10441000	10443000	without I can just not be right this year
10443000	10445000	it's fine were you right
10445000	10447000	last year I don't know probably not
10447000	10449000	I have to go back and pull up like I've ever been right
10449000	10451000	yeah I was like
10451000	10453000	since it's super easy I thought that the Xbox
10453000	10455000	one would be like a hundred dollars with like a
10455000	10457000	like a service plan type thing
10457000	10459000	that's so wrong well you know
10459000	10461000	over there actually is an Orange Lounge
10461000	10463000	Radio wiki where some of the inside
10463000	10465000	jokes and things are tracked you can see every
10465000	10467000	classic game of the week ever but
10467000	10469000	you can also see they actually have a page and I say they
10469000	10471000	because I actually I don't really do anything
10471000	10473000	with this this is all like Dark Tetsuya
10473000	10475000	and I think Orange Riot does work
10475000	10477000	with this like there's a few people and I'm sorry if I'm not aiming
10477000	10479000	everybody in the moment there's a few people
10479000	10481000	that work on this and
10481000	10483000	yeah they actually keep track of a
10483000	10485000	lot of the like inside jokes and things
10485000	10487000	that come up on the show and so one of them is
10487000	10489000	listless and so
10489000	10491000	in episode 582
10491000	10493000	oh thank you AJ Mix Dark Tetsuya says always does a
10493000	10495000	classic game of the week every week thank you AJ Mix
10495000	10497000	582 was OLR's
10497000	10499000	2015 predictions
10499000	10501000	number one now it doesn't say every
10501000	10503000	answer and it doesn't say who contributed it it just
10503000	10505000	says here's the scientific results after the
10505000	10507000	chat room voted number
10507000	10509000	one one of those DDoS
10509000	10511000	brats gets the death penalty
10511000	10513000	that was the number one that was you I remember that
10513000	10515000	that was me I do remember that one and
10515000	10517000	unfortunately that didn't happen but I thought one of them
10517000	10519000	got the book thrown at him didn't he? one of them did get the book
10519000	10521000	thrown at him but it wasn't the death penalty
10521000	10523000	that was the ridiculous part of the answer
10523000	10525000	well if they die in jail it would count right?
10525000	10527000	I shouldn't be so morbid
10527000	10529000	I'm sorry I'm sorry
10529000	10531000	number two which was a tie
10531000	10533000	was yet another 3DS
10533000	10535000	skew which
10535000	10537000	duh that was like a gimme
10537000	10539000	either Alan or Loki I don't know
10539000	10541000	I think I think Alan said that one
10541000	10543000	and that was kind of unfair because
10543000	10545000	that was already out in Japan by that point too
10545000	10547000	that was a duh
10547000	10549000	and it tied with punishing
10549000	10551000	silence from valve on
10551000	10553000	anything but financials
10553000	10555000	that's a winner right there punishing
10555000	10557000	silence from valve absolutely
10557000	10559000	how appropriate it is for your
10559000	10561000	financials because they leak into everybody
10561000	10563000	yes
10563000	10565000	that one won OLR was
10565000	10567000	right shout it on
10567000	10569000	twitter hashtag OLR was right
10569000	10571000	punishing silence from valve
10571000	10573000	came true in 2015
10573000	10575000	it took till the end of the year but
10575000	10577000	alright and then let's see
10577000	10579000	lastly number three which ended up being
10579000	10581000	number four because of a tie Microsoft
10581000	10583000	announces Minecraft 2
10583000	10585000	ok we didn't get Minecraft 2 but
10585000	10587000	we got Minecraft on that
10587000	10589000	hololens thing and we got Minecraft
10589000	10591000	story mode so kind of
10591000	10593000	close kind of close
10593000	10595000	nah get out
10595000	10597000	get out alright
10597000	10599000	full on Minecraft 2
10599000	10601000	if you want to look back
10601000	10603000	on the year do you know what other
10603000	10605000	we only did listless three times this year
10605000	10607000	apparently episode 600
10607000	10609000	which was a big landmark episode
10609000	10611000	what game will we be obsessed with
10611000	10613000	on episode 1000
10613000	10615000	and the top three were PT
10615000	10617000	number one I feel like
10617000	10619000	that was on the shortlist that was on there
10619000	10621000	but number one was pixel
10621000	10623000	shits the mmo number two
10623000	10625000	was dance dance revolution the
10625000	10627000	aww answer and then number three was
10627000	10629000	president cat 2 arena's revenge
10629000	10631000	so it was like all instances I won the
10631000	10633000	last listless I know that not that
10633000	10635000	long ago was the worst NES

10805000	10807000	you have a podcast for three hours
10807000	10809000	I'm like you don't even know how much we can fucking talk
10809000	10811000	try to keep it down for three hours
10811000	10813000	well we had a fault start tonight
10813000	10815000	the podcast listeners won't hear it
10815000	10817000	but we had a fault start with dead audio
10817000	10819000	because Skype screwed up the audio on my computer
10819000	10821000	so we started like ten minutes late
10821000	10823000	there we go we're at the end of the show
10823000	10825000	so Flaco any final thoughts
10825000	10827000	for our listeners tonight?
10827000	10829000	a shout out to Alan
10829000	10831000	I don't know if he's still listening but I went and checked out that
10831000	10833000	amiibo setup that is impressive
10833000	10835000	oh yeah? so good job by him
10835000	10837000	do you like how OCD it is? yes I love it
10837000	10839000	I think it's amazing I really do
10839000	10841000	why don't we change it before we leave? I'll fucking notice
10841000	10843000	no don't don't do it
10843000	10845000	it looks beautiful I love it
10845000	10847000	it'll be like when we were at GamerX
10847000	10849000	and I had all the postcards
10849000	10851000	neatly configured on the table
10851000	10853000	up down up down
10853000	10855000	I had them all configured and I would like
10855000	10857000	to turn around for just a second
10857000	10859000	and then I turn back around and one of them is just slightly tilted
10859000	10861000	and that was me
10861000	10863000	and it's like Jane I fucking know what you just did
10863000	10865000	like achoo
