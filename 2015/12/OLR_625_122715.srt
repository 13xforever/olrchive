Join us for the news on this episode here now, the news and much more and it all starts right meow

On the show where every gamer has a voice

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the very last Orange Lounge Radio episode of 2015

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
My name is Rob Roberts here with you in lovely Sacramento, California in Studio N7 joined by my co-host

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Say hello over there to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I have been freshly groomed

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes, your hair looks amazing, I know it's radio so it doesn't do

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll try to take a picture, someone can take a picture of the back of my head

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Post a little selfie, put it on the tumblers, get some likes

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Maybe, we'll see

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But it's red and purple and I kind of have the Ramona Flowers haircut

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah, I like it

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Except it's straight and I don't have the banks

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And our mutual friend Monet who I've done Rocky Horror with, I went to Wizard World in Reno with

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So I think she probably showed up on my Twitter at some point

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
She does the hair and she has amazing hair herself and so forth

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Though I have to ask Rob

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So if you're in Sacramento and you need a stylist

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
See Monet

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We'll hook you up, yeah, see Monet

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But by the way Rob, what's this about the Bible?

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Bi-

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We're not telling that story on air

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In the Bible

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Cause Monet's really funny and she laughs at my really immature stuff

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So when there was a Bible in the hotel room

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Dot dot dot, that's all I meant to tell about the story

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Rob had a moment

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't want to offend folks that might be offended if I were to finish that story

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not gonna go into-

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But I think it's just more funny that now I know

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And I can tease you relentlessly cause it was pretty funny

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, and I didn't ruin or do anything that would make somebody not want to touch it

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why do you have to tell that story right at the top of the show?

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm not telling the story

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
These people that are tuning into Orange Lounge Radio for the first time are like

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, what a bunch of sacrilegious-

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And on Christmas, on Christmas

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's not Christmas

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
These sacrilegious assholes

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's only still Christmas if you're Catholic, Lutheran, or Anglican

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And I'm Jewish, so it doesn't matter

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Well, did you have a good week in spite of everything being closed on Thursday?

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Christmas did kind of blow

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I got toys

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And a lot of chocolate

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And sometimes a lot of chocolate makes up for the stuff that blows

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's good, chocolate's amazing

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And no, it wasn't Bible in the sex motel

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you, Ikuma

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
We don't have love hotels like that here in the US

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We just have-

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Have you been to West Sacramento?

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We have these seedy little rundown hourly things

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But they're not nice like a real love hotel

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Ah, okay, fair enough

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You put a quarter in the bed and it shakes

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Or so I've heard

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Love hotels are apparently pretty nice

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Like, they're the ones over there

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Not here, alright, anyway

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But we're not here to talk about love hotels

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
As we do every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Live.vognetwork.com

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern is when we tape

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
On Sunday nights, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And if you are listening live, you should join us in chat

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Live.vognetwork.com

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You might be asking yourself right about now

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why didn't Rob introduce Loki?

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Well, Loki is not here tonight

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He does have the night off, he went to do a-

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He was stuffed into a trunk and left in the ocean

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes, he's flying somewhere over the North Pole right now

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Probably trying to capture an ingress node

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So he's on hiatus tonight

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, he had other family stuff going on

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
As I'm sure a lot of people do

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
During this time between Christmas and New Years

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
However, since we were off for a bunch of weeks in November

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Due to other circumstances, we wanted to make sure

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We were still giving you guys a show this week

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So, we are joined in studio though by some special guests

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
To help us fill the void left by Loki's absence tonight

91
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Some familiar faces here in studio

92
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sure you guys will be happy to hear from

93
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Say hello to

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Vognetwork superfan

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Flaco Jones is in the house tonight

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
OMG, it's Flaco, how are you doing, Flaco?

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm doing great, how are you doing?

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Great, it's so good to see you

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, it's like I haven't seen you in such a long time

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I haven't seen you in like a whole day

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No, seriously, thank you for hosting the little holiday

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Choir way last night

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I guess it was a holiday thing, I don't know

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Well, we did gaming

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, we did some gaming

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We played Jackbox Party Pack 2

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Fancy Wine Party

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Which I won, you're waxed, thank you very much

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You did

110
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And I won the other one

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Quiplash

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And then Alan won

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Sketch

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You won the Warioware

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Warioware sketch

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, we played Warioware

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Which I keep forgetting that's a thing

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Warioware Pictionary, yeah, pretty much

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah, but you can actually play that with one gamepad

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You can pass it around

122
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, it's super fun

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yeah, good times

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
We'll get to your gaming week in a little while

125
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But how was your holiday?

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Did you get any good gaming stuff going on for your holiday?

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I got a new controller for my PS4

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh yeah

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's the 20th anniversary one that looks like a PS1 controller

130
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I thought you could only get that if you got the full on PlayStation 4

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No, they made a bunch more of them

132
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, okay, cool

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
They were really expensive originally

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But they were on sale for, I think, 44 bucks at Best Buy

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Right when the holiday shopping season started

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Who's gonna complain about that?

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I know, I was like, that's pretty awesome

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I love it when Steam sales carry over into retail

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
As well

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah, so I thought, you know, oh, this will be cool

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But then I was like, wait, I can't play any PS1 games

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
On my PS4

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Except Final Fantasy VII

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Which actually reminded me

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's like, oh yeah, you can play Final Fantasy VII

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's the one you can play

147
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So I was like, well, that would be fun

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I heard it's kind of cool with the cheats that they have in that game

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Actually, yeah, I know some folks on Twitter that are replaying it right now

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And the cheats apparently help a lot

151
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah, because then you don't have to worry about the whole grind again

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You're like, oh, I can just cheat

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I've already played the game

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, you're not really cheating

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're just fast-forwarding

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, no, it's not just that

157
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It lets you heal your whole party

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah, but you don't have to use that

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You don't have to use any of them

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You don't have to use any of them

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you want to fight the weapons and all that

162
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I wouldn't say it

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It just makes it real easy

164
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now, what is it?

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You have your Vita with you

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh, yeah, my Vita

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But it looks like a Game Gear

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Like, what did you do to your Vita?

169
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I bought a thing a while ago

170
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's Trigger Grips, I think that's what it's called

171
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And yeah, it just makes it feel more like a controller

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Huh

174
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Because I don't like it

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ever since the PSP, I've hated the design

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah

177
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This little circle thing

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I used to have to test games on it at Konami

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We played Frogger on PSP

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Right

181
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And some of the Winx games

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And it was so uncomfortable to hold for all those hours at work

183
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And so when I got a Vita

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I was like, the first thing I want to buy is some kind of grip

185
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And I looked it up and these Trigger Grips

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Trigger Grips

187
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
They also make the triggers easier to push

188
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
At some point, just play around

189
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And try putting your hands on that Heaven's Word Vita from Japan

190
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That I have right there

191
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Is that a

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Because that's the newer model that they never released here

193
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Okay

194
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And, like, you have to have really tiny hands

195
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I think to be able to effectively use that

196
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's like a Slim, right?

197
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, it's like the

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
They released a Slim here

199
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's just not white

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, did they?

201
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah, X4 has one

202
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I didn't think they released the other model

203
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yeah, you have one too

204
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah, no, it is lighter and it's a little bit smaller

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Alright, well

206
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I still think it's uncomfortable to hold

207
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So much for me paying attention

208
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I guess I missed that

209
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But, I mean, again, it's not like

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's not like I was planning on getting a second Vita

211
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yeah

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It just kind of happens for my birthday

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Where Alan was like, I know Rob really wants that Heaven's Word Vita

214
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's what they say about children

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
They just kind of happen

216
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
They do

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, that's how

218
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
My brother and sister were adopted

219
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Like 14, 16 years later

220
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I was an oops

221
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yeah, me too

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I always say, I was a mistake

223
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
And my mom goes, no, Rob, you are a pleasant surprise

224
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But then I made your father have the surgery

225
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Anyway, let's see

226
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is a good time to introduce our chat room as well

227
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

228
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We were having some technical difficulties earlier in the studio

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
We got a little bit of a late start

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The podcasters won't hear that

231
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But some continued issues from my Skype nightmare last week

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Carried into this week

233
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And ended up changing some audio settings unknowingly

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But that caused Tigerclaw to say in our chat room

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

236
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Flaco Jones on the show

237
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
No wonder the show didn't start properly initially

238
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Oh, the curse continues

239
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Make sure the recording is also working

240
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And Alex P

241
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And your UPS, don't forget that

242
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Alex P Carson in chat says

243
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Rob scared me when he said last show

244
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Of 2015

245
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's what was printed on the card

246
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I just had to read what was on the card

247
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's what was printed on the card

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We do have another guest here in studio with us

249
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That comes to say hello a lot on the show

250
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
We're happy to have back Shane tonight

251
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I just woke up

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I know, and now you're going to be very monotone dry, Shane

253
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm a little sleepy

254
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Well, to help you wake up, Shane

255
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm going to give you 30 seconds to talk about Power Rangers

256
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Ready, go

257
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So today we went looking for more toys

258
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And I found one that I was looking for at Toys R Us

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And it was awesome

260
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And I still don't have the ones at Target

261
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Because they don't have them around here yet

262
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And it's really making me mad

263
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Because one of them is really cool

264
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He's Navy

265
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And he's awesome

266
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
And it's just so infuriating

267
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And time's up

268
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But you actually

269
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You've gotten so into this toy collecting thing

270
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That you use websites to track Target inventory and stuff

271
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes, I do

272
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That can be very helpful for Amiibo and things like that too

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah, Power Rangers is more important

274
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Any gaming stuff for your holiday?

275
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Have you splurged on any of the sales or things like that?

276
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
No?

278
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Wait

279
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm waiting

280
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Fantavision, but it really wasn't part of the holiday

281
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It was just a new release and it was on sale

282
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's still nice to see more games being released during the holiday

283
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Even if digitally

284
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Because usually this is just a dead period

285
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Once you hit Black Friday

286
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There's no games released in December usually

287
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sometimes you might have a fringe game that's running a little late

288
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But otherwise there's no games

289
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So it's kind of nice to have some digital treats

290
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Even if it's old games being done new again

291
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
vidpower and our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says there's websites to track Target inventory

292
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Now you're going to have to share on Twitter or something

293
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't know

294
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes there is

295
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's called BrickSeek

296
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And you have to know Target DPCI numbers or it doesn't really work well

297
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Which is some type of internal thing

298
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes

299
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So you have to go make friends with the Target person

300
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Or go read their little labels if you're looking for specific things

301
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Alright

302
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Dually noted

303
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We can use that for possibly game hunting later on

304
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He called that out in chat room over

305
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Is he the one that told you about that?

306
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No

307
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Because apparently he told you about the amiibo figures

308
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I know I didn't take credit

309
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And then you told me

310
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yeah I didn't take credit

311
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Well but I just assumed it was a you thing

312
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No and then I backed him up when he said that

313
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well that's fine so I appreciate it both

314
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Because I actually got one of the figures I ordered today

315
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I got a Palutena from Japan

316
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No no that was something later

317
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That was me telling you that one

318
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He told me about the Dedede and Rosalina

319
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh okay I got those

320
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I want a Dedede

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Check Amazon they may still have them pretty cheap

322
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah I bought one today

323
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So yeah my amiibo collection keeps growing

324
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I think I'm up to

325
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
$75,000

326
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
No it's not $70,000 it's $60,000 something

327
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Maybe $69,000 we'll just say $69,000

328
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I have two What's Your Faces?

329
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
From Animal Crossing the pink one

330
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Lottie

331
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Lottie yeah two Lotties

332
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Because Dan bought me one and I already had one

333
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh okay

334
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So I have to go trade her in at Target

335
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh there you go

336
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And if you know the number you know which Target already has them on shelves

337
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And which ones don't

338
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Alright there it is

339
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That is not helpful for that situation

340
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You're using it wrong

341
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Alan Alchemy again great radio

342
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Alan Alchemy is calling out in chat

343
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Flaco what do you think of the collection on the shelves?

344
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I did that yes

345
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The other night

346
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh okay so those of you guys that listened to Hoard House

347
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
When it was still around about six months ago

348
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Grandpa was in town on Christmas

349
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Because he was spending it with some friends he had here in Sacramento

350
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
So of course what does he want to do with me in the evening?

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He wants to go drinking

352
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah

353
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So and Alan's like hmm thanks but no thanks right

354
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So which I can understand

355
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So I went downtown to have some drinks with Grandpa

356
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And while I was gone Alan decided he was going to completely

357
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Reconfigure my amiibo collection

358
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Which usually you would think that would drive my OCD a little bonkers

359
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But like actually he even made it like anal retentively better

360
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He spaced the shelves all equally

361
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
He put an equal amount of amiibo on each shelf

362
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And spaced them in the same manner

363
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And he tried to group them together best he could

364
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Except I was like when I did get home I was like

365
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Mewtwo is a Pokemon and so he shouldn't be up there

366
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
He should be down here with the other Pokemon

367
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And Alan was like but this shelf is villains

368
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
And I'm like I'm sorry but Mewtwo

369
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Pokemon is more important than villains

370
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So he needs to go on the Pokemon shelf

371
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
And Alan's like hmm

372
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And you need to get a new

373
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Is that in the other room?

374
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Our OCDs battle sometimes

375
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yeah it's in the other room

376
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We have to check it later

377
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You have to check it later

378
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Because it's more important that we get into our kickoff topic tonight

379
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It is the last show of 2015

380
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And as we typically do with our last shows of the year

381
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We want to take a look back at the year in video games

382
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And I'm sure a lot of your gaming press sites

383
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
A lot of your gaming podcasts

384
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Are all doing a similar thing this week

385
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And that is that they are recapping

386
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The best games of 2015

387
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
However we here at Orange Lounge Radio

388
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Have a different view

389
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Because you know what

390
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can't possibly have time

391
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Unless you're paid to do it

392
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
To play every single video game that's out there

393
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Every single release and so forth

394
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So I think it's very hard to say what the best game is of 2015

395
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's all subjective

396
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It is, it is

397
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So tonight we're going to present

398
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
As we do every year

399
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Our favorite games of 2015

400
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Because that's what they are

401
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And that way it's neither right nor wrong

402
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's our favorite

403
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And F you if you don't agree

404
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Right, right Dark Sakura?

405
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That's it

406
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And keep in mind

407
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah, foo

408
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Foo

409
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Keep in mind

410
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Sometimes we blur the lines a little bit

411
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Games that were released at the end of 2014

412
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Or even, who knows

413
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Could creep into 2015

414
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Just because this is the year we discovered them

415
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I think that happened with like Mass Effect 1 year or something

416
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They'll creepy creep

417
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They'll creepy creep a little bit

418
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
So that's all part of the rules

419
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And tonight I actually have a bumper for this

420
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So, without further ado

421
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Live from Studio N7

422
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's the Orange Lounge Radio Best Video Games of 2015

423
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yay

424
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's not our favorites

425
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Alright

426
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You did that whole long explanation

427
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
After I just did that whole explanation

428
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Shane is going to be combative

429
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No, Shane is like

430
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This is the right answer

431
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And if you don't agree

432
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Then you're wrong

433
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's pretty much how it is

434
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Alright

435
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So we're going to go around the room

436
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And since Loki isn't with us this week

437
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Of course we'll catch up with him next week

438
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But for those of us gathered here tonight

439
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We want to recap our top 3 favorite games of 2015

440
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And why

441
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Wait, it's not our best now?

442
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's our favorite

443
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I said it was our favorite

444
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Whether or not they came out

445
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Pay attention

446
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's gone from favorite

447
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
To best

448
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
To top

449
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Oh, to top now

450
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
X is what, in your opinion

451
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Is the most enjoyable thing

452
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That you have participated in

453
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
In recent history

454
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This past year

455
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Thank you

456
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Lay down the goddamn law, DarkSakura

457
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I need it

458
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What the fuck I'd do

459
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Alright

460
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Let's get to it

461
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The best

462
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Top

463
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Favorite

464
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Mostest

465
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Do I have to name them all?

466
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No, just number 3

467
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
DarkSakura, what is your third favorite game of 2015?

468
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Number 3 is Undertale

469
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Undertale

470
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
A game I have yet to play

471
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I've only barely played it

472
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm on my neutral playthrough

473
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So that I can go to the pacifist playthrough

474
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But it just fucking exploded my tumblr

475
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And that's why I have it

476
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I know more about the game now

477
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Without having hardly played any of it

478
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But the fact that it's basically

479
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Hit like the Five Nights at Freddy's level

480
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Of immediate super stardom

481
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You know, fanocity

482
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It actually makes me feel a little home stucky

483
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay

484
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And so until Hiveswap comes out

485
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
This is going to be my replacement

486
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So there it is

487
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Undertale is your third favorite game of the year

488
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And yeah, it's pretty hard to escape

489
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
A lot of the fandom of Undertale

490
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm more of a twitter guy than a tumblr guy

491
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But I try to use both

492
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And it's hard to escape it

493
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So it does seem like every year

494
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There's that one indie game

495
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And there ought to be more

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Because indie games are great

497
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
But there's always that one indie game

498
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That just really breaks through

499
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And actually this year I'd argue there's two

500
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because one of them is on my list

501
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But anyway

502
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There's Minecraft a few years ago

503
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Five Nights at Freddy's obviously

504
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I read that book

505
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I forgot

506
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That was part of my gaming week

507
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
We haven't done gaming weeks yet

508
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh but you talked about what Christmas

509
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Video game things I did

510
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And that's kind of the same thing

511
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Are you just here to correct me tonight?

512
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's what I do every night

513
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
When you're talking

514
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Anyway, let's check out some other number threes

515
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I was going to do Shane next

516
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But since I'm mad at him right now

517
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
We're going to go to Flaco next

518
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Flaco

519
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Your third favorite game

520
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You look like you still haven't decided yet

521
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's been the toughest decision for me

522
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Number three

523
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Because there's so many good games

524
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I think I narrowed it down like on the drive here

525
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I've been flip flopping this week too

526
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
For what it's worth

527
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I love the PS4 remake of Tearaway

528
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Loved it

529
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Got some bugs in it that bugged me

530
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's hard knowing that five million people

531
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
List bugged me

532
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's hard knowing that five million people

533
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Listen to this show

534
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
And your opinion can sway people that much

535
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
On the interwebs

536
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So the time has come

537
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
To make a choice

538
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Number three is

539
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's Rocket League

540
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Rocket League

541
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Rocket League has gone up and down on my list

542
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I think it's just based on

543
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
How many people are playing it

544
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I think I settled in at number three

545
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What is it about Rocket League?

546
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If I like Yoshi more

547
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I should play it more

548
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Rocket League is just a fun

549
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Goofy indie game

550
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Great online experience

551
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So it's like a lot of the online stuff

552
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That really wins that game over for you

553
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah I like playing online

554
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's just crazy to see

555
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The moves you can make

556
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The last second comebacks

557
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's just a fun game

558
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
They've added some new maps now

559
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That actually put some new terrain

560
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Not every map is the same dimension anymore

561
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Which is nice

562
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Is that something I was kind of down on it

563
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
When it first came out

564
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And they made that free

565
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You can pay for the Mad Max update

566
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And get the cars and everything like that

567
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But you get the map for free

568
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
PlayStation Plus really got

569
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
A really sweet deal with that

570
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Because everybody else has pretty much

571
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Had to pay for it at this point

572
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
To get that base game on Steam

573
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I actually enjoyed the game so much

574
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Actually I don't think I bought it on Steam

575
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I think Jason gifted it to me

576
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But I would have bought it for myself

577
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If Jason wasn't so goddamn nice

578
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But I got to get it on both platforms that way

579
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I think it was awesome that it came on PlayStation Plus this year

580
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm considering getting it on Xbox One too

581
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It just came out on that right?

582
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's what I do with games I like

583
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I buy them everywhere

584
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So you're like extra fur

585
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Do you know the Mass Effect 3 story?

586
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh that's right I know that

587
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Go into some comments from our chat

588
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
On the games announced so far on our list

589
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

590
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I act deaf responding to Dark Sakura's selection of Undertale

591
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I was like Dark Sakura

592
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I knew a lot about the game

593
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Before I even played it myself

594
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So that game just has a lot of word of mouth right now

595
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Let's see Tigerclaw says

596
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Rocket League has to be on everyone's list

597
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's a game that came out of nowhere

598
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And became a huge success

599
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Well who knows it may show up on a list

600
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Somewhere else to make

601
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I actually do not know

602
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I think I know it's on Shane's list

603
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I talk to him way too much

604
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know everybody else's list in here

605
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So we may have some overlap

606
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But it is time to get to Shane

607
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
And Shane your number 3 favorite game of 2015

608
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I would say it's going to be

609
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

610
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You finally settled on Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

611
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Well I actually was pretty sure

612
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That was my number 3 for a while now

613
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's 2 and 1 that I'm going back and forth on

614
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So Everybody's Gone to the Rapture on the PlayStation 4

615
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What is it about Everybody's Gone to the Rapture?

616
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I love the story, I love the atmosphere

617
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I love the music

618
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't care that some people may say

619
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That all you do is walk around

620
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I mean that's more fun

621
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Than a lot of other games I played this year

622
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So I think it was just a beautifully done game

623
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's a great experience

624
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
There's little

625
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I mean they have little secrets throughout the entire game

626
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And you get a better

627
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Understanding of the whole story the more you find

628
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And it's just

629
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It was beautiful from start to finish

630
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Loved it

631
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Well Shane I think that's a really good pick

632
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Because my number 3 favorite game of the year is

633
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

634
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
On PlayStation 4 and I actually didn't know

635
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's what Shane was going to pick for number 3

636
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But that is also my number 3 pick

637
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
For favorite game of the year

638
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I actually flip flopped on this a lot

639
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There's another game that was really close

640
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And I just didn't end up putting it

641
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I chose Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

642
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Some people may not consider it a game

643
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But kind of like Shane said

644
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Exploration is a huge part of it

645
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And I think exploration

646
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And that sense of

647
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What goes into a game

648
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Is why games like Minecraft are huge

649
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Exploration is a huge part of that

650
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
And there's still objectives too

651
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's not just like you're watching everything happen

652
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah and Minecraft has

653
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I understand creation there's more to it

654
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm not trying to compare the two games

655
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But I just feel that Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

656
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Was a gaming experience

657
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Where at the end of it

658
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I just had to talk to somebody about it

659
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
And you don't get that a lot in games

660
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You know where it's like

661
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I need to call Shane

662
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And talk to him about it

663
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I need to go on the internet and find people talking about the ending

664
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Because there's so much that's left

665
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Open to interpretation with the ending

666
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And honestly

667
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
One of the best soundtracks to a game

668
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I've heard in a very

669
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Very long time

670
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And something else

671
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The audio in this game

672
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I mean the visuals are gorgeous too

673
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But the audio in this game

674
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
From the soundtrack to the voice acting

675
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Is top notch

676
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So you know what for a download title

677
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Even if it's a little short

678
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And some folks may be like

679
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Where's the action? Where's the quick time event?

680
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Some people may be left with that

681
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I still think this is a game

682
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Well worth your time to check out

683
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And it's one of my top three of the year

684
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Because even though there are no enemies

685
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And nothing that can hurt you in that game

686
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
There were times where I was kind of scared to continue

687
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Because I was like what's going to happen

688
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Is something going to jump out at me

689
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
There's nothing that does

690
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But I was literally creeped out many times

691
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Well you need to go the wrong way and miss the story element too

692
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Oh yeah

693
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And that's something about that game

694
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You kind of have to find everything

695
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's why I don't think there's any question it's a game

696
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Because if you don't find all the right stuff

697
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You don't get the whole story

698
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Then it really won't make sense

699
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But the challenge is really finding all those things

700
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
If you take the wrong path

701
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You have to double back and find the right thing

702
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
There was one scene

703
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
One scene that Shane got that I didn't get

704
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That completely changed the interpretation of the ending

705
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I know it's the one where the guy disappears

706
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
In front of the priest

707
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yes, so we're trying to keep it a little

708
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's the beginning

709
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That's the first chapter

710
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And I missed that

711
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And it completely changed the interpretation of the ending

712
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So I mean it is important

713
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So if you haven't played this game

714
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Play it

715
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And what's funny is I was talking to a game maker

716
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
At GX3 a couple weeks ago

717
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And I won't say what the game is

718
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
But I'm excited about this game too

719
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
And we'll hopefully have him on the show at some point

720
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
But I actually said

721
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Playing this reminds me a lot

722
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Of everybody's gone to the rapture

723
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
And have you played it and he said no

724
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And I said you've got to play it

725
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
If you're going to make a game like this

726
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
And he said he would

727
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
So we'll see

728
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Anyway I was seeing if there was any comments

729
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
On this game but everybody in chat is suddenly

730
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Talking about Niko Atsume

731
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Neko Atsume

732
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Which is the cat game on iPhone

733
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's not so much of a game

734
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
It's just more like

735
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
One of those shitty iPhone collector games

736
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
No

737
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You just put out stuff for cats

738
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And then you

739
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Kind of fuck off for an hour, come back

740
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So it's cat lady simulator

741
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It's cat lady simulator

742
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh my god my cat has a bag on its head

743
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Alright let's move on

744
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
To our number two

745
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Picks for 2015

746
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Dark Soccer your second

747
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Favorite game of 2015

748
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
That's going to be Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

749
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Why?

750
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Just because it takes all the things that people like

751
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The most about Animal Crossing

752
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Which is the amassing of shit and decorating your house

753
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
And just blows it up

754
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And I like having the cards

755
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Because I finally used my amiibo card reader

756
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And had

757
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I decorated for DJKK

758
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And gave him the ultimate hipster apartment

759
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's just fun

760
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I mean it's fun and easy

761
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's

762
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I would say it's casual because you can play it in like

763
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
15 minute increments

764
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
But for me

765
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I just like being creative with the space there

766
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And working in the limited

767
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Availability with an entire

768
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You know

769
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Inventory behind me to do whatever I wanted to with

770
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
You know and I'm looking at our chat over at

771
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
live.vognetwork.com

772
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And actdef says I didn't like Animal Crossing

773
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Happy Home Designer that much

774
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You know and I can see where maybe people kind of feel

775
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Differently about this game based on

776
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Like what you said it takes one element

777
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Of the original Animal Crossing and kind of expands

778
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
On that and I have to admit I don't know

779
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
If I'd be super into it either because

780
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I was always more about I want to run around

781
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
The island I want to find things

782
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It's kind of more that exploration thing too

783
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Like I love the Game Boy Advance thing

784
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Connecting I love going on the internet and going to other

785
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
People's places I would like to have

786
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Another Animal Crossing game

787
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Because I mean I played like for

788
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
A year and a half I played

789
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
New Leaf

790
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And I would really like to have a new one

791
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But for the interim this just sort of gives me

792
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
My little bit of

793
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Animal Crossing you know in small

794
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Easy to carry around

795
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Doses that I can play during my break at work

796
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Well and I wonder at this point if they're just going to skip

797
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
The Wii U and move to Nintendo's next console

798
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
If that console is truly going to be next year

799
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
No we need to have it on Wii U

800
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Because we need the island on the gamepad

801
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
We'll see

802
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Listen to me Nintendo make this happen

803
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
We'll see you never know

804
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Carson in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

805
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
New Leaf for the win and Act F does admit

806
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
It's entertaining enough and I can see the appeal

807
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Of it so there you go

808
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Alright let's move around with some more

809
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Number two favorite games of the year Flaco

810
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
My number two game of the year is

811
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Until Dawn

812
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Until Dawn on the PlayStation 4

813
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
The horror movie

814
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Blend genre

815
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Cross over thing

816
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Super fun interactive movie thing

817
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
So yeah it was a blast to play

818
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I uh you know

819
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Played through the whole game

820
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Got one ending and I've since gone back

821
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And I've like tweaked some things

822
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Once you go back in you can kind of

823
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Chapter jump around so I

824
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Kind of redid the ending because I had almost everything right

825
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And I did an ending where everybody lives

826
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
So it's not a spoiler because you can have

827
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Any like variation of people like living

828
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Or dying at the end of that game

829
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
So I got the everybody lives like trophy so that was really

830
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Fun to do too so now I want to get like

831
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Everybody dies so I'm like

832
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That one's a little bit harder to get actually because you have to

833
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Make some choices early on so I can't

834
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Go back to the game I had I had to go back and start over

835
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Again and in the process I'm looking for more stuff

836
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So the fact that I've been able to

837
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Not just play it the one time through which you think

838
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Most people just do because there's so many

839
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Different branching ways it can go and different

840
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Like people can survive and you have

841
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Different endings then yeah it's got

842
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Me to replay it so it's got great replay

843
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Replayability the acting is great

844
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
It's sometimes it's hilarious but cheesy

845
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Like a regular just like a

846
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Some teenage slasher movie from the 90s that's what it feels

847
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Like yeah and I mean you know I think for

848
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
A lot of us that are PlayStation 4 owners

849
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Many of us were kind of around when

850
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Those 90 horrors films were

851
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You know like when Scream really broke

852
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Through and so forth and all the

853
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
You know knockoffs of that came

854
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Through so I can

855
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Definitely see the appeal of that

856
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And why fans of that are going to be really

857
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Into this also interesting

858
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Too because you know with the PlayStation 4 and the

859
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Xbox One and this new

860
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Era of consoles

861
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Social gaming is very big and I

862
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Noticed there was a lot of and I think part

863
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Of the reason Until Dawn

864
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Even caught on bigger than I think

865
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We all know Sony expected because Sony

866
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Yeah I mean remember how much they

867
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
They didn't quite devil's third it

868
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Not quite but I mean

869
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Remember how much they were promoting that order

870
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
In 1886 and that game like flopped

871
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
For all I could tell and then this

872
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Game they just kind of dump at the end of August

873
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Like oh here's this one we're barely going to

874
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Advertise it even though they had like statues

875
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
For the order and all these collector's

876
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Edition and all this other stuff and then

877
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
When they brought out Until Dawn it's like oh

878
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah Europe gets a collector's edition but the US

879
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Does it and here it is and whatever

880
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And it ended up being a pretty big hit and now

881
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's got apparently a sequel in the works so

882
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And oh and then there's the

883
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
VR PlayStation VR

884
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Which is probably some other

885
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Game they just slapped Until Dawn's name on

886
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Okay whatever whatever it just goes to show

887
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But it shows that now the brand is successful

888
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And if they can do something like that if that's what they're doing

889
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
But I think and I never really finished my point but I think

890
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The whole social and the sharing and

891
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
All that was a big contributor to why

892
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
The game did so well I think

893
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
This game really owes a success

894
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
To Twitch, YouTube

895
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And social play throughs

896
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Thanks to that

897
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And I think Sony knows that that's a good thing

898
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I think it's Nintendo that has to be educated

899
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
A little more on that stuff but that's alright

900
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Okay some comments from

901
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Until Dawn in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

902
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Wyland says I loved

903
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Until Dawn

904
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
AkumaJP with another perspective saying

905
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Until Dawn in Japan is not selling well

906
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Censorship killed it

907
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
That's true you know a lot of times

908
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
We here are very envious of the things they

909
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Get in Japan but Japan's version

910
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Of Until Dawn was censored because

911
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
The violence is

912
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
You know not

913
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
As well received so they do some

914
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Fade to black in some parts

915
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh that's terrible

916
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Yeah like there's one particular scene and it is really gross

917
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
And I would not want to see it anyway

918
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But it fades to black

919
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
I wonder if it's the one they show you over and over and over again

920
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
After it happens in the previously vlogs

921
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah they do a lot of that previously stuff

922
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I wonder what the previously would happen when you

923
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
In the previously because each chapter

924
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Is like an episode

925
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And on the like previously on

926
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It kind of shows you the big decisions you make

927
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And it always shows you the death that happened

928
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Over and over again

929
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
It's kind of funny I mean like I said

930
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The acting in a lot of places is over the top

931
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
But I think appropriate and fun

932
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
For a game like that sure

933
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It's totally like it knows what it is

934
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It doesn't try to take itself too seriously which I love

935
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Fair enough let's go to Shane with your number

936
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Two pick of

937
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
2015 and I'm so excited to hear

938
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
What you finally settled on

939
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
My number two pick is Until Dawn

940
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
You also picked Until Dawn

941
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I did

942
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
And why did you pick Until Dawn

943
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Because I love that game

944
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
The story is fantastic it's engaging

945
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
It's hilarious it's really creepy at times

946
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I watch it

947
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
A lot still even

948
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Now months later on Twitch

949
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Just watching people play

950
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Because it's like watching a fun movie

951
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And it's neat to see

952
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
People's reactions

953
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Or things people do differently that you didn't do

954
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The first time you played through

955
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
The cast is great

956
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
The writing is there

957
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
I don't know if it's good or bad but it's definitely there

958
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And I'm really excited for a sequel

959
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Or whatever they do with the second one now

960
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
But aren't you a little worried that maybe

961
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
The sequel is not going to have the magic of this

962
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
First game because I mean

963
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Part of why I think this first game was successful

964
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Is because the bar was so low

965
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Now the bar is going to be higher

966
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
And this may be a really unfair comparison

967
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But the Blair Witch Project you remember that

968
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Remember when that movie came out it was like the biggest

969
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Fucking thing in cinema for like the year

970
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And this whole like found footage phenomenon

971
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And some people didn't know if it was real

972
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Or not and all this

973
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And then they made a sequel and it was god awful

974
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
But see the thing with Until Dawn is

975
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Strip away this cast

976
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And the lore around it

977
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And keep that same formula and I'll be fine

978
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
That's all I need

979
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Give me something just slightly different with new characters

980
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That don't know what they're getting into

981
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And we're good

982
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
But like they could stand to not show the same death scenes

983
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Over and over again

984
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
In the previously on

985
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Not that they're gross it's just like

986
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The first time you see it's like oh my god I can't believe it

987
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
But like 30 minutes later when you've seen it four more times

988
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Because they showed it to you again

989
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Four more times you're like okay

990
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I get it that person definitely

991
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Is you know not alive anymore maybe

992
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That person is very dead

993
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Very very dead

994
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Alright

995
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
And then going to our chat room with some comments

996
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

997
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Another comment on

998
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Until Dawn, Wyland says

999
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I think the sequel to Until Dawn should be something completely

1000
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
New, make the series

1001
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
In an anthology series

1002
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Well I don't want the

1003
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Same story, get rid of the

1004
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Characters too even though I'm gonna

1005
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Miss Mike a lot

1006
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I would like new characters

1007
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Alan Alchemy in

1008
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Chats making a little

1009
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Tongue and cheek reference to heavy censorship

1010
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
In another country saying

1011
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Until Dawn in Australia is just them

1012
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Showing up to the cabin and having cocoa

1013
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
And then it's like thank you for playing by

1014
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Because

1015
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
That'd be kind of funny

1016
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That'd be it

1017
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
That could be Until Dusk or something like that who knows

1018
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Anyway let's move on

1019
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Here it is

1020
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
My number two pick of 2015

1021
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
And it's actually one that's

1022
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Shown up on somebody else's list already

1023
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So we have a lot of consistency but my number two

1024
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Pick best game of 2015

1025
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Is Rocket League

1026
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I think Rocket League is

1027
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
One of the best games of the year

1028
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
It's actually the second best game of the year I believe

1029
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
My favorite

1030
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And the reason why is I think a huge part of that

1031
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Is accessibility

1032
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Because a lot of people that don't

1033
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Really play a lot of games

1034
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I find are really drawn to

1035
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Rocket League because it's so stupidly simple

1036
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's Mario Kart meets soccer

1037
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And everybody

1038
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You may not know a lot about soccer

1039
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
But you know the general rules

1040
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Place ball in goal

1041
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Okay that's very easy

1042
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And then most people have played some type of racing game in their life

1043
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So it's a really

1044
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Stupidly simple concept

1045
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
But then it has a lot of depth to it

1046
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
With people doing the air trick shots

1047
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And the rolls and things like that

1048
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And the game looks great

1049
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
And yeah

1050
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
I have loved Rocket League

1051
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And I love that it's another

1052
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Indie success story of the year

1053
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Along right up there with Undertale

1054
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And a lot of the things we've mentioned previously

1055
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
So that is why

1056
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I placed Rocket League number two

1057
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
On my favorite games list

1058
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Tigerclaw in chat says

1059
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
They released an update to Rocket League

1060
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
That adds hockey mode

1061
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
The ball turns into a giant puck

1062
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I heard about that but I haven't played it yet

1063
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm excited to check it out

1064
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Smaller ball, that was really hard

1065
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Oh my god

1066
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
It's harder to hit

1067
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
There's no way you're going to get an air trick on those things

1068
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Some people still did

1069
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's easy to pick up

1070
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But it's so hard to master

1071
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
But when you see someone that can master that game

1072
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I've been in a game where we lost 9-1 no problem

1073
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
One player on their team just has

1074
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Ultimate control, it's insane

1075
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Kaijuto in chat says

1076
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
That game needs planes, then I'd buy it

1077
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I could see it happening

1078
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You can fly in that game

1079
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You get a full thing of boost

1080
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
You do a little jump, you can boost in the air

1081
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
You can really take off, I did it in practice

1082
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's just so hard to do in actual game play

1083
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It would make a lot of sense to have planes in the game

1084
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But then I think it would be too hard

1085
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It's hard enough to play with the ball in three dimensions anyway

1086
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Planes is going to make it really hard

1087
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Alright

1088
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Here it is

1089
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The moment you've all been waiting for

1090
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The number one

1091
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Most favoritest game

1092
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Of 2015

1093
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
From Dark Sakura

1094
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You know what this is

1095
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I have a good feeling, but what is it Dark Sakura?

1096
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Dragon Age Inquisition

1097
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
For all of the DLC that came out this year

1098
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Fair enough

1099
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Even though it was a release from last year

1100
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Don't care

1101
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It's been made new again for DLC this year

1102
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Because the DLCs by themselves have been

1103
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Pretty crazy and new adventures

1104
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
And stuff and it's just added

1105
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So much more to the game

1106
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Dragon Age Inquisition game of the year edition

1107
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
This year which had all that DLC in it

1108
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah I paid for all of it

1109
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Of course you did

1110
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Trespasser if you

1111
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Were romancing Solas

1112
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Is like hi I didn't need my heart anymore

1113
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Step on it and set it on fire

1114
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And then shit on it

1115
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Hahahaha

1116
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
However if you're romancing

1117
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Cullen then ahhhh

1118
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Nice

1119
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So are you excited about the future

1120
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Of Dragon Age? I mean I know we've got another

1121
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Mass effect cycle

1122
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
To get through before we get there but

1123
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Eventually

1124
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah you know they're going to do another one because they pretty much

1125
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
How can they not?

1126
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I know the ending there

1127
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Yeah they're going to have to do more

1128
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And Inquisition I'm sure sold plenty

1129
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The Inquisition

1130
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Alright well nobody expects

1131
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The Dragon Age Inquisition on Dark Sakura's list

1132
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
But there it is

1133
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Number one

1134
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Well I thought you would go

1135
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
From this year and I thought you might pick the game

1136
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
That I'm going to pick but I guess not

1137
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Alright we'll see

1138
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Let's move on

1139
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Most favoriteist

1140
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Flaco Jones number one

1141
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
This is going to be such a surprise

1142
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
5 million people hinging

1143
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
5 million people

1144
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
It's almost as many people that follow me on Twitter

1145
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And all those people know

1146
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That all I ever talk about is Splatoon

1147
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Not only is it my favorite game of the year

1148
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
But it's one of my favorite games of all time

1149
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I just love it that much

1150
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
It's the best Wii U game

1151
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I have a blast playing it all the time

1152
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I don't know what else to say about it

1153
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I think it's a near perfect game

1154
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Thank god someone took a chance on a new IP

1155
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Exactly

1156
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
And it was Nintendo of all people

1157
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I mean

1158
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I guess all three games

1159
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Rocket League is not a new IP

1160
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
But the other two are new IP

1161
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yeah so

1162
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
It's just a great game

1163
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Again it's one of those kind of easy to pick up

1164
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Hard to master

1165
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You can just have a fun time

1166
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Just playing turf wars all you want or you can really get into ranked mode

1167
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Which I didn't think I would do originally

1168
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Because I don't like shooters

1169
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
But I started playing this and it's like

1170
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'll test out ranked mode and suddenly I'm getting better

1171
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And I start looking stuff up online

1172
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
How the gear works

1173
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
The special stats you get for each piece

1174
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
And then I went from just like

1175
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Oh I'm just going to play rollers

1176
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm going to shoot all the time

1177
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
It's just a great game

1178
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
For someone who doesn't like shooters

1179
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
It still worked out really well for me

1180
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
When I'm not in a mode of

1181
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I can't just splat everybody

1182
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Or kill everybody

1183
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I can just paint

1184
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And help out my team that way

1185
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Or help out my team in support ways

1186
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
There are some guns that work better at support

1187
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I've done all the research on this stuff

1188
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
I'm always in all the different community boards

1189
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And the reddit stuff

1190
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Tower controls right now

1191
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Bye guys!

1192
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And I do like

1193
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
That this game

1194
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Has kept itself relevant

1195
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
You can make fun of Nintendo

1196
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
For only having 2 or 3 Wii U games

1197
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
This year

1198
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But they've supported those games really well

1199
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
With these frequent updates

1200
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
We're constantly talking about Splatoon

1201
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Here on OLR because they did this splat fest

1202
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And now we have an entire

1203
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Internet war breaking out

1204
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
About planes vs cars

1205
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Or what was the other

1206
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
There was one where like

1207
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Our vs science was right down the middle

1208
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Right down the middle

1209
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
51-49 on both counts

1210
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
There was one I swear to god I said to act deaf

1211
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Fucking fight me

1212
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Pizza vs hamburgers

1213
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Cats vs dogs

1214
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
That was a big one

1215
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Pirates and Ninjas was the one that really

1216
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Toured the internet up

1217
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Because ninjas were so

1218
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Popular but popularity is really

1219
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
A curse in that game because it kind of hurts your team

1220
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And so

1221
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
They lost because what counts more

1222
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Than anything is winning which I think

1223
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Kind of is the way it should be it wasn't originally that way

1224
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That's why

1225
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
That's why dogs won

1226
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Even though the cats won way more games

1227
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The dogs won the splat fest because they were more popular

1228
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Well that's not really fun like the most popular

1229
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Team just wins without having to play

1230
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Well but I kind of see now why it was

1231
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
That way I wish there was a little bit more of a

1232
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
But in the end just win more games

1233
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
That's what's important

1234
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
A lot of people in chat lighting up about Splatoon

1235
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Kai Judo says Splatoon is the bestest of the best of the best

1236
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That's an exact quote

1237
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Act deaf says Splatoon is my number two game of the year

1238
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Some people talking about the recent Naughty vs Nights

1239
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Nice splat fest that went on

1240
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Vid Power says Splatoon is a post-apocalyptic world I'd like to live in

1241
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And even the little story that they tacked on there

1242
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's kind of fun too if you read all the behind the scenes

1243
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Like the sunken scrolls and all that stuff

1244
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It's kind of weird like what's going on

1245
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Back there with the squid people

1246
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
It's kind of creepy

1247
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Alright

1248
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Shane your turn here it is drum roll please

1249
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Your number one game of 2015 is

1250
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I want to say first that

1251
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Had I beat

1252
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Soma and Xenoblade Chronicles X

1253
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I'm pretty sure my list would be different

1254
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
From my top three

1255
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
We'll get to honorable mentions in a minute

1256
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Well then I didn't say that

1257
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But for my number one

1258
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
It's Splatoon

1259
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Because I play it so freaking much

1260
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And despite the fact I have problems with a lot of things about it

1261
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Like the matchmaking is terrible

1262
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Absolutely awful

1263
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
The splat fest

1264
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
The way they do it I don't like it either

1265
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Because if you like

1266
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
We were just talking about if you pick the more popular team

1267
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
You're pretty much guaranteed to lose at this point

1268
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And I think that's dumb

1269
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And that actually goes back to the matchmaking

1270
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But

1271
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
I get so pumped up when I'm playing

1272
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I just have such a good time

1273
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Nintendo really hit it out of the park

1274
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
With this new IP

1275
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And I really hope

1276
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
That we get a Splatoon 2

1277
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
On NX as a launch title

1278
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Because then you don't need any other games after that

1279
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

1280
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Shane's best game is PT

1281
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
You know we talked about that

1282
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Yeah that was last year

1283
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah we talked about this

1284
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It would be funny if PT was your top game this year

1285
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
And last year

1286
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You can't do that

1287
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I know you can't

1288
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Well DarkSakura did actually

1289
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
She just did it

1290
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Except mine had new content out this year

1291
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
That is true

1292
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And mine just got removed from the Playstation store

1293
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Actually

1294
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
YYR said he was able to download it

1295
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Yeah there's some new technique

1296
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Yeah you can get it again

1297
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Like literally

1298
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
In the span of a year

1299
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Literally everybody hates

1300
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Everybody hates a company they used to love

1301
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
In that game

1302
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
In large part

1303
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
But back to Splatoon

1304
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Splatoon is just so much fun

1305
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
You can't stop playing it

1306
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
You play with Flaco Jones online a lot

1307
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Oh yeah

1308
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Twin Squad

1309
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Because you can't do anything more than Twin

1310
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Or else you get screwed over

1311
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Because of their matchmaking system

1312
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Oh my god Nintendo learn online stuff finally please

1313
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Because it would really go a long way

1314
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Yeah the trisquads are the worst

1315
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Splatoon is so bad

1316
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
You're just against an organized team

1317
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Yeah that's not so bad

1318
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But yeah Trisquad why can't they just throw in an extra person

1319
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
An extra body helps

1320
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Or why

1321
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Do I have to play on Splatfest

1322
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
If I accidentally pick the most popular team

1323
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Why do I have to just play with my own people

1324
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Why can't I just wait for another match

1325
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Against the other team so I can actually contribute

1326
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
To the wins losses

1327
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
For my team

1328
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
To try to win Splatfest

1329
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Why as you know not a very high ranked person

1330
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
In ranked mode are you throwing S's

1331
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And S pluses at me

1332
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
When you know I can

1333
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Barely hold my own sometimes against like

1334
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
A minuses

1335
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So even though it's your favorite game there are still plenty of things

1336
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Oh yeah there's a lot of things wrong with that game

1337
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But it doesn't stop me from playing hours

1338
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
A day

1339
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Well it's my turn

1340
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
My favorite game of the year and guess what

1341
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You guys I picked a game that's

1342
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
On the Wii U

1343
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
My favorite game of the year

1344
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I really think

1345
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Is it Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival

1346
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I almost named it because it's fun

1347
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It was close no

1348
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
My favorite game of the year is Super Mario Maker

1349
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I think is the best thing

1350
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
That's happened to gaming this year

1351
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And I think because

1352
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
There's so much

1353
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
That kind of little big planet

1354
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Kind of started

1355
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
But I think the trouble that little big planet had

1356
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
In a way is that it was a new universe

1357
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And something that was completely new

1358
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
And it almost had

1359
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
A level of over complication

1360
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
With a lot of the stuff they added later

1361
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Now don't get me wrong I'm pretty sure little big planet

1362
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Was my favorite game of the year whatever year it came out

1363
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And it still is a fantastic

1364
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Series but I think what I really love

1365
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
About Super Mario Maker is that it took a formula

1366
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Literally anybody that's ever

1367
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Touched a video game knows

1368
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
And really opened it up

1369
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
For people to create anything

1370
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And you know we started off

1371
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
This year talking a lot about

1372
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Creation and you know we've heard

1373
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
The saga of Loki's game and

1374
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Lord knows if he's going to finish it or not

1375
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
But he's apparently really pushing to get something out by the end of the year

1376
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And you know we saw some of the

1377
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Results of what happened with the VoG jam

1378
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Earlier this year we were talking a lot about

1379
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Creating your own game

1380
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
And those experiences and I think Super Mario Maker

1381
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I think really bookends that

1382
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Because you take something

1383
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Pretty much every gamer out there knows

1384
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And yet you learn a lot about

1385
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Game creation through the things that you go through

1386
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Online with the game

1387
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Like I gotta say for me

1388
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
What a trip it is to watch

1389
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Somebody else play your level

1390
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
On Twitch or YouTube

1391
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And do things with it that you

1392
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Weren't expecting them to do

1393
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You know and I think that social element

1394
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
We talked about this before with Until Dawn

1395
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I think that social element and I wish Nintendo

1396
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Would get on board with this a little more and I think

1397
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I get the sense they're starting to warm up to it more and more

1398
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
But I think the social element has really

1399
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Sky-rocketed something like Super Mario Maker

1400
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
To just

1401
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Like its own

1402
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Genre in a way

1403
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
It's just crazy what an impact that game has had

1404
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And I love that the game has been continually

1405
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Supported with regular updates

1406
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Be it the new costume characters you can put in the game

1407
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Some of the new things they've been putting in the levels

1408
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Like the checkpoints and so forth

1409
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
I mean Nintendo

1410
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
God bless them they've only put out like three games this year

1411
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
On the Wii U but they have supported those games

1412
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
So so so well

1413
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
That it really is like a model that other

1414
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Companies should probably look at for

1415
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
The way they support their games

1416
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
So yeah I just

1417
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I can't not

1418
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Say that Super Mario Maker is

1419
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
It's my favorite game of the year absolutely

1420
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Just all the experiences

1421
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Just the other day one more quick story about the game

1422
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Just the other day I was playing

1423
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
It and I was doing some of the random courses

1424
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
The eight stage

1425
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Course which is on easy right

1426
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So you get a lot of like auto

1427
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Play courses and you get a lot of really

1428
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Dippy courses

1429
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
But one course kind of struck me a little bit

1430
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
And that was it was a

1431
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
A French player had made the course

1432
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Because you can see their little country flag

1433
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And it was something and I don't speak

1434
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
French but it was basically

1435
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Paris Je t'aime or something like

1436
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Paris we love you type of thing

1437
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
And it was obviously something that was made in

1438
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Response to the tragedy

1439
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
That happened in Paris and it was

1440
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
An auto play course but it went through

1441
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Like this Eiffel Tower scene

1442
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
That was made out of coins and I

1443
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Think you know they had some other landmarks

1444
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
That were there as well and it was like

1445
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Spelled out and I just I was

1446
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Kind of taken aback by

1447
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
We have all these arguments

1448
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
About our video games art

1449
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And what is art? Art

1450
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Is expression right it's a way

1451
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Of expressing yourself

1452
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Somebody chose to

1453
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
In response to what happened

1454
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
In their country this horrible

1455
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Horrible thing that happened they chose

1456
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
To express their feelings

1457
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
In a video game

1458
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
And not a lot of games

1459
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Have brought it to us on that

1460
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Level yes I know about other construction

1461
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Sets hell there were things like you know pinball

1462
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Construction set back in the 80s and we've

1463
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
We've had games where you can make other games

1464
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
But I don't think we've ever had

1465
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Something on that level of

1466
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Mario where you can

1467
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Do that so I was just really taken aback that

1468
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
You know somebody went to

1469
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Mario maker to express their

1470
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Feelings it was just like it was a really

1471
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Neat thing to see even if it wasn't

1472
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
The greatest level per

1473
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Say because I didn't play it was just auto

1474
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I was just like wow this is this is

1475
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Art video games are totally

1476
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Art and this is this is

1477
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
What it is so

1478
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Looking at our chat room over at

1479
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Live dot vog network dot com

1480
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Tiger kalon chat says I

1481
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Just played some super mario maker today

1482
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I played the new levels that were created

1483
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
By some of you guys

1484
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And ikuma

1485
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Jp says maybe it's time to get a wii u

1486
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You know we're gonna talk about

1487
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Honorable

1488
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Mentions in a minute here but I saw

1489
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
A configuration I was really thinking

1490
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Through the games this year I saw

1491
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
A configuration where easily my number

1492
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
One two and three games could have all been wii u

1493
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Games I mean really

1494
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And it's it's kind of close

1495
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
For for

1496
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Some of you guys I'm sure

1497
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Let's see also going to chat over at live dot vog network dot com

1498
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
DarkTetsuya says

1499
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I know I saw a level like that when Satoru

1500
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Iwata passed away someone

1501
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Did a tribute level to him and I remember

1502
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Playing it over the fall season

1503
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So there you go

1504
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Some other comments there on the

1505
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Art that is super mario maker my favorite game

1506
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Of 2015 so there it is so

1507
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
A lot of overlaps on our list

1508
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
But I think those are some good

1509
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Lists you guys does anybody want to take a second

1510
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
And I'll just open the floor to general

1511
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Comments does anyone want to take a second to call out honorable

1512
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Mentions any honorable

1513
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Mentions things that you were really going back and forth on

1514
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Mario maker was a consideration

1515
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
And I thought that might end up being your game

1516
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
But I it wasn't my

1517
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Favorite I didn't really play a whole bunch of it

1518
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Um Dan played it a lot more

1519
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Than I did um

1520
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
There was and it's actually more of a

1521
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Hack but Dan was playing this today tech mobile

1522
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
2015 uh huh

1523
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Um that's basically

1524
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Just takes like tech mobile and hacked in like

1525
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Modern teams sure and their

1526
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Players and what not it was kind of funny to watch them play

1527
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
It yeah um

1528
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I really I really am happy with the ones

1529
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
That I picked especially since you know the new

1530
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Content for dragon age really kept

1531
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
It like um you know

1532
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Like another chapter of the game you know

1533
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
And it was all content from this year

1534
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
So I was pretty happy with that

1535
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Uh look at our chat over at

1536
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Live.vognetwork.com William murder face

1537
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
And chat says what did you think about Witcher 3

1538
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You know I have to be honest as

1539
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Gorgeous as the game is as I was playing

1540
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Through it I just didn't get to really

1541
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Spend enough quality time with the game and like I said

1542
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
When we started this segment the reason why

1543
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
We call it our favorite and not the best

1544
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Is because

1545
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
We don't have time to play everything and I just did not

1546
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Get to sink the hours into Witcher 3 that it

1547
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Probably deserved probably because

1548
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Of the exact same time one of my honorable

1549
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Mention games I was playing a ton of

1550
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
And that would be Final Fantasy Heavensward

1551
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And a big part of the reason I really didn't

1552
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Feel comfortable putting that in my top 3 is

1553
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
A. Expansions fall in a really

1554
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Weird place I think I put the Diablo 3

1555
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Expansion in one year but that

1556
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Just changed the game fundamentally

1557
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Heavensward has had a weak follow up

1558
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Uh it's having a lot of problems right now

1559
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
In some of the patching content but I think the

1560
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Initial game

1561
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
That came out with the voice acting

1562
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
The dungeon design the music

1563
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Was really just

1564
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
A premier MMO

1565
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Experience and it kind of sucks that it's

1566
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's having some problems here a few months out

1567
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But I think because that game

1568
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Was sucking down like all my time

1569
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I don't really think I got to give

1570
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Witcher 3 a fair break

1571
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
What about some other honorable mentions from you guys?

1572
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Any? Well I said Soma

1573
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Just because I'm pretty sure I would end up

1574
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Loving the story if I finished it

1575
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Xenoblade honestly I've put so much time

1576
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Into Xenoblade Chronicles

1577
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
X has amazing music

1578
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I don't care what people say the story is really

1579
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Good it takes a little bit to get into especially if

1580
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
You are somebody that likes exploring

1581
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Open worlds which I usually don't by doing this

1582
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Game but

1583
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I can see it easily becoming my

1584
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Number one for this year

1585
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I will say Xenoblade was really close

1586
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
For me and one of those 1, 2, 3 configurations

1587
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Would have had Xenoblade on it but I just

1588
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Felt the hurdle

1589
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
You have to get through in the beginning is too great

1590
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
And it just kept

1591
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
That off me and you heard me express this

1592
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
On the show previously I love

1593
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Where I'm at now in the game and I think

1594
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
There is a lot to really love about

1595
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Xenoblade but you really

1596
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Have to work at it I think to

1597
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Love it and I think a really great

1598
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Game you shouldn't have to work at it

1599
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
And the only other game I would have considered

1600
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Probably because I just haven't

1601
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Played it enough yet because when I

1602
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Got it I was definitely

1603
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
On a lot of painkillers was

1604
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Rise of the Tomb Raider

1605
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And because I haven't played

1606
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Enough of it I can't really say

1607
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I think I see it on a lot of people's lists

1608
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
I'm pretty sure I'd put it on mine too

1609
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah I honestly have not gotten around

1610
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
To playing it yet just too much other stuff

1611
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Going on Flaco

1612
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Yeah like I mentioned Tearaway Unfolded was really

1613
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Cool on PS4 and it did a lot of stuff

1614
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Different than the Vita version but since the Vita version

1615
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Is better I was like I'll still knock that one down

1616
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I mean it's definitely a different game

1617
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And they change a lot and they actually make it a lot harder

1618
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And then let's see

1619
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yoshi's Woolly World

1620
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Liked that game a lot

1621
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Cracked top 3 there

1622
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
And the other game that's definitely

1623
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Right on the border top 3 is

1624
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Jackbox Party Pack 2

1625
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
We just talked at the top of the show

1626
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Bomb Corp alone is like

1627
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I think is worthy of being in that top 5

1628
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Of my favorite games of the year

1629
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So I just add in

1630
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
With Quiplash XL which is amazing

1631
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And that's it

1632
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Earwax is not good

1633
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Earwax is great and Fibbage is just Fibbage

1634
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
It's great so

1635
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I guess that's the one

1636
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
That's why it wouldn't crack the top 3

1637
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Not every game on it is good

1638
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I kind of wanted to put as my number 1

1639
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
ResVR but

1640
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I've only played one stage

1641
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
You did play it

1642
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
But I didn't beat it

1643
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Because they wouldn't let you beat it

1644
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
If they would have let me sit there and play all the stages

1645
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I would have gladly done that

1646
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Alright

1647
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Let's see

1648
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
The only other honorable mention I did come very close to putting

1649
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
In the top 3 but Shane I think you outlined all the issues beautifully

1650
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
With Splatoon

1651
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Well I think your issue with Splatoon is

1652
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
You just stick to a roller and you don't try anything

1653
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I have tried the other stuff and I don't like it

1654
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Just not enough

1655
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
You've seen me play the other stuff and you even said

1656
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
You should probably go back to roller

1657
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I probably did

1658
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I think that game also

1659
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
If you get frustrated really easily

1660
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
You probably shouldn't be playing it either

1661
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
The matchmaking thing really bugs me

1662
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I mean come on

1663
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
They did improve matchmaking

1664
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
With the last patch though

1665
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And that's sad that it's improved and it's still really bad

1666
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
No it wasn't because I only played

1667
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Even though there was a huge difference in the popularity

1668
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I only played my own team once

1669
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And there was the exact same disparities

1670
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
That's why I didn't think there was one

1671
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
And I followed another streamer

1672
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
And he only played the other team once

1673
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I think they've gotten better with that

1674
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
The game missed my top 3 narrowly

1675
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It's not a bad game by any means

1676
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
But I do have some issues that made me go

1677
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
I liked it as much as the 3 that I did choose

1678
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
The matchmaking has gotten a lot better

1679
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
That last Splatfest was definitely true

1680
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
That's good

1681
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
So just to recap real quick

1682
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Running down the 3-2-1 real quick

1683
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Dark Sakura 3-2-1 was

1684
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Undertale, Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

1685
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And Dragon Age Inquisition

1686
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
All the DLC that came out

1687
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Flaco 3-2-1 was

1688
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Rocket League

1689
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Until Dawn and Splatoon

1690
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
And Shane, pretty similar

1691
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
I thought you were going to say 3-2-1

1692
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I was going to say contact

1693
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Gotcha

1694
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Yeah, everybody's gone to the rapture

1695
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Until Dawn and Splatoon

1696
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
And mine was everybody's gone to the rapture

1697
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Rocket League

1698
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
And Super Mario Maker

1699
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Which was not on anybody else's list

1700
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
How does that happen?

1701
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
What? You didn't like it?

1702
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Oh my god

1703
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I don't own it either

1704
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
My list was all new IPs

1705
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Just saying

1706
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Take that everybody

1707
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Let's see

1708
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Wait, Rocket League

1709
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
It's a sequel

1710
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
And Mario Maker is definitely not a new IP

1711
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It's kind of Mario

1712
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Fair enough

1713
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Not that anyone played the original Rocket League

1714
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Or Mario

1715
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
That's it

1716
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I hope you guys enjoyed that

1717
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
We're going to get to some of your picks a little later

1718
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
In the FUGL question of the week

1719
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Ingress will catch up with Loki and his top 3 games of the year

1720
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Does anybody want to?

1721
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
He might be listening out there, I doubt he is

1722
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
But does anybody want to guess?

1723
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Because I feel like last year we were in the same situation

1724
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I think he was gone over the holiday show

1725
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And we guessed

1726
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
And we were close

1727
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Loki's top 3

1728
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I would guess Ingress

1729
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Which I'm going to give him so much hell about

1730
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
He would not put that on there

1731
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I think he will, I think he's going to put Ingress

1732
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
But it didn't come

1733
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But mine had new content this year

1734
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
And it was the content that was on my top of the list

1735
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
They do upgrade Ingress

1736
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I still feel like

1737
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
All this aside

1738
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I think the way the rules are set

1739
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
He's going to put Ingress in there

1740
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
He's put a lot of time into that

1741
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I think he will put Fallout in there as well

1742
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Mario Maker

1743
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
That would be 3

1744
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Is there a new Grand Theft Auto?

1745
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Not this year

1746
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Grand Theft Auto again

1747
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
There was a new Earth Defense Force

1748
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
But it didn't sound like he liked it

1749
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
There was something else he was playing this year

1750
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I wish I could remember what it was

1751
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
There was one other game

1752
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I can't remember now

1753
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Lego, he might put the Lego game he's been playing with his son in

1754
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
A lot, I wonder if he put that in

1755
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I don't know

1756
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Going to our chat over at

1757
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
live.vognetwork.com

1758
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Kostan in chat says

1759
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And like I expected, no one picked the Talos principle

1760
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Never played it

1761
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Well to be fair, that was a

1762
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Last year game

1763
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
It is on PS4 now

1764
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I thought about it

1765
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Bobby picked that as his game of the year

1766
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Last year I think

1767
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
There is some love for that game over at VOG

1768
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
And it is on my Steam wishlist, I hope to get to it soon

1769
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I played it at an expo

1770
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
One of the expos I was at

1771
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I want to say it was running on the Rift

1772
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Or one of those VR things, I could be completely wrong

1773
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
But I just feel like

1774
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
That's how I experienced that game

1775
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
That's like a whole other category

1776
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Games I wish I had played

1777
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
That probably would have been on my list

1778
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Like for me Tomb Raider, I don't have an Xbox One

1779
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Or uh, gosh what's the one I just had

1780
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Killer Instinct season 2 would have been a good one too

1781
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I really enjoyed season 2 of Killer Instinct

1782
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Life is Strange is another game

1783
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I think I would really like

1784
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
I just haven't gotten around to it

1785
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And now I'm seeing the disc release is going to come out January

1786
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I might just wait for that

1787
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
And then AkumaJP suggesting Minecraft

1788
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
For Loki, well there is Minecraft story mode

1789
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
But I feel like Loki kind of dissed that a little bit

1790
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So we'll see

1791
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
He said something about the voice acting he didn't care for

1792
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Yeah, so we'll see

1793
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
We'll get the results from Loki next week

1794
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
When he's back on the show

1795
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Alright, let's get into our gaming week

1796
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
So getting back to a little more recently

1797
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Let's talk about the video games that we have been playing this week

1798
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
We always like to start off the show after our kickoff topic

1799
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Which, well we have a long kickoff topic tonight

1800
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But with good reason

1801
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
The news this week

1802
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Is a little light

1803
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
You guys are going to split up Loki's stories right?

1804
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I don't know if Flaco even knew that

1805
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Ok, good

1806
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I tried to say it really quickly, quietly

1807
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Ok, good

1808
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Otherwise I guess I'm going to have to read them

1809
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
So anyway, we're going to get to some news

1810
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But the news as you can imagine is a little bit lighter this week

1811
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Although there were some big events

1812
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
But we do like to start off before we get into the news

1813
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Talking about our gaming weeks

1814
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And the types of video games we have been playing

1815
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
This week specifically

1816
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

1817
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Kind of busy

1818
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Even though I was actually busy with many other things

1819
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I didn't play any Dragon Age this week

1820
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Wow

1821
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I played Happy Home Designer, which I'm still super loving

1822
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I got Catlateral Damage

1823
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Which I haven't played yet

1824
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
But downloaded

1825
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And then we've just been playing all kinds of old school stuff

1826
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
On the

1827
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
The Everdrives

1828
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
I did download a bunch of stuff I had wanted to try on iOS

1829
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
So I was playing some R-Type the other day

1830
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Which I love R-Type so much

1831
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And I got Hearthstone

1832
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I started it off and then I realized that I had to

1833
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Because I have a new iPhone

1834
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I had to bring

1835
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Open up my old one

1836
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Get my authenticator code

1837
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And start my authenticator

1838
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
So I'm considering actually starting off Hearthstone

1839
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Like 50 million other people I work with

1840
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Play Hearthstone

1841
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
That's a good toilet game

1842
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I did also take Diablo 3 off of my PC

1843
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Gasp

1844
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
In order to make room for

1845
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
The Star Wars MMO

1846
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
But Diablo 3

1847
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Although Old Republic is pretty good too

1848
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
But you just need a bigger hard drive

1849
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You need a bigger hard drive

1850
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Even though

1851
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
That goes without saying

1852
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
But the other thing though

1853
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Is that I'm going to be starting back into Final Fantasy 14

1854
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
As a usual Wednesday night thing for myself

1855
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
So

1856
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Trying to rework some stuff

1857
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
And I've got

1858
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
A design project to do

1859
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
So my gaming time is going to get kind of

1860
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Narrowed down a bit

1861
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I think this is the time when a lot of people

1862
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Are thinking about the 2016

1863
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Like what am I going to do in games this year

1864
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And then they'll completely

1865
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
At least I did

1866
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I don't think I did any of the things I talked about

1867
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I was going to do in games

1868
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
You know what I'm going to do in 2016?

1869
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Live

1870
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
That's a good goal

1871
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Yeah my resolution

1872
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
For 2016 is

1873
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Not getting hit by a bus

1874
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Or getting cancer

1875
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Well good luck

1876
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
To you in that

1877
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I'd say those are pretty good resolutions

1878
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Alright well good luck

1879
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Moving on let's go to Flaco

1880
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
How was your gaming week?

1881
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
My gaming week was pretty good

1882
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Recently on the Playstation sale

1883
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I got Parappa 2

1884
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Which I'm terrible at

1885
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
You know the PS2 classic one

1886
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I'm just bad at rhythm games

1887
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
That's what Shane had me do and it works much better

1888
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I tried

1889
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
It wouldn't let me mess with him

1890
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I don't know if that's set on game it kind of just stays on

1891
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Okay I have a Samsung TV

1892
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And you put it into game mode

1893
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
See I have mine in game mode

1894
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I'm just bad at rhythm games

1895
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
You're just a baddie

1896
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So there's that

1897
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Oh I bought Tetris

1898
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
The ultimate casual game Tetris

1899
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I got it, I've been playing it tonight

1900
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I'm a Vita and it's also on the PS4

1901
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But now that's the really shitty

1902
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Ubisoft one that came out last year

1903
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
That has an amazing commercial though

1904
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yes it has a great commercial

1905
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So the Vita version is fine

1906
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
The Vita version is really nice, it doesn't have those weird

1907
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Lighting effects, I'm not listening to the music

1908
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
The music is terrible

1909
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
It sounds like some dystopian 80's movie

1910
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
It's really bad

1911
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
I hope while you're sitting in

1912
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Studio N7 during OLR

1913
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
You're not listening to the bad sound

1914
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I'm not, I have the volume down

1915
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
But I am playing the game while I'm sitting in Studio N7

1916
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Well maybe they made it for the Vita

1917
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And then some genius decided let's just blow it up

1918
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
You know what they did though, they delayed the Vita version

1919
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And I think that helped because I think they actually

1920
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Took feedback from the other version and fixed this one

1921
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Because it doesn't have the weird lighting effects

1922
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I feel like just trying to put it on

1923
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Next Gen at the time on PS4

1924
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
They tried to overdo it with the graphics

1925
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Because the graphics, it's really hard on your eyes

1926
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
When you're playing it, like there's these little light

1927
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Strobes that come off of it

1928
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
When you're really focused on Tetris

1929
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
It just makes it kind of dizzying when you're playing

1930
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And a little nauseating

1931
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
But when I played the Vita version, it's pretty tight

1932
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
And I think Vita is like the way you want to be anyway

1933
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Because that's just how I remember Tetris

1934
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's handheld, portable

1935
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
That's like my favorite way to play it

1936
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
That's been pretty great

1937
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Otherwise there's lots of Splatoon

1938
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And Marvel Puzzle Quest on my phone

1939
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Still play that like crazy

1940
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Did you ever check out the PS4 version?

1941
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
No, because they charge you 15 stupid dollars for it

1942
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
That's so dumb

1943
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
You can't import your other thing

1944
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I already have Hulk, like almost maxed out

1945
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Why would I want to then buy Hulk for like another $5 or whatever

1946
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I thought that was so dumb

1947
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
So I was really angry

1948
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
I wanted to watch you play it

1949
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
But it wasn't working that one night

1950
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
We tried to do SharePlay and it wouldn't work

1951
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
SharePlay didn't like me

1952
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I want to see what this feels like

1953
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
It's just Marvel Puzzle Quest

1954
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
I just like playing on my phone

1955
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Hearthstone is good too

1956
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I'm excited you got into it

1957
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
You know what's really fun on that

1958
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Is the solo adventure modes

1959
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I know they cost money

1960
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
But I've done it all through in-game gold

1961
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
But that takes a lot of time to earn

1962
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I used to play Hearthstone a lot

1963
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I had a lot of gold saved up

1964
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
But the adventure modes are really worth it

1965
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
There's lots of great voice acting in them

1966
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I just loaded it up

1967
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
And then stopped when I realized

1968
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
I needed my authenticator code

1969
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Aren't the first parts free?

1970
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Or am I wrong?

1971
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Maybe on Nax it was originally

1972
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
But they don't do that anymore

1973
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
You got to pay for it

1974
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But again, you can earn all through in-game gold

1975
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
I've never spent a set on Hearthstone

1976
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Even as much as I like it

1977
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I love the game, but Blizzard got enough money

1978
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
They don't need mine

1979
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
So I just play the game

1980
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
In the competitive mode

1981
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Because it's too cutthroat

1982
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And people who do spend money have an advantage

1983
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Because they can just get more cards more quickly

1984
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
And it gets a little cutthroat in there

1985
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
So I've just kind of stuck to

1986
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
You know, the solo modes

1987
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
They're really fun

1988
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
They actually put a single player experience in there

1989
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
That yeah, it helps you have better cards to do it

1990
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
But if you play naturally through the game

1991
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
You get some good cards, so

1992
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It's a good game

1993
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
To register participation

1994
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Check out this week's episode of Orange Andrade

1995
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
At vognetwork.com

1996
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Use the passphrase, birth

1997
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Shane, how about you?

1998
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
How was your gaming week?

1999
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So I played the tail end

2000
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Of the Street Fighter V beta

2001
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
This past weekend

2002
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Love that Vega is no longer a charge character

2003
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Makes him way more fun to play

2004
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And I played Splatoon

2005
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
A lot

2006
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And I played 14

2007
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Again some more

2008
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I'm going to go back into that

2009
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Even though I'm not happy with it

2010
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Even though he said he was going to quit

2011
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Cancelled his account

2012
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I did for like three months

2013
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
The very next day renewed

2014
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Well that was because

2015
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I didn't want my retainers

2016
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And Square Enix's support is very unhelpful

2017
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
You know, answering questions

2018
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Or being polite

2019
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So I figured it out though

2020
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
So I don't have my extra retainers

2021
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Anyway

2022
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
What else did I play?

2023
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Parappa 2, I beat it in like 40 minutes

2024
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
I was like, man, this game is so short

2025
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But I love it

2026
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And now Parappa has a blue hat

2027
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So he's a better version of himself

2028
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
And I got Fantavision

2029
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Which is also really fun

2030
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
And

2031
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I feel like

2032
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I missed around a little bit on Super Beat Sonic

2033
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
That's like a disappointment

2034
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
For me this year

2035
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
That game is not as great as I hoped it was going to be

2036
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
But

2037
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I think

2038
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
That's really it

2039
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I may have also driven to McDonald's to get a Pokemon

2040
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Because they were doing a download

2041
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Only at McDonald's

2042
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
And that was dumb, so I went inside

2043
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
And I got the Pokemon and mozzarella sticks

2044
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Don't get mozzarella sticks at McDonald's

2045
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
They are nasty

2046
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
The one by my house does

2047
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And it was so gross

2048
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Who else used to have mozzarella sticks?

2049
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Was it Jack in the Box?

2050
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Was it Jack in the Box? Most of all it was Jack in the Box

2051
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I don't think they do anymore

2052
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Sonic does, and their mozzarella sticks are amazing

2053
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
McDonald's

2054
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Learn from Sonic

2055
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Sounds so healthy, fried cheese

2056
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
You know what though?

2057
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
This show

2058
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I feel like

2059
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Exists in large part due to mozzarella sticks

2060
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And I mean that

2061
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Because not just our obsession with food

2062
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
But because when we used to play

2063
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
DDR at Roseville Golf Land

2064
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And how Loki, Darsakha, and I all met

2065
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
We would go to the little diner that was in the parking lot

2066
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
It's a local thing called Brookfield's

2067
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
And they have some bomb ass mozzarella sticks

2068
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Like to this day, oh my god

2069
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Probably the best ones I've ever had are there

2070
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And so we would burn off all these calories

2071
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Playing DDR

2072
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
And then put them right back on

2073
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Eating the mozzarella sticks

2074
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Now they have a soup that I've fallen in love with

2075
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Probably, what?

2076
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Now they have a soup that I've fallen in love with

2077
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
It's that one that you didn't like

2078
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
That I brought when you were sick

2079
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Oh, is that Brookfield's?

2080
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I'm gonna mispronounce it

2081
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
It's like the

2082
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Ovolo-lemono or something

2083
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
But it's like an

2084
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Egg and lemon soup

2085
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Chicken soup

2086
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Hey now, they're not paying for this plug

2087
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
I don't care, it's delicious as fuck and I want some

2088
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I'll add a counterpoint then, I hate Brookfield's

2089
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Their breakfast is so terrible

2090
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
They don't know how to cook anything

2091
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Alright, fair enough

2092
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Mark Tetsuya in chat pointing out that

2093
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
A&W cheese curds are better

2094
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Actually, those are pretty bomb too

2095
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I've never heard of that, that just doesn't sound appealing

2096
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
No, they're really good

2097
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
But they're curds

2098
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
And that sounds good, no matter what they are

2099
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
The word sounds really disgusting

2100
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Just like cheesecake

2101
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Cheesecake's good

2102
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I can't get over the fact that it's like

2103
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
A block of cheddar with frosting on it though

2104
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Wasn't our soccer night supposed to have cheesecake today and we didn't?

2105
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Yeah, we didn't

2106
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I got Chinese food though on Christmas

2107
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
That made me feel happy

2108
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Oh, that's good

2109
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I went to Panda

2110
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
They were open on Christmas?

2111
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Yes

2112
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I was like, oh my god, where's chicken?

2113
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Alright, My Gaming Week

2114
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
A lot of the same stuff I always talk about on this show

2115
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Final Fantasy XIV, but I also downloaded Parappa 2

2116
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I didn't play a whole lot of it

2117
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Because the timing was throwing me off

2118
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
But then Shane

2119
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
But then I came to the rescue

2120
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Alright

2121
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
But one game that I played a lot of this week

2122
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And I'm enjoying it quite a bit

2123
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Is Fast Racing Neo

2124
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
On the Wii U

2125
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I wasn't sure if I was going to dig this game or not

2126
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Because it's the game

2127
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
That somebody else made

2128
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Because Nintendo refuses to make a new F-Zero

2129
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
For some unexplainable reason

2130
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
So instead, these guys made Fast Racing Neo

2131
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
And when I first started playing it

2132
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I was like, wow, these menus are

2133
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Super basic

2134
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I was like, this doesn't really feel like

2135
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
As

2136
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I don't know what the word would be

2137
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
As rich or as immersive as an F-Zero game

2138
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Robust

2139
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Robust is a good word

2140
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
But once you actually get into the game

2141
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I was like, okay, well the meat of the game

2142
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
It is what it says it is

2143
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It is Fast Racing

2144
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Super Neo

2145
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Yeah, it is, it is very Neo

2146
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
But when I play it on my 62 inch TV

2147
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Or however big that thing is

2148
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I even get a little motion sick

2149
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
It moves so fucking fast

2150
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
And it's really smooth

2151
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Considering it's a Wii U game

2152
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Which doesn't have the same chips inside

2153
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Like a Playstation 4 and Xbox One

2154
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
They really get things moving very well

2155
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
In that game

2156
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
It felt a little more wipe out

2157
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
To me than F-Zero

2158
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
But that's not a bad thing

2159
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
I really like the wipe out games as well

2160
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
It's pretty much what you would expect

2161
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
In those Fast Racing games

2162
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
The mechanic in Fast Racing Neo

2163
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Is that you can flip the engine on your car

2164
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
From blue colored to orange colors

2165
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And it's kind of like an Ikaruga type of thing

2166
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Like that will trigger the blue

2167
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Or orange boosters on the course

2168
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
The one thing I don't like about the game

2169
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Is the controls

2170
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
And that's what really annoys me about it

2171
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Is the controls have this really odd configuration to it

2172
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
So that part really annoyed me

2173
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
But otherwise, yeah

2174
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I'm really enjoying the game

2175
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I watched you play it today

2176
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I just don't think it's that great of a game

2177
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Even though I didn't play it

2178
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
So maybe my opinion shouldn't matter as much

2179
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
But graphically, so beautiful

2180
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It's the best looking Wii U game

2181
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Hands down

2182
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
No it is, you can't deny it

2183
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
But it's lifeless

2184
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
The music is not great

2185
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
It looks like it was a text demo

2186
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
I don't think Wii U is as bad as you said

2187
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It's pretty bad

2188
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
But it looks like

2189
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
This is what you could do

2190
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
For a Wii U game

2191
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
You can make games look this pretty

2192
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
But this isn't like a game

2193
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
It's just a tech demo

2194
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
That's kind of like soulless, lifeless

2195
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's not anything that special

2196
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
I feel like

2197
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
So anyway, as I'm sitting here talking about it

2198
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I think I actually downloaded this last Sunday

2199
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
So I think I got into this a little bit on last week's OLR

2200
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
So sorry if I'm repeating myself a bit

2201
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
But I did play more of it

2202
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
And I'm enjoying it enough

2203
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
There's still some things

2204
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Kind of what

2205
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Shane is alluding to a little bit there

2206
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
But I don't

2207
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I don't think the negatives are as bad as he says

2208
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
So there you go

2209
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Fast Facing Neo, I've been having some fun with that game

2210
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
And playing more Mario Maker

2211
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Some other

2212
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Stuff too

2213
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
A few of the games on Steam

2214
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
I was playing Super Slam Dunk Touchdown

2215
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Because we had the Maker on last week

2216
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I was playing that Black Ice game

2217
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I liked that because we'd seen that in GamerX

2218
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And then Tron Run R

2219
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Which got an update I need to check out

2220
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Alright

2221
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Carson in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

2222
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Holy shit, I just checked it out

2223
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
And as Rob said, it's really fucking fast

2224
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Well it's in the title

2225
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Fast Racing Neo, you expect it's going to be a little bit fast

2226
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Alright, some quick housekeeping

2227
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
We will not be taking any shows off

2228
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Through the month of January

2229
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
The next show where we will not be here

2230
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Live is in February

2231
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
Because of MAGFest

2232
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
So if you are going to be out in MAGFest in DC

2233
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I've officially booked my flight, hotel, all that stuff

2234
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I'm going to be at MAGFest in February

2235
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I'm very excited about that

2236
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I will be absent on the show on the 10th

2237
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
That's right

2238
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
You are going to Disneyland

2239
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
To mourn the passing

2240
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Of Bucket of Meat

2241
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
You know that story is going around Facebook this week

2242
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
About all the stuff they're closing down

2243
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
To make Star Wars land

2244
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And Big Thunder Railroad too

2245
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
They're only temporarily closing that

2246
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I was going to say, they're not closing that right now

2247
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
But I want to go on it before it's closed down for a while

2248
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
They just had that closed for like a year

2249
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
When they were doing refurbishments

2250
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
It's kind of weird that they're closing that again

2251
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Alright

2252
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I just went on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad recently

2253
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Did you?

2254
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I went at night

2255
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
And the most amazing part was they started doing the fireworks show

2256
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
When I was on the ride

2257
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
We came out of a tunnel

2258
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
A Mickey shaped firework

2259
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Just appeared

2260
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Right in front of us as we came out

2261
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
That happened to me and Dan a few years ago

2262
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Yeah, we all lost our minds

2263
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It was the best

2264
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
That's such a storybook thing

2265
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
It was, I'm like how can this happen?

2266
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
They planned it, they know

2267
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Did it go faster at night?

2268
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Of course it did

2269
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
My son loved that ride, but at night he got a little scared

2270
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I have certain places I have to sit

2271
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
On certain rides

2272
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Always in the back and always with my husband

2273
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Cause he has a bigger lap

2274
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
And it has the two person lap bar

2275
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
So I get air

2276
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I used to be scared of that ride when I was a kid

2277
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Cause I'd ride with my dad and he was much bigger than me

2278
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Obviously he was my dad

2279
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
And I was just a little kid

2280
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I was scared of it, cause I was like oh I'm gonna fall out

2281
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
It's like no that's just more fun

2282
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
As I got older I'm like oh that is more fun

2283
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
You get air, that's what's so great about Tower of Terror

2284
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Is when it drops and you get off your seat

2285
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
It's so fun

2286
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I had a panic attack on the elevator when it fell two stories

2287
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So I tried to go on it to overcome my fear

2288
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Of falling like that

2289
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I had a panic attack

2290
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
In the gift shop

2291
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Wow, my wife refuses to even go on it

2292
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
We got all the way to the door and she's like nope

2293
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
So we had to be escorted out

2294
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
She got a little scared of that one

2295
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
She doesn't want to drop like that

2296
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
You just need to get a glass of wine in her first

2297
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Alright, let's see

2298
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Some other quick things I want to mention

2299
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
This is very important because this guy has been a support

2300
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
For a very long time

2301
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
And also projects that

2302
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I have done

2303
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
On the side, Horde House

2304
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
He was a huge

2305
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Impact on that show

2306
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And I just want to take a minute to acknowledge

2307
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Pod Culture

2308
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Hit their 10 year mark

2309
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
This week, that show started on Christmas

2310
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I didn't realize that, but their show actually started on Christmas

2311
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And so their 10 year

2312
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Anniversary show was this week

2313
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
So I want to give huge props to Brad

2314
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
And his whole crew

2315
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Adam, Christina, Glen, everybody over

2316
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
At Pod Culture for hitting

2317
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
10 years this week

2318
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
It's a fantastic accomplishment, yay

2319
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Clap clap clap

2320
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Pod Culture

2321
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Pod Culture, I love the way he says it too

2322
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
It's so good

2323
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So yes, congratulations Brad

2324
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
And everybody from Pod Culture

2325
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And I really hope I get to see you

2326
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
At Dragon Con this year

2327
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Although I know real life is more important

2328
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
But I'm still going to cross my fingers on my toes

2329
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
That you're able to make it to Dragon Con this year

2330
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Alright, and let's see

2331
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
What else do I want to mention here

2332
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Just briefly, it has nothing to do with games

2333
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
But I do feel as a nerd

2334
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
It is my responsibility to tell you all

2335
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I saw Star Wars

2336
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
It was so good

2337
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I've seen it twice

2338
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I know you went with me

2339
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
So I didn't have to go alone

2340
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Because Alan works at night

2341
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
So nobody else could really go to the movies with me

2342
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I saw Star Wars, which is notable because I never get out

2343
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
And see movies

2344
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
But I did go out and see Star Wars

2345
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
And I will admit, I really liked it

2346
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
It was my favorite out of all seven of them

2347
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
It really was

2348
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
So, kudos to Abrams

2349
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I didn't see one lens flare

2350
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
And this was very subtle

2351
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Are you blind?

2352
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I wasn't really looking for him

2353
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
You don't have to

2354
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I guess not

2355
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
It wasn't Star Trek bad

2356
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
They're not just on the bridge with lights

2357
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
In every camera

2358
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
When big lasers and stuff go off

2359
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
You can see it pretty clearly

2360
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Of course I'm not going to spoil it

2361
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I'm just going to say one thing

2362
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Not a spoiler

2363
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I just have to thank Star Wars

2364
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
For bringing Poe

2365
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Into my life

2366
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And I'm not talking about the poet

2367
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
And I'm not talking about the musician

2368
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Who disappeared somewhere in the late 90s

2369
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I'm talking about Poe Dameron

2370
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
The super hot guy

2371
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
From the movie

2372
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
So that's all I'm going to say

2373
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Thank you

2374
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I really want to get his Disney Infinity figure

2375
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Just because it's Poe

2376
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I hope it means more people watch Inside Llewyn Davis

2377
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Because that's a great movie

2378
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
He got an Oscar nomination for

2379
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
Adam Driver is in that as well

2380
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
The guy who plays Kylo Ren

2381
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I didn't even realize that

2382
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
It's a Coen Brothers movie

2383
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I saw it on opening week

2384
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Shane I feel a little bit like you

2385
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I have never been super obsessed

2386
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
With Star Wars

2387
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Star Wars is awful

2388
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I really hate Star Wars

2389
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Except for this one

2390
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I definitely wouldn't go that far

2391
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
You will go there

2392
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I was always more of a Star Trek person

2393
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Grandpa doesn't even have to pay me money to say that

2394
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I was always more of a Star Trek person

2395
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Than Star Wars

2396
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I was like okay I'll go see the new one

2397
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Just because it's a culture thing

2398
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
And everybody's really into it

2399
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
And as a nerd I feel a responsibility to go see it

2400
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
So I saw it

2401
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
And now I'm like

2402
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
When we were at Toys R Us today

2403
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I'm like I really want the Poe

2404
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Star Wars figure

2405
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
He keeps going into my best spy cart online

2406
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
We have no Rey

2407
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Yes you do because

2408
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
She's not a stand alone

2409
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Rey and Finn are in a Star Wars bundle

2410
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And I was like I can't get Poe

2411
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
And not get Finn

2412
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Well you get those and give me Rey

2413
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Listen

2414
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I like Rey though

2415
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Rey is their female companion

2416
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Listen fully Black Widow her

2417
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
From the toy line

2418
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Is that her only toy?

2419
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
If that is that's pretty sad again

2420
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Women totally get

2421
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Shafted when it comes to having

2422
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Action figures

2423
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Not in Power Rangers

2424
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
It is absolute bullshit

2425
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
You're preaching to the choir in this case

2426
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Because in the movie

2427
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Again I'm not going to spoil

2428
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
But I don't think it's a spoiler to say

2429
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
She kind of

2430
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
She's like the main character

2431
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
She kind of

2432
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I don't want to say she carries that movie

2433
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
But without her I don't think it would be as good as it is

2434
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
So

2435
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
It's bullshit there's no figure

2436
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Of her just like there are for the boys

2437
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
That are also very important in that movie

2438
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Well even Poe's not that important

2439
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
But he's got many figures

2440
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Don't forget about the figure that they did for

2441
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Sir Not Appearing in this film

2442
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Yeah they made a figure for

2443
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Somebody that got cut I think

2444
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Alright alright we got to watch the spoilers

2445
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
It's not a spoiler

2446
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
The character's not in the movie

2447
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
But they made an action figure for him

2448
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And as I've been calling him he's Sir Not Appearing

2449
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
They should have made an action figure

2450
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
For the cameo that I freak out

2451
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Over every time I see that movie

2452
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
What Chanel number 3?

2453
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Spoilers but yes

2454
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
That's not a spoiler

2455
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
She's Carrie Fish's daughter

2456
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
Not a spoiler

2457
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
It's great nepotism

2458
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I just need to have the Captain Phasma figure

2459
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
To put on my cubicle

2460
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Even though she was like

2461
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
I'm not going to spoil it but I love her

2462
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Alright now our chat

2463
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Is starting to get hypersensitive about spoilers

2464
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I mean if we really wanted to spoil you

2465
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
There's other stuff we can say

2466
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
We haven't spoiled anything

2467
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
So go

2468
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Quick go see it before you see some freaking meme

2469
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Or something online

2470
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Or you can see Krampus

2471
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
We're close though to the

2472
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Statute of limitations on spoilers

2473
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
So go see it

2474
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Before we start

2475
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
No we're not a movie show

2476
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Before I start

2477
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Jamie will come to your house, knock on your door

2478
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And scream it if you don't see it

2479
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
In the next 30 days

2480
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Although I do have to say that Ray is very similar

2481
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I used to play the Star Wars RPG tabletop

2482
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
She's very similar to a character

2483
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
That I played like 10 years ago

2484
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Nice

2485
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Alright

2486
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Back to games

2487
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Let's get into the news this week

2488
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
And I'm going to start us off with a big thing

2489
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
That happened on the Christmas holiday

2490
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
That I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard about

2491
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
It was probably the big story of the week

2492
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,000
And that is the fact that Steam

2493
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Had some major issues this week

2494
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Steam wasn't hacked per se

2495
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Or at least that's not what they're saying is happening

2496
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Something happened with Steam's caching servers

2497
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
And what happened

2498
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
In a nutshell is that when you would go

2499
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
On Steam, you're presented

2500
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
With pages from other people's

2501
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Random accounts

2502
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Basically

2503
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And there's screenshots out there on like

2504
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:41,000
NeoGaf and some other Twitter I think has some too

2505
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Where you see random people

2506
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Thankfully, and thank you Twitter people for doing this

2507
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
They blacked out the really sensitive

2508
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Information, but you can clearly see that they're

2509
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Able to see somebody's account name

2510
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
And they can see the address, phone number

2511
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
And email address that

2512
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Goes with an account

2513
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
And so what basically happened

2514
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Is that as people

2515
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Were logging in and using Steam

2516
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
To go about their business and make transactions

2517
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Because after all there is a Steam sale

2518
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Going on, some people's data

2519
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Would be saved to the cache server

2520
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
And then that data was then accidentally

2521
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Delivered to other people that had

2522
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Nothing to do with that transaction

2523
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I'm really oversimplifying this

2524
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I can't tell you what really happened because

2525
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Valve is, in my opinion

2526
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Valve is being really dodgy about what happened

2527
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I'm trying to cut them a break

2528
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Because it's fucking Christmas

2529
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
And I understand like nobody's in the office

2530
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
But at the same time, they are

2531
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Running a major sale right now

2532
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
So I do expect that, you know

2533
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
If they're gonna ask for money, they do kind of owe it to us

2534
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
A little bit to explain exactly

2535
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
What's going on

2536
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
And I kind of feel like their statement right now

2537
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Is more, it's not happening anymore

2538
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Don't look behind the curtain

2539
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
But whatever

2540
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
So anyway, yeah

2541
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
So basically on Steam

2542
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Other people's private information

2543
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Was being displayed to unrelated people

2544
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
And I gotta say, when I found out about this

2545
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
I went super cyan

2546
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Pissed off on Twitter

2547
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
And I was mad

2548
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
And I even kind of said some pretty mean things

2549
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
On Twitter because

2550
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,000
I saw some people were kind of going

2551
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Well, it's a good thing I don't use Steam

2552
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And I'm on Nintendo

2553
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Nintendo doesn't have these problems

2554
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Well, PlayStation 4 fixed that issue

2555
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
Why can't Steam fix that issue

2556
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
And I was like, no!

2557
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
There is a big difference between

2558
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
What happened on those networks

2559
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
And what happened on Steam

2560
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
And what's funny is, I'm actually on the side of

2561
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
What happened on Steam is way worse

2562
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
What happened on PlayStation 4

2563
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
I don't know if it's ever happened on Nintendo

2564
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Probably maintenance and stuff

2565
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
But downtime, DDoS attacks

2566
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
That's one thing

2567
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
It takes the server down

2568
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
People are upset, whatever

2569
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Oh no, so forth

2570
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
But this was displaying people's

2571
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Personal information

2572
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Full on display

2573
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
To other people

2574
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
And you guys know I am a big advocate for privacy

2575
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
And so forth, and I've talked about

2576
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Some of the issues I've had in the past

2577
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
And why I like to use a fake name online and so forth

2578
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
So obviously to use my credit card on Steam

2579
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
I don't use that

2580
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
And I'm sure that potentially

2581
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
And thankfully I took the Internet's advice

2582
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
And just didn't use Steam on Christmas

2583
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
I mean it helped that I was on the road all day anyway

2584
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
But I didn't use Steam

2585
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
At all that day

2586
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
So I don't think my information was out there

2587
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
But I was really pissed off

2588
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Thinking that that possibility

2589
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Was even there

2590
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
That somebody could have seen my address

2591
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
My phone number, and even the last four of my credit cards

2592
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
What the actual fuck

2593
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I think Steam has some huge explaining

2594
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
To do with this

2595
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And what they've said so far isn't enough

2596
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Like this really

2597
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
And you guys might think I'm blowing this out of proportion

2598
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
I don't think I am

2599
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Because I take privacy and this type of stuff

2600
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Like very seriously

2601
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
And you might be thinking

2602
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Well Rob, if you don't want to do that

2603
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
You probably shouldn't give them that information

2604
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
You have to give them that

2605
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
To use your credit card on the store in the first place

2606
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I mean I guess I should have used a prepaid card

2607
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Or something like that

2608
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I didn't learn there oh well

2609
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
But I mean

2610
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Steam has boasted

2611
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
About its security before

2612
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Outright boasted

2613
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
They've come up on stage and said

2614
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Our two-factor authentication is so awesome

2615
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
I don't remember who he was

2616
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
I don't know if he was the CEO

2617
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I don't think anybody at Valve has titles

2618
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
So he was some guy speaking on security

2619
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
He's like, here is my account

2620
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And my password

2621
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
It's secure, you'll never get in there

2622
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
And I know to date

2623
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
The two-factor authentication has been so good

2624
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Nobody's got in there

2625
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
And I do have two-factor authentication enabled on my account

2626
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Guess what, it wouldn't have fucking mattered in this case

2627
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
And that's why I'm really

2628
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Really upset about what happened with Steam

2629
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Isn't part of it also

2630
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
The fact like

2631
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
The thing that happened with Steam

2632
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Wasn't that just something on their part

2633
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
That screwed up

2634
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Whereas the other network issues that happened

2635
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Like Xbox Live and Playstation Network

2636
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Think it's funny

2637
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
So it's like a huge difference there too

2638
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
It wasn't because somebody outright attacked

2639
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
The services, Steam screwed up

2640
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
And I'm gonna say

2641
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Something that might blow your mind here

2642
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
But this is honestly how I feel

2643
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Because I think the closest thing to this

2644
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
That has happened in gaming in the past few years

2645
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Is when the Playstation store was hacked

2646
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And all those credit card numbers were stolen

2647
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
And so forth

2648
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I would rather somebody

2649
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Steal my credit card information

2650
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Than see my address and phone number

2651
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
That's how I honestly feel

2652
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Because credit cards, guess what

2653
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,000
They are like stupid easy to

2654
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Say this is a fraudulent charge

2655
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
It's not me because that also happened to me

2656
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Earlier in the year, it had nothing to do with games

2657
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,000
But somebody charged $50

2658
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
At like a Chuck E. Cheese in Pasadena

2659
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
And then some random store in St. Louis

2660
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
And I'm like what the fuck, so I called my bank

2661
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Easy, done, no problem

2662
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Easy peasy fix

2663
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
That's why credit card companies get money

2664
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
It's to fix these situations like this

2665
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
So honestly

2666
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
If somebody gets the credit card number

2667
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
I honestly don't think it's as big of a deal

2668
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
As somebody potentially knowing

2669
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
What my phone number is and where my house is

2670
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
And maybe that's just because of some of the experiences

2671
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I've gone through in life and so forth

2672
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
But like this is worse in my opinion

2673
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
And I have some huge trust issues with Steam now

2674
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Because A, they're not fucking explaining

2675
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
What really happened

2676
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
And they're not

2677
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
They're not explaining how it's not gonna happen

2678
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Again and trying to earn my trust back

2679
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I don't need a free fucking game

2680
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Or Steam money

2681
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Or training, I just

2682
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Want reassurance

2683
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
This is not gonna happen again

2684
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I wanna know how it happened and how it's not

2685
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Gonna happen again because

2686
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
For them to get up on stage

2687
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
And the chat room is telling me it was Gabe Newell

2688
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Who actually got up there on stage, sorry

2689
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
It was a long time ago, to get up on stage

2690
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
You're just a random employee though

2691
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
We are the most secure company

2692
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Because of two-actor authentication

2693
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I'm the president and I'm gonna give you

2694
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
My password because the two-factor's so

2695
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Strong so if you use it, you'll have the same security

2696
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
To have that fail

2697
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Is a real violation

2698
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Of my trust, I think

2699
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And that is why I'm super cyan pissed off

2700
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
At what happened on Steam

2701
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
If you think I'm going overboard, oh well, it's my opinion

2702
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
So I don't know, anybody else wanna comment on

2703
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
What's going on with the Steam stuff?

2704
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I mean, it was fixed after a short amount of time

2705
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Was my information on

2706
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Display? Probably not because I didn't use

2707
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
The service during that particular hour

2708
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
But I have been on

2709
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Steam off and on throughout

2710
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
The sale, I was doing the trading cards every

2711
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Day, since Christmas

2712
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I kinda

2713
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Stopped

2714
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I've bought three things since that went down

2715
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Yeah, and it's, I just, I don't know

2716
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Are you, are you, do you

2717
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Think I'm too upset

2718
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Dark soccer or what?

2719
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I think that they've dealt with the problem

2720
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
And that your information probably didn't get out there

2721
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
It's what

2722
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
I tell people

2723
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
You're like, oh well this could have happened

2724
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Did it happen?

2725
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
No

2726
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
If it's not going to happen

2727
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Again, if they now

2728
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Know of the issue and know how to prevent it

2729
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
From happening

2730
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I honestly think that

2731
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
There's really no

2732
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Use getting too worked up over it

2733
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
It's the past

2734
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I'm sort of like half with you

2735
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Because I get that it didn't happen

2736
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
To me, and I know I'm sitting here going

2737
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
It could have, but

2738
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
To be fair, the people that it did happen to

2739
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
They don't know

2740
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Because that's the other end of this

2741
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
You don't know whose information got displayed

2742
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Is Valve going to alert these people?

2743
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
They haven't said

2744
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
And if it was me

2745
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Is Valve going to know who got reflected?

2746
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
I don't think they do

2747
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
I don't think they do either

2748
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
In my opinion

2749
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
They're going to get sued over it

2750
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
And they should

2751
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I see you rolling your eyes

2752
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I wasn't rolling my eyes

2753
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
The whole thing is

2754
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Chances are it was noticed

2755
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
By a few people

2756
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
I doubt that everyone looking at it is so malicious

2757
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
That they're going to actively start looking

2758
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
For people that they want to see

2759
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
It only happened for people who had recently made

2760
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Purchases, right?

2761
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
So it was just cached data

2762
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
So it's not anything

2763
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
That they're going to be able to do much with

2764
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Apart from

2765
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Now, I understand

2766
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
There are stalker situations

2767
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
But those are

2768
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
More often than not

2769
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
First of all, they would have to have actively

2770
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Been looking for the person that they're trying to stalk

2771
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Knowing the username

2772
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
And then finding that data that way

2773
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
It would still require work

2774
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
To get this information

2775
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
So it would have to be somebody actively trying to go after

2776
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
Who knows the person's username on Steam

2777
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
And you can change your username on Steam

2778
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Right. Now there's a lot of

2779
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Talk and chat back and forth

2780
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Was it a hack? Was it not a hack?

2781
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
My understanding was that

2782
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
It was an internal failing

2783
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Now, could something from the outside

2784
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Have tipped that internal failing?

2785
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I don't think so

2786
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Based on what we know about the situation

2787
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
But when Valve has given us a very

2788
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Short answer and I really feel like

2789
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
They're trying to sweep this under the rug

2790
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
I really want to see what happens next week

2791
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Because, uh-uh, you are not sweeping this under the rug

2792
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Valve, you are not sweeping this under the rug

2793
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
You need to explain how the fuck

2794
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
This happened a lot better

2795
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
So we're clear, you know, if it was a hack or not

2796
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:25,000
And if it wasn't, then what happened?

2797
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:27,000
What's being done to this in the future?

2798
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
So, anyway

2799
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
There you go

2800
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Alright

2801
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf in chat

2802
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Says, this was one employee who was

2803
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Most likely an employee who is no longer employed

2804
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
By Valve, you set something incorrectly

2805
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
On Akamai

2806
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I don't know how you actually pronounce that

2807
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
But the name of the actual caching system

2808
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
So, we'll see

2809
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I don't know, we'll see what comes in the coming weeks

2810
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
But I do not want this story to go away

2811
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Because I need to know

2812
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
If I'm to continue to use Steam, which I'm not sure

2813
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,000
I want to in the moment

2814
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
How they're going to prevent this from happening again

2815
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
And once they address the issue, I'll probably

2816
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Simmer down, I forgave PlayStation

2817
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
As a lot of people did, you know

2818
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I still shop at Target, but

2819
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I bought three things today

2820
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
On Steam

2821
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Right now

2822
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
So, I mean

2823
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I haven't gotten any weird mail

2824
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
There's probably a lot of people

2825
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
In your boat, and that's fine

2826
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:25,000
But I'm

2827
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Choosing not to

2828
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Until I have that reassurance back

2829
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Steam has lost some of my trust

2830
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Alright, moving on

2831
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
Darcyra

2832
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Well, Bayonetta

2833
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
As we all know, she is

2834
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Now going to be in Super Smash Bros

2835
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
However, her inclusion

2836
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Nearly changed the rating of the game in Japan

2837
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,000
They

2838
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Actually

2839
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Were

2840
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Because she's very

2841
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
What's a good word for it?

2842
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Sexual

2843
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
You know

2844
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
They thought that it would

2845
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
That putting her in the game

2846
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Would basically remove it for the

2847
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,000
A for All rating

2848
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:09,000
However, after

2849
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Discussion

2850
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
And working on it, they figure

2851
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
She's, I guess, safe enough to

2852
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Hang out with Cloud, so

2853
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
They've NSFW'd

2854
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Or they've taken out the NSFW

2855
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
And sterilized her a little bit

2856
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Which I find really odd for Japan

2857
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Given

2858
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
That, at least

2859
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
In my experience

2860
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Well

2861
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
I don't know, I would think that

2862
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Having a character that might be

2863
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
A little bit more risque

2864
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Wouldn't be as

2865
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Big of a deal, given that things

2866
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Like, well then again

2867
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,000
In America we have a tendency

2868
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
To sexualize

2869
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Nudity, which in and of itself

2870
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Is not a sexual thing

2871
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
You know

2872
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
And

2873
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
She doesn't really get naked

2874
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
She gets maybe less

2875
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Clothed the more she uses her hair

2876
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
You never see your titties

2877
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
In the game

2878
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
And she's flirty and does a little bit of bad talk

2879
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
But she's not like

2880
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
Overtly

2881
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I don't know

2882
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,000
I'm just really surprised at that

2883
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,000
But you know what's interesting, we did talk about

2884
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Until Dawn being censored in Japan earlier

2885
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
So we do have some cases

2886
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,000
Where, I mean that's violence

2887
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
I was always of the opinion

2888
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
That things like, you know, blood and gore

2889
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,000
I mean if you look at the history

2890
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Of, at least back for the 16-bit era

2891
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Games would be censored

2892
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
When they came here instead of how they were there

2893
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I mean look at Splatterhouse

2894
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Or look at, well even

2895
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Mortal Kombat

2896
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
Or Samurai Shodown, that was one

2897
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Cause on Samurai Shodown

2898
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Too, I actually have the Samurai Spirits

2899
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Neo Geo cartridge

2900
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
And if you play it in Japanese mode

2901
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Then it's got red blood

2902
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
And if you play it in the American mode

2903
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
It's sweat

2904
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,000
So, you know

2905
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I'm very, I'm just a little bit surprised by that

2906
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
But I mean, it is what it is

2907
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,000
I mean, I guess maybe

2908
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,000
You know, her smacking down

2909
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:11,000
People with the guillotine

2910
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Or her demon boot

2911
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Is a little bit too much

2912
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,000
AkumaJP in chat

2913
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Who is in Japan

2914
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
And listens to this program live sometimes

2915
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Thanks for being here

2916
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
I mean, the billboards here in Akihabara

2917
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Breast, naked chicks everywhere

2918
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
So, uh

2919
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Yeah, maybe there's, you know what

2920
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
A lot of those same double standards exist here

2921
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
In the US too, just for what it's worth

2922
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I, we're

2923
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Nintendo

2924
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Bayonetta will not corrupt the youth

2925
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
They were already there

2926
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Deal with it

2927
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Well I am super excited for Bayonetta and Smash

2928
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And, you know, I'm pretty sure

2929
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
It's not like she's gonna have, like you said

2930
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
She's not gonna have her guillotine move

2931
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Or a lot of the super violent stuff she has in her games

2932
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,000
They're not gonna bring that to Smash

2933
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
You're not gonna be able to chop Peach's head off

2934
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
With some move

2935
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Although it'd be kind of rad if that were a thing

2936
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:05,000
No, I'm just kidding, you can't do that to

2937
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Mario and friends

2938
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
You can't do that, alright

2939
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Let's move on, who's doing our next story? When are you guys, right?

2940
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Oh, I was trying to tweet

2941
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Oh, well, sorry, but

2942
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
You know, during live radio, you never know

2943
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
When it's gonna get deeper

2944
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Let's just stop the show

2945
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,000
Let's go to a break

2946
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,000
So, Shane can finish his tweet

2947
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
So, with

2948
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Amplitude already out

2949
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And coming out soon

2950
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
For people that didn't pay

2951
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
$40 or more to back it

2952
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
Like me

2953
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
They are adding

2954
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
And have added

2955
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
This story sucks

2956
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
A mode to make it look like frequency

2957
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
So, in Amplitude

2958
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Your tracks are all laid out

2959
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Horizontally

2960
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,000
But in

2961
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
Frequency

2962
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
You were kind of in this

2963
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Tube

2964
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Going around in circles

2965
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,000
To hit the tracks

2966
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Well, Harmonics said that

2967
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
They initially changed it in Amplitude

2968
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
To allow for better

2969
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Track recognition

2970
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
But between the fans and even the developers

2971
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,000
It was pretty much split

2972
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
On which way people

2973
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Preferred, the frequency way or amplitude way

2974
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
So, for this

2975
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
New reboot, they've actually

2976
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Added a mode that makes it so you can play it like frequency

2977
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
And for me, I'm

2978
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,000
Super excited because I preferred the frequency

2979
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Method a lot more

2980
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
It took a lot of getting used to for Amplitude

2981
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:35,000
And I'll be happy

2982
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
To play this game the way I

2983
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Would have preferred to back when

2984
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:41,000
They released the original version

2985
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
The end

2986
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Have you played? You were a big backer

2987
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Of Amplitude, have you played?

2988
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I paid $20 for it

2989
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Wait, so did you

2990
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Get the PS4 version?

2991
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
No, because you had to do $40

2992
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Two weeks, one week early

2993
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:59,000
So I'll get it when it comes out

2994
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,000
In January, next

2995
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Next week I think it is

2996
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
But I played it at

2997
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
PlayStation Experience

2998
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
And it was Amplitude

2999
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:11,000
There it was

3000
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Not much different

3001
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
At all, so I mean

3002
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
I'm fine with that

3003
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I have a feeling I will be a little

3004
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Disappointed based on some of the things

3005
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
I've been seeing

3006
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
And already disappointed just kind of

3007
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
At the song list in general because

3008
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Something that really stuck out

3009
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,000
In frequency and amplitude for me

3010
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Was the inclusion of

3011
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Random genres of music

3012
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
That I never would have listened to

3013
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Or never thought would be good in a music

3014
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Game like Quarashi

3015
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Or they had a lot of hard rock stuff

3016
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Randomly

3017
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
And this is mostly

3018
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
In house music

3019
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
This time

3020
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
That was something that concerned me too

3021
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
About going into the game is that they

3022
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Weren't going to have the money to do all that license stuff

3023
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
So I really wanted to see

3024
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Part of the reason I didn't back it

3025
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
I wanted to see what the quality of the game

3026
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Was going to be first

3027
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
If it was going to be able to live up to the original

3028
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I get in the sense it is from a lot of the YouTubes

3029
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
And stuff that I'm seeing but

3030
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
There's also a part of me that's like

3031
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
It's just a lot

3032
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Just rock band blitz

3033
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
And

3034
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I kind of just want to see them do rock band

3035
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Blitz on Playstation 4 and

3036
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Xbox One I kind of wish they'd do that

3037
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
I don't know what's going on over at Harmonix

3038
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
But I feel like they're just losing their touch

3039
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Overall

3040
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
And you see some people out there abandoning ship a little bit

3041
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Which is a little weird so

3042
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
I also don't like, and I understand that

3043
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
This is part of the nature of Kickstarter

3044
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
But I don't like that the super

3045
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Uber backers get an extra song

3046
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
That we apparently will never get

3047
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I think

3048
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
That's kind of a bad decision

3049
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
And also

3050
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Makes me feel like

3051
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Maybe they do another Kickstarter

3052
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Maybe I won't support it because

3053
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I'm not going to pay $200

3054
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
To get an extra song

3055
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
But they expect

3056
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Me to throw them money to get what now

3057
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
I feel is an incomplete game

3058
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
ActDeft in chat

3059
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com says

3060
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Having licensed music

3061
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Costs money, lots of money

3062
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Not lots of money

3063
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
I saw how much it cost

3064
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
At Konami when we did DDR

3065
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Some of that stuff is super cheap you'd be surprised

3066
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
So maybe

3067
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
But also

3068
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
And you don't have to go for well known stuff

3069
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Yeah, DDR also never really went for the AAA stuff

3070
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Like

3071
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Yeah we had garbage in that, that was cool

3072
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
We had David Bowie in

3073
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Amplitude or Frequency, that was cool

3074
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
But at the time

3075
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
I'm sure Quarashi didn't cost

3076
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
$3,000 to put in the game

3077
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
They still win

3078
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
They'd probably pay you $3,000 to get in the game

3079
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Because they probably aren't doing anything

3080
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
It's stuff like that

3081
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Don't go for big names, but go for

3082
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
A name

3083
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
It would just kind of help balance it a bit

3084
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
I think

3085
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
I kind of skimmed the soundtrack

3086
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Or the song list rather

3087
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
At Playstation Experience

3088
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
A lot of it just sounded like electronic music

3089
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
That's cool

3090
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
But I want something more

3091
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
I think that's what really brought a lot of the charm to the game

3092
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
And I don't see that there

3093
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Bobby Blackwolf

3094
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Offering a different perspective saying

3095
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
It may have been cheap before music games took off

3096
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
But the music licensing landscape changed

3097
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
With regards to video games

3098
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Rock Band and Guitar Hero

3099
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
They always go for a very big AAA genre

3100
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
I think back to some of the greatest

3101
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
DDR games

3102
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
I still think the best one they ever did here in the US was Ultramix 2

3103
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
And with that series

3104
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
It was a lot of really unknown

3105
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
That game alone

3106
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
Introduced me to so many new

3107
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Bands that were amazing

3108
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Granted, some of those bands were

3109
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Part of a label that maybe

3110
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Konami had a partnership with

3111
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
To get cheaper stuff

3112
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Again, you don't have to go for huge things

3113
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Go for

3114
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
They're based out in Boston

3115
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Go for local random Boston artists

3116
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
It doesn't matter

3117
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
It just brings something different

3118
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
That's why Freezepop is always in the game

3119
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Go get some random hip hop artist

3120
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
In Boston that's not a big name

3121
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Or a hard rock artist

3122
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Something like that

3123
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Just get me something that's not just electronic music

3124
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Just diversify

3125
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
The soundtrack a little bit

3126
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Alright, well let's move on to another story

3127
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
That talks about the NX

3128
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
We brought up Nintendo's successor

3129
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
To the Wii U a little earlier

3130
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
The NX, although of course that won't be the final name

3131
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
But that's what everybody's calling it right now

3132
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Because the hype is growing more and more

3133
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
About the NX possibly

3134
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
Releasing next year

3135
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
But, the analysts are coming out

3136
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
And the analysts are having their say

3137
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
On what's going on

3138
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
And you know this guy always

3139
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Has to say something when it comes to video game analytics

3140
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
And that's Michael Patcher

3141
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
He's still something?

3142
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Yeah, and I don't know the guy

3143
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
And whatever, I know other podcasts

3144
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Have had him on, he's probably very pleasant

3145
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
But at the same time

3146
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I really think what he's doing isn't all that different

3147
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Than what you and I are doing

3148
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
He's just got some more schooling

3149
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
And experience in financial industries

3150
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
But I see him commenting on

3151
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Entertainment stuff all the time too

3152
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
It's not just video games

3153
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
But anyway, here's what Patcher says

3154
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
First, mobile game will flop

3155
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Miitomo will get 100 million downloads

3156
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
So it'll be a success

3157
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
But it'll drop out of the top 100 grossing games

3158
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
On iOS and Android by the year end

3159
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I think people will try it, but I don't think they'll find

3160
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Social chat compelling enough to spend money

3161
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
In my opinion, Miitomo offers

3162
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Little that isn't already widely available on Facebook

3163
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Younger consumers not on Facebook

3164
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Will probably find it appealing, but they typically have

3165
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Little or no access to credit

3166
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
So Nintendo will have trouble monetizing Miitomo

3167
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
To his credit

3168
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
I actually kind of see that perspective

3169
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
A little bit, but I also think we know

3170
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Way too little about Miitomo

3171
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
To say that it's going to do nothing

3172
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Instead of just the social stuff

3173
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
So I don't know, we'll see though

3174
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
Nintendo's second mobile game

3175
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Will be a resounding success

3176
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I actually think Miitomo is intended to be a platform

3177
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
That allows people to create a personalized image or character

3178
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
And use it on other Nintendo games

3179
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I am hopeful that the second effort

3180
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Is something more familiar, such as the

3181
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Super Mario platformer

3182
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I think the game will attract 200 million downloads

3183
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
And will be a top 20 or possibly top 10

3184
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Grossing game on both iOS and Android

3185
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
But here's the other big one

3186
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
The NX won't come out in 2016

3187
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Nintendo has a history of announcing

3188
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Consoles in one year and launching the next

3189
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
And I don't see the NX

3190
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
As deviating from that pattern

3191
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
William Ritterface

3192
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
With a comment or chat over at

3193
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Live.FogNetwork.com

3194
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Why should we care what he says?

3195
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
That's an excellent question

3196
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
No matter what I say and all this stuff about him

3197
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Because his analytics

3198
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Are so well respected and so forth

3199
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Investors listen

3200
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
To what he says

3201
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
And invest their money

3202
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Sometimes as a result of his

3203
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
Predictions, so to speak

3204
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
That's a lot of what the stock market is

3205
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
And a lot of these analytics

3206
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Come in

3207
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
When we talk about the stock market

3208
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
That's the reality

3209
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Whether you agree with it or not

3210
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
We're in turn mentioning this

3211
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Because these comments

3212
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Get picked up on Wall Street

3213
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Journal-esque type of sites

3214
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
And could

3215
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Possibly impact investorship

3216
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
On into 2016

3217
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And even Dungeon Buster in chat

3218
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Says, Patrick's a Wall Street analyst so he's just

3219
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Looking at it from an investor standpoint

3220
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Interesting

3221
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
Though that last comment there, I don't want to gloss over

3222
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
This, NX won't come out in 2016

3223
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Nintendo has a history

3224
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Of announcing consoles in one year

3225
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
And launching the next

3226
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
And I don't see the NX as deviating

3227
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
From that pattern

3228
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Announcing how though? Because they kind of announced

3229
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
It already

3230
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
And that's a very good counterpoint

3231
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
They've said more about NX

3232
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
At this point than they said about Wii U

3233
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
This far out

3234
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
So they have kind of already said

3235
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
This is something we're working on

3236
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Even though

3237
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
You always know these big companies are working on

3238
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Successors, Playstation 5

3239
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Xbox

3240
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Whatever they call it, 2

3241
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
They're in development right now

3242
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
But you know, obviously

3243
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
It's going to be a while before we see the results of that

3244
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
So obviously

3245
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Nintendo is working on a successor

3246
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
It's just usually not talked about so publicly

3247
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
So that's why I think we feel like it's coming

3248
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
A little sooner than it might

3249
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
But to be fair, the Wii U was shown

3250
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
A long time before it came out

3251
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Because I think they wanted to

3252
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Get more developers on board

3253
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Because Nintendo is always that

3254
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
We've got a silly concept type of thing

3255
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
And so Nintendo shows it

3256
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
So that the developers can start

3257
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Thinking about how they want to use it

3258
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I also think it's for consumer benefit too

3259
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Because you just throw something out there

3260
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
That

3261
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Out there

3262
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
And they're not going to understand what to do with it

3263
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
So if this isn't super crazy

3264
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Like the Wii or Wii U

3265
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Maybe they wouldn't need that extra time

3266
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
Alright, well

3267
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
We'll see what happens

3268
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Obviously this is all just

3269
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Miss Cleo future predicting

3270
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Until E3

3271
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Which is when we're probably going to hear

3272
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
What it's really called instead of NX

3273
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Let's just hope they give it a good name

3274
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
And we'll see

3275
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
What the catch is about the system

3276
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
And what's to expect

3277
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Alright, let's move on

3278
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates

3279
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Well, we have a statement that was

3280
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Put out

3281
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
By

3282
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Kimishima

3283
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
The new Nintendo president

3284
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Who had a few things

3285
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
To say about the year in review

3286
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
It was something that was released

3287
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
To shareholders and investors

3288
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
The big thing on here though

3289
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Is that he made a mention

3290
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
I'm just

3291
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Going to read this section

3292
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Because it's going to illustrate it

3293
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Of course, very good

3294
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
We leverage Nintendo IP

3295
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
In various ways beyond our traditional

3296
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Use of them

3297
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Predominantly within the dedicated video game platform business

3298
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Furthermore

3299
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
In our attempt to establish

3300
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
A sustainable and continual relationship

3301
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
With our customers

3302
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Sorry, consumers

3303
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
We are creating a new membership service

3304
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Called My Nintendo

3305
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
And a new account system

3306
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Which will work as a bridge between our dedicated

3307
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Video game platforms and other devices

3308
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Where our consumers can get in touch with Nintendo IP

3309
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
And thus

3310
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Will work as a mechanism to

3311
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Maximize the number of people

3312
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
That interact with Nintendo's IP

3313
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
That

3314
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Seems to me that

3315
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
They're

3316
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Already, I think, looking outside

3317
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
Of just standard video game stuff

3318
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
They did start off as a card company

3319
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
But I think that they're trying

3320
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
To work for

3321
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
Everything, toys, figures

3322
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Non-video games

3323
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Things like that

3324
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
It seems to me that

3325
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
We're going to be hearing a lot more about

3326
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
My Nintendo

3327
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I'd say

3328
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Yeah, I mean, they've had such success

3329
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
With the toy thing

3330
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
And they're hoping to have a lot of success with mobile

3331
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I don't know how Pokemon Go

3332
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Is going to play into that

3333
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
I understand Pokemon Company is their own separate thing

3334
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
But it would be very interesting to see if that does tie back

3335
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Into the Nintendo infrastructure

3336
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
One way or another

3337
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
But we, of course, know about Miitomo

3338
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
And they want to grow that as well

3339
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
So you basically have Nintendo across

3340
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
All these platforms

3341
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Which, to be fair,

3342
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Microsoft's probably the closest

3343
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Otherwise

3344
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Because your Xbox, Microsoft account

3345
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Can work on your Windows

3346
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
And works in a lot of those other places

3347
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
I don't think Sony's really there with what they've got going on on PlayStation

3348
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Because Sony hasn't really penetrated

3349
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Other parts of

3350
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Your living room and your office

3351
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
If that makes sense

3352
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Haha, penetrated

3353
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
You want me to say it again, Dar Sakura?

3354
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Penetrated

3355
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Sony has not yet

3356
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Penetrated, but they hope to

3357
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
They're hoping to get some

3358
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Yes

3359
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
The other thing, though, is that

3360
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
They did mention NX

3361
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
In the statement

3362
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Without going into too much detail about it

3363
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
But just as it says on here

3364
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Nintendo is currently developing

3365
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
A gaming platform codenamed NX

3366
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
With a brand new concept

3367
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
And our unique software-led hardware

3368
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Software integrated business

3369
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Will continue to constitute the core business

3370
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
For Nintendo

3371
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
So

3372
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I think they're banking a lot on NX

3373
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
On top of that

3374
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
So there's a few things to be read into this

3375
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Speculation, of course

3376
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Which, again, they're talking about all this now

3377
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
I think it actually supports that we could be seeing

3378
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
NX, whatever it is, a little sooner rather than later

3379
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
But I also

3380
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I can still

3381
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
Also understand the whole, don't get your hopes up

3382
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
That it's a sure thing for

3383
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
December 2016, because maybe

3384
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
The focus is really going to be on

3385
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Zelda on the Wii U

3386
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
At this point, it wouldn't surprise me one bit

3387
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
If Zelda is all the way holiday

3388
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Next year, be ready for that

3389
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
And mobile

3390
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Their renewed focus on mobile

3391
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
The transition to NX in 2017, who knows

3392
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Anyway

3393
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Let's move on, we're going to travel around the world

3394
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
And check out some release dates

3395
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
But I think it's probably going to be

3396
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
A little slow this week

3397
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
I tried to look at the US release dates for Loki

3398
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
And nothing's out this week

3399
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
In the US

3400
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Hooray, because I didn't see anything to look up

3401
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
There isn't, I checked the sources

3402
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Which, of course, there's nothing new this week

3403
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
And going over to Japan

3404
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Nothing coming out in Japan

3405
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
So I don't know, does Europe

3406
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Have any games to save this segment this week?

3407
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Do we have any late December releases?

3408
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Yes, now there's nothing for

3409
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
The New Year, I checked on that

3410
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
But we do have a release for the 30th

3411
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
And that's Story of Seasons for 3DS

3412
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
That's

3413
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
It

3414
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
One lone 3DS title in the entire world

3415
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Is launching this week

3416
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
It's so lonely

3417
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
It's a lonely story

3418
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
That's right, it's the best game

3419
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
In the entire world

3420
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
For the last week of the year

3421
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Alright

3422
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys

3423
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week

3424
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Let's get to it

3425
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Who's going next, Flaco?

3426
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
There's this giant picture on the article

3427
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Oh wait, it looks like it's gone away

3428
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Okay, so

3429
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter is still happening

3430
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
No, don't pop up on my thing

3431
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
It's still happening

3432
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Actually no, Tekken Cross Street Fighter

3433
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Is supposed to be better than Street Fighter Cross Tekken

3434
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Because I have more faith in Namco

3435
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Than Capcom right now

3436
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Well I guess they recently revealed that Akuma

3437
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
Is going to be joining the Tekken 7 cast

3438
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
I don't know anything about these games

3439
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Just sound like you do

3440
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I totally know everything about

3441
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter

3442
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
I did see Street Fighter

3443
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
At the PlayStation experience, I saw a little bit of the

3444
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Tournament

3445
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
Did you see the Street Fighter movie?

3446
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
I did watch the movie

3447
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
So I'm very well informed now

3448
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Although I did see that movie

3449
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I just don't play fighting games that much

3450
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
People were wondering if

3451
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
They were still going to make

3452
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Oh wait is it

3453
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter

3454
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
So they're still making that one

3455
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
The quote here is from

3456
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Senior designer Michael Murray

3457
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Said, it's still in development

3458
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
That's the quote

3459
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Please look forward to it

3460
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
It's been a period to launch the game

3461
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Since Tekken 7 was released

3462
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
For the moment we are focused on Tekken 7

3463
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
But he says it's still in development

3464
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
But we might recycle the engine and use it

3465
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
For Tekken Cross Street Fighter

3466
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
As Capcom did with Street Fighter 4

3467
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
But it seems like there's been a lot of fighting games

3468
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Doing well lately it seems like

3469
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Especially on PlayStation 4

3470
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I would be curious about

3471
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter

3472
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
I think that could be interesting

3473
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Who do I have to sleep with

3474
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
For Capcom vs SNK to happen again

3475
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
That's the one that I want more than anything

3476
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
I want to play Tekken 7

3477
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Because they have a really hot character

3478
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
In it named Shaheen

3479
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
He is super good looking

3480
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Shaheen? What?

3481
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
He's the Middle Eastern fighter

3482
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Yes he is

3483
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
He is super gorgeous

3484
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
I'll tell you what impressed me about that one

3485
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Is that they actually did interview

3486
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
People from the region he's supposed to be from

3487
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
To make an accurate character

3488
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Doing their research

3489
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Indeed doing their homework

3490
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Being ethnically sensitive

3491
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter was first revealed

3492
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
In 2010 or unveiled whatever

3493
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Alongside Street Fighter Cross Tekken

3494
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Street Fighter Cross Tekken took only two years

3495
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Afterwards to come out

3496
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
This has been going almost six years

3497
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
What are we going to get first?

3498
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Let's say but what will we get first?

3499
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Okay here we go

3500
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Will we see

3501
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter

3502
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Kingdom Hearts 3

3503
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Or Final Fantasy 15

3504
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
15 first

3505
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Then Kingdom Hearts 3 we've seen enough of

3506
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
That we know it's going to come out eventually

3507
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I got one more

3508
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
The Final Fantasy 7 Remake

3509
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Episode 1

3510
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
I bet it will come out before all those other ones

3511
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Probably so

3512
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
You think Final Fantasy 7 Episode 1 is going to be first?

3513
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
I think it will be before 15

3514
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
You guys are high

3515
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I think Final Fantasy 15 is the first

3516
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
15 they have to put a whole game out

3517
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
7 Remake Episode 1

3518
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
You guys are high

3519
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I think it's going to be

3520
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
That's wishful thinking

3521
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
It's going to be Final Fantasy 15

3522
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Then the 7 Remake

3523
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
And Dark Dead Studio you can time stamp this

3524
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
For Shane to play later when I'm wrong

3525
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
It's fine

3526
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
But it's going to be 15 first then the 7 Remake

3527
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Then Tekken Cross Street Fighter

3528
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
No then Kingdom Hearts

3529
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Because we've seen footage of Kingdom Hearts

3530
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
When's the last time you saw Tekken Cross Street Fighter

3531
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Never

3532
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I saw Tekken 7 footage and you know they're just going to shove

3533
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Chun Li into Tekken 7's engine

3534
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
That's what's going to happen

3535
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
That sounds gross

3536
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Well he did recently mention

3537
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
It is quote, pretty far

3538
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
In development

3539
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
They drew the logo

3540
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Hold on we have to do this again

3541
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
What do we have now?

3542
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
We have Tekken Cross Street Fighter

3543
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Final Fantasy 7 Remake Episode 1

3544
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Final Fantasy 15

3545
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Kingdom Hearts 3

3546
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
And you ready for one more?

3547
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Half Life 3

3548
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
That doesn't even count that's a myth

3549
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
But no Last Guardian

3550
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Where does that fall?

3551
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
After Final Fantasy 15

3552
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Before 7's Remake

3553
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
No Man's Sky

3554
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Alright

3555
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
That's enough

3556
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
I forgot about that game

3557
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Because it's never coming out

3558
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
I swear they're trying to

3559
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Wedge that into VR somehow

3560
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Probably

3561
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Oh my gosh that'd be fun

3562
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Dark Tetsuya sums up

3563
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
This segment perfectly by saying

3564
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Oh for fuck's sake

3565
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
That's something I would

3566
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Expect Dark Sakura to sigh over there in the corner

3567
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I would say

3568
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
For fuck's sake but I don't give a fuck

3569
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
I'm looking at Buzzfeed

3570
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Y'all can just keep arguing about whatever

3571
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
I feel like

3572
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Oh these top 25

3573
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
gifts from Game of Thrones that showed when I

3574
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
didn't give a fuck like is that what you're looking at right now?

3575
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
No I'm actually looking at

3576
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
this picture of gorillas

3577
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
inserted into

3578
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
The

3579
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
The Force Awakens

3580
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
I know how she feels

3581
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Alright

3582
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
All joking aside I feel like this should be a segment

3583
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Because I feel like Loki would have a lot of fun with this

3584
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Like what will happen first

3585
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
This

3586
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
This or Half Life 3

3587
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
And that should be the

3588
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
We're gonna play this more often

3589
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Maybe we can get a game

3590
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
widget on the site

3591
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Maybe Bobby will have another rainy day project there

3592
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
We can have a

3593
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
This, this or Half Life 3 what's gonna happen first

3594
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
You know what I just thought of an idea of a segment

3595
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Just now

3596
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Da fuck is that

3597
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Where we get the weirdest of all weird

3598
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Vaguely video game related things

3599
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
And just say da fuck is that

3600
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
We can start with that dish you have

3601
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
that came with the Dreamcast game

3602
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
Da fuck is that

3603
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Oh that's just Japanese marketing

3604
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Alright

3605
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Ikuma-san tell us

3606
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Don't like isn't it a really big thing to have weird

3607
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
collector's editions of everything

3608
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
popular in Japan

3609
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Some

3610
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Some folks in chat are very supportive about the

3611
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
new segment idea we might have to make that happen

3612
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Tigerclass says I'm surprised you guys didn't do

3613
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
a list list for what you want to see happen in 2016

3614
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
You know that actually was on the agenda for tonight

3615
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
when I thought Loki was still gonna be here

3616
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
I didn't want to do it without him so we'll probably roll that over to next

3617
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
week so plus we're actually

3618
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
We're already at 8 o'clock and haven't even taken a break yet

3619
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
I'm hungry

3620
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
Alright well let's quickly then talk

3621
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
about Killer Instinct a fighting game

3622
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
which none of you have mentioned

3623
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I did

3624
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Yeah god you don't pay attention

3625
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
Yes he just mentioned it

3626
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Honorable mentions

3627
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
I know

3628
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I said season

3629
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I said season 2 was like an honorable mention

3630
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Okay so what's gonna happen

3631
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
first the Final Fantasy 7 remake

3632
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Half Life 3 or Rob

3633
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
listens to Shane

3634
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
It's not the last one

3635
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
So anyway

3636
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
well alright then since Shane is hanging

3637
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
on everything this game does Killer Instinct

3638
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
will be bringing a combo assist

3639
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
mode to the game I guess to make

3640
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
pulling off combos in the game a little easier

3641
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
so you can button mash even more

3642
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
to your heart's content but the good news is

3643
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
the old way of doing combos will still work

3644
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
for those of you guys that got used to it

3645
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
so assisted

3646
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
combos basically you tap a second attack button

3647
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
during the cancel window of a first

3648
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
and that will transition your character into a

3649
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
special move after that another

3650
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
button press will do an auto double

3651
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
now that's already in the game but yet another

3652
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
will do an auto linker and then ending

3653
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
the combo it's as easy as forward

3654
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
and doing a heavy punch or kick and they

3655
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
they have some visuals and I'm sure this will be

3656
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
in the game to be explained as well but they're

3657
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
making comboing in Killer Instinct a lot

3658
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
easier and all joking aside with

3659
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
me listening or not listening to Shane

3660
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Shane did convince me

3661
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
to pick up I think it's

3662
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Season 2 I got on Xbox One

3663
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Cinder, that's all you need is Cinder

3664
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
and I've been having fun with that

3665
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
it's a good fighting game

3666
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
and they did such a better job with Season 2

3667
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
with the story mode because

3668
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
it's actually like interesting

3669
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
whereas Season 1 was really dull

3670
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
and bare bones

3671
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
alright the combo assist coming

3672
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
to Killer Instinct in their next update

3673
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
which I don't think is dated as

3674
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
of yet but I imagine it's in the coming days probably next

3675
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
month alright so

3676
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
let's get to a time when

3677
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
games they didn't get these regular

3678
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
monthly updates

3679
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
you had a cartridge and that was

3680
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
it take it or fucking leave it

3681
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
it's the classic game of the

3682
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
week Dark Sakura

3683
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
she don't give a fuck about these new

3684
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
games so she's gonna

3685
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
go into the gaming vault

3686
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
she's gonna go into the gaming vault and find

3687
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
a game that she thinks hey

3688
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
you kids should all be playing this game this week

3689
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Dark Sakura what is the classic

3690
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
game of the week

3691
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
I think you should let the video answer that question for us

3692
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
there you go I have to hit play that helps

3693
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
huh?

3694
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
well

3695
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
well done

3696
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
I picked

3697
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Kirby's Avalanche because yes I've already done

3698
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Puyo Puyo and I've mentioned

3699
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's

3700
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Mean Bean Machine in that segment

3701
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
but I wanted to do Kirby's Avalanche in particular

3702
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
because it is my favorite of all the Puyo Puyo games

3703
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
it was my introduction

3704
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
to Puyo Puyo and I think a lot of people

3705
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
stateside who didn't follow the import scene

3706
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
really I think it was this or Dr. Robotnik's

3707
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Mean Bean Machine so it's a fair pick

3708
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
exactly and also

3709
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
I did it in honor of

3710
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Act Deft for sending me

3711
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
the delicious gift of his

3712
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Oreos that Dan and I might have eaten all of

3713
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
if you find more

3714
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
I will seriously do another trade with you

3715
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
and I will send you those

3716
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
rich cream flavored

3717
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Oreo things

3718
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
and I found the blueberry cheesecake one so I'll send you

3719
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
those too this is like a million more Kirby

3720
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
games she can make the classic game of the week so there you go

3721
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
I've done other Kirby games

3722
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
there's still more I bet

3723
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
like Act Deft

3724
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
like has pictures of Dark Sakura

3725
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
by his bed not in a creepy way but

3726
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
just like cause he loves her so much for all the

3727
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Kirby games she always picks

3728
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
that's still in a creepy way if they're by the bed

3729
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
hey I'm allowed to be worshipped

3730
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
no

3731
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
that would be in a closet with candles

3732
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
that you'd have to have like a double door

3733
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
Act Deft take pictures of you trying to make cookies

3734
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
actually

3735
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
I'll just settle for more cookies cause those

3736
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
were amazing

3737
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
short tangent

3738
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
Dan who's like stop buying cookies

3739
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
why do we have all these cookies he's like

3740
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
oh my god those are the best cookies I've ever eaten in my life

3741
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
how dare any human say to

3742
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
another stop buying cookies

3743
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
what kind of is this fascism

3744
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
I married that I love you Dan

3745
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
hearts

3746
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
anyway Kirby's Avalanche

3747
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
was known in Europe as

3748
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Kirby's Ghost Trap

3749
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
and it is of course a puzzle game that was done

3750
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
by HAL Laboratory

3751
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
and by HAL because high is Puyo Puyo

3752
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
and bad presto

3753
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
it came out on February 1st

3754
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
1995 in Europe

3755
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
so it came out in Europe first

3756
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
and April 25th 1995 in North America

3757
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
which I actually got this game

3758
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
right after my birthday

3759
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
right after I graduated

3760
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
high school

3761
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
it is basically the Western

3762
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
release of Super Puyo Puyo

3763
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
and technically the 4th Kirby game

3764
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
that was released for the Super Nintendo

3765
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
basically

3766
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
I mean it really is just Puyo Puyo

3767
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
you have two colored blobs

3768
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
that fall from the top of the screen

3769
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
and you gotta rotate them and match them up

3770
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
and once you get 4 or more of the same color touching

3771
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
they'll disappear and the blobs from above

3772
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
will fall down and you can do

3773
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
combos that way and drop like big

3774
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
like kinda clear-ish rock

3775
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
blobs on whoever you're playing against

3776
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
so you have a

3777
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
storyline for this

3778
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
and basically

3779
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
it has almost the same

3780
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
storyline for Super Puyo Puyo

3781
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
so basically

3782
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
King Dedede

3783
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
challenged Kirby and

3784
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
all the other people who live in Dreamland

3785
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
to an avalanche competition

3786
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
at the Fountain of Dreams and Kirby

3787
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
says you know what I'm gonna do this

3788
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
although Kirby's kind of a

3789
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
dick to Wispy Woods come to think of it

3790
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
cause like Wispy Woods

3791
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
is like hey don't step on my

3792
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
root and Kirby's like bitch

3793
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I'm stepping on your root

3794
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
oh yeah we'll play avalanche then

3795
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
or Puyo Puyo

3796
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
so yeah

3797
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I think Dark Soccer should explain lots of games

3798
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
bitch

3799
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
I'm gonna step on your root

3800
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Kirby was kind of a dick to

3801
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Wispy Woods

3802
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
by the way there's this little gif going around

3803
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
of Wispy Woods all decorated for Christmas

3804
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
and Kirby going

3805
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
his little sucky thing and turning into

3806
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
a Christmas tree

3807
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
Kirby as Bayonetta

3808
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
is really effing adorable

3809
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
just so we're clear

3810
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Kirby does suck

3811
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
literally that's his power

3812
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
is sucking

3813
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
who can make sucking be so cool

3814
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
why did he just say before he challenged Wispy Woods

3815
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
he says I like apple pie

3816
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
that's what he said

3817
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
yeah he was like don't tread on my roots

3818
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
yeah the tree was like don't tread on my roots

3819
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
and Kirby was like I like apple pie

3820
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
that made no sense

3821
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
yeah

3822
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
anyway

3823
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
there are some differences

3824
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
so with Super Puyo Puyo

3825
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
it basically was Arl

3826
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
and carbuncle

3827
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
the big Puyo Puyo characters

3828
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
basically going through

3829
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
all of the story

3830
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
challenging different characters

3831
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
the Kirby's avalanche

3832
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
it was all the typical Kirby characters

3833
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
and the game did come out

3834
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
much later in the Super Nintendo

3835
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
so it had really

3836
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
great colors

3837
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
the music was good and did you hear

3838
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
how good the voice was

3839
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
the digitized

3840
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
voice in this is great

3841
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
the last Metroid is in captivity

3842
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
the galaxy is at peace

3843
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
well

3844
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
at any rate though

3845
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
this version

3846
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
all the music in it was original

3847
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
all Kirby-ish music

3848
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
except the panic music

3849
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
oh no

3850
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
it's another interlude

3851
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
who blocked the path with this boulder

3852
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
your road to glory ends here

3853
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
oh hi are you ready

3854
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
for a game of avalanche

3855
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
I love this story

3856
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
I like gumdrops and cake

3857
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
no he didn't say that but he might as well

3858
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
well they kind of do look like gumdrops

3859
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
falling through the sky

3860
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
there's one track from Puyo Puyo left

3861
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
and that's the panic music

3862
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
that's what it's about to do

3863
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
but you're about to die anyway

3864
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
so it's got the cinematics

3865
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
as you can see

3866
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
and

3867
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
basically this is probably some of the

3868
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
most conversation that you get out of

3869
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Kirby in a game

3870
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
and yeah as you can see

3871
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
he comes off a little bit dickish

3872
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
a little bit more confrontational

3873
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
he's a wee bit of a twat

3874
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
does he talk in any other games?

3875
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
I

3876
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
don't know a ton about Kirby

3877
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
because I only played the first couple games

3878
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
but does he talk?

3879
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
not very much

3880
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
but he is a bit of a tit

3881
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
the only dark soccer

3882
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
I could get away with saying that

3883
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
well Kirby he is a bit of a tit

3884
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
anyway you can also

3885
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
find the game on Wii Virtual Console

3886
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
it came out in 2007 in July

3887
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
um

3888
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
and uh oh actually

3889
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I take that back in North America it came out September 24th

3890
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
for 800 Wii points

3891
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
and it is identical

3892
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
to the original game except

3893
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
that it has a cheat code that you

3894
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
can get after completing competition mode

3895
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
um

3896
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
so that was pretty cool but Kirby's Avalanche is

3897
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
you know

3898
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I actually I have to read this quote because

3899
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
GamePro said it great

3900
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
um although Kirby's Avalanche

3901
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
is a rehash of a

3902
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
dick

3903
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
so he challenges this

3904
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
broom and like I can't believe

3905
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I've got to clean up this entire forest

3906
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
and then Kirby goes well you better clean up your

3907
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
avalanche skills first

3908
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
yeah what a dick

3909
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
yeah

3910
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
so anyway um I just like the way that this

3911
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
is was said

3912
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
although Kirby's Avalanche is a rehash

3913
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
of an overdone puzzler theme

3914
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
it's so well done that it's worth playing

3915
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
that is if you don't already have three

3916
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
puzzle games just like it

3917
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
I think that is actually while it's

3918
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
an interesting description for it

3919
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
I think that Kirby's Avalanche especially

3920
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
since we didn't get any other

3921
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
P.O.P.O. games that I'm aware of in the U.S.

3922
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
apart from Dr. Robotnik's

3923
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Mean Bean Machine

3924
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
that this was something that's absolutely

3925
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
uh a must buy

3926
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
for uh

3927
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
for people with the Super Nintendo

3928
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
or you know

3929
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
other things

3930
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
on the Wii Virtual Console

3931
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
um but absolutely worth it

3932
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
in fact if you can the cartridge as I'm aware

3933
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
actually I think goes for some money

3934
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
now um but if you can

3935
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
find it definitely get it it's

3936
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
totally worth

3937
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
having in your collection and it

3938
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
is very challenging even in

3939
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
easy mode it can get really difficult so

3940
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
go for it

3941
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
it's Kirby's Avalanche

3942
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
there it is your classic game of the week

3943
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Kirby's Avalanche

3944
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
and to sum that all up

uh and we're gonna make a small edit to our

3988
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
flow and we're actually gonna be

3989
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
because a lot of our news stories that we had in part B

3990
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
were kinda not

3991
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
huge news yeah cause

3992
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
cause you know it's been a slower news week

3993
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
we're actually gonna fast forward the show a little bit

3994
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
so we can get to your calls and actually Dark Sakura

3995
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
has to leave here

3996
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
anyway yes cause I have to go to work

3997
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
so I'm gonna be left without Loki and Dark

3998
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Sakura and I can't

3999
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
just be left alone with Shane to run the show

4000
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
well you won't be just alone with Shane

4001
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
that's true we'll have Flaco he'll help me out but

4002
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
I'll be here we will be hiding under your bed

4003
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
we just realized that our microphone

4004
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
colors are one of the Splatoon matchups we

4005
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
get all the time macaroni and cheese versus dark blue

4006
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
oh my gosh alright and

4007
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
as you probably heard in the first half of the show

4008
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
uh Splatoon topping

4009
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
uh both Jim and

4010
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Shane's uh top games

4011
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
of uh 2015 their favorites

4012
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
and uh I don't know the top best

4013
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
favorite top best most favoritest

4014
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
um and I don't I don't think there was really any

4015
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
game all three of us had on list so we really

4016
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
couldn't come to a consensus so

4017
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
cause like we both

4018
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
had rocket league we both had everybody's gonna

4019
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:31,000
the rapture you guys both had Splatoon

4020
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:33,000
and until dawn until dawn

4021
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Jamie had to be unique that's okay

4022
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
mine was legitimate

4023
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Rob so was mine

4024
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
legitimately mine was legitimate

4025
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
leer

4026
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:45,000
words so we're gonna go right into

4027
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
some more news with dark

4028
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Sakura well you

4029
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
know um there'd been this uh

4030
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
patent suit going on about

4031
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
the Miis um there was a company

4032
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
called

4033
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Recogni Corps who was suing Nintendo

4034
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
because they said it violated

4035
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
their uh patent

4036
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
for storing facial sketch data

4037
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
um when Nintendo

4038
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
started making the MiI characters

4039
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:11,000
well the uh

4040
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:13,000
uh Judge Jones

4041
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
who was in charge of the case

4042
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:17,000
was like um

4043
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:19,000
yeah no not really this is completely

4044
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
different and Nintendo didn't

4045
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
uh infringe on any uh

4046
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
copyright so

4047
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
of course they're very

4048
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
happy with the uh

4049
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
with the ruling and

4050
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
um we don't know if uh Recogni

4051
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Corps will uh

4052
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
appeal cause they can still appeal

4053
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
but chances

4054
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:41,000
are I mean the hope is that they won't

4055
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
because I mean

4056
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Nintendo's got got the power

4057
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
and it is quite different

4058
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:49,000
than their method

4059
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
their version was

4060
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
um

4061
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:55,000
more of from what I can

4062
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,000
understand just storing data

4063
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
to apply where Nintendo's

4064
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
is actually

4065
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:03,000
picking presets and putting them in

4066
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:05,000
place so I mean if you really had

4067
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
to do that for the MiI you'd have to do

4068
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
that for any type of video game character

4069
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
creation you know character creation

4070
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
so yeah they they didn't really

4071
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
have anything to stand on

4072
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,000
As we see a lot of times

4073
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
in these patent infringement suits

4074
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
where it's like there may be

4075
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,000
this one little derivative but

4076
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
on the whole it's a completely different thing we see

4077
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:27,000
this happen in gaming like a lot but

4078
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,000
patent law it's complicated yo

4079
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
and uh I don't think I've heard a lot you know

4080
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
with all the talk and buzz about 2016

4081
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:35,000
presidential elections maybe I've

4082
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
missed it because people are talking about a lot of

4083
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
stuff but I'm not really

4084
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:41,000
hearing anybody talking about patent

4085
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
reform and I guess maybe because that's not

4086
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
you know people want to hear more about I don't know

4087
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
healthcare or international

4088
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
conflict and so forth but

4089
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I don't know I'd be curious to hear what

4090
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,000
maybe some of these candidates want to do about

4091
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,000
patent law and trademark

4092
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:57,000
and some of that in this country because

4093
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
the rules were not written in an internet

4094
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
age and it's very obvious but anyhow

4095
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
uh I

4096
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:05,000
guess these patent things though for the

4097
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
time being they're still going to continue and

4098
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:09,000
that's why these companies have very large legal departments

4099
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
indeed they do they

4100
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
sure do alright let's

4101
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
get into the FUs

4102
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:17,000
of the week every week

4103
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
uh we rant here a little bit on this show

4104
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
why well uh because we can

4105
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,000
sometimes we get angry

4106
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
here is punishment

4107
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
here

4108
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
this is fucked up

4109
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
dark soccer

4110
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
um FU

4111
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
to just how early

4112
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:45,000
I have to be up in the morning

4113
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
and I do like

4114
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
having my week split kind of

4115
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:51,000
with the two separate days off because

4116
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
it makes my weeks feel shorter at the

4117
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
same time I don't feel like

4118
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I get enough rest on my day off so just FU

4119
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:59,000
be tired and sore

4120
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:01,000
and heavy so that's it

4121
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
and having to leave the show earlier

4122
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:05,000
because I miss having

4123
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
my Mondays as my day off

4124
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
and your schedule

4125
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:11,000
changes every few months so this won't last forever

4126
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:13,000
yeah but part of me does

4127
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:15,000
like though having to be split up so it all depends

4128
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:17,000
you know honestly enough

4129
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
if I worked on Sunday and kept

4130
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
my same early shift

4131
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
I would definitely be able to get to the show

4132
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,000
and I'll have to

4133
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
stay safe alright

4134
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
uh I have two FUs this week before we get to my guests

4135
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:31,000
my first one goes to my neck

4136
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
it's still been like really sore ever since

4137
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
you know that fall it was probably like three weeks ago right

4138
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
now I've got this I probably have

4139
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
even dark soccer I feel this because she probably knows more about

4140
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
this stuff than I do I have this weird like bump

4141
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
thing on the back of my neck

4142
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
you feel that dark soccer right

4143
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:47,000
hold on she's I'm getting a medical

4144
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
exam here at Live Institute it's right

4145
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
here yeah you

4146
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
feel that isn't that weird

4147
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
yeah now yeah that's what

4148
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
it could be a cyst or something in there so

4149
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:59,000
that's just great so FU to that

4150
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,000
cause it's causing me like increased neck pain

4151
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,000
it's horrible I would honestly

4152
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
enough get that seen

4153
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,000
yeah no I know I need to be a completely benign cyst

4154
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
but it could also be um swelling

4155
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:11,000
on the tendon itself yeah

4156
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
no I know I need to get it seen but then here's the other

4157
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:15,000
crappy thing my insurance completely

4158
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
changes the first of the year so if I see

4159
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
somebody now it's gonna be

4160
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:21,000
something yeah exactly so good urgent

4161
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
care yeah it might be what I have to do

4162
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
which is if I didn't have another

4163
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:27,000
stuff and I am not

4164
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,000
a doctor but I was a massage therapist

4165
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:31,000
for quite a while probably gonna wanna

4166
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
ice that yeah good

4167
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
times in 10 minute in no longer

4168
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
than 10 minute increments and that would be

4169
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:39,000
every hour I've had this for like

4170
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:41,000
four days though

4171
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
but anyway I know

4172
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
I'm gonna say this now if ever you think

4173
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
you have any kind of health

4174
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:51,000
problem and something that

4175
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
your body is doing abnormally if it

4176
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
does not go away within a couple

4177
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
of days get it seen

4178
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
well I was hoping it would go away I keep

4179
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
convincing myself it's getting smaller but anyway

4180
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
not every problem goes away by ignoring

4181
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
it some do

4182
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
aren't you leaving no I'm just kidding

4183
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
you know what I have

4184
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
you're number one

4185
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
in my book

4186
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
she gave me a one finger to show me how much she loves me

4187
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
alright moving on we got more FUs

4188
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Flocko

4189
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
let's see FU2 oh yeah

4190
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
you know you can connect your phone

4191
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
on a little cord in your car

4192
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I don't know who else does that I do

4193
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
charge you the phone and please use it

4194
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
well mine keeps saying unsupported

4195
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
version it's super annoying

4196
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
happens all the time

4197
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
yeah iPhone

4198
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
alright I think it's dirty but

4199
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I always have to clean the dumb thing out

4200
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
anyway are you using an official cable

4201
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
yes

4202
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
yeah it's weird I think it's my car

4203
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
I probably just need to update the

4204
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
firmware on my car but FU

4205
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
it could be I have a loose connection

4206
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
with the cord because it's been ripped out by my

4207
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
fat foot so many times that I think

4208
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
it's the car plug not the phone plug

4209
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
that's causing me problems

4210
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
yeah I think it might be the car plug

4211
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
or like I said I've never updated the car's firmware

4212
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
which I'm sure you could do if you plug a USB

4213
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
god that's so weird I gotta update the car's

4214
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
firmware I need to update the firmware on my TV

4215
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
gotta download the new car

4216
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
and I know that's a big thing with like Tesla's now

4217
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
and a lot of other new vehicles

4218
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
it's like you know I gotta

4219
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
my car is gonna

4220
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
evolve like it's a Pokemon overnight

4221
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
while it's plugged in I have a super old TV

4222
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
and when I got a PS4 it looked terrible on there

4223
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
I had to update the firmware because it was

4224
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
downgrading the graphics

4225
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
it was really strange that's so weird to me

4226
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
yeah my TV

4227
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
is an internet TV so I had to

4228
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
download it from the internet put it on the thumb drive

4229
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
and then plug the thumb drive into the USB port

4230
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
on the TV and then it like magically worked

4231
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
it's funny if you take that the other way

4232
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
we were using

4233
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
these LCD monitors

4234
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
with our Atari 5200

4235
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
and it didn't look

4236
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
nearly as I mean it was

4237
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
crisp but it didn't look nearly as good as it would

4238
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
on an old CRT

4239
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
I think that's still the case yeah

4240
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
it just looks terrible

4241
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
and last but not least Shane you're FU of the week

4242
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
FU2 the local targets

4243
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
for not having the two Power Ranger toys I've been

4244
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
looking for and they're all over like

4245
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
the south and the east coast but

4246
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
somehow just not over here yet and it's

4247
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
making me really annoyed

4248
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Shane I will tell you something

4249
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
put it into order and have them deliver it local

4250
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
they can't even order it

4251
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
it's not on the website if you even

4252
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
look it up on my little brick seek thing

4253
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
it has the price

4254
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
but if you usually put items in there

4255
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
it'll say the name and the picture

4256
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
doesn't even do that yet

4257
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
so it's almost like it's a placeholder

4258
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
but it's what shows if they have it or not

4259
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
I am really surprised you haven't just driven

4260
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
to Southern California

4261
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
it was in Burbank so

4262
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
and I don't put it past you to drive

4263
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
to LA for a freaking Power Rangers toy

4264
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
let me know what they are

4265
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
there is a target near Disneyland

4266
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
and I will make every attempt to stop

4267
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
at that target for you and look for your

4268
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Power Rangers toys

4269
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
I will hit you up on that probably

4270
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
that is true it's right there on

4271
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
what is that Harbor? Catalla?

4272
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
the one right before you hop back on five

4273
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
I will go look right now on my phone

4274
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
to see if they even have it

4275
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
I know you are not going right now

4276
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
but you could tomorrow

4277
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
you could go to the target and then

4278
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
you could see Victoria who lives right there

4279
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
such a long drive for one day

4280
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
it is

4281
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
but I would still do it

4282
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
it's Power Rangers Shane

4283
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
we are going to get to the FUGA

4284
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
question of the week in just a moment

4285
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
but I do want to do one quick news story here

4286
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
and this is about a game I think

4287
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
they end up on Flaco's 2016

4288
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
best games list it might be too soon

4289
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
to tell but Uncharted 4

4290
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
a thief's end

4291
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
now PlayStation they ran on their

4292
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
official blog this week a little

4293
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
update on Uncharted 4

4294
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
and they said hey good news we are wrapping up

4295
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
production and it is shaping up to be the proper

4296
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
send off for Nathan Drake that we promised you

4297
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
the bad news

4298
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
we need more time in the new release date

4299
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
is April 26th 2016

4300
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
so they have pushed it back a little

4301
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
more to 4-26-2016

4302
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
that's a lot of

4303
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
March 23rd so like another month

4304
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
they did the same to The Last of Us right towards the end

4305
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I think it was going to come out April

4306
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
oh no it's going to be May something

4307
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
or maybe it was May and then they pushed it to June

4308
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I don't remember

4309
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
so at this point is there really a big difference between March and April

4310
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
probably not and if that's what they need to make the

4311
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
game right then go ahead

4312
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
but I wonder how much

4313
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
my birthday is in April and that makes it important

4314
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
actually my sister's birthday by the way

4315
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
oh there you go so then this

4316
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
can make the perfect present for both of you

4317
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
reverse present

4318
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
she doesn't play video games

4319
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
reverse present media on Uncharted

4320
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
my half birthday was yesterday

4321
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
what did I get for a reverse present

4322
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
I don't know

4323
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
I never actually purchased an Uncharted game before

4324
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
I always just rent them, play through them and then be done with it

4325
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
I don't like

4326
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
goodbye

4327
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
I don't like shooters

4328
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
so I just like to play the story

4329
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
and then be done with it

4330
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
so what you're telling me is you're going to wait for this to be free on Playstation Plus

4331
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
that is what happened with the other one

4332
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
yeah that would take a long time

4333
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
3 took a while to come

4334
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
I bet the trilogy will be

4335
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
the Playstation Plus game in April leading into this

4336
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
that would be great what a great idea

4337
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
found it

4338
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
and for the record those toys are not there yet

4339
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
I'm trying to do my stuff

4340
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
I know

4341
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
I know alright

4342
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
let's get to the FUGL question

4343
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
FUGL question of the week

4344
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
every week we ask a question of you guys on our

4345
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
Facebook and our Google Plus community

4346
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
communities and we read

4347
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
some of your answers right here right now

4348
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
is there no other place you want to be

4349
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Rob?

4350
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
he said right here right now

4351
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
we're going to read the answers

4352
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
I know you're singing a song over there

4353
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
you think you're so funny I'm hilarious

4354
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
alright

4355
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
this week

4356
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
since obviously we knew we were going to be talking about

4357
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
the best games of 2015 tonight

4358
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
we decided to ask you guys on our social

4359
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
community what is your

4360
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
favorite game of

4361
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
2015

4362
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
let's get to Andy R. who starts off

4363
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
on Facebook saying super beat

4364
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Zonic

4365
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
fighting words I guess

4366
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
everybody's entitled to their opinion

4367
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
I don't have to respect anybody's opinion

4368
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
first of all and secondly

4369
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
it's fine there are some positives

4370
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
it just is a disappointment

4371
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
alright so Andy R. says

4372
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
this really was the year of rhythm games for me

4373
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
I got seven rhythm games on Vita

4374
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
three on PS4, one on 3DS just this year

4375
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
as a big DJ Max fan

4376
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
Zonic might be my favorite of those

4377
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
but overall those eleven games

4378
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
really defined my gaming year

4379
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I have to be honest I didn't realize there were that many music games

4380
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
that released this year there was Persona 4, Dancing All Night

4381
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
which was really good, Super Beat Zonic

4382
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
like a couple

4383
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
whatever the fake chick is

4384
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
what's her name?

4385
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Hatsune Miku?

4386
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
yeah I think she had a few games

4387
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Parappa came back out

4388
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
alright anyway

4389
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
moving on Redertainment says

4390
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Destiny begun under good intentions

4391
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
with lots of promise, lots of expectation

4392
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
and lots of anticipation

4393
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
after spending some time digging into the experience

4394
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
of it many outside observers

4395
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
found it to be disappointing

4396
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
nitpicking the details of it in ways that are completely annoying

4397
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
however somebody with an insider's perspective

4398
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
knows it was still a good experience

4399
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
the entire thing wasn't all bad

4400
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
especially compared to the experience of others

4401
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
it's all just a matter of perspective

4402
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
also the future of it holds the possibility

4403
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
for a richer experience

4404
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
very similar to when I named the Diablo expansion

4405
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
one of my favorites one year

4406
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
the fact that Destiny

4407
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
not to alter Redertainment's answer

4408
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
but he would probably mean

4409
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Destiny of the Taken King

4410
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
the expansion that kind of changed a lot

4411
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
some year-end lists

4412
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
I've seen that too

4413
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Dart Tetsuya says gotta give it to Splatoon

4414
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
never expected Nintendo to take a shot

4415
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
at the team-based shooter genre and put a fun twist on it

4416
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
I also really dug the Surf City vibe

4417
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
in the visuals and music

4418
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Shane really likes that too

4419
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
he listens to the soundtrack of this game

4420
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
Fifth Dream says

4421
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I have to say Fallout 4

4422
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
while I played a lot of games this year

4423
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
probably more than ever in my 30 plus years of gaming

4424
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
nothing in a long time held my attention

4425
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
for an entire month straight

4426
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
like Fallout 4 did

4427
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
there's a lot of people that are saying Fallout 4

4428
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
I know you are not alone with that

4429
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
let's see, going to

4430
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
Fabrice A who says

4431
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Assassin's Creed Syndicate

4432
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
I gave the series another chance because I'm into the Victorian era

4433
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
was not disappointed

4434
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
nice mood and I like the protagonist a lot

4435
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Mike B says

4436
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
Star Wars Battlefront Xbox One

4437
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
awesome game

4438
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
they got this one right

4439
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
The movie was awesome

4440
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
William Murderface says

4441
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Witcher 3

4442
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
I love RPGs with stories

4443
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
that you can actually affect with small decisions

4444
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
and this one more than any other

4445
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
that I have ever played allowed this

4446
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
and even encouraged it

4447
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
the choices were also given in such a way

4448
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
that you could not be sure which provided

4449
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
the desired outcome which added suspense

4450
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
and tension to the experience

4451
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
this to me makes this game more than the game of the year

4452
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
it makes it the best game of the last 10 years

4453
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
to me it set the new mark

4454
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
to which I will measure all other RPGs

4455
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
that is quite the praise

4456
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
for Witcher 3, there's a lot of people

4457
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
loving Witcher 3

4458
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Renji221 says

4459
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
I'm going to have to go with WWE 2K16

4460
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
since the game is almost better

4461
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
in every way than the game last year was

4462
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
since the roster is bigger

4463
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
and career mode is better

4464
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Hitstun says

4465
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Splatoon gets my vote too

4466
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
leave it to Nintendo to fix the problems

4467
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
I have with shooters on console

4468
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
it's bright, it's colorful, the motion controls

4469
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
are almost as good as keyboard and mouse

4470
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
squid mode makes movement fun

4471
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
and I actually don't miss voice chat

4472
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Undertale is a close second place

4473
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
super don't miss voice chat except for like

4474
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
when we're playing Twin Squad

4475
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
but that's skypable

4476
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
I just like doing the booyahs a lot anyway

4477
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
and I'm laughing to myself

4478
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
at the imagery of driving down

4479
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
the freeway really fast too

4480
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:09,000
the Splatoon soundtrack

4481
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
which sounds just like that by the way

4482
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
I was one of the singers

4483
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
it's like K.K. Snyder music

4484
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
for a second I thought they were in the room with us

4485
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
what's going on?

4486
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
it's like I'm really playing Splatoon

4487
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
it's like a really bad drag impression

4488
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:27,000
alright

4489
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
let's go over to Google Plus

4490
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
where Popper starts us off

4491
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
on Google Plus saying

4492
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Rise of the Tomb Raider is the game

4493
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
I waited all year for

4494
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
and it was well worth it

4495
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Act F says two gaming things

4496
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
to find my year both from Nintendo

4497
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
I said one

4498
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
who said you got two

4499
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
when everybody else gets one?

4500
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
put the coin to read which one then

4501
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
well I'll read the first one because you'll agree with it

4502
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Splatoon from the single player

4503
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
to multiplayer I've had

4504
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
so many experiences both good and bad

4505
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
from it and of course Amiibo

4506
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
not only collecting but being part of

4507
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
local hunters and training community

4508
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
participating and hosting tournaments

4509
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
well I'll give

4510
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Act F the other one he's been a long time supporter

4511
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
of the show my game of the year

4512
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
though goes to Undertale

4513
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
that game is unique and quite amazing

4514
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
and everyone should play it and the soundtrack is

4515
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
one of the best there is out there

4516
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
he also did apologize for the long response

4517
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
so fair enough

4518
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
I do want to play Undertale but when will I ever

4519
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
come to console?

4520
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Undertale's appeal at all

4521
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
you do that a lot with games

4522
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
I watched the opening

4523
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
and I thought it looked amazing

4524
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
like when you first meet Flowey

4525
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
I kept trying to watch it on Twitch because I was like

4526
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
oh my god Undertale's like okay what is this

4527
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
and I could not find one that looked interesting

4528
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
that's probably just the Twitch people

4529
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
are not interesting but anyway

4530
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
not all I'm sorry

4531
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
I didn't just diss every single person

4532
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
on Twitch just the ones at that moment

4533
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
that Shane was looking

4534
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
not leastly Prince Peach Fuzz

4535
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
I do love that name it's one of my favorite

4536
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
handles on the show

4537
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
says PT

4538
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
someone had to say it

4539
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
thank god someone went there

4540
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
that'll be an honorable mention every year

4541
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
I think it should every year on this show

4542
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
at the end we all say

4543
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
in unison and PT

4544
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
until Silent Hills comes out

4545
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
or whatever they call it

4546
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
well not Silent Hills whatever Kojima can make with his new company

4547
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
well let's hear Prince Peach Fuzz's rationale

4548
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
PT

4549
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
partially because it was the only game

4550
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
I was able to beat this year

4551
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
as well

4552
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
well that's a great accomplishment with that ending part

4553
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
and an excellent experience

4554
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
I'd like to give Metal Gear Solid 5

4555
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
an honorable mention

4556
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
that's so funny I'm sorry

4557
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
I'm not laughing at Metal Gear Solid 5

4558
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
because obviously a lot of people love that game

4559
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
but I'm laughing at the fact that you put the Konami demo

4560
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
above like what's probably going to be

4561
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
their last AAA game they ever release

4562
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
that's not soccer

4563
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
so I don't think they'll do soccer anymore

4564
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
alright

4565
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
there it is

4566
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Google question of the week thanks to all you guys for answering

4567
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
love hearing the diversity there

4568
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
but definitely sounds like we probably heard Splatoon

4569
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
from more people than anybody tonight

4570
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
but Undertale a lot a lot of people as well

4571
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
so I would say that seems to be the number one and two across the board

4572
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
but we'll see what Loki says when he gets back next week

4573
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
I have a feeling neither of those games

4574
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
are on his list

4575
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
maybe Splatoon maybe

4576
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
act deft in our chat over at live.voggenetwork.com

4577
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
encouraging Shane Undertale is a game you need to

4578
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
experience yourself

4579
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
so maybe you just need to

4580
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
I don't want to

4581
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
I want to but they won't let me because it's not on console

4582
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
I don't have a PC

4583
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
maybe that'll be a big E3 land for somebody

4584
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
they're going to get Undertale

4585
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
but it was all made in Game Maker

4586
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
like it was made in one of those construction set type of things

4587
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
and it's huge

4588
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
I'm kind of surprised somebody isn't trying to throw that guy

4589
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
a bunch of money to port it

4590
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
or do yeah I don't know we'll see we'll see

4591
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
alright well we would do

4592
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
the mail bag usually but unfortunately

4593
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
we got no emails this week

4594
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
alright I understand y'all were busy because of the holidays

4595
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
but now that you have time

4596
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
to calm down from your food comas

4597
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
and your gift givings and all that

4598
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
you need to email us

4599
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

4600
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
make sure you lend your voice

4601
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
to the program again that's participate

4602
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
at orangeloungeradio.com

4603
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
I have an unfinished draft

4604
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
in my email

4605
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
to send to you

4606
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
I have to remember now

4607
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
I think it's about couch co-op games

4608
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
I don't even remember specifically what I was going to talk about

4609
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
I have to look at my draft again

4610
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
if it was couch co-op it was probably going to be

4611
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Rob you need to stop being so harsh on Splatoon

4612
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
oh no I think it was

4613
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
that's got the worst couch co-op mode

4614
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
it's so bad

4615
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
though I got my kids to play that

4616
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
and they had a really good time with it

4617
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
I think it was about

4618
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
it was a Fugu question from forever ago

4619
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
and nobody mentioned

4620
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
Secret of Mana

4621
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
and I was like

4622
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
for me that's like the couch co-op

4623
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
top of the pyramid for me

4624
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
we did have a question on couch co-op a few weeks ago

4625
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
it was a while ago

4626
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
and that's like how could nobody mention this game

4627
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
that's the thing that really got me into couch co-op

4628
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
I remember we rented

4629
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
a multi-tap adapter

4630
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
from a video store

4631
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
like 45 minutes away because I lived up in the boonies

4632
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
so I had to drive to another different

4633
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
part of also boonies

4634
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
and get this thing and then we just kept

4635
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
it forever and they kept calling

4636
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
my roommate but they didn't

4637
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
take a credit card so we pretty much just got to steal it

4638
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
well then eventually he felt bad so he

4639
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
went to go drop it off like

4640
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
3 months later and they were out of business so

4641
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
we got to keep it

4642
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
yay stealing

4643
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
but I just

4644
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
loved it because it was just so fun to play with 3 people

4645
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
yeah no

4646
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I never got to do the multi-tap thing

4647
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
with that I don't even know if I ever played

4648
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
with the multi-tap thing I never even played that game

4649
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
really? man I love that game

4650
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
well it was just kind of like

4651
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
it was annoying with 2 people because you had to kind of switch

4652
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
around and you had the third

4653
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
that was always computer controlled and terrible

4654
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
but when you had the third person

4655
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
and we got a second

4656
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
when I got a second roommate there

4657
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
we had 3 of us living in one house

4658
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
we beat the whole game with 3 people all the way

4659
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
it's really kind of odd to me

4660
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
in a way that they didn't really continue

4661
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
the Mana series past I mean I know they had

4662
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Secret of Evermore which was the

4663
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
USA thing and it wasn't very well received

4664
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
even though I think it was horribly

4665
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
the Seiken Densetsu series still goes on

4666
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
in Japan still today?

4667
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
yeah there's a 9 phone version

4668
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
I beat the DS version too

4669
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
was it Legend of Mana on the DS?

4670
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
you guys didn't let me finish there was 2nd Assistant 3 on Super Nintendo

4671
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
I know and then there was Legend of Mana

4672
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
on Playstation was fucking horrible

4673
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
I'm sorry I hated the Playstation 1

4674
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
it was the one on the DS it was something else of Mana

4675
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
I played that one and I liked that one

4676
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
I beat that entirely

4677
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
while commuting on Muni

4678
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
when I lived in San Francisco

4679
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
yeah it was a good game

4680
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
well let's do one more story for you guys

4681
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
then we're going to open up the skype line over at 1877 Game OLR

4682
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
or username on skype

4683
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Orange Lounge Radio

4684
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
and I'm having to do the little rig that I did last week

4685
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
but it should work fine tonight

4686
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
we know from last week it worked ok

4687
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
so let me talk about

4688
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Diablo 3

4689
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
and season 5 is coming out soon

4690
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
for Diablo 3

4691
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
and it sounds like patch 2.4 is going to coincide

4692
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
with season 5

4693
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
I don't know how many of y'all are still playing

4694
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Diablo 3 or interested in all the games

4695
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Shane are you going to come back to Diablo for season 5?

4696
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
no why not?

4697
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
I've got Xenoblade and

4698
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
Splatoon and Heavensward

4699
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
to play

4700
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
and so every other game just kind of does not take precedent

4701
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
alright well some big changes

4702
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
first off seasonal

4703
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
legendaries have been eliminated from

4704
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
the game all new legendaries in

4705
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
patch 2.4 will be available to everybody

4706
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
whether you're participating in the season

4707
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
or not which makes sense because that's what happens

4708
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
on consoles and I should point out when we talk

4709
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
about seasons this is only for the

4710
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
PC consoles don't support seasons

4711
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
because of the exploits that happen on

4712
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
consoles because the console versions don't

4713
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
have to always be online like the

4714
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
PC version now what's interesting

4715
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
is that now in the season journey

4716
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
which is to encourage you to replay through the game

4717
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
starting in chapter 3 some of the

4718
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
objectives in the season journey will

4719
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
reward you with two pieces

4720
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
of one of your class

4721
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
sets and that class set has been

4722
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
pre-established so you

4723
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
will get guaranteed a full

4724
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
green season

4725
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
class set for your character

4726
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
by playing through the game so that's

4727
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
really interesting you don't have

4728
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
to grind for these drops anymore

4729
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
if you want to get the other sets you do

4730
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
but I find that very very interesting

4731
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
and that's because also coming out with this

4732
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
patch are going to be the new

4733
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
dungeons that are geared specifically

4734
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
for these gear sets

4735
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
so that's going to be pretty interesting

4736
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I'm excited to play season 5

4737
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
even if Shane is being a hater

4738
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
but there are going to be new cosmetic rewards

4739
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
as well there will be a

4740
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
little companion that kind of looks like Groot

4741
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
to me a little bit it's a little tree dude

4742
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
a new little non combat pet

4743
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
and I love the new frame the new frame

4744
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
is really pretty it looks like the wicked queens mirror

4745
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
or something there so

4746
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
I like that so there you go

4747
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
some things to look forward to

4748
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
in Diablo 3 a game that's still

4749
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
clicking along a few years

4750
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
after the fact you know I praise Super Mario

4751
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Maker and even Splatoon earlier

4752
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
in the show for Nintendo still supporting

4753
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
their games with regular patches

4754
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
and so forth well after release

4755
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
I understand Splatoon they've said don't expect

4756
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
anymore after January although

4757
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
I have a feeling the Splatfest might continue for a little bit

4758
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
they said Splatfest is still going on

4759
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
well that's good so that will be a thing still

4760
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
but you know

4761
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
they're probably not going to have all the frequent

4762
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
updates they've been having but look at Diablo

4763
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
you know how many years are we after release now

4764
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
and they're still doing new stuff for it hopefully

4765
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
another expansion my fingers are crossed

4766
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
alright let's do it let's go to the

4767
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
phones you can give us a call right now on

4768
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Skype orange lounge radio all one word

4769
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
on Skype I actually don't think the 800 number

4770
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
is working tonight because again I'm not able to

4771
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
get in on PC so I can't

4772
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
disable the spam guard that I usually

4773
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
disable when we go on air because we get

4774
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
a lot of spam

4775
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
calls robo faxes and things like that

4776
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
but it does look like we are getting a call

4777
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
on Skype right now so we're going to get to

4778
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
it here in the studio just takes me a little

4779
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
longer to connect than usual

4780
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
so oh

4781
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
gosh and I did something weird on the

4782
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
screen here but we're going to get to it

4783
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
hi you're on orange lounge radio who's

4784
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000

4787
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000

02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
I am halfway naked Rob Roberts

4789
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
Jesus Christ dude so

4790
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
okay so because I'm on the iPad

4791
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
tonight I'm sending video

4792
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
but that Ramy you don't have to send yours

4793
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
back if you don't want to it's fine please

4794
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
yeah cause um

4795
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
I'd rather not

4796
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
make Alan jealous

4797
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
he's not here

4798
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
what's on your mind tonight buddy

4799
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
hey hey hey hey hey

4800
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
hey hey what's up

4801
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
buddy what's on your mind tonight

4802
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
I kind of want to throw out there

4803
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
like my top three games

4804
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
but my top three

4805
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
games are slightly different they're from a

4806
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
mobile point of view because for the

4807
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
last year all I've been able to do

4808
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
is play mobile games

4809
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
you know that's the story that a lot

4810
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
of people have so I'm not totally surprised

4811
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
to hear that and I even joked that

4812
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
Ingress is probably going to end up on Loki's

4813
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
top three although I don't know yet so we'll see

4814
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
what is it what are three mobile games

4815
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
we all need to be playing

4816
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
well one thing about Ingress I have to put it back

4817
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
on my phone cause I took it off for a while

4818
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
then I'm like you know I'm going to have

4819
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
to put it back

4820
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
you never know that might be the way you get into

4821
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
Pokemon Go early

4822
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
yeah pretty much

4823
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
but um

4824
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
let's go ahead and give

4825
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
my number three my number three

4826
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
is a game I've talked about

4827
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
I've called about the show before

4828
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
and I said it's a game that you have to check out

4829
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
number three

4830
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
is Love Live

4831
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
School Idol Festival for Android

4832
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
and iOS

4833
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
you did mention that and I have to apologize I don't think

4834
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
I ever did get around to playing it but I think I like

4835
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
downloaded it so I got like you know

4836
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
I got close

4837
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
it is a fun game and what I like

4838
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
is that this rhythm game

4839
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
is pretty much identical to the original

4840
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Japanese they

4841
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
did have to tweak the story a little bit

4842
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
because some people got offended

4843
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
cause they were

4844
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
alluding in the story to

4845
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
same sex relationships and they didn't

4846
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
want to freak people out

4847
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
oh no what'll happen

4848
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
cause we all know

4849
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Massachusetts fell into the ocean ever since they

4850
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
legalized it however many years ago

4851
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
yeah and a lot of

4852
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
people decided to go ahead and download the

4853
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Japanese version so you know

4854
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
either or make em happy

4855
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
it's still a fun rhythm game

4856
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
it's right up there

4857
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
alright fair enough what's your number two

4858
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
number two

4859
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
is another mobile game

4860
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
it's a game

4861
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Alan plays

4862
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
I see him pop up from time to time

4863
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
and I give him lives when I need to

4864
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
is it that Sailor Moon game?

4865
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
yes Sailor Moon drops

4866
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
he plays that a lot

4867
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
my friend

4868
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Yaten sits there and plays it

4869
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
forever and ever

4870
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
she played it to the point where she

4871
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
unlocked a Christmas wallpaper

4872
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
gave it to her wife Seiya

4873
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
and when Seiya says she got it I was begging her for

4874
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
if she could send a copy of it to me

4875
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
so I could have it on both of my phones

4876
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
that is so funny because

4877
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
I didn't think Alan was connected

4878
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
with other people on that and I even asked him

4879
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
does it have like social interactions and stuff

4880
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
I guess he finally hooked it up to Facebook and now

4881
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
you can send each other lives and stuff that's great

4882
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
alright

4883
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
and then your number one

4884
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
my number one game

4885
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
is LBX

4886
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Little Battlers Exchange for the

4887
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Nintendo 3DS

4888
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
wow okay

4889
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
what is it about this? I don't even know if I know this game

4890
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
do you know this game Shane?

4891
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
I've played it, I played a quick demo of it

4892
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
alright well what is it about this game

4893
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
well

4894
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
it's what

4895
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
as I like to call it

4896
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
or some people might fan them

4897
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
it's like this if you ever watch the anime

4898
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Angelic Lair or

4899
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Gundam Build Fighters it's right up there

4900
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
it's pretty much a time where

4901
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
you buy like these custom

4902
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
robo kits and you add weapons and armor

4903
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
and you put them in little

4904
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
cardboard arenas and you battle them back

4905
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
and forth and it's an interesting storyline

4906
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
where the main hero is looking to find his

4907
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
father who originally created

4908
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
the entire game genre

4909
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
and so forth okay that sounds

4910
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
kind of fun

4911
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
yeah and as you're running around through the game

4912
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
you're using your LBX to get

4913
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
through certain areas

4914
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
like if there's like traps and there's like

4915
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
sentients you use your LBX

4916
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
to battle the little robots to keep

4917
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
going forward

4918
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
ActDeft is giving some more insight in our chat room on this game

4919
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
saying Nintendo promoted it during E3

4920
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
but it didn't get that much publicity after

4921
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
though it's based on an anime isn't it?

4922
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
yeah that's correct I didn't notice

4923
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
after the fact the anime is on its

4924
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
season on Nicktoons as LBX

4925
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
the original

4926
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
anime is called

4927
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
Denkai Senkai Wars

4928
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
which I have acquired and I will be watching

4929
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
soon to check it out

4930
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
and let's see Kaijuto you may have

4931
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
won him over because he said oh yeah I forgot

4932
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
about that game I wanted it so there you go

4933
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
so reminding people yes that is a thing

4934
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
I just love the fact

4935
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
that you can just customize the character any way

4936
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
you want and it's just

4937
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
all the fight scenes are just pure action

4938
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
oriented and when

4939
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
you go through the same levels

4940
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
to you know to build

4941
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
your character up usually when you're

4942
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
fighting the other person the levels

4943
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
are usually within 2 to 5

4944
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
of yours so it's not like you're

4945
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
level 20 and you're going back to fight

4946
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
the level 5 character again

4947
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
right

4948
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
alright so that sounds like some really

4949
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
good time wasters for filthy

4950
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
casuals I'm just kidding

4951
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
yes and filthy casuals who at work

4952
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
sit there and play Mario Kart 7

4953
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
and Smash Brothers during the break in

4954
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
the break room nice nice

4955
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
that's how to do it

4956
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
I was just poking fun because Zach Defton chat said

4957
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Rama turned into a casual and made a face but said

4958
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
JK so he didn't really mean it you know what

4959
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
it's all good you game wherever

4960
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000

02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Orange Lawn Tradio who's this?

4994
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Hey Akdef how you doing?

4995
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
pretty great

4996
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
what's on your mind?

4997
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
well

4998
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
I have already talked about Undertale that much

4999
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
but

5000
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
just a quick note

5001
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
it has a demo so if Flacco

5002
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
and Shane want to try it out

5003
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
it has a demo on Undertale.com

5004
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
so

5005
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
you can try it out it isn't that

5006
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
big of a mending game so

5007
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
I'm pretty sure any PC can run it

5008
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
I don't have APC

5009
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
does it run on Macs at all?

5010
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
it runs on Mac

5011
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
so yeah

5012
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
I have a really old Mac I wouldn't risk it

5013
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
alright well you can try at least a demo

5014
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
Shane you gonna still be a hater over there?

5015
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
or you try a demo?

5016
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
when am I gonna work in the time for a demo?

5017
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
when are you gonna have the time for a demo in between all the

5018
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Xenoblade and 14

5019
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
and Toy Hunting

5020
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
I know I know

5021
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
well I don't know Akdef

5022
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
I have the full game thanks to Dark Saga

5023
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
so I do fully intend on trying it at some point

5024
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
well it's a really great game

5025
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
my number one but I'm gonna

5026
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
I'm gonna take my number

5027
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
my number three since I didn't mention

5028
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
that over on the full question

5029
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
what's that?

5030
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
and it's Taiko no Tatsujin beta version

5031
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
really?

5032
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
yeah I really

5033
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
really really love that game a lot

5034
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
it's one of my

5035
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
my favorite games of this year

5036
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
and it pretty much gave

5037
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
my beta a lot of life

5038
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
so I'm

5039
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
really really grateful about it

5040
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
and I hope there's

5041
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
new versions for the beta

5042
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
or at least

5043
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
new Taiko games coming out

5044
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
and

5045
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
again

5046
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
it's a game that

5047
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
I really really liked

5048
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
and I still play it a lot

5049
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
and if you know Taiko no Tatsujin

5050
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
or Taiko Drone Master

5051
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
it's pretty much the same game

5052
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
it has some new things

5053
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
like quest mode

5054
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
it's like an RPG adventure

5055
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
so it has that

5056
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
it has multiplayer also

5057
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
so it's a great game

5058
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
probably not for everyone but

5059
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
it's definitely my number three this year

5060
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
wasn't there a 3DS one that

5061
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
like was released

5062
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
maybe I'm crossing wires here

5063
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
maybe I'm thinking of the Vita one but I thought it was on 3DS

5064
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
but I seem to remember talking about that one

5065
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
but I know in

5066
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
the Fugu question of the week

5067
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Andy Arde mentioned like 7 Vita games

5068
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
were music games so

5069
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
I'm sure Taiko no Tatsujin is one of them

5070
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
so yeah that's pretty cool

5071
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
that the Vita's kind of living

5072
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
on with all these different music

5073
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
games but it's interesting that they're all

5074
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
overseas because we don't really get the Vita

5075
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
support here in the US

5076
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
that we do in other places

5077
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
and like all these games are basically imports

5078
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
except Shane was Super Beat Sonic

5079
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
localized? That was a local release right?

5080
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
cause DJ Max was

5081
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
well only two DJ Max's were

5082
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
sorry the one I remember

5083
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
sorry three were

5084
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
I can't count

5085
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
yeah I actually got

5086
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Super Beat Sonic this week because it

5087
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
was cheap on Amazon

5088
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
so yeah I'm gonna try that too

5089
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
but yeah there was also a lot of

5090
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
games, Persona 4, Dancing All Night

5091
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
there was also

5092
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
AIBT

5093
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
which got really popular

5094
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
when it got released so I really want to

5095
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
try that one too

5096
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
but yeah the Vita is getting

5097
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
pretty much a niche

5098
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
niche machine

5099
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
it's getting a lot of

5100
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
import releases and

5101
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
it's a great console not

5102
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
the best but it's great for

5103
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
if you like

5104
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
imports gaming

5105
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
so yeah

5106
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
I actually remember too that

5107
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
since Dark Sakura talked about Puyo

5108
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
or Kirby's Island launch today

5109
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
I

5110
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
need to get Tetris Puyo Pop

5111
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
or Puyo Puyo

5112
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
since that's an import

5113
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
only and it has

5114
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
a Vita release so yeah

5115
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
yeah Puyo Puyo did have

5116
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
a Vita release and I thought there was like a Puyo Puyo

5117
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
versus something that came out on all those

5118
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
handhelds as well like it was like two puzzle

5119
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
games blended together but I don't remember

5120
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
in the moment so

5121
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
alright well thank you ACDEF

02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
we'll squeeze in one more call Orange Lounge

5133
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
Radio all one word on

5134
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
Skype and Dark Tetsuya says

5135
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Puyo Puyo cross Tetris

5136
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
and Akuma

5137
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
JP says there's so many Puyo

5138
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Puyo on mobile

5139
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
I'm not surprised to hear that

5140
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
actually I don't know do we have a lot of Puyo Puyo on

5141
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
mobile here I think there's

5142
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
at least one I think I've seen at least one

5143
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
so anyway Orange Lounge

5144
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Radio all one word on Skype if you

5145
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
want to give us a call here in these closing minutes

5146
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
of the show otherwise

5147
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
I think we'll probably wrap up because we're getting to be after

5148
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
nine o'clock on the west coast

5149
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
we're getting to be hungry are you getting to be hungry

5150
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
yes you making plans on where you're going to go eat

5151
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
no not yet I haven't figured

5152
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
out haven't figured that out yet alright

5153
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
one more shout out for calls

5154
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
and we'll probably wrap things up Orange Lounge Radio

5155
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
all one word on Skype

5156
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
and next

5157
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
week we will be here and

5158
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
talking about whatever comes up in the next

5159
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
week although I anticipate it's probably going to be another

5160
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
slow news week so we will probably do some

5161
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
sort of list list next week with

5162
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
our predictions I'm sorry we didn't get to do that

5163
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
tonight I know Flaco is looking

5164
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
forward to that but that's okay I only do it

5165
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
without I can just not be right this year

5166
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
it's fine were you right

5167
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
last year I don't know probably not

5168
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
I have to go back and pull up like I've ever been right

5169
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
yeah I was like

5170
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
since it's super easy I thought that the Xbox

5171
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
one would be like a hundred dollars with like a

5172
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
like a service plan type thing

5173
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
that's so wrong well you know

5174
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
over there actually is an Orange Lounge

5175
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Radio wiki where some of the inside

5176
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
jokes and things are tracked you can see every

5177
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
classic game of the week ever but

5178
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
you can also see they actually have a page and I say they

5179
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
because I actually I don't really do anything

5180
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
with this this is all like Dark Tetsuya

5181
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
and I think Orange Riot does work

5182
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
with this like there's a few people and I'm sorry if I'm not aiming

5183
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
everybody in the moment there's a few people

5184
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
that work on this and

5185
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
yeah they actually keep track of a

5186
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
lot of the like inside jokes and things

5187
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
that come up on the show and so one of them is

5188
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
listless and so

5189
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
in episode 582

5190
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
oh thank you AJ Mix Dark Tetsuya says always does a

5191
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
classic game of the week every week thank you AJ Mix

5192
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
582 was OLR's

5193
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
2015 predictions

5194
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
number one now it doesn't say every

5195
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
answer and it doesn't say who contributed it it just

5196
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
says here's the scientific results after the

5197
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
chat room voted number

5198
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
one one of those DDoS

5199
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
brats gets the death penalty

5200
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
that was the number one that was you I remember that

5201
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
that was me I do remember that one and

5202
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
unfortunately that didn't happen but I thought one of them

5203
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
got the book thrown at him didn't he? one of them did get the book

5204
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
thrown at him but it wasn't the death penalty

5205
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
that was the ridiculous part of the answer

5206
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
well if they die in jail it would count right?

5207
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
I shouldn't be so morbid

5208
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
I'm sorry I'm sorry

5209
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
number two which was a tie

5210
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
was yet another 3DS

5211
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
skew which

5212
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
duh that was like a gimme

5213
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
either Alan or Loki I don't know

5214
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
I think I think Alan said that one

5215
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
and that was kind of unfair because

5216
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
that was already out in Japan by that point too

5217
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
that was a duh

5218
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
and it tied with punishing

5219
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
silence from valve on

5220
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
anything but financials

5221
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
that's a winner right there punishing

5222
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
silence from valve absolutely

5223
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
how appropriate it is for your

5224
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
financials because they leak into everybody

5225
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
yes

5226
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
that one won OLR was

5227
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
right shout it on

5228
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
twitter hashtag OLR was right

5229
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
punishing silence from valve

5230
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
came true in 2015

5231
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
it took till the end of the year but

5232
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
alright and then let's see

5233
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
lastly number three which ended up being

5234
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
number four because of a tie Microsoft

5235
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
announces Minecraft 2

5236
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
ok we didn't get Minecraft 2 but

5237
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
we got Minecraft on that

5238
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
hololens thing and we got Minecraft

5239
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
story mode so kind of

5240
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
close kind of close

5241
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
nah get out

5242
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
get out alright

5243
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
full on Minecraft 2

5244
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
if you want to look back

5245
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
on the year do you know what other

5246
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
we only did listless three times this year

5247
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
apparently episode 600

5248
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
which was a big landmark episode

5249
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
what game will we be obsessed with

5250
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
on episode 1000

5251
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
and the top three were PT

5252
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
number one I feel like

5253
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
that was on the shortlist that was on there

5254
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
but number one was pixel

5255
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
shits the mmo number two

5256
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
was dance dance revolution the

5257
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
aww answer and then number three was

5258
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
president cat 2 arena's revenge

5259
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
so it was like all instances I won the

5260
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
last listless I know that not that

5261
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
long ago was the worst NES

5262
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
game of all time and that was when you were here Flaco

5263
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
and it was a huge tie because it was Bible

5264
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000

5265
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000

5271
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000

5280
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
all joking and laughing aside that's it I'm going to

5281
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
close up the skype line because clearly

5282
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
nobody else is calling in now we're just laughing at ourselves

5283
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
but I do want to thank you guys

5284
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000

02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000

5286
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
as we move into next week

5287
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000

5288
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000

5289
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000

02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
a ton through 2015

5295

5296
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000

I appreciate that please tell

02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
a friend or two about the show that's all we ask

5300
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
help us spread the word about orange lounge

5301
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
radio because this is a show where every gamer

5302
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
has a voice but we can't share those voices

5303
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
if they're not out there listening so

5304
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
help recruit more people for the OL

5305
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000

02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000

02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000

5311
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000

5312
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000

5316
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
our guests for filling in tonight Shane I know

5317
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
you're dying of hunger over there thank you for toughing it out

5318
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
for three hours even though I offered you food

5319
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
during the break but

5320
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
coffee or water?

5321
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
is he like Christian Bale for trying to

5322
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
lose weight for a roll?

5323
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
can I get something to eat and I would have been like

5324
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
no coffee or water that's all

5325
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
you can freeze the coffee

5326
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
and eat coffee ice

5327
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
alright Shane

5328
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
he doesn't like coffee grinds

5329
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
oh yeah you want to eat some coffee grinds?

5330
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
just get them all on your teeth

5331
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
that's so nasty

5332
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
Shane do you have a final thought for us tonight?

5333
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
thanks for being here I really hope

5334
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
my targets get those toys this week

5335
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
I want my blue spino

5336
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
zord so bad like

5337
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
it hurts and PT

5338
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
for game of the year 2016 right?

5339
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
yes we'll start the campaign now

5340
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
alright Flaco

5341
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
thank you for being here as well you're welcome

5342
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
always a five hour show when you're here

5343
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
I know I just talk too much

5344
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
that's okay we all talk too much

5345
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
you have a podcast for three hours

5346
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
I'm like you don't even know how much we can fucking talk

5347
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
try to keep it down for three hours

5348
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
well we had a fault start tonight

5349
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
the podcast listeners won't hear it

5350
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
but we had a fault start with dead audio

5351
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
because Skype screwed up the audio on my computer

5352
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
so we started like ten minutes late

5353
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
there we go we're at the end of the show

5354
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
so Flaco any final thoughts

5355
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
for our listeners tonight?

5356
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
a shout out to Alan

5357
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
I don't know if he's still listening but I went and checked out that

5358
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
amiibo setup that is impressive

5359
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
oh yeah? so good job by him

5360
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
do you like how OCD it is? yes I love it

5361
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
I think it's amazing I really do

5362
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
why don't we change it before we leave? I'll fucking notice

5363
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
no don't don't do it

5364
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
it looks beautiful I love it

5365
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
it'll be like when we were at GamerX

5366
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
and I had all the postcards

5367
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
neatly configured on the table

5368
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
up down up down

5369
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
I had them all configured and I would like

5370
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
to turn around for just a second

5371
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
and then I turn back around and one of them is just slightly tilted

5372
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
and that was me

5373
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
and it's like Jane I fucking know what you just did

5374
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
like achoo

5375
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
that's what you did at the end yes

5376
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
alright

5377
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
and my final thought tonight is

5378
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
I'm gonna go with what I see in the chat room there

5379
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
I like apple pie

5380
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
that's my final thought tonight

5381
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
I want some pie that sounds really good

5382
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
I think there's cake in the fridge

5383
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
