00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Twas the nightmare on Christmas when all through the net did the outrage explode the frustration was met

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Join us for the news on this episode here now, the news and much more and it all starts right meow

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
On the show where every gamer has a voice

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the very last Orange Lounge Radio episode of 2015

00:40.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts here with you in lovely Sacramento, California in Studio N7 joined by my co-host

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Say hello over there to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
I have been freshly groomed

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Yes, your hair looks amazing, I know it's radio so it doesn't do

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
I'll try to take a picture, someone can take a picture of the back of my head

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Post a little selfie, put it on the tumblers, get some likes

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Maybe, we'll see

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
But it's red and purple and I kind of have the Ramona Flowers haircut

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah, I like it

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Except it's straight and I don't have the banks

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
And our mutual friend Monet who I've done Rocky Horror with, I went to Wizard World in Reno with

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
So I think she probably showed up on my Twitter at some point

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
She does the hair and she has amazing hair herself and so forth

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Though I have to ask Rob

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
So if you're in Sacramento and you need a stylist

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
See Monet

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
We'll hook you up, yeah, see Monet

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
But by the way Rob, what's this about the Bible?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
The Bi-

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
We're not telling that story on air

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
In the Bible

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Cause Monet's really funny and she laughs at my really immature stuff

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
So when there was a Bible in the hotel room

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
Dot dot dot, that's all I meant to tell about the story

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Rob had a moment

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
I don't want to offend folks that might be offended if I were to finish that story

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
I'm not gonna go into-

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
But I think it's just more funny that now I know

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
And I can tease you relentlessly cause it was pretty funny

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
Yeah, and I didn't ruin or do anything that would make somebody not want to touch it

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
Why do you have to tell that story right at the top of the show?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm not telling the story

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
These people that are tuning into Orange Lounge Radio for the first time are like

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Oh, what a bunch of sacrilegious-

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
And on Christmas, on Christmas

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
It's not Christmas

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
These sacrilegious assholes

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
It's only still Christmas if you're Catholic, Lutheran, or Anglican

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
And I'm Jewish, so it doesn't matter

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
Well, did you have a good week in spite of everything being closed on Thursday?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Christmas did kind of blow

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
But I got toys

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And a lot of chocolate

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
And sometimes a lot of chocolate makes up for the stuff that blows

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
That's good, chocolate's amazing

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
And no, it wasn't Bible in the sex motel

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Thank you, Ikuma

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
We don't have love hotels like that here in the US

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
We just have-

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Have you been to West Sacramento?

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
We have these seedy little rundown hourly things

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
But they're not nice like a real love hotel

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
Ah, okay, fair enough

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
You put a quarter in the bed and it shakes

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Or so I've heard

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Love hotels are apparently pretty nice

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Like, they're the ones over there

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Okay

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Not here, alright, anyway

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
But we're not here to talk about love hotels

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
As we do every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Live.vognetwork.com

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern is when we tape

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
On Sunday nights, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
And if you are listening live, you should join us in chat

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Live.vognetwork.com

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
You might be asking yourself right about now

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Why didn't Rob introduce Loki?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
Well, Loki is not here tonight

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
He does have the night off, he went to do a-

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
He was stuffed into a trunk and left in the ocean

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
Yes, he's flying somewhere over the North Pole right now

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Probably trying to capture an ingress node

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
So he's on hiatus tonight

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
No, he had other family stuff going on

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
As I'm sure a lot of people do

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
During this time between Christmas and New Years

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
However, since we were off for a bunch of weeks in November

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Due to other circumstances, we wanted to make sure

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
We were still giving you guys a show this week

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
So, we are joined in studio though by some special guests

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
To help us fill the void left by Loki's absence tonight

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Some familiar faces here in studio

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
I'm sure you guys will be happy to hear from

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Say hello to

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Vognetwork superfan

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Flaco Jones is in the house tonight

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
OMG, it's Flaco, how are you doing, Flaco?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
I'm doing great, how are you doing?

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Great, it's so good to see you

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah, it's like I haven't seen you in such a long time

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I haven't seen you in like a whole day

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
No, seriously, thank you for hosting the little holiday

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Choir way last night

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
I guess it was a holiday thing, I don't know

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Well, we did gaming

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah, we did some gaming

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
We played Jackbox Party Pack 2

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Fancy Wine Party

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Which I won, you're waxed, thank you very much

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
You did

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
And I won the other one

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Quiplash

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Yes

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
And then Alan won

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Sketch

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
You won the Warioware

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
Warioware sketch

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yeah, we played Warioware

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Which I keep forgetting that's a thing

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Warioware Pictionary, yeah, pretty much

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah, but you can actually play that with one gamepad

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
You can pass it around

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Yeah, it's super fun

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Yeah, good times

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
We'll get to your gaming week in a little while

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
But how was your holiday?

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Did you get any good gaming stuff going on for your holiday?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I got a new controller for my PS4

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Oh yeah

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
It's the 20th anniversary one that looks like a PS1 controller

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
I thought you could only get that if you got the full on PlayStation 4

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
No, they made a bunch more of them

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Oh, okay, cool

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
They were really expensive originally

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
But they were on sale for, I think, 44 bucks at Best Buy

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
Right when the holiday shopping season started

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Who's gonna complain about that?

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
I know, I was like, that's pretty awesome

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
I love it when Steam sales carry over into retail

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
As well

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
Yeah, so I thought, you know, oh, this will be cool

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
But then I was like, wait, I can't play any PS1 games

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
On my PS4

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Except Final Fantasy VII

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Which actually reminded me

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
It's like, oh yeah, you can play Final Fantasy VII

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
That's the one you can play

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
So I was like, well, that would be fun

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
And I heard it's kind of cool with the cheats that they have in that game

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Actually, yeah, I know some folks on Twitter that are replaying it right now

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And the cheats apparently help a lot

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
Yeah, because then you don't have to worry about the whole grind again

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
You're like, oh, I can just cheat

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
I've already played the game

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Yeah, you're not really cheating

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
You're just fast-forwarding

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
No, no, it's not just that

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
It lets you heal your whole party

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah, but you don't have to use that

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
You don't have to use any of them

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
You don't have to use any of them

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
If you want to fight the weapons and all that

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
I wouldn't say it

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
It just makes it real easy

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
Now, what is it?

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
You have your Vita with you

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Oh, yeah, my Vita

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
But it looks like a Game Gear

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Like, what did you do to your Vita?

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
I bought a thing a while ago

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
It's Trigger Grips, I think that's what it's called

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
And yeah, it just makes it feel more like a controller

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Huh

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Because I don't like it

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Ever since the PSP, I've hated the design

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
This little circle thing

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
I used to have to test games on it at Konami

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
We played Frogger on PSP

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Right

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
And some of the Winx games

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
And it was so uncomfortable to hold for all those hours at work

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
And so when I got a Vita

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
I was like, the first thing I want to buy is some kind of grip

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And I looked it up and these Trigger Grips

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Trigger Grips

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
They also make the triggers easier to push

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
At some point, just play around

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
And try putting your hands on that Heaven's Word Vita from Japan

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
That I have right there

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Is that a

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Because that's the newer model that they never released here

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Okay

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
And, like, you have to have really tiny hands

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I think to be able to effectively use that

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
That's like a Slim, right?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Yeah, it's like the

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
They released a Slim here

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
It's just not white

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Oh, did they?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yeah, X4 has one

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
I didn't think they released the other model

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah, you have one too

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Yeah, no, it is lighter and it's a little bit smaller

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Alright, well

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
I still think it's uncomfortable to hold

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So much for me paying attention

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
I guess I missed that

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
But, I mean, again, it's not like

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
It's not like I was planning on getting a second Vita

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
Yeah

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
It just kind of happens for my birthday

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Where Alan was like, I know Rob really wants that Heaven's Word Vita

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
That's what they say about children

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
They just kind of happen

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
They do

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Well, that's how

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
My brother and sister were adopted

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Like 14, 16 years later

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
I was an oops

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
Yeah, me too

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
I always say, I was a mistake

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
And my mom goes, no, Rob, you are a pleasant surprise

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
But then I made your father have the surgery

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
Anyway, let's see

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
This is a good time to introduce our chat room as well

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
We were having some technical difficulties earlier in the studio

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
We got a little bit of a late start

08:00.000 --> 08:01.000
The podcasters won't hear that

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
But some continued issues from my Skype nightmare last week

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
Carried into this week

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
And ended up changing some audio settings unknowingly

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
But that caused Tigerclaw to say in our chat room

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Flaco Jones on the show

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
No wonder the show didn't start properly initially

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Oh, the curse continues

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Make sure the recording is also working

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And Alex P

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
And your UPS, don't forget that

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Alex P Carson in chat says

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
Rob scared me when he said last show

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Of 2015

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
That's what was printed on the card

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I just had to read what was on the card

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
That's what was printed on the card

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
We do have another guest here in studio with us

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
That comes to say hello a lot on the show

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
We're happy to have back Shane tonight

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
I just woke up

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
I know, and now you're going to be very monotone dry, Shane

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
I'm a little sleepy

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Well, to help you wake up, Shane

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm going to give you 30 seconds to talk about Power Rangers

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
Ready, go

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
So today we went looking for more toys

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
And I found one that I was looking for at Toys R Us

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
And it was awesome

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
And I still don't have the ones at Target

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Because they don't have them around here yet

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
And it's really making me mad

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Because one of them is really cool

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
He's Navy

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And he's awesome

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
And it's just so infuriating

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
And time's up

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
But you actually

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
You've gotten so into this toy collecting thing

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
That you use websites to track Target inventory and stuff

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Yes, I do

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
That can be very helpful for Amiibo and things like that too

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
Yeah, Power Rangers is more important

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
Any gaming stuff for your holiday?

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
Have you splurged on any of the sales or things like that?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
No

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
No?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
Wait

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
I'm waiting

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Fantavision, but it really wasn't part of the holiday

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
It was just a new release and it was on sale

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
It's still nice to see more games being released during the holiday

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Even if digitally

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
Because usually this is just a dead period

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
Once you hit Black Friday

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
There's no games released in December usually

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Sometimes you might have a fringe game that's running a little late

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
But otherwise there's no games

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
So it's kind of nice to have some digital treats

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Even if it's old games being done new again

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
vidpower and our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says there's websites to track Target inventory

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Now you're going to have to share on Twitter or something

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
I don't know

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Yes there is

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
It's called BrickSeek

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
And you have to know Target DPCI numbers or it doesn't really work well

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Which is some type of internal thing

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Yes

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
So you have to go make friends with the Target person

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
Or go read their little labels if you're looking for specific things

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Alright

10:43.000 --> 10:44.000
Dually noted

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
We can use that for possibly game hunting later on

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
He called that out in chat room over

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
Is he the one that told you about that?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
No

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Because apparently he told you about the amiibo figures

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
I know I didn't take credit

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
And then you told me

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Yeah I didn't take credit

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Well but I just assumed it was a you thing

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
No and then I backed him up when he said that

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Well that's fine so I appreciate it both

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Because I actually got one of the figures I ordered today

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I got a Palutena from Japan

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
No no that was something later

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
That was me telling you that one

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
He told me about the Dedede and Rosalina

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Oh okay I got those

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I want a Dedede

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Check Amazon they may still have them pretty cheap

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Yeah I bought one today

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
So yeah my amiibo collection keeps growing

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
I think I'm up to

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
$75,000

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
No it's not $70,000 it's $60,000 something

11:29.000 --> 11:30.000
Maybe $69,000 we'll just say $69,000

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
I have two What's Your Faces?

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
From Animal Crossing the pink one

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Lottie

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Lottie yeah two Lotties

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Because Dan bought me one and I already had one

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Oh okay

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
So I have to go trade her in at Target

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Oh there you go

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
And if you know the number you know which Target already has them on shelves

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
And which ones don't

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Alright there it is

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
That is not helpful for that situation

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
You're using it wrong

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
Alan Alchemy again great radio

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Alan Alchemy is calling out in chat

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
Flaco what do you think of the collection on the shelves?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
I did that yes

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
The other night

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Oh okay so those of you guys that listened to Hoard House

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
When it was still around about six months ago

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
Grandpa was in town on Christmas

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
Because he was spending it with some friends he had here in Sacramento

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So of course what does he want to do with me in the evening?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
He wants to go drinking

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
So and Alan's like hmm thanks but no thanks right

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
So which I can understand

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
So I went downtown to have some drinks with Grandpa

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
And while I was gone Alan decided he was going to completely

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
Reconfigure my amiibo collection

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
Which usually you would think that would drive my OCD a little bonkers

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
But like actually he even made it like anal retentively better

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
He spaced the shelves all equally

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
He put an equal amount of amiibo on each shelf

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And spaced them in the same manner

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
And he tried to group them together best he could

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Except I was like when I did get home I was like

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
Mewtwo is a Pokemon and so he shouldn't be up there

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
He should be down here with the other Pokemon

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
And Alan was like but this shelf is villains

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
And I'm like I'm sorry but Mewtwo

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
Pokemon is more important than villains

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
So he needs to go on the Pokemon shelf

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
And Alan's like hmm

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
And you need to get a new

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Is that in the other room?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Our OCDs battle sometimes

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yeah it's in the other room

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
We have to check it later

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
You have to check it later

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
Because it's more important that we get into our kickoff topic tonight

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
It is the last show of 2015

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
And as we typically do with our last shows of the year

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
We want to take a look back at the year in video games

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
And I'm sure a lot of your gaming press sites

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
A lot of your gaming podcasts

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Are all doing a similar thing this week

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
And that is that they are recapping

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
The best games of 2015

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
However we here at Orange Lounge Radio

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Have a different view

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Because you know what

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
You can't possibly have time

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Unless you're paid to do it

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
To play every single video game that's out there

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
Every single release and so forth

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
So I think it's very hard to say what the best game is of 2015

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
It's all subjective

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
It is, it is

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
So tonight we're going to present

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
As we do every year

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
Our favorite games of 2015

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Because that's what they are

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
And that way it's neither right nor wrong

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
It's our favorite

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
And F you if you don't agree

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Right, right Dark Sakura?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
That's it

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
And keep in mind

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Yeah, foo

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Foo

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
Keep in mind

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Sometimes we blur the lines a little bit

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Games that were released at the end of 2014

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
Or even, who knows

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Could creep into 2015

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
Just because this is the year we discovered them

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
I think that happened with like Mass Effect 1 year or something

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
They'll creepy creep

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
They'll creepy creep a little bit

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
So that's all part of the rules

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
And tonight I actually have a bumper for this

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
So, without further ado

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Live from Studio N7

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
It's the Orange Lounge Radio Best Video Games of 2015

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Yay

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
It's not our favorites

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Alright

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
You did that whole long explanation

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
After I just did that whole explanation

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Shane is going to be combative

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
No, Shane is like

15:08.000 --> 15:09.000
This is the right answer

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
And if you don't agree

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Then you're wrong

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
That's pretty much how it is

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Alright

15:13.000 --> 15:14.000
So we're going to go around the room

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
And since Loki isn't with us this week

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Of course we'll catch up with him next week

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
But for those of us gathered here tonight

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
We want to recap our top 3 favorite games of 2015

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
And why

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Wait, it's not our best now?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
It's our favorite

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I said it was our favorite

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Whether or not they came out

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
Pay attention

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
It's gone from favorite

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
To best

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
To top

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
Oh, to top now

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
X is what, in your opinion

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Is the most enjoyable thing

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
That you have participated in

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
In recent history

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
This past year

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Thank you

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Lay down the goddamn law, DarkSakura

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
I need it

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
What the fuck I'd do

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Alright

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
Let's get to it

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
The best

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Top

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Favorite

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
Mostest

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Do I have to name them all?

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
No, just number 3

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
DarkSakura, what is your third favorite game of 2015?

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Number 3 is Undertale

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Undertale

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
A game I have yet to play

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
I've only barely played it

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
I'm on my neutral playthrough

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
So that I can go to the pacifist playthrough

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
But it just fucking exploded my tumblr

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
And that's why I have it

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
I know more about the game now

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Without having hardly played any of it

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
But the fact that it's basically

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Hit like the Five Nights at Freddy's level

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Of immediate super stardom

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
You know, fanocity

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
It actually makes me feel a little home stucky

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Okay

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
And so until Hiveswap comes out

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
This is going to be my replacement

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
So there it is

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Undertale is your third favorite game of the year

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
And yeah, it's pretty hard to escape

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
A lot of the fandom of Undertale

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
I'm more of a twitter guy than a tumblr guy

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
But I try to use both

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
And it's hard to escape it

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
So it does seem like every year

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
There's that one indie game

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
And there ought to be more

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Because indie games are great

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
But there's always that one indie game

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
That just really breaks through

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
And actually this year I'd argue there's two

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Because one of them is on my list

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
But anyway

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
There's Minecraft a few years ago

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Five Nights at Freddy's obviously

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
I read that book

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
I forgot

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
That was part of my gaming week

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
We haven't done gaming weeks yet

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Oh but you talked about what Christmas

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Video game things I did

17:16.000 --> 17:17.000
And that's kind of the same thing

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Are you just here to correct me tonight?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
That's what I do every night

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
When you're talking

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
Anyway, let's check out some other number threes

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
I was going to do Shane next

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
But since I'm mad at him right now

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
We're going to go to Flaco next

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Flaco

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
Your third favorite game

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
You look like you still haven't decided yet

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
It's been the toughest decision for me

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
Number three

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Because there's so many good games

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
I think I narrowed it down like on the drive here

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
I've been flip flopping this week too

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
For what it's worth

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
I love the PS4 remake of Tearaway

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
Loved it

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Got some bugs in it that bugged me

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
It's hard knowing that five million people

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
List bugged me

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
It's hard knowing that five million people

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Listen to this show

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
And your opinion can sway people that much

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
On the interwebs

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
So the time has come

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
To make a choice

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Number three is

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
It's Rocket League

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Rocket League

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Rocket League has gone up and down on my list

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
I think it's just based on

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
How many people are playing it

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
I think I settled in at number three

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
What is it about Rocket League?

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
If I like Yoshi more

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I should play it more

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
Rocket League is just a fun

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
Goofy indie game

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
Great online experience

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
So it's like a lot of the online stuff

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
That really wins that game over for you

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Yeah I like playing online

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
It's just crazy to see

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
The moves you can make

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
The last second comebacks

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
It's just a fun game

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
They've added some new maps now

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
That actually put some new terrain

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
Not every map is the same dimension anymore

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
Which is nice

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Is that something I was kind of down on it

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
When it first came out

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
And they made that free

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
You can pay for the Mad Max update

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
And get the cars and everything like that

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
But you get the map for free

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
PlayStation Plus really got

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
A really sweet deal with that

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Because everybody else has pretty much

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Had to pay for it at this point

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
To get that base game on Steam

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
I actually enjoyed the game so much

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Actually I don't think I bought it on Steam

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I think Jason gifted it to me

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
But I would have bought it for myself

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
If Jason wasn't so goddamn nice

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
But I got to get it on both platforms that way

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
I think it was awesome that it came on PlayStation Plus this year

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
I'm considering getting it on Xbox One too

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
It just came out on that right?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
That's what I do with games I like

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
I buy them everywhere

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
So you're like extra fur

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Do you know the Mass Effect 3 story?

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Oh that's right I know that

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
Go into some comments from our chat

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
On the games announced so far on our list

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I act deaf responding to Dark Sakura's selection of Undertale

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
I was like Dark Sakura

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
I knew a lot about the game

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
Before I even played it myself

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
So that game just has a lot of word of mouth right now

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Let's see Tigerclaw says

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
Rocket League has to be on everyone's list

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
That's a game that came out of nowhere

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
And became a huge success

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Well who knows it may show up on a list

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Somewhere else to make

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I actually do not know

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
I think I know it's on Shane's list

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
I talk to him way too much

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
I don't know everybody else's list in here

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
So we may have some overlap

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
But it is time to get to Shane

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
And Shane your number 3 favorite game of 2015

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
I would say it's going to be

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
You finally settled on Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Well I actually was pretty sure

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
That was my number 3 for a while now

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
It's 2 and 1 that I'm going back and forth on

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
So Everybody's Gone to the Rapture on the PlayStation 4

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
What is it about Everybody's Gone to the Rapture?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
I love the story, I love the atmosphere

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
I love the music

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I don't care that some people may say

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
That all you do is walk around

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
I mean that's more fun

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Than a lot of other games I played this year

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
So I think it was just a beautifully done game

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
It's a great experience

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
There's little

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I mean they have little secrets throughout the entire game

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
And you get a better

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Understanding of the whole story the more you find

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And it's just

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
It was beautiful from start to finish

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Loved it

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Well Shane I think that's a really good pick

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Because my number 3 favorite game of the year is

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
On PlayStation 4 and I actually didn't know

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
That's what Shane was going to pick for number 3

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
But that is also my number 3 pick

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
For favorite game of the year

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
I actually flip flopped on this a lot

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
There's another game that was really close

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
And I just didn't end up putting it

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I chose Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Some people may not consider it a game

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
But kind of like Shane said

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Exploration is a huge part of it

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
And I think exploration

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
And that sense of

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
What goes into a game

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Is why games like Minecraft are huge

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Exploration is a huge part of that

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
And there's still objectives too

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
It's not just like you're watching everything happen

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Yeah and Minecraft has

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
I understand creation there's more to it

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm not trying to compare the two games

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
But I just feel that Everybody's Gone to the Rapture

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Was a gaming experience

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
Where at the end of it

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
I just had to talk to somebody about it

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
And you don't get that a lot in games

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
You know where it's like

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I need to call Shane

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
And talk to him about it

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I need to go on the internet and find people talking about the ending

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Because there's so much that's left

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Open to interpretation with the ending

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
And honestly

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
One of the best soundtracks to a game

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
I've heard in a very

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Very long time

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
And something else

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
The audio in this game

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
I mean the visuals are gorgeous too

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
But the audio in this game

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
From the soundtrack to the voice acting

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Is top notch

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
So you know what for a download title

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Even if it's a little short

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
And some folks may be like

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Where's the action? Where's the quick time event?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
Some people may be left with that

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
I still think this is a game

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Well worth your time to check out

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
And it's one of my top three of the year

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
Because even though there are no enemies

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
And nothing that can hurt you in that game

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
There were times where I was kind of scared to continue

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Because I was like what's going to happen

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Is something going to jump out at me

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
There's nothing that does

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
But I was literally creeped out many times

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Well you need to go the wrong way and miss the story element too

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Oh yeah

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
And that's something about that game

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
You kind of have to find everything

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
That's why I don't think there's any question it's a game

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Because if you don't find all the right stuff

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
You don't get the whole story

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Then it really won't make sense

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
But the challenge is really finding all those things

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
If you take the wrong path

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
You have to double back and find the right thing

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
There was one scene

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
One scene that Shane got that I didn't get

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
That completely changed the interpretation of the ending

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
I know it's the one where the guy disappears

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
In front of the priest

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Yes, so we're trying to keep it a little

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
That's the beginning

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
That's the first chapter

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
And I missed that

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
And it completely changed the interpretation of the ending

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
So I mean it is important

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
So if you haven't played this game

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Play it

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
And what's funny is I was talking to a game maker

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
At GX3 a couple weeks ago

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
And I won't say what the game is

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
But I'm excited about this game too

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
And we'll hopefully have him on the show at some point

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
But I actually said

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Playing this reminds me a lot

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Of everybody's gone to the rapture

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
And have you played it and he said no

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
And I said you've got to play it

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
If you're going to make a game like this

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
And he said he would

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
So we'll see

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
Anyway I was seeing if there was any comments

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
On this game but everybody in chat is suddenly

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
Talking about Niko Atsume

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Neko Atsume

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Which is the cat game on iPhone

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It's not so much of a game

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
It's just more like

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
One of those shitty iPhone collector games

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
No

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
You just put out stuff for cats

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
And then you

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Kind of fuck off for an hour, come back

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
So it's cat lady simulator

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
It's cat lady simulator

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
Oh my god my cat has a bag on its head

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Alright let's move on

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
To our number two

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
Picks for 2015

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Dark Soccer your second

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Favorite game of 2015

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
That's going to be Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Why?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Just because it takes all the things that people like

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
The most about Animal Crossing

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Which is the amassing of shit and decorating your house

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
And just blows it up

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
And I like having the cards

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Because I finally used my amiibo card reader

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And had

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I decorated for DJKK

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
And gave him the ultimate hipster apartment

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
It's just fun

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
I mean it's fun and easy

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
It's

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I would say it's casual because you can play it in like

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
15 minute increments

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
But for me

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I just like being creative with the space there

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
And working in the limited

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
Availability with an entire

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
You know

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Inventory behind me to do whatever I wanted to with

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
You know and I'm looking at our chat over at

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
live.vognetwork.com

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
And actdef says I didn't like Animal Crossing

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
Happy Home Designer that much

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
You know and I can see where maybe people kind of feel

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
Differently about this game based on

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Like what you said it takes one element

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Of the original Animal Crossing and kind of expands

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
On that and I have to admit I don't know

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
If I'd be super into it either because

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
I was always more about I want to run around

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
The island I want to find things

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
It's kind of more that exploration thing too

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
Like I love the Game Boy Advance thing

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
Connecting I love going on the internet and going to other

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
People's places I would like to have

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Another Animal Crossing game

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
Because I mean I played like for

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
A year and a half I played

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
New Leaf

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And I would really like to have a new one

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
But for the interim this just sort of gives me

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
My little bit of

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Animal Crossing you know in small

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
Easy to carry around

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Doses that I can play during my break at work

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Well and I wonder at this point if they're just going to skip

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
The Wii U and move to Nintendo's next console

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
If that console is truly going to be next year

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
No we need to have it on Wii U

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Because we need the island on the gamepad

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
We'll see

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Listen to me Nintendo make this happen

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
We'll see you never know

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Carson in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
New Leaf for the win and Act F does admit

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
It's entertaining enough and I can see the appeal

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
Of it so there you go

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Alright let's move around with some more

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Number two favorite games of the year Flaco

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
My number two game of the year is

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Until Dawn

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Until Dawn on the PlayStation 4

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
The horror movie

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Blend genre

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Cross over thing

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Super fun interactive movie thing

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
So yeah it was a blast to play

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I uh you know

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Played through the whole game

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Got one ending and I've since gone back

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
And I've like tweaked some things

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Once you go back in you can kind of

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Chapter jump around so I

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Kind of redid the ending because I had almost everything right

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
And I did an ending where everybody lives

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
So it's not a spoiler because you can have

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Any like variation of people like living

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Or dying at the end of that game

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
So I got the everybody lives like trophy so that was really

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Fun to do too so now I want to get like

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Everybody dies so I'm like

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
That one's a little bit harder to get actually because you have to

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Make some choices early on so I can't

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Go back to the game I had I had to go back and start over

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
Again and in the process I'm looking for more stuff

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
So the fact that I've been able to

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Not just play it the one time through which you think

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Most people just do because there's so many

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Different branching ways it can go and different

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
Like people can survive and you have

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Different endings then yeah it's got

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
Me to replay it so it's got great replay

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
Replayability the acting is great

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
It's sometimes it's hilarious but cheesy

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Like a regular just like a

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Some teenage slasher movie from the 90s that's what it feels

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Like yeah and I mean you know I think for

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
A lot of us that are PlayStation 4 owners

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Many of us were kind of around when

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Those 90 horrors films were

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
You know like when Scream really broke

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Through and so forth and all the

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
You know knockoffs of that came

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Through so I can

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Definitely see the appeal of that

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
And why fans of that are going to be really

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Into this also interesting

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Too because you know with the PlayStation 4 and the

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Xbox One and this new

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Era of consoles

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
Social gaming is very big and I

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Noticed there was a lot of and I think part

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Of the reason Until Dawn

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Even caught on bigger than I think

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
We all know Sony expected because Sony

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Yeah I mean remember how much they

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
They didn't quite devil's third it

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Not quite but I mean

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Remember how much they were promoting that order

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
In 1886 and that game like flopped

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
For all I could tell and then this

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Game they just kind of dump at the end of August

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Like oh here's this one we're barely going to

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Advertise it even though they had like statues

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
For the order and all these collector's

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Edition and all this other stuff and then

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
When they brought out Until Dawn it's like oh

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Yeah Europe gets a collector's edition but the US

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Does it and here it is and whatever

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And it ended up being a pretty big hit and now

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
It's got apparently a sequel in the works so

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
And oh and then there's the

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
VR PlayStation VR

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
Which is probably some other

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
Game they just slapped Until Dawn's name on

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Okay whatever whatever it just goes to show

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
But it shows that now the brand is successful

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
And if they can do something like that if that's what they're doing

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
But I think and I never really finished my point but I think

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
The whole social and the sharing and

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
All that was a big contributor to why

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
The game did so well I think

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
This game really owes a success

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
To Twitch, YouTube

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
And social play throughs

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
Thanks to that

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And I think Sony knows that that's a good thing

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I think it's Nintendo that has to be educated

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
A little more on that stuff but that's alright

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Okay some comments from

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Until Dawn in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Wyland says I loved

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Until Dawn

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
AkumaJP with another perspective saying

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
Until Dawn in Japan is not selling well

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Censorship killed it

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
That's true you know a lot of times

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
We here are very envious of the things they

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Get in Japan but Japan's version

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Of Until Dawn was censored because

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
The violence is

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
You know not

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
As well received so they do some

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Fade to black in some parts

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Oh that's terrible

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Yeah like there's one particular scene and it is really gross

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
And I would not want to see it anyway

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
But it fades to black

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
I wonder if it's the one they show you over and over and over again

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
After it happens in the previously vlogs

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Yeah they do a lot of that previously stuff

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
I wonder what the previously would happen when you

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
In the previously because each chapter

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Is like an episode

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
And on the like previously on

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
It kind of shows you the big decisions you make

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
And it always shows you the death that happened

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Over and over again

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
It's kind of funny I mean like I said

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
The acting in a lot of places is over the top

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
But I think appropriate and fun

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
For a game like that sure

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
It's totally like it knows what it is

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
It doesn't try to take itself too seriously which I love

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Fair enough let's go to Shane with your number

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Two pick of

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
2015 and I'm so excited to hear

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
What you finally settled on

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
My number two pick is Until Dawn

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
You also picked Until Dawn

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I did

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
And why did you pick Until Dawn

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
Because I love that game

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
The story is fantastic it's engaging

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
It's hilarious it's really creepy at times

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
I watch it

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
A lot still even

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Now months later on Twitch

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Just watching people play

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
Because it's like watching a fun movie

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
And it's neat to see

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
People's reactions

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
Or things people do differently that you didn't do

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
The first time you played through

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
The cast is great

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
The writing is there

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
I don't know if it's good or bad but it's definitely there

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
And I'm really excited for a sequel

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Or whatever they do with the second one now

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
But aren't you a little worried that maybe

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
The sequel is not going to have the magic of this

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
First game because I mean

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Part of why I think this first game was successful

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Is because the bar was so low

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Now the bar is going to be higher

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
And this may be a really unfair comparison

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
But the Blair Witch Project you remember that

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Remember when that movie came out it was like the biggest

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Fucking thing in cinema for like the year

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
And this whole like found footage phenomenon

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
And some people didn't know if it was real

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Or not and all this

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
And then they made a sequel and it was god awful

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
But see the thing with Until Dawn is

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Strip away this cast

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
And the lore around it

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
And keep that same formula and I'll be fine

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
That's all I need

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Give me something just slightly different with new characters

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
That don't know what they're getting into

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
And we're good

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
But like they could stand to not show the same death scenes

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Over and over again

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
In the previously on

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
Not that they're gross it's just like

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
The first time you see it's like oh my god I can't believe it

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
But like 30 minutes later when you've seen it four more times

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
Because they showed it to you again

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Four more times you're like okay

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
I get it that person definitely

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Is you know not alive anymore maybe

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
That person is very dead

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
Very very dead

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Alright

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
And then going to our chat room with some comments

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Another comment on

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Until Dawn, Wyland says

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
I think the sequel to Until Dawn should be something completely

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
New, make the series

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
In an anthology series

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
Well I don't want the

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Same story, get rid of the

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
Characters too even though I'm gonna

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Miss Mike a lot

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
I would like new characters

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Alan Alchemy in

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Chats making a little

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
Tongue and cheek reference to heavy censorship

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
In another country saying

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Until Dawn in Australia is just them

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
Showing up to the cabin and having cocoa

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
And then it's like thank you for playing by

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
Because

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
That'd be kind of funny

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
That'd be it

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
That could be Until Dusk or something like that who knows

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
Anyway let's move on

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Here it is

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
My number two pick of 2015

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
And it's actually one that's

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Shown up on somebody else's list already

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
So we have a lot of consistency but my number two

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Pick best game of 2015

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Is Rocket League

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I think Rocket League is

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
One of the best games of the year

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
It's actually the second best game of the year I believe

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
My favorite

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
And the reason why is I think a huge part of that

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
Is accessibility

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Because a lot of people that don't

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Really play a lot of games

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
I find are really drawn to

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
Rocket League because it's so stupidly simple

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
It's Mario Kart meets soccer

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
And everybody

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
You may not know a lot about soccer

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
But you know the general rules

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Place ball in goal

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
Okay that's very easy

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
And then most people have played some type of racing game in their life

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
So it's a really

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
Stupidly simple concept

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
But then it has a lot of depth to it

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
With people doing the air trick shots

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
And the rolls and things like that

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
And the game looks great

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
And yeah

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I have loved Rocket League

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And I love that it's another

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Indie success story of the year

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Along right up there with Undertale

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
And a lot of the things we've mentioned previously

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
So that is why

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
I placed Rocket League number two

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
On my favorite games list

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Tigerclaw in chat says

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
They released an update to Rocket League

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
That adds hockey mode

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
The ball turns into a giant puck

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I heard about that but I haven't played it yet

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
I'm excited to check it out

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Smaller ball, that was really hard

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
Oh my god

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
It's harder to hit

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
There's no way you're going to get an air trick on those things

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Some people still did

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
It's easy to pick up

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
But it's so hard to master

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
But when you see someone that can master that game

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
I've been in a game where we lost 9-1 no problem

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
One player on their team just has

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
Ultimate control, it's insane

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Kaijuto in chat says

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
That game needs planes, then I'd buy it

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I could see it happening

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
You can fly in that game

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
You get a full thing of boost

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
You do a little jump, you can boost in the air

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
You can really take off, I did it in practice

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
It's just so hard to do in actual game play

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
It would make a lot of sense to have planes in the game

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
But then I think it would be too hard

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
It's hard enough to play with the ball in three dimensions anyway

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
Planes is going to make it really hard

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Alright

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Here it is

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
The moment you've all been waiting for

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
The number one

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
Most favoritest game

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Of 2015

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
From Dark Sakura

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
You know what this is

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I have a good feeling, but what is it Dark Sakura?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Dragon Age Inquisition

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
For all of the DLC that came out this year

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Fair enough

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Even though it was a release from last year

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Don't care

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
It's been made new again for DLC this year

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Because the DLCs by themselves have been

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Pretty crazy and new adventures

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
And stuff and it's just added

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
So much more to the game

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Dragon Age Inquisition game of the year edition

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
This year which had all that DLC in it

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Yeah I paid for all of it

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Of course you did

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Trespasser if you

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Were romancing Solas

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Is like hi I didn't need my heart anymore

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Step on it and set it on fire

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And then shit on it

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Hahahaha

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
However if you're romancing

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Cullen then ahhhh

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Nice

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
So are you excited about the future

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Of Dragon Age? I mean I know we've got another

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Mass effect cycle

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
To get through before we get there but

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Eventually

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Yeah you know they're going to do another one because they pretty much

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
How can they not?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
I know the ending there

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Yeah they're going to have to do more

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And Inquisition I'm sure sold plenty

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
The Inquisition

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Alright well nobody expects

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
The Dragon Age Inquisition on Dark Sakura's list

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
But there it is

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Number one

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Well I thought you would go

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
From this year and I thought you might pick the game

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
That I'm going to pick but I guess not

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Alright we'll see

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
Let's move on

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Most favoriteist

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Flaco Jones number one

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
This is going to be such a surprise

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
5 million people hinging

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
5 million people

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
It's almost as many people that follow me on Twitter

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
And all those people know

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
That all I ever talk about is Splatoon

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
Not only is it my favorite game of the year

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
But it's one of my favorite games of all time

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
I just love it that much

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
It's the best Wii U game

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
I have a blast playing it all the time

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
I don't know what else to say about it

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
I think it's a near perfect game

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Thank god someone took a chance on a new IP

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Exactly

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
And it was Nintendo of all people

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
I mean

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
I guess all three games

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
Rocket League is not a new IP

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
But the other two are new IP

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Yeah so

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
It's just a great game

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Again it's one of those kind of easy to pick up

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Hard to master

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
You can just have a fun time

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Just playing turf wars all you want or you can really get into ranked mode

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
Which I didn't think I would do originally

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Because I don't like shooters

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
But I started playing this and it's like

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
I'll test out ranked mode and suddenly I'm getting better

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
And I start looking stuff up online

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
How the gear works

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
The special stats you get for each piece

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
And then I went from just like

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Oh I'm just going to play rollers

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
I'm going to shoot all the time

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
It's just a great game

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
For someone who doesn't like shooters

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
It still worked out really well for me

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
When I'm not in a mode of

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I can't just splat everybody

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Or kill everybody

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
I can just paint

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
And help out my team that way

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Or help out my team in support ways

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
There are some guns that work better at support

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I've done all the research on this stuff

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
I'm always in all the different community boards

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
And the reddit stuff

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
Tower controls right now

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Bye guys!

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
And I do like

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
That this game

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
Has kept itself relevant

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
You can make fun of Nintendo

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
For only having 2 or 3 Wii U games

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
This year

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
But they've supported those games really well

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
With these frequent updates

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
We're constantly talking about Splatoon

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Here on OLR because they did this splat fest

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
And now we have an entire

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
Internet war breaking out

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
About planes vs cars

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Or what was the other

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
There was one where like

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
Our vs science was right down the middle

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
Right down the middle

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
51-49 on both counts

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
There was one I swear to god I said to act deaf

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Fucking fight me

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
Pizza vs hamburgers

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
Cats vs dogs

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
That was a big one

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Pirates and Ninjas was the one that really

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Toured the internet up

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Because ninjas were so

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Popular but popularity is really

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
A curse in that game because it kind of hurts your team

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
And so

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
They lost because what counts more

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Than anything is winning which I think

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Kind of is the way it should be it wasn't originally that way

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
That's why

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
That's why dogs won

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
Even though the cats won way more games

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
The dogs won the splat fest because they were more popular

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Well that's not really fun like the most popular

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
Team just wins without having to play

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Well but I kind of see now why it was

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
That way I wish there was a little bit more of a

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
But in the end just win more games

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
That's what's important

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
A lot of people in chat lighting up about Splatoon

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Kai Judo says Splatoon is the bestest of the best of the best

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
That's an exact quote

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
Act deaf says Splatoon is my number two game of the year

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Some people talking about the recent Naughty vs Nights

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Nice splat fest that went on

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
Vid Power says Splatoon is a post-apocalyptic world I'd like to live in

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
And even the little story that they tacked on there

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
It's kind of fun too if you read all the behind the scenes

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Like the sunken scrolls and all that stuff

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
It's kind of weird like what's going on

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Back there with the squid people

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
It's kind of creepy

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
Alright

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Shane your turn here it is drum roll please

42:32.000 --> 42:35.000
Your number one game of 2015 is

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
I want to say first that

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Had I beat

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Soma and Xenoblade Chronicles X

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
I'm pretty sure my list would be different

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
From my top three

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
We'll get to honorable mentions in a minute

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Well then I didn't say that

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
But for my number one

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
It's Splatoon

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Because I play it so freaking much

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
And despite the fact I have problems with a lot of things about it

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Like the matchmaking is terrible

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Absolutely awful

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
The splat fest

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
The way they do it I don't like it either

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Because if you like

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
We were just talking about if you pick the more popular team

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
You're pretty much guaranteed to lose at this point

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
And I think that's dumb

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
And that actually goes back to the matchmaking

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
But

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
I get so pumped up when I'm playing

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I just have such a good time

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
Nintendo really hit it out of the park

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
With this new IP

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
And I really hope

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
That we get a Splatoon 2

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
On NX as a launch title

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Because then you don't need any other games after that

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Shane's best game is PT

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
You know we talked about that

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Yeah that was last year

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Yeah we talked about this

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
It would be funny if PT was your top game this year

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
And last year

43:47.000 --> 43:48.000
You can't do that

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
I know you can't

43:49.000 --> 43:50.000
Well DarkSakura did actually

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
She just did it

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Except mine had new content out this year

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
That is true

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
And mine just got removed from the Playstation store

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Actually

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
YYR said he was able to download it

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Yeah there's some new technique

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Yeah you can get it again

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Like literally

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
In the span of a year

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
Literally everybody hates

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Everybody hates a company they used to love

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
In that game

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
In large part

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
But back to Splatoon

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Splatoon is just so much fun

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
You can't stop playing it

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
You play with Flaco Jones online a lot

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Oh yeah

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Twin Squad

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
Because you can't do anything more than Twin

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Or else you get screwed over

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Because of their matchmaking system

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Oh my god Nintendo learn online stuff finally please

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
Because it would really go a long way

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Yeah the trisquads are the worst

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Splatoon is so bad

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
You're just against an organized team

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Yeah that's not so bad

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
But yeah Trisquad why can't they just throw in an extra person

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
An extra body helps

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Or why

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Do I have to play on Splatfest

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
If I accidentally pick the most popular team

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Why do I have to just play with my own people

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Why can't I just wait for another match

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Against the other team so I can actually contribute

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
To the wins losses

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
For my team

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
To try to win Splatfest

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Why as you know not a very high ranked person

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
In ranked mode are you throwing S's

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
And S pluses at me

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
When you know I can

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Barely hold my own sometimes against like

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
A minuses

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
So even though it's your favorite game there are still plenty of things

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Oh yeah there's a lot of things wrong with that game

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
But it doesn't stop me from playing hours

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
A day

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
Well it's my turn

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
My favorite game of the year and guess what

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
You guys I picked a game that's

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
On the Wii U

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
My favorite game of the year

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
I really think

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Is it Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
I almost named it because it's fun

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
It was close no

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
My favorite game of the year is Super Mario Maker

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I think is the best thing

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
That's happened to gaming this year

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
And I think because

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
There's so much

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
That kind of little big planet

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Kind of started

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
But I think the trouble that little big planet had

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
In a way is that it was a new universe

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
And something that was completely new

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
And it almost had

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
A level of over complication

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
With a lot of the stuff they added later

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Now don't get me wrong I'm pretty sure little big planet

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Was my favorite game of the year whatever year it came out

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
And it still is a fantastic

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Series but I think what I really love

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
About Super Mario Maker is that it took a formula

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Literally anybody that's ever

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Touched a video game knows

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
And really opened it up

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
For people to create anything

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
And you know we started off

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
This year talking a lot about

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Creation and you know we've heard

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
The saga of Loki's game and

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
Lord knows if he's going to finish it or not

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
But he's apparently really pushing to get something out by the end of the year

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
And you know we saw some of the

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Results of what happened with the VoG jam

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Earlier this year we were talking a lot about

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Creating your own game

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
And those experiences and I think Super Mario Maker

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
I think really bookends that

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Because you take something

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Pretty much every gamer out there knows

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
And yet you learn a lot about

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Game creation through the things that you go through

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Online with the game

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Like I gotta say for me

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
What a trip it is to watch

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Somebody else play your level

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
On Twitch or YouTube

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
And do things with it that you

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
Weren't expecting them to do

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
You know and I think that social element

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
We talked about this before with Until Dawn

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
I think that social element and I wish Nintendo

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Would get on board with this a little more and I think

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
I get the sense they're starting to warm up to it more and more

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
But I think the social element has really

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Sky-rocketed something like Super Mario Maker

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
To just

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Like its own

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
Genre in a way

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
It's just crazy what an impact that game has had

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
And I love that the game has been continually

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Supported with regular updates

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Be it the new costume characters you can put in the game

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Some of the new things they've been putting in the levels

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
Like the checkpoints and so forth

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I mean Nintendo

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
God bless them they've only put out like three games this year

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
On the Wii U but they have supported those games

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
So so so well

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
That it really is like a model that other

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Companies should probably look at for

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
The way they support their games

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
So yeah I just

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I can't not

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
Say that Super Mario Maker is

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
It's my favorite game of the year absolutely

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Just all the experiences

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Just the other day one more quick story about the game

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Just the other day I was playing

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
It and I was doing some of the random courses

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
The eight stage

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Course which is on easy right

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
So you get a lot of like auto

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Play courses and you get a lot of really

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Dippy courses

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
But one course kind of struck me a little bit

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
And that was it was a

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
A French player had made the course

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Because you can see their little country flag

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
And it was something and I don't speak

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
French but it was basically

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Paris Je t'aime or something like

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Paris we love you type of thing

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
And it was obviously something that was made in

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Response to the tragedy

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
That happened in Paris and it was

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
An auto play course but it went through

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
Like this Eiffel Tower scene

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
That was made out of coins and I

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Think you know they had some other landmarks

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
That were there as well and it was like

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Spelled out and I just I was

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Kind of taken aback by

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
We have all these arguments

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
About our video games art

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
And what is art? Art

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Is expression right it's a way

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Of expressing yourself

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
Somebody chose to

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
In response to what happened

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
In their country this horrible

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Horrible thing that happened they chose

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
To express their feelings

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
In a video game

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
And not a lot of games

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Have brought it to us on that

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Level yes I know about other construction

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Sets hell there were things like you know pinball

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Construction set back in the 80s and we've

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
We've had games where you can make other games

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
But I don't think we've ever had

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Something on that level of

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Mario where you can

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Do that so I was just really taken aback that

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
You know somebody went to

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Mario maker to express their

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Feelings it was just like it was a really

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Neat thing to see even if it wasn't

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
The greatest level per

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Say because I didn't play it was just auto

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
I was just like wow this is this is

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Art video games are totally

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Art and this is this is

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
What it is so

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Looking at our chat room over at

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Live dot vog network dot com

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Tiger kalon chat says I

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
Just played some super mario maker today

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
I played the new levels that were created

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
By some of you guys

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
And ikuma

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Jp says maybe it's time to get a wii u

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
You know we're gonna talk about

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Honorable

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Mentions in a minute here but I saw

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
A configuration I was really thinking

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Through the games this year I saw

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
A configuration where easily my number

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
One two and three games could have all been wii u

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Games I mean really

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
And it's it's kind of close

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
For for

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Some of you guys I'm sure

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Let's see also going to chat over at live dot vog network dot com

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
DarkTetsuya says

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I know I saw a level like that when Satoru

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Iwata passed away someone

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Did a tribute level to him and I remember

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Playing it over the fall season

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
So there you go

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Some other comments there on the

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
Art that is super mario maker my favorite game

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Of 2015 so there it is so

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
A lot of overlaps on our list

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
But I think those are some good

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Lists you guys does anybody want to take a second

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
And I'll just open the floor to general

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Comments does anyone want to take a second to call out honorable

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Mentions any honorable

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Mentions things that you were really going back and forth on

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Mario maker was a consideration

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
And I thought that might end up being your game

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
But I it wasn't my

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Favorite I didn't really play a whole bunch of it

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Um Dan played it a lot more

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
Than I did um

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
There was and it's actually more of a

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Hack but Dan was playing this today tech mobile

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
2015 uh huh

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Um that's basically

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Just takes like tech mobile and hacked in like

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Modern teams sure and their

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Players and what not it was kind of funny to watch them play

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
It yeah um

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
I really I really am happy with the ones

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
That I picked especially since you know the new

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Content for dragon age really kept

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
It like um you know

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Like another chapter of the game you know

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
And it was all content from this year

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
So I was pretty happy with that

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
Uh look at our chat over at

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Live.vognetwork.com William murder face

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
And chat says what did you think about Witcher 3

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
You know I have to be honest as

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
Gorgeous as the game is as I was playing

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Through it I just didn't get to really

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Spend enough quality time with the game and like I said

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
When we started this segment the reason why

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
We call it our favorite and not the best

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Is because

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
We don't have time to play everything and I just did not

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Get to sink the hours into Witcher 3 that it

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Probably deserved probably because

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Of the exact same time one of my honorable

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Mention games I was playing a ton of

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
And that would be Final Fantasy Heavensward

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
And a big part of the reason I really didn't

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Feel comfortable putting that in my top 3 is

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
A. Expansions fall in a really

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Weird place I think I put the Diablo 3

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Expansion in one year but that

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Just changed the game fundamentally

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Heavensward has had a weak follow up

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Uh it's having a lot of problems right now

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
In some of the patching content but I think the

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Initial game

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
That came out with the voice acting

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
The dungeon design the music

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Was really just

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
A premier MMO

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Experience and it kind of sucks that it's

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
It's having some problems here a few months out

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
But I think because that game

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Was sucking down like all my time

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
I don't really think I got to give

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Witcher 3 a fair break

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
What about some other honorable mentions from you guys?

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
Any? Well I said Soma

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Just because I'm pretty sure I would end up

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Loving the story if I finished it

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Xenoblade honestly I've put so much time

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Into Xenoblade Chronicles

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
X has amazing music

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
I don't care what people say the story is really

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
Good it takes a little bit to get into especially if

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
You are somebody that likes exploring

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Open worlds which I usually don't by doing this

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Game but

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
I can see it easily becoming my

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
Number one for this year

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
I will say Xenoblade was really close

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
For me and one of those 1, 2, 3 configurations

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Would have had Xenoblade on it but I just

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
Felt the hurdle

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
You have to get through in the beginning is too great

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
And it just kept

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
That off me and you heard me express this

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
On the show previously I love

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Where I'm at now in the game and I think

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
There is a lot to really love about

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Xenoblade but you really

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
Have to work at it I think to

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Love it and I think a really great

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Game you shouldn't have to work at it

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
And the only other game I would have considered

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
Probably because I just haven't

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Played it enough yet because when I

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Got it I was definitely

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
On a lot of painkillers was

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Rise of the Tomb Raider

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
And because I haven't played

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
Enough of it I can't really say

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I think I see it on a lot of people's lists

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
I'm pretty sure I'd put it on mine too

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Yeah I honestly have not gotten around

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
To playing it yet just too much other stuff

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Going on Flaco

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Yeah like I mentioned Tearaway Unfolded was really

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Cool on PS4 and it did a lot of stuff

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Different than the Vita version but since the Vita version

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Is better I was like I'll still knock that one down

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
I mean it's definitely a different game

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
And they change a lot and they actually make it a lot harder

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
And then let's see

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Yoshi's Woolly World

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Liked that game a lot

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Cracked top 3 there

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
And the other game that's definitely

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Right on the border top 3 is

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Jackbox Party Pack 2

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
We just talked at the top of the show

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Bomb Corp alone is like

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
I think is worthy of being in that top 5

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Of my favorite games of the year

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
So I just add in

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
With Quiplash XL which is amazing

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
And that's it

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
Earwax is not good

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
Earwax is great and Fibbage is just Fibbage

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
It's great so

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I guess that's the one

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
That's why it wouldn't crack the top 3

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Not every game on it is good

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I kind of wanted to put as my number 1

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
ResVR but

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I've only played one stage

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
You did play it

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
But I didn't beat it

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
Because they wouldn't let you beat it

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
If they would have let me sit there and play all the stages

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
I would have gladly done that

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
Alright

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Let's see

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
The only other honorable mention I did come very close to putting

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
In the top 3 but Shane I think you outlined all the issues beautifully

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
With Splatoon

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Well I think your issue with Splatoon is

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
You just stick to a roller and you don't try anything

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
I have tried the other stuff and I don't like it

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Just not enough

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
You've seen me play the other stuff and you even said

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
You should probably go back to roller

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
I probably did

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I think that game also

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
If you get frustrated really easily

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
You probably shouldn't be playing it either

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
The matchmaking thing really bugs me

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
I mean come on

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
They did improve matchmaking

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
With the last patch though

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
And that's sad that it's improved and it's still really bad

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
No it wasn't because I only played

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Even though there was a huge difference in the popularity

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
I only played my own team once

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
And there was the exact same disparities

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
That's why I didn't think there was one

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
And I followed another streamer

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
And he only played the other team once

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
I think they've gotten better with that

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
The game missed my top 3 narrowly

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
It's not a bad game by any means

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
But I do have some issues that made me go

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
I liked it as much as the 3 that I did choose

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
The matchmaking has gotten a lot better

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
That last Splatfest was definitely true

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
That's good

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
So just to recap real quick

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Running down the 3-2-1 real quick

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Dark Sakura 3-2-1 was

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Undertale, Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
And Dragon Age Inquisition

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
All the DLC that came out

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Flaco 3-2-1 was

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Rocket League

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
Until Dawn and Splatoon

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
And Shane, pretty similar

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
I thought you were going to say 3-2-1

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
I was going to say contact

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Gotcha

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Yeah, everybody's gone to the rapture

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Until Dawn and Splatoon

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
And mine was everybody's gone to the rapture

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Rocket League

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
And Super Mario Maker

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Which was not on anybody else's list

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
How does that happen?

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
What? You didn't like it?

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Oh my god

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
I don't own it either

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
My list was all new IPs

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Just saying

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Take that everybody

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Let's see

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Wait, Rocket League

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
It's a sequel

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
And Mario Maker is definitely not a new IP

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
It's kind of Mario

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Fair enough

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Not that anyone played the original Rocket League

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Or Mario

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
That's it

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
I hope you guys enjoyed that

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
We're going to get to some of your picks a little later

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
In the FUGL question of the week

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Ingress will catch up with Loki and his top 3 games of the year

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Does anybody want to?

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
He might be listening out there, I doubt he is

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
But does anybody want to guess?

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
Because I feel like last year we were in the same situation

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
I think he was gone over the holiday show

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
And we guessed

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
And we were close

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Loki's top 3

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
I would guess Ingress

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
Which I'm going to give him so much hell about

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
He would not put that on there

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
I think he will, I think he's going to put Ingress

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
But it didn't come

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
But mine had new content this year

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
And it was the content that was on my top of the list

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
They do upgrade Ingress

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
I still feel like

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
All this aside

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I think the way the rules are set

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
He's going to put Ingress in there

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
He's put a lot of time into that

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
I think he will put Fallout in there as well

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Mario Maker

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
That would be 3

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Is there a new Grand Theft Auto?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Not this year

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Grand Theft Auto again

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
There was a new Earth Defense Force

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
But it didn't sound like he liked it

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
There was something else he was playing this year

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I wish I could remember what it was

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
There was one other game

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
I can't remember now

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Lego, he might put the Lego game he's been playing with his son in

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
A lot, I wonder if he put that in

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
I don't know

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Going to our chat over at

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
live.vognetwork.com

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Kostan in chat says

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
And like I expected, no one picked the Talos principle

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Never played it

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Well to be fair, that was a

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Last year game

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
It is on PS4 now

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
I thought about it

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
Bobby picked that as his game of the year

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Last year I think

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
There is some love for that game over at VOG

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
And it is on my Steam wishlist, I hope to get to it soon

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
I played it at an expo

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
One of the expos I was at

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I want to say it was running on the Rift

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Or one of those VR things, I could be completely wrong

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
But I just feel like

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
That's how I experienced that game

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
That's like a whole other category

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Games I wish I had played

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
That probably would have been on my list

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Like for me Tomb Raider, I don't have an Xbox One

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Or uh, gosh what's the one I just had

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Killer Instinct season 2 would have been a good one too

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I really enjoyed season 2 of Killer Instinct

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Life is Strange is another game

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
I think I would really like

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
I just haven't gotten around to it

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And now I'm seeing the disc release is going to come out January

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I might just wait for that

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And then AkumaJP suggesting Minecraft

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
For Loki, well there is Minecraft story mode

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
But I feel like Loki kind of dissed that a little bit

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
So we'll see

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
He said something about the voice acting he didn't care for

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Yeah, so we'll see

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
We'll get the results from Loki next week

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
When he's back on the show

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Alright, let's get into our gaming week

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
So getting back to a little more recently

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Let's talk about the video games that we have been playing this week

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
We always like to start off the show after our kickoff topic

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Which, well we have a long kickoff topic tonight

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
But with good reason

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
The news this week

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Is a little light

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
You guys are going to split up Loki's stories right?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I don't know if Flaco even knew that

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Ok, good

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
I tried to say it really quickly, quietly

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Ok, good

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Otherwise I guess I'm going to have to read them

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
So anyway, we're going to get to some news

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But the news as you can imagine is a little bit lighter this week

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Although there were some big events

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
But we do like to start off before we get into the news

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Talking about our gaming weeks

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And the types of video games we have been playing

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
This week specifically

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Kind of busy

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Even though I was actually busy with many other things

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
I didn't play any Dragon Age this week

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Wow

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I played Happy Home Designer, which I'm still super loving

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
I got Catlateral Damage

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Which I haven't played yet

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
But downloaded

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And then we've just been playing all kinds of old school stuff

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
On the

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
The Everdrives

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I did download a bunch of stuff I had wanted to try on iOS

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.000
So I was playing some R-Type the other day

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Which I love R-Type so much

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
And I got Hearthstone

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I started it off and then I realized that I had to

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Because I have a new iPhone

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I had to bring

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Open up my old one

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Get my authenticator code

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And start my authenticator

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
So I'm considering actually starting off Hearthstone

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Like 50 million other people I work with

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Play Hearthstone

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
That's a good toilet game

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I did also take Diablo 3 off of my PC

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Gasp

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
In order to make room for

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
The Star Wars MMO

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
But Diablo 3

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Although Old Republic is pretty good too

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
But you just need a bigger hard drive

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
You need a bigger hard drive

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Even though

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
That goes without saying

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
But the other thing though

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Is that I'm going to be starting back into Final Fantasy 14

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
As a usual Wednesday night thing for myself

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
So

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Trying to rework some stuff

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And I've got

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
A design project to do

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
So my gaming time is going to get kind of

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Narrowed down a bit

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I think this is the time when a lot of people

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Are thinking about the 2016

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Like what am I going to do in games this year

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
And then they'll completely

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
At least I did

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I don't think I did any of the things I talked about

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I was going to do in games

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
You know what I'm going to do in 2016?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Live

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
That's a good goal

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yeah my resolution

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
For 2016 is

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Not getting hit by a bus

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Or getting cancer

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Well good luck

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
To you in that

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
I'd say those are pretty good resolutions

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Alright well good luck

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Moving on let's go to Flaco

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
How was your gaming week?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
My gaming week was pretty good

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Recently on the Playstation sale

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
I got Parappa 2

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Which I'm terrible at

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
You know the PS2 classic one

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I'm just bad at rhythm games

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
That's what Shane had me do and it works much better

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I tried

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
It wouldn't let me mess with him

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I don't know if that's set on game it kind of just stays on

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Okay I have a Samsung TV

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And you put it into game mode

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
See I have mine in game mode

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I'm just bad at rhythm games

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
You're just a baddie

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So there's that

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Oh I bought Tetris

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
The ultimate casual game Tetris

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I got it, I've been playing it tonight

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
I'm a Vita and it's also on the PS4

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
But now that's the really shitty

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Ubisoft one that came out last year

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
That has an amazing commercial though

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yes it has a great commercial

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
So the Vita version is fine

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
The Vita version is really nice, it doesn't have those weird

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Lighting effects, I'm not listening to the music

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
The music is terrible

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
It sounds like some dystopian 80's movie

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It's really bad

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
I hope while you're sitting in

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Studio N7 during OLR

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
You're not listening to the bad sound

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I'm not, I have the volume down

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
But I am playing the game while I'm sitting in Studio N7

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Well maybe they made it for the Vita

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
And then some genius decided let's just blow it up

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
You know what they did though, they delayed the Vita version

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
And I think that helped because I think they actually

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Took feedback from the other version and fixed this one

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Because it doesn't have the weird lighting effects

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I feel like just trying to put it on

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Next Gen at the time on PS4

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
They tried to overdo it with the graphics

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Because the graphics, it's really hard on your eyes

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
When you're playing it, like there's these little light

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Strobes that come off of it

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
When you're really focused on Tetris

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
It just makes it kind of dizzying when you're playing

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
And a little nauseating

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
But when I played the Vita version, it's pretty tight

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
And I think Vita is like the way you want to be anyway

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Because that's just how I remember Tetris

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
It's handheld, portable

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
That's like my favorite way to play it

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
That's been pretty great

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Otherwise there's lots of Splatoon

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And Marvel Puzzle Quest on my phone

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Still play that like crazy

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Did you ever check out the PS4 version?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
No, because they charge you 15 stupid dollars for it

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
That's so dumb

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
You can't import your other thing

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I already have Hulk, like almost maxed out

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Why would I want to then buy Hulk for like another $5 or whatever

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
I thought that was so dumb

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
So I was really angry

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I wanted to watch you play it

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
But it wasn't working that one night

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
We tried to do SharePlay and it wouldn't work

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
SharePlay didn't like me

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
I want to see what this feels like

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
It's just Marvel Puzzle Quest

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
I just like playing on my phone

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Hearthstone is good too

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I'm excited you got into it

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
You know what's really fun on that

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Is the solo adventure modes

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I know they cost money

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
But I've done it all through in-game gold

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
But that takes a lot of time to earn

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I used to play Hearthstone a lot

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
I had a lot of gold saved up

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
But the adventure modes are really worth it

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
There's lots of great voice acting in them

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I just loaded it up

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
And then stopped when I realized

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
I needed my authenticator code

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Aren't the first parts free?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Or am I wrong?

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Maybe on Nax it was originally

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
But they don't do that anymore

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
You got to pay for it

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
But again, you can earn all through in-game gold

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
I've never spent a set on Hearthstone

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Even as much as I like it

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I love the game, but Blizzard got enough money

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
They don't need mine

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
So I just play the game

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
In the competitive mode

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Because it's too cutthroat

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
And people who do spend money have an advantage

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Because they can just get more cards more quickly

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
And it gets a little cutthroat in there

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So I've just kind of stuck to

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
You know, the solo modes

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
They're really fun

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
They actually put a single player experience in there

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
That yeah, it helps you have better cards to do it

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
But if you play naturally through the game

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
You get some good cards, so

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
It's a good game

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
To register participation

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Check out this week's episode of Orange Andrade

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
At vognetwork.com

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Use the passphrase, birth

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Shane, how about you?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
How was your gaming week?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
So I played the tail end

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Of the Street Fighter V beta

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
This past weekend

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Love that Vega is no longer a charge character

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Makes him way more fun to play

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And I played Splatoon

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
A lot

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And I played 14

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Again some more

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I'm going to go back into that

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Even though I'm not happy with it

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Even though he said he was going to quit

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Cancelled his account

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I did for like three months

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
The very next day renewed

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Well that was because

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
I didn't want my retainers

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And Square Enix's support is very unhelpful

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
You know, answering questions

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Or being polite

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
So I figured it out though

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
So I don't have my extra retainers

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Anyway

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
What else did I play?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Parappa 2, I beat it in like 40 minutes

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I was like, man, this game is so short

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
But I love it

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
And now Parappa has a blue hat

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
So he's a better version of himself

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
And I got Fantavision

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Which is also really fun

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
And

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I feel like

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
I missed around a little bit on Super Beat Sonic

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
That's like a disappointment

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
For me this year

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
That game is not as great as I hoped it was going to be

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
But

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I think

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
That's really it

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I may have also driven to McDonald's to get a Pokemon

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Because they were doing a download

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Only at McDonald's

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
And that was dumb, so I went inside

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And I got the Pokemon and mozzarella sticks

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Don't get mozzarella sticks at McDonald's

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
They are nasty

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
The one by my house does

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And it was so gross

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Who else used to have mozzarella sticks?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Was it Jack in the Box?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Was it Jack in the Box? Most of all it was Jack in the Box

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I don't think they do anymore

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Sonic does, and their mozzarella sticks are amazing

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
McDonald's

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Learn from Sonic

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Sounds so healthy, fried cheese

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
You know what though?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
This show

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I feel like

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Exists in large part due to mozzarella sticks

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
And I mean that

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Because not just our obsession with food

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
But because when we used to play

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
DDR at Roseville Golf Land

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And how Loki, Darsakha, and I all met

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
We would go to the little diner that was in the parking lot

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
It's a local thing called Brookfield's

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And they have some bomb ass mozzarella sticks

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Like to this day, oh my god

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Probably the best ones I've ever had are there

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
And so we would burn off all these calories

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Playing DDR

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And then put them right back on

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Eating the mozzarella sticks

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Now they have a soup that I've fallen in love with

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Probably, what?

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Now they have a soup that I've fallen in love with

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
It's that one that you didn't like

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
That I brought when you were sick

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Oh, is that Brookfield's?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I'm gonna mispronounce it

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
It's like the

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Ovolo-lemono or something

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
But it's like an

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Egg and lemon soup

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Chicken soup

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Hey now, they're not paying for this plug

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
I don't care, it's delicious as fuck and I want some

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I'll add a counterpoint then, I hate Brookfield's

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Their breakfast is so terrible

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
They don't know how to cook anything

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Alright, fair enough

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Mark Tetsuya in chat pointing out that

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
A&W cheese curds are better

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Actually, those are pretty bomb too

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I've never heard of that, that just doesn't sound appealing

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
No, they're really good

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
But they're curds

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
And that sounds good, no matter what they are

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
The word sounds really disgusting

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Just like cheesecake

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Cheesecake's good

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I can't get over the fact that it's like

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
A block of cheddar with frosting on it though

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Wasn't our soccer night supposed to have cheesecake today and we didn't?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Yeah, we didn't

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I got Chinese food though on Christmas

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
That made me feel happy

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Oh, that's good

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I went to Panda

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
They were open on Christmas?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Yes

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I was like, oh my god, where's chicken?

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Alright, My Gaming Week

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
A lot of the same stuff I always talk about on this show

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Final Fantasy XIV, but I also downloaded Parappa 2

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I didn't play a whole lot of it

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Because the timing was throwing me off

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
But then Shane

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
But then I came to the rescue

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Alright

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
But one game that I played a lot of this week

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And I'm enjoying it quite a bit

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Is Fast Racing Neo

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
On the Wii U

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
I wasn't sure if I was going to dig this game or not

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Because it's the game

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
That somebody else made

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Because Nintendo refuses to make a new F-Zero

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
For some unexplainable reason

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
So instead, these guys made Fast Racing Neo

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
And when I first started playing it

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
I was like, wow, these menus are

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Super basic

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
I was like, this doesn't really feel like

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
As

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I don't know what the word would be

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
As rich or as immersive as an F-Zero game

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Robust

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Robust is a good word

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
But once you actually get into the game

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I was like, okay, well the meat of the game

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
It is what it says it is

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
It is Fast Racing

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Super Neo

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Yeah, it is, it is very Neo

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
But when I play it on my 62 inch TV

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Or however big that thing is

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
I even get a little motion sick

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
It moves so fucking fast

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
And it's really smooth

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Considering it's a Wii U game

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Which doesn't have the same chips inside

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Like a Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
They really get things moving very well

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
In that game

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
It felt a little more wipe out

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
To me than F-Zero

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
But that's not a bad thing

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
I really like the wipe out games as well

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
It's pretty much what you would expect

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
In those Fast Racing games

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
The mechanic in Fast Racing Neo

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Is that you can flip the engine on your car

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
From blue colored to orange colors

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
And it's kind of like an Ikaruga type of thing

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
Like that will trigger the blue

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Or orange boosters on the course

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
The one thing I don't like about the game

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Is the controls

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
And that's what really annoys me about it

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Is the controls have this really odd configuration to it

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
So that part really annoyed me

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
But otherwise, yeah

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
I'm really enjoying the game

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I watched you play it today

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
I just don't think it's that great of a game

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Even though I didn't play it

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
So maybe my opinion shouldn't matter as much

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
But graphically, so beautiful

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
It's the best looking Wii U game

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Hands down

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
No it is, you can't deny it

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
But it's lifeless

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
The music is not great

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
It looks like it was a text demo

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I don't think Wii U is as bad as you said

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
It's pretty bad

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
But it looks like

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
This is what you could do

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
For a Wii U game

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
You can make games look this pretty

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
But this isn't like a game

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
It's just a tech demo

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
That's kind of like soulless, lifeless

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
It's not anything that special

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
I feel like

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
So anyway, as I'm sitting here talking about it

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I think I actually downloaded this last Sunday

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
So I think I got into this a little bit on last week's OLR

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
So sorry if I'm repeating myself a bit

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
But I did play more of it

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
And I'm enjoying it enough

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
There's still some things

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Kind of what

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Shane is alluding to a little bit there

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
But I don't

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I don't think the negatives are as bad as he says

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
So there you go

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
Fast Facing Neo, I've been having some fun with that game

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And playing more Mario Maker

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Some other

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Stuff too

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
A few of the games on Steam

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
I was playing Super Slam Dunk Touchdown

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Because we had the Maker on last week

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
I was playing that Black Ice game

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I liked that because we'd seen that in GamerX

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
And then Tron Run R

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Which got an update I need to check out

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
Alright

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Carson in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Holy shit, I just checked it out

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
And as Rob said, it's really fucking fast

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Well it's in the title

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Fast Racing Neo, you expect it's going to be a little bit fast

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Alright, some quick housekeeping

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
We will not be taking any shows off

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Through the month of January

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
The next show where we will not be here

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Live is in February

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Because of MAGFest

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
So if you are going to be out in MAGFest in DC

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
I've officially booked my flight, hotel, all that stuff

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
I'm going to be at MAGFest in February

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I'm very excited about that

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I will be absent on the show on the 10th

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
That's right

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
You are going to Disneyland

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
To mourn the passing

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Of Bucket of Meat

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
You know that story is going around Facebook this week

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
About all the stuff they're closing down

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
To make Star Wars land

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
And Big Thunder Railroad too

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
They're only temporarily closing that

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
I was going to say, they're not closing that right now

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
But I want to go on it before it's closed down for a while

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
They just had that closed for like a year

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
When they were doing refurbishments

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
It's kind of weird that they're closing that again

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Alright

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I just went on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad recently

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Did you?

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I went at night

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
And the most amazing part was they started doing the fireworks show

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
When I was on the ride

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
We came out of a tunnel

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
A Mickey shaped firework

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Just appeared

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Right in front of us as we came out

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
That happened to me and Dan a few years ago

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Yeah, we all lost our minds

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
It was the best

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
That's such a storybook thing

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
It was, I'm like how can this happen?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
They planned it, they know

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Did it go faster at night?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Of course it did

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
My son loved that ride, but at night he got a little scared

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
I have certain places I have to sit

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
On certain rides

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Always in the back and always with my husband

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
Cause he has a bigger lap

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
And it has the two person lap bar

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
So I get air

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
I used to be scared of that ride when I was a kid

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
Cause I'd ride with my dad and he was much bigger than me

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Obviously he was my dad

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
And I was just a little kid

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I was scared of it, cause I was like oh I'm gonna fall out

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
It's like no that's just more fun

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
As I got older I'm like oh that is more fun

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
You get air, that's what's so great about Tower of Terror

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Is when it drops and you get off your seat

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
It's so fun

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
I had a panic attack on the elevator when it fell two stories

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So I tried to go on it to overcome my fear

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Of falling like that

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
I had a panic attack

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
In the gift shop

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Wow, my wife refuses to even go on it

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
We got all the way to the door and she's like nope

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
So we had to be escorted out

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
She got a little scared of that one

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
She doesn't want to drop like that

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
You just need to get a glass of wine in her first

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Alright, let's see

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Some other quick things I want to mention

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
This is very important because this guy has been a support

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
For a very long time

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
And also projects that

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I have done

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
On the side, Horde House

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
He was a huge

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
Impact on that show

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And I just want to take a minute to acknowledge

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Pod Culture

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Hit their 10 year mark

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
This week, that show started on Christmas

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I didn't realize that, but their show actually started on Christmas

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And so their 10 year

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Anniversary show was this week

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
So I want to give huge props to Brad

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And his whole crew

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Adam, Christina, Glen, everybody over

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
At Pod Culture for hitting

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
10 years this week

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
It's a fantastic accomplishment, yay

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Clap clap clap

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Pod Culture

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Pod Culture, I love the way he says it too

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
It's so good

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
So yes, congratulations Brad

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
And everybody from Pod Culture

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
And I really hope I get to see you

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
At Dragon Con this year

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Although I know real life is more important

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
But I'm still going to cross my fingers on my toes

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
That you're able to make it to Dragon Con this year

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Alright, and let's see

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
What else do I want to mention here

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Just briefly, it has nothing to do with games

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
But I do feel as a nerd

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
It is my responsibility to tell you all

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
I saw Star Wars

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
It was so good

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I've seen it twice

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
I know you went with me

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
So I didn't have to go alone

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Because Alan works at night

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
So nobody else could really go to the movies with me

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I saw Star Wars, which is notable because I never get out

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
And see movies

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
But I did go out and see Star Wars

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
And I will admit, I really liked it

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
It was my favorite out of all seven of them

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
It really was

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
So, kudos to Abrams

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I didn't see one lens flare

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
And this was very subtle

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Are you blind?

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I wasn't really looking for him

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
You don't have to

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I guess not

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
It wasn't Star Trek bad

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
They're not just on the bridge with lights

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
In every camera

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
When big lasers and stuff go off

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
You can see it pretty clearly

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Of course I'm not going to spoil it

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I'm just going to say one thing

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Not a spoiler

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I just have to thank Star Wars

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
For bringing Poe

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Into my life

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
And I'm not talking about the poet

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
And I'm not talking about the musician

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
Who disappeared somewhere in the late 90s

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I'm talking about Poe Dameron

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
The super hot guy

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
From the movie

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
So that's all I'm going to say

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Thank you

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
I really want to get his Disney Infinity figure

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Just because it's Poe

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
I hope it means more people watch Inside Llewyn Davis

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Because that's a great movie

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
He got an Oscar nomination for

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
Adam Driver is in that as well

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
The guy who plays Kylo Ren

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I didn't even realize that

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
It's a Coen Brothers movie

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I saw it on opening week

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Shane I feel a little bit like you

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I have never been super obsessed

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
With Star Wars

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Star Wars is awful

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I really hate Star Wars

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Except for this one

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I definitely wouldn't go that far

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
You will go there

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I was always more of a Star Trek person

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Grandpa doesn't even have to pay me money to say that

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I was always more of a Star Trek person

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Than Star Wars

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I was like okay I'll go see the new one

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Just because it's a culture thing

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And everybody's really into it

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
And as a nerd I feel a responsibility to go see it

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
So I saw it

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
And now I'm like

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
When we were at Toys R Us today

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
I'm like I really want the Poe

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Star Wars figure

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
He keeps going into my best spy cart online

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
We have no Rey

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Yes you do because

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
She's not a stand alone

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Rey and Finn are in a Star Wars bundle

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
And I was like I can't get Poe

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And not get Finn

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Well you get those and give me Rey

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Listen

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I like Rey though

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Rey is their female companion

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Listen fully Black Widow her

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
From the toy line

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Is that her only toy?

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
If that is that's pretty sad again

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
Women totally get

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Shafted when it comes to having

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
Action figures

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Not in Power Rangers

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
It is absolute bullshit

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
You're preaching to the choir in this case

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Because in the movie

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Again I'm not going to spoil

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
But I don't think it's a spoiler to say

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
She kind of

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
She's like the main character

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
She kind of

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
I don't want to say she carries that movie

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
But without her I don't think it would be as good as it is

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
So

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
It's bullshit there's no figure

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Of her just like there are for the boys

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
That are also very important in that movie

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Well even Poe's not that important

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
But he's got many figures

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Don't forget about the figure that they did for

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Sir Not Appearing in this film

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Yeah they made a figure for

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Somebody that got cut I think

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Alright alright we got to watch the spoilers

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
It's not a spoiler

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
The character's not in the movie

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
But they made an action figure for him

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
And as I've been calling him he's Sir Not Appearing

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
They should have made an action figure

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
For the cameo that I freak out

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Over every time I see that movie

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
What Chanel number 3?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Spoilers but yes

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
That's not a spoiler

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
She's Carrie Fish's daughter

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Not a spoiler

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
It's great nepotism

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
I just need to have the Captain Phasma figure

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
To put on my cubicle

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
Even though she was like

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
I'm not going to spoil it but I love her

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Alright now our chat

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Is starting to get hypersensitive about spoilers

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I mean if we really wanted to spoil you

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
There's other stuff we can say

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
We haven't spoiled anything

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
So go

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Quick go see it before you see some freaking meme

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Or something online

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Or you can see Krampus

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
We're close though to the

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Statute of limitations on spoilers

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
So go see it

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Before we start

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
No we're not a movie show

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Before I start

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Jamie will come to your house, knock on your door

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
And scream it if you don't see it

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
In the next 30 days

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
Although I do have to say that Ray is very similar

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I used to play the Star Wars RPG tabletop

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
She's very similar to a character

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
That I played like 10 years ago

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Nice

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Alright

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Back to games

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Let's get into the news this week

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And I'm going to start us off with a big thing

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
That happened on the Christmas holiday

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
That I'm sure a lot of you guys have heard about

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
It was probably the big story of the week

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And that is the fact that Steam

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Had some major issues this week

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Steam wasn't hacked per se

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Or at least that's not what they're saying is happening

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Something happened with Steam's caching servers

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
And what happened

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
In a nutshell is that when you would go

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
On Steam, you're presented

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
With pages from other people's

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Random accounts

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Basically

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
And there's screenshots out there on like

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
NeoGaf and some other Twitter I think has some too

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Where you see random people

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Thankfully, and thank you Twitter people for doing this

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000
They blacked out the really sensitive

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Information, but you can clearly see that they're

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Able to see somebody's account name

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And they can see the address, phone number

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And email address that

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Goes with an account

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
And so what basically happened

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Is that as people

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Were logging in and using Steam

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
To go about their business and make transactions

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Because after all there is a Steam sale

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Going on, some people's data

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Would be saved to the cache server

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
And then that data was then accidentally

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Delivered to other people that had

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Nothing to do with that transaction

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I'm really oversimplifying this

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
I can't tell you what really happened because

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Valve is, in my opinion

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Valve is being really dodgy about what happened

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000
I'm trying to cut them a break

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Because it's fucking Christmas

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
And I understand like nobody's in the office

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000
But at the same time, they are

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Running a major sale right now

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
So I do expect that, you know

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000
If they're gonna ask for money, they do kind of owe it to us

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
A little bit to explain exactly

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
What's going on

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000
And I kind of feel like their statement right now

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Is more, it's not happening anymore

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Don't look behind the curtain

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
But whatever

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
So anyway, yeah

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
So basically on Steam

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Other people's private information

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Was being displayed to unrelated people

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And I gotta say, when I found out about this

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
I went super cyan

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Pissed off on Twitter

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
And I was mad

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
And I even kind of said some pretty mean things

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
On Twitter because

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
I saw some people were kind of going

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Well, it's a good thing I don't use Steam

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And I'm on Nintendo

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
Nintendo doesn't have these problems

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Well, PlayStation 4 fixed that issue

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Why can't Steam fix that issue

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And I was like, no!

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
There is a big difference between

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
What happened on those networks

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
And what happened on Steam

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
And what's funny is, I'm actually on the side of

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000
What happened on Steam is way worse

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
What happened on PlayStation 4

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I don't know if it's ever happened on Nintendo

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Probably maintenance and stuff

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
But downtime, DDoS attacks

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
That's one thing

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
It takes the server down

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
People are upset, whatever

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
Oh no, so forth

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000
But this was displaying people's

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Personal information

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000
Full on display

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000
To other people

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And you guys know I am a big advocate for privacy

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
And so forth, and I've talked about

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Some of the issues I've had in the past

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000
And why I like to use a fake name online and so forth

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
So obviously to use my credit card on Steam

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
I don't use that

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
And I'm sure that potentially

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
And thankfully I took the Internet's advice

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000
And just didn't use Steam on Christmas

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
I mean it helped that I was on the road all day anyway

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000
But I didn't use Steam

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
At all that day

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
So I don't think my information was out there

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
But I was really pissed off

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
Thinking that that possibility

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Was even there

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
That somebody could have seen my address

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
My phone number, and even the last four of my credit cards

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
What the actual fuck

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
I think Steam has some huge explaining

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
To do with this

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
And what they've said so far isn't enough

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Like this really

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
And you guys might think I'm blowing this out of proportion

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
I don't think I am

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Because I take privacy and this type of stuff

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Like very seriously

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
And you might be thinking

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Well Rob, if you don't want to do that

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000
You probably shouldn't give them that information

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
You have to give them that

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
To use your credit card on the store in the first place

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
I mean I guess I should have used a prepaid card

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Or something like that

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
I didn't learn there oh well

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
But I mean

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Steam has boasted

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
About its security before

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Outright boasted

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
They've come up on stage and said

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Our two-factor authentication is so awesome

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I don't remember who he was

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
I don't know if he was the CEO

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I don't think anybody at Valve has titles

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
So he was some guy speaking on security

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
He's like, here is my account

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
And my password

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
It's secure, you'll never get in there

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
And I know to date

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
The two-factor authentication has been so good

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
Nobody's got in there

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And I do have two-factor authentication enabled on my account

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Guess what, it wouldn't have fucking mattered in this case

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And that's why I'm really

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Really upset about what happened with Steam

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Isn't part of it also

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
The fact like

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
The thing that happened with Steam

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Wasn't that just something on their part

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
That screwed up

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Whereas the other network issues that happened

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Like Xbox Live and Playstation Network

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Think it's funny

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
So it's like a huge difference there too

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
It wasn't because somebody outright attacked

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
The services, Steam screwed up

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And I'm gonna say

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Something that might blow your mind here

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
But this is honestly how I feel

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Because I think the closest thing to this

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
That has happened in gaming in the past few years

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Is when the Playstation store was hacked

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And all those credit card numbers were stolen

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
And so forth

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I would rather somebody

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Steal my credit card information

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Than see my address and phone number

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
That's how I honestly feel

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Because credit cards, guess what

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000
They are like stupid easy to

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Say this is a fraudulent charge

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
It's not me because that also happened to me

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Earlier in the year, it had nothing to do with games

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.000
But somebody charged $50

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
At like a Chuck E. Cheese in Pasadena

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
And then some random store in St. Louis

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000
And I'm like what the fuck, so I called my bank

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Easy, done, no problem

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Easy peasy fix

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000
That's why credit card companies get money

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
It's to fix these situations like this

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
So honestly

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
If somebody gets the credit card number

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
I honestly don't think it's as big of a deal

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
As somebody potentially knowing

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
What my phone number is and where my house is

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
And maybe that's just because of some of the experiences

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
I've gone through in life and so forth

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
But like this is worse in my opinion

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
And I have some huge trust issues with Steam now

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Because A, they're not fucking explaining

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
What really happened

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
And they're not

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
They're not explaining how it's not gonna happen

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Again and trying to earn my trust back

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I don't need a free fucking game

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Or Steam money

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Or training, I just

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Want reassurance

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
This is not gonna happen again

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I wanna know how it happened and how it's not

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Gonna happen again because

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
For them to get up on stage

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
And the chat room is telling me it was Gabe Newell

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Who actually got up there on stage, sorry

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
It was a long time ago, to get up on stage

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
You're just a random employee though

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
We are the most secure company

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Because of two-actor authentication

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
I'm the president and I'm gonna give you

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
My password because the two-factor's so

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Strong so if you use it, you'll have the same security

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
To have that fail

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Is a real violation

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Of my trust, I think

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
And that is why I'm super cyan pissed off

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
At what happened on Steam

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
If you think I'm going overboard, oh well, it's my opinion

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
So I don't know, anybody else wanna comment on

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
What's going on with the Steam stuff?

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I mean, it was fixed after a short amount of time

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Was my information on

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Display? Probably not because I didn't use

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
The service during that particular hour

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
But I have been on

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Steam off and on throughout

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
The sale, I was doing the trading cards every

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Day, since Christmas

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I kinda

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Stopped

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
I've bought three things since that went down

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Yeah, and it's, I just, I don't know

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Are you, are you, do you

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Think I'm too upset

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Dark soccer or what?

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
I think that they've dealt with the problem

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
And that your information probably didn't get out there

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
It's what

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
I tell people

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
You're like, oh well this could have happened

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Did it happen?

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
No

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
If it's not going to happen

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Again, if they now

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Know of the issue and know how to prevent it

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
From happening

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
I honestly think that

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
There's really no

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Use getting too worked up over it

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
It's the past

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
I'm sort of like half with you

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Because I get that it didn't happen

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
To me, and I know I'm sitting here going

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
It could have, but

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
To be fair, the people that it did happen to

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
They don't know

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Because that's the other end of this

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
You don't know whose information got displayed

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Is Valve going to alert these people?

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
They haven't said

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
And if it was me

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Is Valve going to know who got reflected?

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
I don't think they do

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
I don't think they do either

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
In my opinion

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
They're going to get sued over it

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
And they should

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
I see you rolling your eyes

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
I wasn't rolling my eyes

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
The whole thing is

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Chances are it was noticed

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
By a few people

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
I doubt that everyone looking at it is so malicious

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
That they're going to actively start looking

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
For people that they want to see

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
It only happened for people who had recently made

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Purchases, right?

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
So it was just cached data

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
So it's not anything

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
That they're going to be able to do much with

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
Apart from

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Now, I understand

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
There are stalker situations

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
But those are

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000
More often than not

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000
First of all, they would have to have actively

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Been looking for the person that they're trying to stalk

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Knowing the username

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000
And then finding that data that way

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
It would still require work

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
To get this information

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
So it would have to be somebody actively trying to go after

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000
Who knows the person's username on Steam

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And you can change your username on Steam

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Right. Now there's a lot of

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Talk and chat back and forth

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
Was it a hack? Was it not a hack?

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
My understanding was that

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
It was an internal failing

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Now, could something from the outside

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000
Have tipped that internal failing?

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I don't think so

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
Based on what we know about the situation

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
But when Valve has given us a very

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
Short answer and I really feel like

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000
They're trying to sweep this under the rug

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000
I really want to see what happens next week

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Because, uh-uh, you are not sweeping this under the rug

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Valve, you are not sweeping this under the rug

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000
You need to explain how the fuck

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000
This happened a lot better

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
So we're clear, you know, if it was a hack or not

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000
And if it wasn't, then what happened?

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000
What's being done to this in the future?

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000
So, anyway

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
There you go

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Alright

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
Let's see, Bobby Blackwolf in chat

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Says, this was one employee who was

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Most likely an employee who is no longer employed

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000
By Valve, you set something incorrectly

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000
On Akamai

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000
I don't know how you actually pronounce that

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
But the name of the actual caching system

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000
So, we'll see

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000
I don't know, we'll see what comes in the coming weeks

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
But I do not want this story to go away

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Because I need to know

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
If I'm to continue to use Steam, which I'm not sure

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000
I want to in the moment

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
How they're going to prevent this from happening again

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
And once they address the issue, I'll probably

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Simmer down, I forgave PlayStation

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
As a lot of people did, you know

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
I still shop at Target, but

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
I bought three things today

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
On Steam

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
Right now

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
So, I mean

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I haven't gotten any weird mail

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000
There's probably a lot of people

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
In your boat, and that's fine

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000
But I'm

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000
Choosing not to

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Until I have that reassurance back

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Steam has lost some of my trust

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
Alright, moving on

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Darcyra

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Well, Bayonetta

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
As we all know, she is

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Now going to be in Super Smash Bros

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
However, her inclusion

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000
Nearly changed the rating of the game in Japan

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000
They

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
Actually

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000
Were

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
Because she's very

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000
What's a good word for it?

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Sexual

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
You know

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
They thought that it would

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
That putting her in the game

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Would basically remove it for the

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000
A for All rating

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000
However, after

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Discussion

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
And working on it, they figure

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
She's, I guess, safe enough to

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
Hang out with Cloud, so

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000
They've NSFW'd

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Or they've taken out the NSFW

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000
And sterilized her a little bit

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Which I find really odd for Japan

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
Given

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000
That, at least

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
In my experience

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000
Well

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000
I don't know, I would think that

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Having a character that might be

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000
A little bit more risque

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Wouldn't be as

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
Big of a deal, given that things

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Like, well then again

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000
In America we have a tendency

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
To sexualize

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Nudity, which in and of itself

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Is not a sexual thing

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
You know

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
And

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000
She doesn't really get naked

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000
She gets maybe less

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Clothed the more she uses her hair

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
You never see your titties

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
In the game

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000
And she's flirty and does a little bit of bad talk

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000
But she's not like

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000
Overtly

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000
I don't know

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I'm just really surprised at that

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
But you know what's interesting, we did talk about

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Until Dawn being censored in Japan earlier

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
So we do have some cases

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000
Where, I mean that's violence

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000
I was always of the opinion

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
That things like, you know, blood and gore

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000
I mean if you look at the history

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
Of, at least back for the 16-bit era

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000
Games would be censored

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000
When they came here instead of how they were there

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
I mean look at Splatterhouse

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Or look at, well even

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Mortal Kombat

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
Or Samurai Shodown, that was one

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000
Cause on Samurai Shodown

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000
Too, I actually have the Samurai Spirits

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000
Neo Geo cartridge

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000
And if you play it in Japanese mode

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Then it's got red blood

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
And if you play it in the American mode

01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000
It's sweat

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000
So, you know

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
I'm very, I'm just a little bit surprised by that

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000
But I mean, it is what it is

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
I mean, I guess maybe

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000
You know, her smacking down

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000
People with the guillotine

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Or her demon boot

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Is a little bit too much

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000
AkumaJP in chat

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Who is in Japan

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000
And listens to this program live sometimes

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
Thanks for being here

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
I mean, the billboards here in Akihabara

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Breast, naked chicks everywhere

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000
So, uh

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Yeah, maybe there's, you know what

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000
A lot of those same double standards exist here

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000
In the US too, just for what it's worth

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000
I, we're

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Nintendo

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000
Bayonetta will not corrupt the youth

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
They were already there

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Deal with it

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Well I am super excited for Bayonetta and Smash

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000
And, you know, I'm pretty sure

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000
It's not like she's gonna have, like you said

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
She's not gonna have her guillotine move

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Or a lot of the super violent stuff she has in her games

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000
They're not gonna bring that to Smash

01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000
You're not gonna be able to chop Peach's head off

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
With some move

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Although it'd be kind of rad if that were a thing

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
No, I'm just kidding, you can't do that to

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Mario and friends

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000
You can't do that, alright

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Let's move on, who's doing our next story? When are you guys, right?

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Oh, I was trying to tweet

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Oh, well, sorry, but

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
You know, during live radio, you never know

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
When it's gonna get deeper

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Let's just stop the show

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
Let's go to a break

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000
So, Shane can finish his tweet

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000
So, with

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Amplitude already out

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And coming out soon

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
For people that didn't pay

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
$40 or more to back it

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000
Like me

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
They are adding

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000
And have added

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
This story sucks

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000
A mode to make it look like frequency

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
So, in Amplitude

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Your tracks are all laid out

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Horizontally

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000
But in

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000
Frequency

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000
You were kind of in this

01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Tube

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
Going around in circles

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000
To hit the tracks

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000
Well, Harmonics said that

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
They initially changed it in Amplitude

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
To allow for better

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
Track recognition

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000
But between the fans and even the developers

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000
It was pretty much split

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000
On which way people

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Preferred, the frequency way or amplitude way

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
So, for this

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000
New reboot, they've actually

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Added a mode that makes it so you can play it like frequency

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
And for me, I'm

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Super excited because I preferred the frequency

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Method a lot more

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000
It took a lot of getting used to for Amplitude

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000
And I'll be happy

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
To play this game the way I

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000
Would have preferred to back when

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000
They released the original version

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000
The end

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Have you played? You were a big backer

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Of Amplitude, have you played?

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I paid $20 for it

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000
Wait, so did you

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000
Get the PS4 version?

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
No, because you had to do $40

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000
Two weeks, one week early

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000
So I'll get it when it comes out

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000
In January, next

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Next week I think it is

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
But I played it at

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
PlayStation Experience

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
And it was Amplitude

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000
There it was

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000
Not much different

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000
At all, so I mean

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
I'm fine with that

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I have a feeling I will be a little

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Disappointed based on some of the things

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
I've been seeing

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And already disappointed just kind of

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
At the song list in general because

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Something that really stuck out

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000
In frequency and amplitude for me

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Was the inclusion of

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Random genres of music

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
That I never would have listened to

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
Or never thought would be good in a music

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Game like Quarashi

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
Or they had a lot of hard rock stuff

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
Randomly

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
And this is mostly

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
In house music

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
This time

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
That was something that concerned me too

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
About going into the game is that they

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Weren't going to have the money to do all that license stuff

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
So I really wanted to see

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Part of the reason I didn't back it

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I wanted to see what the quality of the game

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Was going to be first

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
If it was going to be able to live up to the original

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
I get in the sense it is from a lot of the YouTubes

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
And stuff that I'm seeing but

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
There's also a part of me that's like

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
It's just a lot

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Just rock band blitz

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
And

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I kind of just want to see them do rock band

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Blitz on Playstation 4 and

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Xbox One I kind of wish they'd do that

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
I don't know what's going on over at Harmonix

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
But I feel like they're just losing their touch

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Overall

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
And you see some people out there abandoning ship a little bit

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Which is a little weird so

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I also don't like, and I understand that

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
This is part of the nature of Kickstarter

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
But I don't like that the super

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Uber backers get an extra song

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
That we apparently will never get

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
I think

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
That's kind of a bad decision

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
And also

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Makes me feel like

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
Maybe they do another Kickstarter

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
Maybe I won't support it because

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I'm not going to pay $200

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
To get an extra song

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
But they expect

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Me to throw them money to get what now

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
I feel is an incomplete game

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
ActDeft in chat

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com says

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Having licensed music

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Costs money, lots of money

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Not lots of money

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
I saw how much it cost

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
At Konami when we did DDR

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Some of that stuff is super cheap you'd be surprised

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
So maybe

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
But also

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
And you don't have to go for well known stuff

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Yeah, DDR also never really went for the AAA stuff

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
Like

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Yeah we had garbage in that, that was cool

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
We had David Bowie in

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
Amplitude or Frequency, that was cool

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
But at the time

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
I'm sure Quarashi didn't cost

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
$3,000 to put in the game

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
They still win

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
They'd probably pay you $3,000 to get in the game

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Because they probably aren't doing anything

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
It's stuff like that

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Don't go for big names, but go for

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
A name

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
It would just kind of help balance it a bit

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
I think

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
I kind of skimmed the soundtrack

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Or the song list rather

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
At Playstation Experience

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
A lot of it just sounded like electronic music

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
That's cool

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
But I want something more

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
I think that's what really brought a lot of the charm to the game

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
And I don't see that there

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
Bobby Blackwolf

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
Offering a different perspective saying

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
It may have been cheap before music games took off

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
But the music licensing landscape changed

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
With regards to video games

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Rock Band and Guitar Hero

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
They always go for a very big AAA genre

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
I think back to some of the greatest

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
DDR games

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
I still think the best one they ever did here in the US was Ultramix 2

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
And with that series

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
It was a lot of really unknown

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
That game alone

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
Introduced me to so many new

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Bands that were amazing

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Granted, some of those bands were

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Part of a label that maybe

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Konami had a partnership with

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
To get cheaper stuff

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Again, you don't have to go for huge things

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Go for

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
They're based out in Boston

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Go for local random Boston artists

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
It doesn't matter

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
It just brings something different

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
That's why Freezepop is always in the game

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Go get some random hip hop artist

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
In Boston that's not a big name

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Or a hard rock artist

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Something like that

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
Just get me something that's not just electronic music

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
Just diversify

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
The soundtrack a little bit

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Alright, well let's move on to another story

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
That talks about the NX

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
We brought up Nintendo's successor

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
To the Wii U a little earlier

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
The NX, although of course that won't be the final name

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
But that's what everybody's calling it right now

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Because the hype is growing more and more

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
About the NX possibly

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
Releasing next year

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
But, the analysts are coming out

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
And the analysts are having their say

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
On what's going on

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
And you know this guy always

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
Has to say something when it comes to video game analytics

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
And that's Michael Patcher

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
He's still something?

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Yeah, and I don't know the guy

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
And whatever, I know other podcasts

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Have had him on, he's probably very pleasant

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
But at the same time

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I really think what he's doing isn't all that different

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
Than what you and I are doing

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
He's just got some more schooling

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
And experience in financial industries

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
But I see him commenting on

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Entertainment stuff all the time too

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
It's not just video games

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
But anyway, here's what Patcher says

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
First, mobile game will flop

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Miitomo will get 100 million downloads

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
So it'll be a success

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
But it'll drop out of the top 100 grossing games

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
On iOS and Android by the year end

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
I think people will try it, but I don't think they'll find

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Social chat compelling enough to spend money

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
In my opinion, Miitomo offers

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Little that isn't already widely available on Facebook

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
Younger consumers not on Facebook

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Will probably find it appealing, but they typically have

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Little or no access to credit

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
So Nintendo will have trouble monetizing Miitomo

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
To his credit

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
I actually kind of see that perspective

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
A little bit, but I also think we know

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Way too little about Miitomo

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
To say that it's going to do nothing

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Instead of just the social stuff

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
So I don't know, we'll see though

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Nintendo's second mobile game

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Will be a resounding success

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
I actually think Miitomo is intended to be a platform

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
That allows people to create a personalized image or character

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
And use it on other Nintendo games

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I am hopeful that the second effort

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Is something more familiar, such as the

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Super Mario platformer

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
I think the game will attract 200 million downloads

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
And will be a top 20 or possibly top 10

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Grossing game on both iOS and Android

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
But here's the other big one

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
The NX won't come out in 2016

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Nintendo has a history of announcing

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Consoles in one year and launching the next

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
And I don't see the NX

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
As deviating from that pattern

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
William Ritterface

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
With a comment or chat over at

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
Live.FogNetwork.com

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Why should we care what he says?

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
That's an excellent question

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
No matter what I say and all this stuff about him

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Because his analytics

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
Are so well respected and so forth

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Investors listen

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
To what he says

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
And invest their money

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Sometimes as a result of his

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
Predictions, so to speak

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
That's a lot of what the stock market is

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
And a lot of these analytics

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Come in

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
When we talk about the stock market

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
That's the reality

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Whether you agree with it or not

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
We're in turn mentioning this

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Because these comments

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Get picked up on Wall Street

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Journal-esque type of sites

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
And could

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Possibly impact investorship

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
On into 2016

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
And even Dungeon Buster in chat

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Says, Patrick's a Wall Street analyst so he's just

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
Looking at it from an investor standpoint

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
Interesting

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
Though that last comment there, I don't want to gloss over

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
This, NX won't come out in 2016

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Nintendo has a history

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Of announcing consoles in one year

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
And launching the next

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
And I don't see the NX as deviating

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
From that pattern

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Announcing how though? Because they kind of announced

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
It already

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
And that's a very good counterpoint

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
They've said more about NX

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
At this point than they said about Wii U

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
This far out

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
So they have kind of already said

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
This is something we're working on

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Even though

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
You always know these big companies are working on

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
Successors, Playstation 5

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Xbox

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Whatever they call it, 2

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
They're in development right now

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
But you know, obviously

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
It's going to be a while before we see the results of that

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
So obviously

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Nintendo is working on a successor

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
It's just usually not talked about so publicly

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
So that's why I think we feel like it's coming

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
A little sooner than it might

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
But to be fair, the Wii U was shown

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
A long time before it came out

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Because I think they wanted to

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Get more developers on board

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Because Nintendo is always that

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
We've got a silly concept type of thing

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
And so Nintendo shows it

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
So that the developers can start

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Thinking about how they want to use it

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
I also think it's for consumer benefit too

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Because you just throw something out there

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
That

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Out there

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
And they're not going to understand what to do with it

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
So if this isn't super crazy

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Like the Wii or Wii U

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Maybe they wouldn't need that extra time

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Alright, well

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
We'll see what happens

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Obviously this is all just

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Miss Cleo future predicting

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Until E3

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Which is when we're probably going to hear

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
What it's really called instead of NX

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Let's just hope they give it a good name

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
And we'll see

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
What the catch is about the system

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
And what's to expect

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
Alright, let's move on

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
Well, we have a statement that was

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Put out

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
By

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Kimishima

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
The new Nintendo president

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Who had a few things

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
To say about the year in review

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
It was something that was released

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
To shareholders and investors

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
The big thing on here though

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Is that he made a mention

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
I'm just

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Going to read this section

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Because it's going to illustrate it

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Of course, very good

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
We leverage Nintendo IP

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
In various ways beyond our traditional

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Use of them

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Predominantly within the dedicated video game platform business

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Furthermore

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
In our attempt to establish

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
A sustainable and continual relationship

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
With our customers

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Sorry, consumers

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
We are creating a new membership service

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Called My Nintendo

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
And a new account system

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Which will work as a bridge between our dedicated

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Video game platforms and other devices

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Where our consumers can get in touch with Nintendo IP

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
And thus

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Will work as a mechanism to

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Maximize the number of people

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
That interact with Nintendo's IP

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
That

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Seems to me that

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
They're

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Already, I think, looking outside

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Of just standard video game stuff

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
They did start off as a card company

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
But I think that they're trying

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
To work for

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Everything, toys, figures

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Non-video games

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Things like that

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
It seems to me that

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
We're going to be hearing a lot more about

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
My Nintendo

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
I'd say

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Yeah, I mean, they've had such success

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
With the toy thing

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
And they're hoping to have a lot of success with mobile

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
I don't know how Pokemon Go

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Is going to play into that

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
I understand Pokemon Company is their own separate thing

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
But it would be very interesting to see if that does tie back

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Into the Nintendo infrastructure

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
One way or another

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
But we, of course, know about Miitomo

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
And they want to grow that as well

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
So you basically have Nintendo across

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
All these platforms

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Which, to be fair,

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Microsoft's probably the closest

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Otherwise

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Because your Xbox, Microsoft account

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Can work on your Windows

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
And works in a lot of those other places

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
I don't think Sony's really there with what they've got going on on PlayStation

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Because Sony hasn't really penetrated

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
Other parts of

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
Your living room and your office

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
If that makes sense

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Haha, penetrated

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
You want me to say it again, Dar Sakura?

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Penetrated

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Sony has not yet

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Penetrated, but they hope to

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
They're hoping to get some

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Yes

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
The other thing, though, is that

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
They did mention NX

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
In the statement

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Without going into too much detail about it

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
But just as it says on here

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Nintendo is currently developing

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
A gaming platform codenamed NX

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
With a brand new concept

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
And our unique software-led hardware

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
Software integrated business

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
Will continue to constitute the core business

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
For Nintendo

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
So

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
I think they're banking a lot on NX

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
On top of that

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
So there's a few things to be read into this

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Speculation, of course

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Which, again, they're talking about all this now

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
I think it actually supports that we could be seeing

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
NX, whatever it is, a little sooner rather than later

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
But I also

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I can still

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Also understand the whole, don't get your hopes up

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
That it's a sure thing for

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
December 2016, because maybe

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
The focus is really going to be on

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Zelda on the Wii U

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
At this point, it wouldn't surprise me one bit

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
If Zelda is all the way holiday

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Next year, be ready for that

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
And mobile

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Their renewed focus on mobile

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
The transition to NX in 2017, who knows

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Anyway

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Let's move on, we're going to travel around the world

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
And check out some release dates

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
But I think it's probably going to be

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
A little slow this week

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
I tried to look at the US release dates for Loki

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
And nothing's out this week

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
In the US

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Hooray, because I didn't see anything to look up

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
There isn't, I checked the sources

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Which, of course, there's nothing new this week

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
And going over to Japan

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
Nothing coming out in Japan

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
So I don't know, does Europe

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Have any games to save this segment this week?

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Do we have any late December releases?

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Yes, now there's nothing for

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
The New Year, I checked on that

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
But we do have a release for the 30th

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
And that's Story of Seasons for 3DS

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
That's

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
It

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
One lone 3DS title in the entire world

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Is launching this week

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
It's so lonely

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
It's a lonely story

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
That's right, it's the best game

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
In the entire world

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
For the last week of the year

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Alright

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Then we're going to get to the classic game of the week

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Let's get to it

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Who's going next, Flaco?

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
There's this giant picture on the article

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Oh wait, it looks like it's gone away

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Okay, so

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter is still happening

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
No, don't pop up on my thing

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
It's still happening

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Actually no, Tekken Cross Street Fighter

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Is supposed to be better than Street Fighter Cross Tekken

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Because I have more faith in Namco

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Than Capcom right now

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Well I guess they recently revealed that Akuma

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
Is going to be joining the Tekken 7 cast

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
I don't know anything about these games

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Just sound like you do

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
I totally know everything about

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
I did see Street Fighter

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
At the PlayStation experience, I saw a little bit of the

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Tournament

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
Did you see the Street Fighter movie?

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
I did watch the movie

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
So I'm very well informed now

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Although I did see that movie

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
I just don't play fighting games that much

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
People were wondering if

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
They were still going to make

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Oh wait is it

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
So they're still making that one

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
The quote here is from

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Senior designer Michael Murray

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Said, it's still in development

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
That's the quote

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Please look forward to it

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
It's been a period to launch the game

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Since Tekken 7 was released

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
For the moment we are focused on Tekken 7

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
But he says it's still in development

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
But we might recycle the engine and use it

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
For Tekken Cross Street Fighter

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
As Capcom did with Street Fighter 4

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
But it seems like there's been a lot of fighting games

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Doing well lately it seems like

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Especially on PlayStation 4

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
I would be curious about

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
I think that could be interesting

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Who do I have to sleep with

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
For Capcom vs SNK to happen again

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
That's the one that I want more than anything

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
I want to play Tekken 7

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Because they have a really hot character

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
In it named Shaheen

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
He is super good looking

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Shaheen? What?

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
He's the Middle Eastern fighter

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Yes he is

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
He is super gorgeous

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
I'll tell you what impressed me about that one

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Is that they actually did interview

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
People from the region he's supposed to be from

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
To make an accurate character

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Doing their research

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Indeed doing their homework

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Being ethnically sensitive

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter was first revealed

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
In 2010 or unveiled whatever

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
Alongside Street Fighter Cross Tekken

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Street Fighter Cross Tekken took only two years

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Afterwards to come out

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
This has been going almost six years

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
What are we going to get first?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Let's say but what will we get first?

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Okay here we go

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Will we see

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Tekken Cross Street Fighter

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Kingdom Hearts 3

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Or Final Fantasy 15

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
15 first

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Then Kingdom Hearts 3 we've seen enough of

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
That we know it's going to come out eventually

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
I got one more

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
The Final Fantasy 7 Remake

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Episode 1

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
I bet it will come out before all those other ones

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Probably so

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
You think Final Fantasy 7 Episode 1 is going to be first?

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
I think it will be before 15

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
You guys are high

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
I think Final Fantasy 15 is the first

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
15 they have to put a whole game out

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
7 Remake Episode 1

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
You guys are high

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
I think it's going to be

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
That's wishful thinking

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
It's going to be Final Fantasy 15

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Then the 7 Remake

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
And Dark Dead Studio you can time stamp this

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
For Shane to play later when I'm wrong

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
It's fine

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
But it's going to be 15 first then the 7 Remake

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Then Tekken Cross Street Fighter

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
No then Kingdom Hearts

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Because we've seen footage of Kingdom Hearts

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
When's the last time you saw Tekken Cross Street Fighter

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Never

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I saw Tekken 7 footage and you know they're just going to shove

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Chun Li into Tekken 7's engine

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
That's what's going to happen

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
That sounds gross

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Well he did recently mention

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
It is quote, pretty far

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
In development

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
They drew the logo

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
Hold on we have to do this again

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
What do we have now?

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
We have Tekken Cross Street Fighter

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Final Fantasy 7 Remake Episode 1

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Final Fantasy 15

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Kingdom Hearts 3

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And you ready for one more?

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Half Life 3

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
That doesn't even count that's a myth

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
But no Last Guardian

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Where does that fall?

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
After Final Fantasy 15

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Before 7's Remake

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
No Man's Sky

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Alright

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
That's enough

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
I forgot about that game

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
Because it's never coming out

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
I swear they're trying to

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Wedge that into VR somehow

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Probably

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Oh my gosh that'd be fun

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Dark Tetsuya sums up

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
This segment perfectly by saying

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Oh for fuck's sake

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
That's something I would

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Expect Dark Sakura to sigh over there in the corner

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I would say

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
For fuck's sake but I don't give a fuck

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
I'm looking at Buzzfeed

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Y'all can just keep arguing about whatever

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
I feel like

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Oh these top 25

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
gifts from Game of Thrones that showed when I

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
didn't give a fuck like is that what you're looking at right now?

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
No I'm actually looking at

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
this picture of gorillas

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
inserted into

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
The

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
The Force Awakens

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
I know how she feels

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Alright

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
All joking aside I feel like this should be a segment

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Because I feel like Loki would have a lot of fun with this

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Like what will happen first

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
This

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
This or Half Life 3

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
And that should be the

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
We're gonna play this more often

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Maybe we can get a game

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
widget on the site

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Maybe Bobby will have another rainy day project there

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
We can have a

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
This, this or Half Life 3 what's gonna happen first

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
You know what I just thought of an idea of a segment

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Just now

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Da fuck is that

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Where we get the weirdest of all weird

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Vaguely video game related things

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
And just say da fuck is that

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
We can start with that dish you have

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
that came with the Dreamcast game

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
Da fuck is that

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Oh that's just Japanese marketing

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Alright

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Ikuma-san tell us

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
Don't like isn't it a really big thing to have weird

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
collector's editions of everything

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
popular in Japan

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Some

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Some folks in chat are very supportive about the

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
new segment idea we might have to make that happen

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Tigerclass says I'm surprised you guys didn't do

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
a list list for what you want to see happen in 2016

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
You know that actually was on the agenda for tonight

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
when I thought Loki was still gonna be here

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
I didn't want to do it without him so we'll probably roll that over to next

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
week so plus we're actually

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
We're already at 8 o'clock and haven't even taken a break yet

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
I'm hungry

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
Alright well let's quickly then talk

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
about Killer Instinct a fighting game

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
which none of you have mentioned

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
I did

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Yeah god you don't pay attention

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
Yes he just mentioned it

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Honorable mentions

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
I know

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I said season

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
I said season 2 was like an honorable mention

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Okay so what's gonna happen

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
first the Final Fantasy 7 remake

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Half Life 3 or Rob

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
listens to Shane

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
It's not the last one

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
So anyway

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
well alright then since Shane is hanging

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
on everything this game does Killer Instinct

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
will be bringing a combo assist

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
mode to the game I guess to make

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
pulling off combos in the game a little easier

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
so you can button mash even more

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
to your heart's content but the good news is

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
the old way of doing combos will still work

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
for those of you guys that got used to it

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
so assisted

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
combos basically you tap a second attack button

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
during the cancel window of a first

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
and that will transition your character into a

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
special move after that another

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
button press will do an auto double

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
now that's already in the game but yet another

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
will do an auto linker and then ending

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
the combo it's as easy as forward

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
and doing a heavy punch or kick and they

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
they have some visuals and I'm sure this will be

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
in the game to be explained as well but they're

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
making comboing in Killer Instinct a lot

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
easier and all joking aside with

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
me listening or not listening to Shane

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Shane did convince me

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
to pick up I think it's

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Season 2 I got on Xbox One

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Cinder, that's all you need is Cinder

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
and I've been having fun with that

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
it's a good fighting game

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
and they did such a better job with Season 2

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
with the story mode because

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
it's actually like interesting

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
whereas Season 1 was really dull

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
and bare bones

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
alright the combo assist coming

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
to Killer Instinct in their next update

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
which I don't think is dated as

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
of yet but I imagine it's in the coming days probably next

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
month alright so

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
let's get to a time when

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
games they didn't get these regular

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
monthly updates

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
you had a cartridge and that was

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
it take it or fucking leave it

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
it's the classic game of the

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
week Dark Sakura

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
she don't give a fuck about these new

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
games so she's gonna

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
go into the gaming vault

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
she's gonna go into the gaming vault and find

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
a game that she thinks hey

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
you kids should all be playing this game this week

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
Dark Sakura what is the classic

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
game of the week

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
I think you should let the video answer that question for us

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
there you go I have to hit play that helps

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
huh?

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
well

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
well done

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
I picked

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Kirby's Avalanche because yes I've already done

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Puyo Puyo and I've mentioned

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Mean Bean Machine in that segment

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
but I wanted to do Kirby's Avalanche in particular

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
because it is my favorite of all the Puyo Puyo games

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
it was my introduction

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
to Puyo Puyo and I think a lot of people

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
stateside who didn't follow the import scene

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
really I think it was this or Dr. Robotnik's

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Mean Bean Machine so it's a fair pick

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
exactly and also

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
I did it in honor of

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Act Deft for sending me

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
the delicious gift of his

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Oreos that Dan and I might have eaten all of

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
if you find more

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
I will seriously do another trade with you

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
and I will send you those

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
rich cream flavored

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Oreo things

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
and I found the blueberry cheesecake one so I'll send you

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
those too this is like a million more Kirby

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
games she can make the classic game of the week so there you go

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
I've done other Kirby games

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
there's still more I bet

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
like Act Deft

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
like has pictures of Dark Sakura

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
by his bed not in a creepy way but

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
just like cause he loves her so much for all the

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Kirby games she always picks

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
that's still in a creepy way if they're by the bed

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
hey I'm allowed to be worshipped

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
no

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
that would be in a closet with candles

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
that you'd have to have like a double door

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Act Deft take pictures of you trying to make cookies

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
actually

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
I'll just settle for more cookies cause those

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
were amazing

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
short tangent

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
Dan who's like stop buying cookies

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
why do we have all these cookies he's like

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
oh my god those are the best cookies I've ever eaten in my life

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
how dare any human say to

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
another stop buying cookies

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
what kind of is this fascism

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
I married that I love you Dan

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
hearts

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
anyway Kirby's Avalanche

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
was known in Europe as

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Kirby's Ghost Trap

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
and it is of course a puzzle game that was done

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
by HAL Laboratory

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
and by HAL because high is Puyo Puyo

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
and bad presto

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
it came out on February 1st

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
1995 in Europe

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
so it came out in Europe first

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
and April 25th 1995 in North America

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
which I actually got this game

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
right after my birthday

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
right after I graduated

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
high school

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
it is basically the Western

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
release of Super Puyo Puyo

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
and technically the 4th Kirby game

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
that was released for the Super Nintendo

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
basically

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
I mean it really is just Puyo Puyo

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
you have two colored blobs

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
that fall from the top of the screen

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
and you gotta rotate them and match them up

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
and once you get 4 or more of the same color touching

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
they'll disappear and the blobs from above

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
will fall down and you can do

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
combos that way and drop like big

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
like kinda clear-ish rock

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
blobs on whoever you're playing against

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
so you have a

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
storyline for this

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
and basically

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
it has almost the same

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
storyline for Super Puyo Puyo

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
so basically

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
King Dedede

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
challenged Kirby and

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
all the other people who live in Dreamland

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
to an avalanche competition

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
at the Fountain of Dreams and Kirby

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
says you know what I'm gonna do this

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
although Kirby's kind of a

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
dick to Wispy Woods come to think of it

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
cause like Wispy Woods

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
is like hey don't step on my

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
root and Kirby's like bitch

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
I'm stepping on your root

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
oh yeah we'll play avalanche then

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
or Puyo Puyo

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
so yeah

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I think Dark Soccer should explain lots of games

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
bitch

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
I'm gonna step on your root

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Kirby was kind of a dick to

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Wispy Woods

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
by the way there's this little gif going around

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
of Wispy Woods all decorated for Christmas

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
and Kirby going

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
his little sucky thing and turning into

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
a Christmas tree

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
Kirby as Bayonetta

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
is really effing adorable

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
just so we're clear

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Kirby does suck

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
literally that's his power

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
is sucking

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
who can make sucking be so cool

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
why did he just say before he challenged Wispy Woods

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
he says I like apple pie

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
that's what he said

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
yeah he was like don't tread on my roots

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
yeah the tree was like don't tread on my roots

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
and Kirby was like I like apple pie

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
that made no sense

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
yeah

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
anyway

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
there are some differences

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
so with Super Puyo Puyo

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
it basically was Arl

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
and carbuncle

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
the big Puyo Puyo characters

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
basically going through

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
all of the story

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
challenging different characters

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
the Kirby's avalanche

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
it was all the typical Kirby characters

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
and the game did come out

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
much later in the Super Nintendo

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
so it had really

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
great colors

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
the music was good and did you hear

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
how good the voice was

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
the digitized

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
voice in this is great

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
the last Metroid is in captivity

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
the galaxy is at peace

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
well

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
at any rate though

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
this version

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
all the music in it was original

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
all Kirby-ish music

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
except the panic music

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
oh no

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
it's another interlude

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
who blocked the path with this boulder

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
your road to glory ends here

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
oh hi are you ready

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
for a game of avalanche

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
I love this story

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
I like gumdrops and cake

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
no he didn't say that but he might as well

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
well they kind of do look like gumdrops

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
falling through the sky

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
there's one track from Puyo Puyo left

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
and that's the panic music

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
that's what it's about to do

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
but you're about to die anyway

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
so it's got the cinematics

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
as you can see

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
and

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
basically this is probably some of the

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
most conversation that you get out of

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Kirby in a game

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
and yeah as you can see

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
he comes off a little bit dickish

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
a little bit more confrontational

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
he's a wee bit of a twat

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
does he talk in any other games?

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
I

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
don't know a ton about Kirby

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
because I only played the first couple games

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
but does he talk?

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
not very much

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
but he is a bit of a tit

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
the only dark soccer

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
I could get away with saying that

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
well Kirby he is a bit of a tit

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
anyway you can also

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
find the game on Wii Virtual Console

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
it came out in 2007 in July

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
um

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
and uh oh actually

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I take that back in North America it came out September 24th

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
for 800 Wii points

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
and it is identical

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
to the original game except

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
that it has a cheat code that you

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
can get after completing competition mode

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
um

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
so that was pretty cool but Kirby's Avalanche is

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
you know

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
I actually I have to read this quote because

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
GamePro said it great

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
um although Kirby's Avalanche

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
is a rehash of a

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
dick

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
so he challenges this

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
broom and like I can't believe

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
I've got to clean up this entire forest

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
and then Kirby goes well you better clean up your

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
avalanche skills first

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
yeah what a dick

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
yeah

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
so anyway um I just like the way that this

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
is was said

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
although Kirby's Avalanche is a rehash

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
of an overdone puzzler theme

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
it's so well done that it's worth playing

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
that is if you don't already have three

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
puzzle games just like it

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
I think that is actually while it's

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
an interesting description for it

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
I think that Kirby's Avalanche especially

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
since we didn't get any other

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
P.O.P.O. games that I'm aware of in the U.S.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
apart from Dr. Robotnik's

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Mean Bean Machine

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
that this was something that's absolutely

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
uh a must buy

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
for uh

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
for people with the Super Nintendo

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
or you know

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
other things

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
on the Wii Virtual Console

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
um but absolutely worth it

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
in fact if you can the cartridge as I'm aware

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
actually I think goes for some money

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
now um but if you can

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
find it definitely get it it's

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
totally worth

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
having in your collection and it

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
is very challenging even in

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
easy mode it can get really difficult so

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
go for it

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
it's Kirby's Avalanche

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
there it is your classic game of the week

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Kirby's Avalanche

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
and to sum that all up

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
DarkTetsuya in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000

in part B so we're gonna fast forward part B

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
and get to your calls when we

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
of Orange Lounge Radio right after this

episode number 625

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
if you can believe it already

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
in progress for this December the 27th

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
of 2015 the last

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Orange Lounge Radio of

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
2015 and

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Loki not here tonight as he had a family

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Sakura however joining me in studio

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
as well as our frequent

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
guest host and we love having him here Shane and

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Flaco Jones your collection's being ogled

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
yes uh Allen said Flaco go

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
look at the collection so he's in the other room checking

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
that out now uh because the

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
first half I'm using my

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
quotey fingers of our show actually ran for

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
over two hours which doesn't usually happen

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
uh and we're gonna make a small edit to our

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
flow and we're actually gonna be

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
because a lot of our news stories that we had in part B

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
were kinda not

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
huge news yeah cause

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
cause you know it's been a slower news week

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
we're actually gonna fast forward the show a little bit

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
so we can get to your calls and actually Dark Sakura

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
has to leave here

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
anyway yes cause I have to go to work

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
so I'm gonna be left without Loki and Dark

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Sakura and I can't

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
just be left alone with Shane to run the show

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
well you won't be just alone with Shane

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
that's true we'll have Flaco he'll help me out but

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
I'll be here we will be hiding under your bed

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
we just realized that our microphone

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
colors are one of the Splatoon matchups we

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
get all the time macaroni and cheese versus dark blue

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
oh my gosh alright and

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
as you probably heard in the first half of the show

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
uh Splatoon topping

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
uh both Jim and

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Shane's uh top games

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
of uh 2015 their favorites

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
and uh I don't know the top best

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
favorite top best most favoritest

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
um and I don't I don't think there was really any

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
game all three of us had on list so we really

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
couldn't come to a consensus so

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
cause like we both

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
had rocket league we both had everybody's gonna

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
the rapture you guys both had Splatoon

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:33.000
and until dawn until dawn

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Jamie had to be unique that's okay

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:37.000
mine was legitimate

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Rob so was mine

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.000
legitimately mine was legitimate

02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:43.000
leer

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.000
words so we're gonna go right into

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:47.000
some more news with dark

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Sakura well you

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
know um there'd been this uh

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:53.000
patent suit going on about

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.000
the Miis um there was a company

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000
called

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.000
Recogni Corps who was suing Nintendo

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:01.000
because they said it violated

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
their uh patent

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
for storing facial sketch data

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:07.000
um when Nintendo

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.000
started making the MiI characters

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:11.000
well the uh

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
uh Judge Jones

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:15.000
who was in charge of the case

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:17.000
was like um

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:19.000
yeah no not really this is completely

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
different and Nintendo didn't

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.000
uh infringe on any uh

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
copyright so

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
of course they're very

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:29.000
happy with the uh

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
with the ruling and

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
um we don't know if uh Recogni

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Corps will uh

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
appeal cause they can still appeal

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
but chances

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
are I mean the hope is that they won't

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:43.000
because I mean

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Nintendo's got got the power

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
and it is quite different

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:49.000
than their method

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
their version was

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
um

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:55.000
more of from what I can

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:57.000
understand just storing data

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
to apply where Nintendo's

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:01.000
is actually

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:03.000
picking presets and putting them in

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
place so I mean if you really had

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.000
to do that for the MiI you'd have to do

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
that for any type of video game character

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
creation you know character creation

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
so yeah they they didn't really

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
have anything to stand on

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
As we see a lot of times

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
in these patent infringement suits

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
where it's like there may be

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:23.000
this one little derivative but

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
on the whole it's a completely different thing we see

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:27.000
this happen in gaming like a lot but

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:29.000
patent law it's complicated yo

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
and uh I don't think I've heard a lot you know

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
with all the talk and buzz about 2016

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:35.000
presidential elections maybe I've

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
missed it because people are talking about a lot of

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.000
stuff but I'm not really

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:41.000
hearing anybody talking about patent

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:43.000
reform and I guess maybe because that's not

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
you know people want to hear more about I don't know

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
healthcare or international

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
conflict and so forth but

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
I don't know I'd be curious to hear what

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
maybe some of these candidates want to do about

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
patent law and trademark

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:57.000
and some of that in this country because

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
the rules were not written in an internet

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.000
age and it's very obvious but anyhow

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
uh I

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.000
guess these patent things though for the

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:07.000
time being they're still going to continue and

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.000
that's why these companies have very large legal departments

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
indeed they do they

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
sure do alright let's

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
get into the FUs

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
of the week every week

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
uh we rant here a little bit on this show

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
why well uh because we can

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
sometimes we get angry

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:33.000
here is punishment

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
here

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
this is fucked up

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
dark soccer

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
um FU

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
to just how early

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:45.000
I have to be up in the morning

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:47.000
and I do like

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.000
having my week split kind of

02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:51.000
with the two separate days off because

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:53.000
it makes my weeks feel shorter at the

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
same time I don't feel like

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.000
I get enough rest on my day off so just FU

02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:59.000
be tired and sore

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000
and heavy so that's it

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000
and having to leave the show earlier

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.000
because I miss having

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
my Mondays as my day off

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
and your schedule

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:11.000
changes every few months so this won't last forever

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.000
yeah but part of me does

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
like though having to be split up so it all depends

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
you know honestly enough

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
if I worked on Sunday and kept

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
my same early shift

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
I would definitely be able to get to the show

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:25.000
and I'll have to

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:27.000
stay safe alright

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
uh I have two FUs this week before we get to my guests

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.000
my first one goes to my neck

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
it's still been like really sore ever since

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
you know that fall it was probably like three weeks ago right

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.000
now I've got this I probably have

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
even dark soccer I feel this because she probably knows more about

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.000
this stuff than I do I have this weird like bump

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:43.000
thing on the back of my neck

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:45.000
you feel that dark soccer right

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
hold on she's I'm getting a medical

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
exam here at Live Institute it's right

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
here yeah you

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
feel that isn't that weird

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
yeah now yeah that's what

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
it could be a cyst or something in there so

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:59.000
that's just great so FU to that

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
cause it's causing me like increased neck pain

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
it's horrible I would honestly

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:05.000
enough get that seen

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:07.000
yeah no I know I need to be a completely benign cyst

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:09.000
but it could also be um swelling

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.000
on the tendon itself yeah

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
no I know I need to get it seen but then here's the other

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:15.000
crappy thing my insurance completely

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:17.000
changes the first of the year so if I see

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:19.000
somebody now it's gonna be

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
something yeah exactly so good urgent

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.000
care yeah it might be what I have to do

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
which is if I didn't have another

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:27.000
stuff and I am not

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.000
a doctor but I was a massage therapist

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:31.000
for quite a while probably gonna wanna

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
ice that yeah good

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:35.000
times in 10 minute in no longer

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:37.000
than 10 minute increments and that would be

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.000
every hour I've had this for like

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:41.000
four days though

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
but anyway I know

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:47.000
I'm gonna say this now if ever you think

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
you have any kind of health

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.000
problem and something that

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
your body is doing abnormally if it

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
does not go away within a couple

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
of days get it seen

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
well I was hoping it would go away I keep

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
convincing myself it's getting smaller but anyway

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
not every problem goes away by ignoring

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
it some do

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
aren't you leaving no I'm just kidding

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
you know what I have

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:11.000
you're number one

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
in my book

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
she gave me a one finger to show me how much she loves me

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
alright moving on we got more FUs

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Flocko

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
let's see FU2 oh yeah

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
you know you can connect your phone

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
on a little cord in your car

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
I don't know who else does that I do

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
charge you the phone and please use it

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
well mine keeps saying unsupported

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
version it's super annoying

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
happens all the time

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
yeah iPhone

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
alright I think it's dirty but

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
I always have to clean the dumb thing out

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
anyway are you using an official cable

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
yes

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
yeah it's weird I think it's my car

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
I probably just need to update the

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
firmware on my car but FU

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
it could be I have a loose connection

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
with the cord because it's been ripped out by my

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
fat foot so many times that I think

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
it's the car plug not the phone plug

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
that's causing me problems

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
yeah I think it might be the car plug

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
or like I said I've never updated the car's firmware

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
which I'm sure you could do if you plug a USB

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
god that's so weird I gotta update the car's

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
firmware I need to update the firmware on my TV

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
gotta download the new car

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
and I know that's a big thing with like Tesla's now

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
and a lot of other new vehicles

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
it's like you know I gotta

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
my car is gonna

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
evolve like it's a Pokemon overnight

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
while it's plugged in I have a super old TV

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
and when I got a PS4 it looked terrible on there

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
I had to update the firmware because it was

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
downgrading the graphics

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
it was really strange that's so weird to me

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
yeah my TV

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
is an internet TV so I had to

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
download it from the internet put it on the thumb drive

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
and then plug the thumb drive into the USB port

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
on the TV and then it like magically worked

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
it's funny if you take that the other way

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
we were using

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
these LCD monitors

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
with our Atari 5200

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
and it didn't look

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
nearly as I mean it was

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
crisp but it didn't look nearly as good as it would

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
on an old CRT

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
I think that's still the case yeah

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
it just looks terrible

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
and last but not least Shane you're FU of the week

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
FU2 the local targets

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
for not having the two Power Ranger toys I've been

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
looking for and they're all over like

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
the south and the east coast but

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
somehow just not over here yet and it's

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
making me really annoyed

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Shane I will tell you something

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
put it into order and have them deliver it local

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
they can't even order it

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
it's not on the website if you even

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
look it up on my little brick seek thing

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
it has the price

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
but if you usually put items in there

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
it'll say the name and the picture

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
doesn't even do that yet

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
so it's almost like it's a placeholder

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
but it's what shows if they have it or not

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
I am really surprised you haven't just driven

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
to Southern California

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
it was in Burbank so

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
and I don't put it past you to drive

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
to LA for a freaking Power Rangers toy

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
let me know what they are

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
there is a target near Disneyland

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
and I will make every attempt to stop

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
at that target for you and look for your

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Power Rangers toys

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
I will hit you up on that probably

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
that is true it's right there on

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
what is that Harbor? Catalla?

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
the one right before you hop back on five

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
I will go look right now on my phone

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
to see if they even have it

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
I know you are not going right now

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
but you could tomorrow

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
you could go to the target and then

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
you could see Victoria who lives right there

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
such a long drive for one day

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
it is

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
but I would still do it

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
it's Power Rangers Shane

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
we are going to get to the FUGA

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
question of the week in just a moment

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
but I do want to do one quick news story here

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
and this is about a game I think

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
they end up on Flaco's 2016

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
best games list it might be too soon

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
to tell but Uncharted 4

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
a thief's end

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
now PlayStation they ran on their

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
official blog this week a little

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
update on Uncharted 4

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
and they said hey good news we are wrapping up

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
production and it is shaping up to be the proper

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
send off for Nathan Drake that we promised you

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
the bad news

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
we need more time in the new release date

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
is April 26th 2016

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
so they have pushed it back a little

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
more to 4-26-2016

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
that's a lot of

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
March 23rd so like another month

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
they did the same to The Last of Us right towards the end

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I think it was going to come out April

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
oh no it's going to be May something

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
or maybe it was May and then they pushed it to June

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
I don't remember

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
so at this point is there really a big difference between March and April

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
probably not and if that's what they need to make the

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
game right then go ahead

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
but I wonder how much

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
my birthday is in April and that makes it important

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
actually my sister's birthday by the way

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
oh there you go so then this

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
can make the perfect present for both of you

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
reverse present

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
she doesn't play video games

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
reverse present media on Uncharted

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
my half birthday was yesterday

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
what did I get for a reverse present

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
I don't know

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
I never actually purchased an Uncharted game before

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
I always just rent them, play through them and then be done with it

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
I don't like

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
goodbye

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
I don't like shooters

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
so I just like to play the story

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
and then be done with it

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
so what you're telling me is you're going to wait for this to be free on Playstation Plus

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
that is what happened with the other one

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
yeah that would take a long time

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
3 took a while to come

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
I bet the trilogy will be

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
the Playstation Plus game in April leading into this

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
that would be great what a great idea

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
found it

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
and for the record those toys are not there yet

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
I'm trying to do my stuff

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
I know

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
I know alright

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
let's get to the FUGL question

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
FUGL question of the week

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
every week we ask a question of you guys on our

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
Facebook and our Google Plus community

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
communities and we read

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
some of your answers right here right now

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
is there no other place you want to be

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Rob?

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
he said right here right now

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
we're going to read the answers

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
I know you're singing a song over there

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
you think you're so funny I'm hilarious

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
alright

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
this week

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
since obviously we knew we were going to be talking about

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
the best games of 2015 tonight

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
we decided to ask you guys on our social

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
community what is your

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
favorite game of

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
2015

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
let's get to Andy R. who starts off

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
on Facebook saying super beat

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Zonic

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
fighting words I guess

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
everybody's entitled to their opinion

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
I don't have to respect anybody's opinion

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
first of all and secondly

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
it's fine there are some positives

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
it just is a disappointment

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
alright so Andy R. says

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
this really was the year of rhythm games for me

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
I got seven rhythm games on Vita

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
three on PS4, one on 3DS just this year

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
as a big DJ Max fan

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
Zonic might be my favorite of those

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
but overall those eleven games

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
really defined my gaming year

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
I have to be honest I didn't realize there were that many music games

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
that released this year there was Persona 4, Dancing All Night

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
which was really good, Super Beat Zonic

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
like a couple

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
whatever the fake chick is

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
what's her name?

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
Hatsune Miku?

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
yeah I think she had a few games

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
Parappa came back out

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
alright anyway

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
moving on Redertainment says

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
Destiny begun under good intentions

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
with lots of promise, lots of expectation

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
and lots of anticipation

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
after spending some time digging into the experience

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
of it many outside observers

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
found it to be disappointing

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
nitpicking the details of it in ways that are completely annoying

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
however somebody with an insider's perspective

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
knows it was still a good experience

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
the entire thing wasn't all bad

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
especially compared to the experience of others

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
it's all just a matter of perspective

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
also the future of it holds the possibility

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
for a richer experience

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
very similar to when I named the Diablo expansion

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
one of my favorites one year

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
the fact that Destiny

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
not to alter Redertainment's answer

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
but he would probably mean

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
Destiny of the Taken King

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
the expansion that kind of changed a lot

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
some year-end lists

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
I've seen that too

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
Dart Tetsuya says gotta give it to Splatoon

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
never expected Nintendo to take a shot

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
at the team-based shooter genre and put a fun twist on it

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
I also really dug the Surf City vibe

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
in the visuals and music

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Shane really likes that too

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
he listens to the soundtrack of this game

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
Fifth Dream says

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
I have to say Fallout 4

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
while I played a lot of games this year

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
probably more than ever in my 30 plus years of gaming

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
nothing in a long time held my attention

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
for an entire month straight

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
like Fallout 4 did

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
there's a lot of people that are saying Fallout 4

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
I know you are not alone with that

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
let's see, going to

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Fabrice A who says

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Assassin's Creed Syndicate

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
I gave the series another chance because I'm into the Victorian era

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
was not disappointed

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
nice mood and I like the protagonist a lot

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
Mike B says

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
Star Wars Battlefront Xbox One

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
awesome game

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
they got this one right

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
The movie was awesome

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
William Murderface says

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Witcher 3

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
I love RPGs with stories

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
that you can actually affect with small decisions

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
and this one more than any other

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
that I have ever played allowed this

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
and even encouraged it

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
the choices were also given in such a way

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
that you could not be sure which provided

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
the desired outcome which added suspense

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
and tension to the experience

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
this to me makes this game more than the game of the year

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
it makes it the best game of the last 10 years

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
to me it set the new mark

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
to which I will measure all other RPGs

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
that is quite the praise

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
for Witcher 3, there's a lot of people

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
loving Witcher 3

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
Renji221 says

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
I'm going to have to go with WWE 2K16

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
since the game is almost better

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
in every way than the game last year was

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
since the roster is bigger

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
and career mode is better

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
Hitstun says

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
Splatoon gets my vote too

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
leave it to Nintendo to fix the problems

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
I have with shooters on console

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
it's bright, it's colorful, the motion controls

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
are almost as good as keyboard and mouse

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
squid mode makes movement fun

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
and I actually don't miss voice chat

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Undertale is a close second place

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
super don't miss voice chat except for like

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
when we're playing Twin Squad

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
but that's skypable

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
I just like doing the booyahs a lot anyway

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
and I'm laughing to myself

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
at the imagery of driving down

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
the freeway really fast too

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:09.000
the Splatoon soundtrack

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
which sounds just like that by the way

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
I was one of the singers

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
it's like K.K. Snyder music

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
for a second I thought they were in the room with us

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
what's going on?

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
it's like I'm really playing Splatoon

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
it's like a really bad drag impression

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:27.000
alright

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
let's go over to Google Plus

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
where Popper starts us off

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
on Google Plus saying

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Rise of the Tomb Raider is the game

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
I waited all year for

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
and it was well worth it

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
Act F says two gaming things

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
to find my year both from Nintendo

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
I said one

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
who said you got two

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
when everybody else gets one?

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
put the coin to read which one then

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
well I'll read the first one because you'll agree with it

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
Splatoon from the single player

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
to multiplayer I've had

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
so many experiences both good and bad

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
from it and of course Amiibo

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
not only collecting but being part of

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
local hunters and training community

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
participating and hosting tournaments

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
well I'll give

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Act F the other one he's been a long time supporter

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
of the show my game of the year

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
though goes to Undertale

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
that game is unique and quite amazing

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
and everyone should play it and the soundtrack is

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
one of the best there is out there

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
he also did apologize for the long response

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
so fair enough

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
I do want to play Undertale but when will I ever

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
come to console?

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
Undertale's appeal at all

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
you do that a lot with games

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
I watched the opening

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
and I thought it looked amazing

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
like when you first meet Flowey

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
I kept trying to watch it on Twitch because I was like

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
oh my god Undertale's like okay what is this

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
and I could not find one that looked interesting

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
that's probably just the Twitch people

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
are not interesting but anyway

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
not all I'm sorry

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
I didn't just diss every single person

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
on Twitch just the ones at that moment

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
that Shane was looking

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
not leastly Prince Peach Fuzz

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
I do love that name it's one of my favorite

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
handles on the show

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
says PT

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
someone had to say it

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
thank god someone went there

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
that'll be an honorable mention every year

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
I think it should every year on this show

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
at the end we all say

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
in unison and PT

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
until Silent Hills comes out

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
or whatever they call it

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
well not Silent Hills whatever Kojima can make with his new company

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
well let's hear Prince Peach Fuzz's rationale

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
PT

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
partially because it was the only game

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
I was able to beat this year

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
as well

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
well that's a great accomplishment with that ending part

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
and an excellent experience

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
I'd like to give Metal Gear Solid 5

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
an honorable mention

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
that's so funny I'm sorry

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
I'm not laughing at Metal Gear Solid 5

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
because obviously a lot of people love that game

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
but I'm laughing at the fact that you put the Konami demo

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
above like what's probably going to be

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
their last AAA game they ever release

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
that's not soccer

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
so I don't think they'll do soccer anymore

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
alright

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
there it is

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
Google question of the week thanks to all you guys for answering

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
love hearing the diversity there

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
but definitely sounds like we probably heard Splatoon

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
from more people than anybody tonight

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
but Undertale a lot a lot of people as well

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
so I would say that seems to be the number one and two across the board

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
but we'll see what Loki says when he gets back next week

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
I have a feeling neither of those games

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
are on his list

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
maybe Splatoon maybe

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
act deft in our chat over at live.voggenetwork.com

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
encouraging Shane Undertale is a game you need to

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
experience yourself

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
so maybe you just need to

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
I don't want to

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
I want to but they won't let me because it's not on console

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
I don't have a PC

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
maybe that'll be a big E3 land for somebody

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
they're going to get Undertale

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
but it was all made in Game Maker

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
like it was made in one of those construction set type of things

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
and it's huge

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
I'm kind of surprised somebody isn't trying to throw that guy

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
a bunch of money to port it

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
or do yeah I don't know we'll see we'll see

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
alright well we would do

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
the mail bag usually but unfortunately

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
we got no emails this week

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
alright I understand y'all were busy because of the holidays

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
but now that you have time

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
to calm down from your food comas

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
and your gift givings and all that

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
you need to email us

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
make sure you lend your voice

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
to the program again that's participate

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
at orangeloungeradio.com

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
I have an unfinished draft

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
in my email

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
to send to you

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
I have to remember now

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
I think it's about couch co-op games

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
I don't even remember specifically what I was going to talk about

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
I have to look at my draft again

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
if it was couch co-op it was probably going to be

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Rob you need to stop being so harsh on Splatoon

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
oh no I think it was

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
that's got the worst couch co-op mode

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
it's so bad

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
though I got my kids to play that

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
and they had a really good time with it

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
I think it was about

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
it was a Fugu question from forever ago

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
and nobody mentioned

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
Secret of Mana

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
and I was like

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
for me that's like the couch co-op

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
top of the pyramid for me

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
we did have a question on couch co-op a few weeks ago

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
it was a while ago

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
and that's like how could nobody mention this game

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
that's the thing that really got me into couch co-op

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
I remember we rented

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
a multi-tap adapter

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
from a video store

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
like 45 minutes away because I lived up in the boonies

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
so I had to drive to another different

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
part of also boonies

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
and get this thing and then we just kept

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
it forever and they kept calling

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
my roommate but they didn't

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
take a credit card so we pretty much just got to steal it

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
well then eventually he felt bad so he

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
went to go drop it off like

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
3 months later and they were out of business so

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
we got to keep it

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
yay stealing

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
but I just

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
loved it because it was just so fun to play with 3 people

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
yeah no

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
I never got to do the multi-tap thing

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
with that I don't even know if I ever played

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
with the multi-tap thing I never even played that game

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
really? man I love that game

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
well it was just kind of like

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
it was annoying with 2 people because you had to kind of switch

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
around and you had the third

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
that was always computer controlled and terrible

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
but when you had the third person

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
and we got a second

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
when I got a second roommate there

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
we had 3 of us living in one house

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
we beat the whole game with 3 people all the way

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
it's really kind of odd to me

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
in a way that they didn't really continue

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
the Mana series past I mean I know they had

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Secret of Evermore which was the

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
USA thing and it wasn't very well received

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
even though I think it was horribly

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
the Seiken Densetsu series still goes on

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
in Japan still today?

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
yeah there's a 9 phone version

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
I beat the DS version too

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
was it Legend of Mana on the DS?

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
you guys didn't let me finish there was 2nd Assistant 3 on Super Nintendo

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
I know and then there was Legend of Mana

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
on Playstation was fucking horrible

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
I'm sorry I hated the Playstation 1

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
it was the one on the DS it was something else of Mana

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
I played that one and I liked that one

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
I beat that entirely

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
while commuting on Muni

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
when I lived in San Francisco

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
yeah it was a good game

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
well let's do one more story for you guys

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
then we're going to open up the skype line over at 1877 Game OLR

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
or username on skype

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
Orange Lounge Radio

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
and I'm having to do the little rig that I did last week

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
but it should work fine tonight

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
we know from last week it worked ok

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
so let me talk about

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Diablo 3

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
and season 5 is coming out soon

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
for Diablo 3

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
and it sounds like patch 2.4 is going to coincide

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
with season 5

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
I don't know how many of y'all are still playing

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Diablo 3 or interested in all the games

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Shane are you going to come back to Diablo for season 5?

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
no why not?

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
I've got Xenoblade and

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
Splatoon and Heavensward

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
to play

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
and so every other game just kind of does not take precedent

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
alright well some big changes

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
first off seasonal

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
legendaries have been eliminated from

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
the game all new legendaries in

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
patch 2.4 will be available to everybody

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
whether you're participating in the season

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
or not which makes sense because that's what happens

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
on consoles and I should point out when we talk

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
about seasons this is only for the

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
PC consoles don't support seasons

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
because of the exploits that happen on

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
consoles because the console versions don't

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
have to always be online like the

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
PC version now what's interesting

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
is that now in the season journey

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
which is to encourage you to replay through the game

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
starting in chapter 3 some of the

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
objectives in the season journey will

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
reward you with two pieces

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
of one of your class

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
sets and that class set has been

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
pre-established so you

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
will get guaranteed a full

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
green season

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
class set for your character

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
by playing through the game so that's

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
really interesting you don't have

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
to grind for these drops anymore

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
if you want to get the other sets you do

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
but I find that very very interesting

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
and that's because also coming out with this

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
patch are going to be the new

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
dungeons that are geared specifically

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
for these gear sets

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
so that's going to be pretty interesting

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
I'm excited to play season 5

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
even if Shane is being a hater

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
but there are going to be new cosmetic rewards

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
as well there will be a

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
little companion that kind of looks like Groot

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
to me a little bit it's a little tree dude

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
a new little non combat pet

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
and I love the new frame the new frame

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
is really pretty it looks like the wicked queens mirror

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
or something there so

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
I like that so there you go

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
some things to look forward to

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
in Diablo 3 a game that's still

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
clicking along a few years

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
after the fact you know I praise Super Mario

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Maker and even Splatoon earlier

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
in the show for Nintendo still supporting

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
their games with regular patches

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
and so forth well after release

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
I understand Splatoon they've said don't expect

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
anymore after January although

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
I have a feeling the Splatfest might continue for a little bit

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
they said Splatfest is still going on

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
well that's good so that will be a thing still

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
but you know

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
they're probably not going to have all the frequent

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
updates they've been having but look at Diablo

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
you know how many years are we after release now

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
and they're still doing new stuff for it hopefully

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
another expansion my fingers are crossed

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
alright let's do it let's go to the

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
phones you can give us a call right now on

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
Skype orange lounge radio all one word

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
on Skype I actually don't think the 800 number

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
is working tonight because again I'm not able to

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
get in on PC so I can't

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
disable the spam guard that I usually

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
disable when we go on air because we get

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
a lot of spam

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
calls robo faxes and things like that

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
but it does look like we are getting a call

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
on Skype right now so we're going to get to

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
it here in the studio just takes me a little

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
longer to connect than usual

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
so oh

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
gosh and I did something weird on the

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
screen here but we're going to get to it

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
hi you're on orange lounge radio who's

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
this dammit I'm halfway

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
naked here

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
oh wait wait we can barely

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
hear you you said you're halfway naked

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
I am halfway naked Rob Roberts

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Jesus Christ dude so

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
okay so because I'm on the iPad

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
tonight I'm sending video

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
but that Ramy you don't have to send yours

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
back if you don't want to it's fine please

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
yeah cause um

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
I'd rather not

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
make Alan jealous

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
he's not here

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
what's on your mind tonight buddy

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
hey hey hey hey hey

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
hey hey what's up

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
buddy what's on your mind tonight

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
I kind of want to throw out there

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
like my top three games

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
but my top three

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
games are slightly different they're from a

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
mobile point of view because for the

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
last year all I've been able to do

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
is play mobile games

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
you know that's the story that a lot

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
of people have so I'm not totally surprised

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
to hear that and I even joked that

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
Ingress is probably going to end up on Loki's

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
top three although I don't know yet so we'll see

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
what is it what are three mobile games

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
we all need to be playing

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
well one thing about Ingress I have to put it back

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
on my phone cause I took it off for a while

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
then I'm like you know I'm going to have

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
to put it back

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
you never know that might be the way you get into

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Pokemon Go early

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
yeah pretty much

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
but um

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
let's go ahead and give

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
my number three my number three

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
is a game I've talked about

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
I've called about the show before

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
and I said it's a game that you have to check out

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
number three

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
is Love Live

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
School Idol Festival for Android

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
and iOS

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
you did mention that and I have to apologize I don't think

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
I ever did get around to playing it but I think I like

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
downloaded it so I got like you know

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
I got close

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
it is a fun game and what I like

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
is that this rhythm game

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
is pretty much identical to the original

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Japanese they

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
did have to tweak the story a little bit

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
because some people got offended

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
cause they were

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
alluding in the story to

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
same sex relationships and they didn't

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
want to freak people out

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
oh no what'll happen

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
cause we all know

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
Massachusetts fell into the ocean ever since they

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
legalized it however many years ago

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
yeah and a lot of

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
people decided to go ahead and download the

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
Japanese version so you know

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
either or make em happy

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
it's still a fun rhythm game

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
it's right up there

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
alright fair enough what's your number two

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
number two

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
is another mobile game

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
it's a game

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Alan plays

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
I see him pop up from time to time

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
and I give him lives when I need to

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
is it that Sailor Moon game?

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
yes Sailor Moon drops

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
he plays that a lot

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
my friend

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Yaten sits there and plays it

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
forever and ever

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
she played it to the point where she

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
unlocked a Christmas wallpaper

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
gave it to her wife Seiya

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
and when Seiya says she got it I was begging her for

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
if she could send a copy of it to me

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
so I could have it on both of my phones

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
that is so funny because

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
I didn't think Alan was connected

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
with other people on that and I even asked him

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
does it have like social interactions and stuff

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
I guess he finally hooked it up to Facebook and now

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
you can send each other lives and stuff that's great

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
alright

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
and then your number one

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
my number one game

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
is LBX

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Little Battlers Exchange for the

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
Nintendo 3DS

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
wow okay

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
what is it about this? I don't even know if I know this game

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
do you know this game Shane?

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
I've played it, I played a quick demo of it

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
alright well what is it about this game

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
well

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
it's what

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
as I like to call it

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
or some people might fan them

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
it's like this if you ever watch the anime

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
Angelic Lair or

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Gundam Build Fighters it's right up there

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
it's pretty much a time where

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
you buy like these custom

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
robo kits and you add weapons and armor

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
and you put them in little

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
cardboard arenas and you battle them back

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
and forth and it's an interesting storyline

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
where the main hero is looking to find his

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
father who originally created

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
the entire game genre

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
and so forth okay that sounds

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
kind of fun

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
yeah and as you're running around through the game

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
you're using your LBX to get

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
through certain areas

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
like if there's like traps and there's like

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
sentients you use your LBX

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
to battle the little robots to keep

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
going forward

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
ActDeft is giving some more insight in our chat room on this game

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
saying Nintendo promoted it during E3

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
but it didn't get that much publicity after

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
though it's based on an anime isn't it?

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
yeah that's correct I didn't notice

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
after the fact the anime is on its

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
season on Nicktoons as LBX

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
the original

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
anime is called

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Denkai Senkai Wars

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
which I have acquired and I will be watching

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
soon to check it out

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
and let's see Kaijuto you may have

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
won him over because he said oh yeah I forgot

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
about that game I wanted it so there you go

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
so reminding people yes that is a thing

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
I just love the fact

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
that you can just customize the character any way

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
you want and it's just

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
all the fight scenes are just pure action

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
oriented and when

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
you go through the same levels

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
to you know to build

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
your character up usually when you're

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
fighting the other person the levels

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
are usually within 2 to 5

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
of yours so it's not like you're

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
level 20 and you're going back to fight

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
the level 5 character again

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
right

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
alright so that sounds like some really

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
good time wasters for filthy

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
casuals I'm just kidding

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
yes and filthy casuals who at work

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
sit there and play Mario Kart 7

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
and Smash Brothers during the break in

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
the break room nice nice

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
that's how to do it

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
I was just poking fun because Zach Defton chat said

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Rama turned into a casual and made a face but said

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
JK so he didn't really mean it you know what

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
9 o'clock but I wanna see if we can squeeze in at least

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
one more call here on the show

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
so let's get to it I see another call coming

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
in so I'm gonna try to answer it here

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
and it does take another minute to connect

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
that it doesn't usually let's get to it hi

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Orange Lawn Tradio who's this?

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
Hey Akdef how you doing?

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
pretty great

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
what's on your mind?

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
well

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
I have already talked about Undertale that much

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
but

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
just a quick note

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
it has a demo so if Flacco

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
and Shane want to try it out

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
it has a demo on Undertale.com

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
so

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
you can try it out it isn't that

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
big of a mending game so

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
I'm pretty sure any PC can run it

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
I don't have APC

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
does it run on Macs at all?

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
it runs on Mac

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
so yeah

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
I have a really old Mac I wouldn't risk it

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
alright well you can try at least a demo

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
Shane you gonna still be a hater over there?

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
or you try a demo?

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
when am I gonna work in the time for a demo?

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
when are you gonna have the time for a demo in between all the

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Xenoblade and 14

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
and Toy Hunting

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
I know I know

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
well I don't know Akdef

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
I have the full game thanks to Dark Saga

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
so I do fully intend on trying it at some point

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
well it's a really great game

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
my number one but I'm gonna

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
I'm gonna take my number

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
my number three since I didn't mention

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
that over on the full question

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
what's that?

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
and it's Taiko no Tatsujin beta version

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
really?

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
yeah I really

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
really really love that game a lot

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
it's one of my

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
my favorite games of this year

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
and it pretty much gave

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
my beta a lot of life

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
so I'm

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
really really grateful about it

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
and I hope there's

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
new versions for the beta

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
or at least

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
new Taiko games coming out

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
and

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
again

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
it's a game that

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
I really really liked

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
and I still play it a lot

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
and if you know Taiko no Tatsujin

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
or Taiko Drone Master

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
it's pretty much the same game

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
it has some new things

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
like quest mode

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
it's like an RPG adventure

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
so it has that

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
it has multiplayer also

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
so it's a great game

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
probably not for everyone but

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
it's definitely my number three this year

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
wasn't there a 3DS one that

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
like was released

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
maybe I'm crossing wires here

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
maybe I'm thinking of the Vita one but I thought it was on 3DS

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
but I seem to remember talking about that one

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
but I know in

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
the Fugu question of the week

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
Andy Arde mentioned like 7 Vita games

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
were music games so

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
I'm sure Taiko no Tatsujin is one of them

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
so yeah that's pretty cool

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
that the Vita's kind of living

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
on with all these different music

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
games but it's interesting that they're all

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
overseas because we don't really get the Vita

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
support here in the US

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
that we do in other places

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
and like all these games are basically imports

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
except Shane was Super Beat Sonic

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
localized? That was a local release right?

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
cause DJ Max was

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
well only two DJ Max's were

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
sorry the one I remember

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
sorry three were

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
I can't count

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
yeah I actually got

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Super Beat Sonic this week because it

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
was cheap on Amazon

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
so yeah I'm gonna try that too

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
but yeah there was also a lot of

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
games, Persona 4, Dancing All Night

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
there was also

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
AIBT

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
which got really popular

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
when it got released so I really want to

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
try that one too

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
but yeah the Vita is getting

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
pretty much a niche

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
niche machine

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
it's getting a lot of

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
import releases and

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
it's a great console not

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
the best but it's great for

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
if you like

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
imports gaming

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
so yeah

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
I actually remember too that

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
since Dark Sakura talked about Puyo

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
or Kirby's Island launch today

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
I

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
need to get Tetris Puyo Pop

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
or Puyo Puyo

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
since that's an import

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
only and it has

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
a Vita release so yeah

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
yeah Puyo Puyo did have

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
a Vita release and I thought there was like a Puyo Puyo

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
versus something that came out on all those

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
handhelds as well like it was like two puzzle

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
games blended together but I don't remember

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
in the moment so

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
alright well thank you ACDEF

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000

Skype and Dark Tetsuya says

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Puyo Puyo cross Tetris

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
and Akuma

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
JP says there's so many Puyo

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
Puyo on mobile

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
I'm not surprised to hear that

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
actually I don't know do we have a lot of Puyo Puyo on

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
mobile here I think there's

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
at least one I think I've seen at least one

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
so anyway Orange Lounge

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Radio all one word on Skype if you

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
want to give us a call here in these closing minutes

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
of the show otherwise

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
I think we'll probably wrap up because we're getting to be after

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
nine o'clock on the west coast

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
we're getting to be hungry are you getting to be hungry

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
yes you making plans on where you're going to go eat

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
no not yet I haven't figured

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
out haven't figured that out yet alright

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
one more shout out for calls

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
and we'll probably wrap things up Orange Lounge Radio

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
all one word on Skype

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
week we will be here and

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
talking about whatever comes up in the next

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
week although I anticipate it's probably going to be another

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
slow news week so we will probably do some

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
sort of list list next week with

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
our predictions I'm sorry we didn't get to do that

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
tonight I know Flaco is looking

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
forward to that but that's okay I only do it

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
without I can just not be right this year

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
it's fine were you right

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
last year I don't know probably not

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
I have to go back and pull up like I've ever been right

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
yeah I was like

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
since it's super easy I thought that the Xbox

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
one would be like a hundred dollars with like a

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
like a service plan type thing

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
that's so wrong well you know

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
over there actually is an Orange Lounge

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Radio wiki where some of the inside

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
jokes and things are tracked you can see every

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
classic game of the week ever but

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
you can also see they actually have a page and I say they

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
because I actually I don't really do anything

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
with this this is all like Dark Tetsuya

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
and I think Orange Riot does work

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
with this like there's a few people and I'm sorry if I'm not aiming

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
everybody in the moment there's a few people

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
that work on this and

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
yeah they actually keep track of a

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
lot of the like inside jokes and things

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
that come up on the show and so one of them is

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
listless and so

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
in episode 582

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
oh thank you AJ Mix Dark Tetsuya says always does a

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
classic game of the week every week thank you AJ Mix

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
582 was OLR's

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
2015 predictions

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
number one now it doesn't say every

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
answer and it doesn't say who contributed it it just

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
says here's the scientific results after the

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
chat room voted number

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
one one of those DDoS

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
brats gets the death penalty

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
that was the number one that was you I remember that

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
that was me I do remember that one and

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
unfortunately that didn't happen but I thought one of them

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
got the book thrown at him didn't he? one of them did get the book

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
thrown at him but it wasn't the death penalty

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
that was the ridiculous part of the answer

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
well if they die in jail it would count right?

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
I shouldn't be so morbid

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
I'm sorry I'm sorry

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
number two which was a tie

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
was yet another 3DS

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
skew which

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
duh that was like a gimme

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
either Alan or Loki I don't know

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
I think I think Alan said that one

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
and that was kind of unfair because

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
that was already out in Japan by that point too

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
that was a duh

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
and it tied with punishing

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
silence from valve on

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
anything but financials

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
that's a winner right there punishing

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
silence from valve absolutely

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
how appropriate it is for your

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
financials because they leak into everybody

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
yes

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
that one won OLR was

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
right shout it on

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
twitter hashtag OLR was right

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
punishing silence from valve

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
came true in 2015

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
it took till the end of the year but

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
alright and then let's see

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
lastly number three which ended up being

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
number four because of a tie Microsoft

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
announces Minecraft 2

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
ok we didn't get Minecraft 2 but

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
we got Minecraft on that

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
hololens thing and we got Minecraft

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
story mode so kind of

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
close kind of close

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
nah get out

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
get out alright

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
full on Minecraft 2

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
if you want to look back

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
on the year do you know what other

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
we only did listless three times this year

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
apparently episode 600

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
which was a big landmark episode

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
what game will we be obsessed with

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
on episode 1000

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
and the top three were PT

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
number one I feel like

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
that was on the shortlist that was on there

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
but number one was pixel

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
shits the mmo number two

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
was dance dance revolution the

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
aww answer and then number three was

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
president cat 2 arena's revenge

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
so it was like all instances I won the

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
last listless I know that not that

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
long ago was the worst NES

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
game of all time and that was when you were here Flaco

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
and it was a huge tie because it was Bible

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
adventures way up here

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
and then like everything else tied Bart

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
vs the space man that was my answer barbie

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
back to the future 2 and 3

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
and cheetah men 2 yeah

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
like all tied so but not first place

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
that was me that's right

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
this is the first time I think I even got in the top

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
three on this list and I

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
won it ahh looking back

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
on 2015 thanks Bible there it is

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
I want to thank the Bible

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
thank you God

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
alright

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
all joking and laughing aside that's it I'm going to

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
close up the skype line because clearly

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
nobody else is calling in now we're just laughing at ourselves

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
but I do want to thank you guys

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
I appreciate that please tell

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
a friend or two about the show that's all we ask

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
help us spread the word about orange lounge

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
radio because this is a show where every gamer

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
has a voice but we can't share those voices

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
if they're not out there listening so

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
our guests for filling in tonight Shane I know

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
you're dying of hunger over there thank you for toughing it out

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
for three hours even though I offered you food

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
during the break but

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
coffee or water?

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
is he like Christian Bale for trying to

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
lose weight for a roll?

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
can I get something to eat and I would have been like

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
no coffee or water that's all

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
you can freeze the coffee

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
and eat coffee ice

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
alright Shane

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
he doesn't like coffee grinds

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
oh yeah you want to eat some coffee grinds?

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
just get them all on your teeth

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
that's so nasty

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
Shane do you have a final thought for us tonight?

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
thanks for being here I really hope

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
my targets get those toys this week

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
I want my blue spino

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
zord so bad like

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
it hurts and PT

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
for game of the year 2016 right?

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
yes we'll start the campaign now

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
alright Flaco

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
thank you for being here as well you're welcome

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
always a five hour show when you're here

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
I know I just talk too much

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
that's okay we all talk too much

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
you have a podcast for three hours

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
I'm like you don't even know how much we can fucking talk

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
try to keep it down for three hours

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
well we had a fault start tonight

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
the podcast listeners won't hear it

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
but we had a fault start with dead audio

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
because Skype screwed up the audio on my computer

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
so we started like ten minutes late

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
there we go we're at the end of the show

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
so Flaco any final thoughts

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
for our listeners tonight?

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
a shout out to Alan

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
I don't know if he's still listening but I went and checked out that

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
amiibo setup that is impressive

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
oh yeah? so good job by him

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
do you like how OCD it is? yes I love it

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
I think it's amazing I really do

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
why don't we change it before we leave? I'll fucking notice

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
no don't don't do it

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
it looks beautiful I love it

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
it'll be like when we were at GamerX

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
and I had all the postcards

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
neatly configured on the table

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
up down up down

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
I had them all configured and I would like

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
to turn around for just a second

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
and then I turn back around and one of them is just slightly tilted

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
and that was me

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
and it's like Jane I fucking know what you just did

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
like achoo

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
that's what you did at the end yes

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
alright

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
and my final thought tonight is

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
I'm gonna go with what I see in the chat room there

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
I like apple pie

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
that's my final thought tonight

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
I want some pie that sounds really good

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
I think there's cake in the fridge

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
