00:00.000 --> 00:17.640
This week, after a round of expected and unexpected wins, happiness and outrage swept

00:17.640 --> 00:21.320
the internet during the Game Awards, but perhaps the biggest surprise is who is not present.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.320
There's much to cover as we enter the final month of the year, and it all starts right

00:24.320 --> 00:31.320
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.600
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.600 --> 00:40.560
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on December the

00:40.560 --> 00:48.000
6th of 2015 with episode number 623 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts, coming to you

00:48.000 --> 00:54.760
live from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, and we'll be here to talk about gaming, gaming

00:54.760 --> 00:59.640
culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Here in studio with my co-host tonight, I only have

00:59.640 --> 01:04.440
with me tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing

01:04.440 --> 01:10.400
okay. Yeah? I know you were Ingersing a little bit before you came over here. Yeah, I bet.

01:10.400 --> 01:16.240
She's like an hour and a half. I still, the whole fact that that used to be a thing that

01:16.240 --> 01:19.400
you would, I don't know if you'd say make fun of me for, but you gave me a hard time

01:19.400 --> 01:23.520
over is now something you probably play more of than me at this point. Maybe. I don't know.

01:23.520 --> 01:29.560
I don't know. I mean, and it really was only during like, um, the double AP things, double

01:29.560 --> 01:34.080
experience and, and now I'm at a level like where it's going to take a lot of time to

01:34.080 --> 01:40.200
get to the next level, but there's, I don't know. I'm not like that. No, I, I, I'm totally

01:40.200 --> 01:43.960
the, you know, like looking at maps and shit, you know, and driving the fucking Auburn for

01:43.960 --> 01:49.360
no fucking reason. So I can't say that I'm not that into it because it is interesting

01:49.360 --> 01:54.600
how that game gets you out and seeing the world. Like I've learned so many like backroads

01:54.600 --> 01:59.840
in my community and places that I never knew existed. So I'll give the game that, you know,

01:59.840 --> 02:04.920
for what it's worth. Yeah. So is that, but then I'm also like, Ooh, next weekend I'm

02:04.920 --> 02:12.200
going to be in San Jose. I get to get all those uniques. I'm really excited. So, uh,

02:12.200 --> 02:17.160
anyhow, not joining us tonight in studio, the one and only dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

02:17.160 --> 02:23.120
She will not be joining us in studio tonight. She will join us via telephone later on, uh,

02:23.120 --> 02:27.680
for one of her regular segments. Uh, she could not be here tonight as, um, something and

02:27.680 --> 02:31.120
I guess I'll have to have her explain it later when she's here, but something about, she

02:31.120 --> 02:36.080
kind of hurt herself. She was helping a friend move, uh, yesterday and I guess she can't

02:36.080 --> 02:39.680
drive right now cause something, I don't know if she did something to her neck or something,

02:39.680 --> 02:42.920
but anyway, uh, so she unfortunately couldn't get over to the studio tonight, but we will

02:42.920 --> 02:47.940
be welcoming, welcoming her by phone later on. Uh, and if you want to call us on Skype,

02:47.940 --> 02:52.940
you can later on in the show, we will open that up. Uh, you can also participate along

02:52.940 --> 02:57.300
the show along with the show in our chat room. Uh, if you are listening live to us because

02:57.300 --> 03:01.960
we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network, a vog network.com

03:01.960 --> 03:05.760
six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black will show. And if you

03:05.760 --> 03:11.440
do happen to be listening live, you should join our chat room live.vog network.com where

03:11.440 --> 03:17.240
you can have a comment such as Akuma JP who says, telephone, what's that? I know it's

03:17.240 --> 03:23.200
a, it's that other thing your cell phone does besides check Facebook and use apps. It's

03:23.200 --> 03:26.760
that that old fashioned thing. Actually, it's funny that Akuma JP says that in our chat

03:26.760 --> 03:32.040
room because I saw a pay phone the other day, like at a gas station, like a legit old school

03:32.040 --> 03:35.760
pay phone. And I actually took a picture and I was like, what is this relic? It's just

03:35.760 --> 03:41.120
really funny. Like how far technology's gone where, um, you know, I remember what 20 years

03:41.120 --> 03:46.040
ago, it was a car phone, not really a flip phone or handheld. Maybe it was kind of right

03:46.040 --> 03:51.160
around that transition, but a cellular telephone. That's right. A cellular telephone. And I

03:51.160 --> 03:55.480
always, I, Oh, this is such an obscure reference, but I don't even care. I always think of that

03:55.480 --> 03:59.120
movie Romy and Michelle's high school reunion, which is one of my favorites. Like it's one

03:59.120 --> 04:03.280
of those like stupid comedies, but like, so stupid. It's, it's great. And there's a

04:03.280 --> 04:08.160
whole scene involving a cell phone and it's like a gigantic, like brick looking phone.

04:08.160 --> 04:12.160
And she goes, if anyone needs to make a call, I've got a phone. Cause she's trying to show

04:12.160 --> 04:16.440
that she's like really successful at her high school reunion, even though, you know, they're,

04:16.440 --> 04:22.920
they're unemployed or whatever the plot was. So derailed by a tangent. Yay. Uh, anyhow,

04:22.920 --> 04:27.120
uh, you can join us via Skype. We'll open that up later on in the show, orange lounge

04:27.120 --> 04:32.360
radio. I like, I like how it says, I don't know the way the Loki said it made me think

04:32.360 --> 04:38.120
of a random bit in Kung free. Yes. That's cause that's exactly why I said it that way.

04:38.120 --> 04:43.880
Because of everything in your life is Kung fury. Not everything, almost everything. It

04:43.880 --> 04:48.600
should be. All right. But, and I don't think we were doing the show yet when this announcement

04:48.600 --> 04:54.640
came out, one of my most favorite movies of all time, similar title Kung pow is getting

04:54.640 --> 04:59.520
a sequel. Congratulations. I remember when you were obsessed with that movie. I want

04:59.520 --> 05:02.640
to say it was when we were living together in the early days of OR. Oh, I don't even

05:02.640 --> 05:06.380
know how many times I've seen that movie. It's ridiculous. But they're finally making

05:06.380 --> 05:11.040
a sequel about damn time. Congratulations. Yes. That'll be, how long is this going to

05:11.040 --> 05:13.600
take for the sequel to get a sequel? I don't know, but I've got enough movies lined up.

05:13.600 --> 05:18.240
So I've got the Deadpool movie. I've got ready player one at some point and now Kung pow

05:18.240 --> 05:23.640
2. Isn't that the theme of like this decade? I swear like, and it's like all things entertainment.

05:23.640 --> 05:28.240
I mean, with television, uh, what twin peaks is coming back, which don't get me wrong.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.200
I'm here for that. Cause I fricking love twin peaks, but uh, what X files is coming back

05:32.200 --> 05:36.400
as well. You know, we have all these old TV shows that are coming back after a hiatus.

05:36.400 --> 05:40.960
Um, and then, uh, the same thing's kind of happening with movies. Like you talked about

05:40.960 --> 05:45.680
there, uh, and star Wars. Hell, I mean, most people figure, I wasn't that hyped about star

05:45.680 --> 05:50.440
Wars. And then I watched, I actually watched like a fan clip where they took all the clips

05:50.440 --> 05:53.560
from everything and tried to put it in like what they think is the chronological order.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.240
I'm like, Ooh, that looks really cool. Yeah. Right. Right. Like I'm like, I got to watch

05:56.240 --> 06:00.600
that now. I'm not, I always considered myself more of a Trek guy than a Wars guy. And, and

06:00.600 --> 06:04.920
especially after you see the prequels, you're like, ah, I think, I think this might be done,

06:04.920 --> 06:08.600
but I mean, I, I'm, I'm even kind of hyped about the new movie. Like I really want to

06:08.600 --> 06:13.240
go see it. I don't know if I'll see it in the theater opening night cause uh, I think

06:13.240 --> 06:17.600
there's going to be a lot of very loud people, but uh, I'll go see it, you know, during the

06:17.600 --> 06:22.080
day on Christmas week or something. Who knows? I'll go see it a little bit later. Um, but

06:22.080 --> 06:27.000
yeah, I'm excited about that. But then also since this is a video game podcast, hell,

06:27.000 --> 06:31.560
what was one of the biggest things to come out of the PlayStation experience yesterday

06:31.560 --> 06:35.760
was that update on the final fantasy seven remake and that, that new trailer. Did you

06:35.760 --> 06:42.040
watch that trailer? Oh yes. Yeah. Yes. I, I was really surprised. Final fantasy seven

06:42.040 --> 06:48.040
cross 13 basically. I don't even know versus cross 15 I think. Yeah, I'm sorry. That's

06:48.040 --> 06:53.640
right. It's 15 now. Yeah, it's cross 15. Am I the only one that has a really hard time

06:53.640 --> 06:58.780
at this point calling it a remake? I mean, it's not a remake. It's a reimagining to me.

06:58.780 --> 07:02.360
It's the final fantasy seven reimagining. It's like we took the plot and the characters

07:02.360 --> 07:05.720
and just call it final fantasy seven. I mean, by the time it comes out, just call it final

07:05.720 --> 07:10.520
fantasy seven. Just like now they did like hit man and you know, in tomb Raider, you

07:10.520 --> 07:14.160
don't need to like have seven remake. It's just, that's a good comparison. It's like

07:14.160 --> 07:18.520
tomb Raider, like the new tomb Raider really had nothing in common with the old tomb Raider

07:18.520 --> 07:24.900
besides Laura Croft. And she had kind of the same job. You know what I mean? Yeah. So,

07:24.900 --> 07:29.320
but the new tomb Raider was obviously flipping fantastic. And I think, I don't know. I'm

07:29.320 --> 07:34.260
super hyped after seeing the final fantasy seven reimagining trailer. Uh, I know some

07:34.260 --> 07:39.560
people a little awkward with the battle system. I think we really don't know enough about

07:39.560 --> 07:43.840
it. I think we're reading a lot into it from what we saw. It's awesome. Yeah. One of the

07:43.840 --> 07:48.160
things about final fantasy has always been presentation. And I think, you know, the one

07:48.160 --> 07:53.120
thing we didn't see in that trailer that we needed to see, that's going to really like,

07:53.120 --> 07:56.800
I think maybe if people were really upset with what they saw in the battle system, we'll

07:56.800 --> 08:03.400
bring them back. Summons. What was always the Epic part of a final fantasy games? Summons.

08:03.400 --> 08:08.160
Right. So, uh, Knights of the brand. I'm going to go make a sandwich. Let's, let's hope the

08:08.160 --> 08:14.080
summons are skippable this time for God's sake. They shouldn't be, you know, we'll see what

08:14.080 --> 08:17.720
happens there. Uh, go into our chat for some other comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

08:17.720 --> 08:23.320
Akuma JP says final fantasy seven reskin. When you say reskin, that makes me think, that makes

08:23.320 --> 08:26.080
me think of, and I know we'll get into it later in the show, but that makes me think of what

08:26.080 --> 08:30.560
they're doing to the PS2 games on PS4. It's like a little bit of a cosmetic upgrade and,

08:30.560 --> 08:35.240
and kind of done. Uh, I don't know. Uh, let's see. SSG100Matt says, I think they're just

08:35.280 --> 08:39.520
calling it final fantasy seven remake until they think of a creative name to call it something

08:39.520 --> 08:43.640
else. I just hope they add like more to the game, like advent children or something like that,

08:43.640 --> 08:47.400
like that whole storyline would be awesome. Well, but it's going to be the same story,

08:47.400 --> 08:51.640
I think. So I think I I'm with you where they ought to just call it final fantasy seven,

08:51.640 --> 08:56.960
but we all kind of know it's the remake. Unless you weren't old enough to know,

08:56.960 --> 09:02.000
but the media's definitely let you know that this is a remake of an older game. I wonder

09:02.240 --> 09:07.000
if Aerith's going to still die in this. No, that'll be the DLC expansion. She lives.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.040
The Aerith revive potion for only $4.99. Who knows? Oh, Hey, cool. We can, you know,

09:13.040 --> 09:17.360
get her limit breaks and whatever. I don't know. Well, anyway, speaking of that trailer,

09:17.360 --> 09:22.520
uh, we're going to have joining us in studio in a little bit. Uh, Shane Alinko is going to join

09:22.520 --> 09:27.680
us here. He's not here at the top of the show because he is driving back from San Francisco

09:27.680 --> 09:32.720
right now. Um, so he's going to be joining us. I think he's, he's only about, you just texted me

09:32.720 --> 09:36.600
and he's not that far away. So he should be here in probably about 15 minutes. He was actually at

09:36.600 --> 09:42.020
PlayStation experience this weekend. So I, we want to talk to him about what it was like, um, to be

09:42.020 --> 09:47.320
there at the show, the energy in the room, what we might not have seen on the stream. Um, I think

09:47.320 --> 09:50.360
sometimes you can really see a lot when you're there in person that might not always come

09:50.360 --> 09:55.160
through on a broadcast. Um, and I know he got hands on with a lot of the games. Uh, he actually

09:55.400 --> 10:00.200
did get to play rez infinite in the full VR and he has some strong opinions on it. So we're gonna

10:00.200 --> 10:04.960
talk to him about that, uh, in a little bit whenever he gets here. So, uh, we'll look forward to that.

10:04.960 --> 10:10.160
So, uh, overall, did you follow the news out of PlayStation experience where you kind of, I had it

10:10.160 --> 10:16.080
on a screen while I was taking phone calls cause I was at work. So I had it on my laptop screen. I

10:16.080 --> 10:20.480
was kind of like occasionally trying to listen to it and stuff. So I didn't really follow it too

10:20.480 --> 10:26.560
closely. Um, I thought that they showed, you know, it wasn't expecting a whole lot and I thought

10:26.560 --> 10:31.520
they showed a lot more than, you know, I was expecting them to, I felt like they dropped more

10:31.520 --> 10:36.200
bombshells last year. And I know I was commenting this to Shane and we were texting each other a

10:36.200 --> 10:39.200
little bit during the thing. I was kinda like, I feel like they dropped more bombshells last year

10:39.200 --> 10:44.680
and it was more of a like, like a action packed conference last year. But I admittedly, I'm

10:44.680 --> 10:50.440
probably not being very fair because last year the bar was not a, it was the first time they ever

10:50.440 --> 10:55.160
did it. So we had no expectations going into it. So when we heard about things like street fighter

10:55.160 --> 11:02.200
five and you know, the things they announced last year, uh, the final fantasy seven first remake that

11:02.200 --> 11:06.080
then they just kind of had as a footnote this year. Oh, by the way, if you wanted that, it's out

11:06.080 --> 11:10.760
today. That whole thing, right? That was a big thing last year. Um, we didn't, weren't expecting

11:10.760 --> 11:16.320
anything. I think this year now it was like a precedent's been set. So we knew to expect some

11:16.320 --> 11:21.480
things. And I think in all fairness, I think it was about probably the same that they had last

11:21.480 --> 11:27.720
year. Um, I know the Nino Cooney two thing caught a lot of people by surprise myself included. I

11:27.720 --> 11:33.720
mean, I enjoyed the game and I know, I know that game is a VOG network in joke of sorts because

11:33.760 --> 11:38.720
Bobby, um, our pal who's on before us here at VOG couldn't finish the demo. Yeah. Well, well, and

11:38.720 --> 11:43.720
to be fair, the demo for Nino Cooney was terrible. It really was. Um, I took a chance on the game

11:43.720 --> 11:48.760
anyway, and I'm glad, I'm glad I did because the full game explains things a lot better than the

11:48.760 --> 11:55.320
demo did. Um, but I, I enjoyed the game, but I kind of wasn't expecting it to get a sequel. And so

11:55.320 --> 12:00.280
the fact that they announced one genuinely surprised me. I kind of thought that wasn't going

12:00.280 --> 12:05.960
to be a thing, but it is. So I guess, hooray, I'm sure Flacco Jones was doing cartwheels. Yeah, he

12:05.960 --> 12:09.940
was there at the, uh, PlayStation experience as well. So I'm sure he was excited about that. I

12:09.940 --> 12:13.240
don't think they had it playable by any means though. I think that was a very early announced

12:13.240 --> 12:19.120
trailer. Probably. Yeah. Awesome. All right. Uh, well, let's get into, um, since Shane's still

12:19.120 --> 12:22.480
not here yet, let's get into a kickoff topic tonight and then we'll get into our gaming week.

12:22.480 --> 12:28.040
So, uh, Loki, another big of, I mean, PlayStation experience was one thing. Do you remember when

12:28.040 --> 12:32.320
December was like no news month and it was like, well, we're just going to enjoy all the games that

12:32.320 --> 12:37.960
came out in November and, uh, we'll have new games to talk about come March or so like that

12:38.080 --> 12:44.200
dynamic has changed just in the past two years with PlayStation experience. And now another event

12:44.440 --> 12:49.760
that has a lot of people talking about a certain moment, right? Loki, the game awards, uh, 2015,

12:49.760 --> 12:53.880
they hosted it again this year and streamed it live on the internet. I didn't actually get to

12:53.880 --> 13:00.400
watch it live because I just didn't unfortunately. Um, but I got to catch up on it after it was,

13:00.400 --> 13:04.800
everything was done, but I did get to watch the video playback of some things. I mainly just want

13:04.800 --> 13:09.360
to watch the trailers and everything cause you know, just don't care who wins. But, uh, one of

13:09.360 --> 13:16.240
the awards that was given out was her best action adventure game and the award went to Metal Gear

13:16.240 --> 13:22.800
Solid Five Phantom Pain. And so of course you'd expect, okay, you know, the developer, um, Hideo

13:22.800 --> 13:28.040
Kojima should be accepting that award because you know, he's kind of the face of that series.

13:28.960 --> 13:35.320
However, he wasn't there. Um, instead Kiefer Sutherland, um, accepted the award on his behalf

13:35.360 --> 13:42.680
anyways. And the reason he wasn't able to attend is because he is barred legally by Konami from

13:42.680 --> 13:47.080
attending the award ceremony. And this was actually explained right after the acceptance by

13:47.080 --> 13:53.160
Jeff Keeley. Um, basically saying, as you notice, Hideo Kojima is not here. Mr. Kojima had every

13:53.160 --> 13:57.920
intention of being here, but unfortunately he was informed by a lawyer representing Konami that he

13:57.920 --> 14:03.120
would not be allowed to travel to tonight's award ceremony to accept any awards. He is still under

14:03.200 --> 14:09.360
employment and contract or employment in contract. And it's disappointing. It's inconceivable to me

14:09.360 --> 14:14.400
that an artist like Hideo Kojima would not be allowed to come here and celebrate with his peers

14:14.400 --> 14:15.400
and fellow teammates.

14:17.800 --> 14:23.120
I have to admit, I was pretty impressed by that moment. I mean, for all the shit that Jeff Keeley

14:23.120 --> 14:28.480
has gotten about being the Dorito Pope and all that stuff, I thought that was a pretty rad moment

14:28.480 --> 14:33.520
that he kind of broke the fourth wall in that regard. And, you know, we all know something's been

14:33.520 --> 14:39.760
really off with Konami for a couple years now, right? We've all kind of like, what's going on with

14:39.760 --> 14:44.080
that company that we used to love so much because they've fallen from grace and hidden every branch

14:44.080 --> 14:50.080
on the tree on the way down, it seems like. And, um, you know, I thought that was really interesting

14:50.080 --> 14:56.560
for him. It was kind of a risk too, for him to call out Konami because, I mean, just a couple

14:56.560 --> 14:59.440
weeks ago on the show, we were talking about the whole blacklisting and that whole thing, right?

14:59.440 --> 15:04.800
And that was a big controversy was going on. Yeah. To see like what there are no games that they're

15:04.800 --> 15:09.520
making. You're not going to get access to nothing that we're making. You beat me to the easy punch

15:09.520 --> 15:12.800
line. What's he going to get blacklisted from? You're not going to play this particular machine

15:12.800 --> 15:19.520
before it comes out. But I thought that was pretty ballsy of him to break the fourth wall in that

15:19.520 --> 15:23.520
regard. And I think a lot of people kind of applauded him for it. And certainly on the other

15:23.520 --> 15:28.720
token, there's a lot of people that are going, okay, what is Konami fucking smoking at this

15:28.720 --> 15:34.000
point? And like, seriously, I would love once, I'm sure it's probably an NDA and stuff, but like,

15:34.000 --> 15:41.440
seriously, what the fuck transpired to cause all this to like, just why, who is deciding that this

15:41.440 --> 15:46.560
is like the way to treat your developer? That's bringing basically in a ton of money for you.

15:46.560 --> 15:53.280
And I get that he's under contract and I get that he has this non-compete clause, but to bar him

15:53.280 --> 16:00.080
from an award show to pick up an award, that's kind of a dick move right there. Like there's

16:00.080 --> 16:05.520
what, what possible good thing. It's the same dick move when they took off his

16:05.520 --> 16:10.320
name from the actual game, when they dropped his name off the title there. Yeah. I mean, that,

16:10.320 --> 16:14.880
that's, that's the thing. They want that game associated with Konami and not with Hideo Kojima,

16:14.880 --> 16:22.480
which is like, right. That's not going to happen. Yeah. Dungeonbuster in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

16:22.480 --> 16:28.720
says, this is not the Konami I grew up with. And I think that really sums up how I feel too. And

16:28.720 --> 16:35.360
you know, this, again, this has been just this slow. It's, this is going to be a horrible

16:35.360 --> 16:41.280
comparison and I apologize in advance. It's like Atari. But it's like watching your friend overdose

16:41.280 --> 16:45.680
on something or something. It's like, or, or be in a really bad, horrible relationship where it's

16:45.680 --> 16:52.480
like, it's slowly like getting worse and worse. And it's like, this is not the Konami that I

16:53.040 --> 16:58.720
remember at all. And of course, you know, here at Orange Lounge Radio, myself, Loki, Dark Sakura,

16:58.720 --> 17:03.520
we all met playing a Konami video game, a series of Konami video games, really. You've been invited

17:03.520 --> 17:09.520
to Konami press events a couple of times. Yeah. But it's like, but none of those people that we

17:09.520 --> 17:15.920
were friends with are working for them anymore because Konami's really changed. So let me ask a

17:15.920 --> 17:21.840
very honest, blunt type of question. Is Konami fucked beyond repair at this point? I think so.

17:21.840 --> 17:27.120
I think that they were fucked beyond repair before this event. And it's just even worse now. They,

17:27.120 --> 17:31.680
and I don't think they fucking care. I think they're just like, whatever, we're done. We're

17:31.680 --> 17:38.000
done with this segment of the business anyways. So it's all mobile in pachinko slots. I hope it

17:38.000 --> 17:44.800
does well. So you think Konami has just basically written off hardcore gamers for lack of a better

17:44.800 --> 17:49.280
term. Konami has basically decided, and you know, I guess we have heard this before in so many

17:49.280 --> 17:55.040
words. Konami is not interested in this side of the business anymore. I hope that they know what

17:55.040 --> 18:00.480
they're doing because I know the mobile space is, I mean, it can be profitable, but it's just,

18:01.040 --> 18:06.720
there's so much out there. I mean, you're not going to have like the Angry Birds game,

18:06.720 --> 18:11.360
or you're not going to have, you know, the next Candy Crush saga or whatever the hell that you

18:11.360 --> 18:16.720
think you're going to release. I mean, so I don't know what they're expecting. I hope that they're

18:16.720 --> 18:20.800
successful in that. But at this point, I don't really fucking care either, to be honest. I mean,

18:20.800 --> 18:28.320
it's like at this point, I just, whatever. I wish, I hope their IPs that I do enjoy are maybe

18:28.320 --> 18:34.400
sold to somebody else. Well, as tacky as my earlier comparison might have been, you know,

18:34.640 --> 18:38.160
the thing I think Konami really needs at this point is an intervention.

18:38.160 --> 18:45.920
Like, and I'm talking about the people that are investing, the board. I like, how is the company

18:45.920 --> 18:50.080
continuing to make these type of decisions? I like, it just kind of blows my mind how they

18:50.080 --> 18:55.440
can shoot themselves in the foot so often and so repeatedly. Like, is there any PR at Konami?

18:55.440 --> 18:58.880
I don't even understand what the point would have been if, like, he showed up at the awards

18:58.880 --> 19:03.760
ceremony. I mean, what would that have done for Konami? Nothing. That would have done nothing

19:03.760 --> 19:08.000
negative to Konami. It might have even been a positive to kind of be like, hey, you know,

19:08.000 --> 19:12.960
Konami made this game that's getting this award. Woohoo. Like, it could have been kind of an okay

19:12.960 --> 19:18.080
moment for Konami amongst all this messed up stuff. But were they worried that Konami was

19:18.080 --> 19:23.760
going to get up there and go fuck Konami? Hashtag. Like, were they, were they worried about that?

19:23.760 --> 19:28.400
I, it just seems really silly to me. I don't know. I mean, at this point though now, I mean,

19:28.400 --> 19:32.240
even if you have those casual games coming out, I mean, I guess we're not the same audience for it,

19:32.240 --> 19:38.320
but, like, you would think that you wouldn't try to burn those bridges. I mean, maybe try to get

19:38.320 --> 19:42.320
those people involved in those games. Like, hey, you like this license? Because what's the point

19:42.320 --> 19:48.080
in licensing this stuff? Stuff that really is going to be appealing to fans of that series that

19:48.080 --> 19:53.040
love those hardcore games. What's the point in licensing that for these casual games if these

19:53.040 --> 19:58.480
casual game players don't know what the fuck those licenses are? Yeah. It's like, does, like,

19:59.440 --> 20:03.200
does grandma know what the fuck Metal Gear Solid is? Is she going to fucking care when

20:03.200 --> 20:06.560
she's playing the Castlevania pachinko slot machine or whatever the case may be?

20:06.560 --> 20:10.400
It's like, they don't fucking care. Well, the goal might be to lure a younger audience into

20:10.400 --> 20:15.360
gambling, to be fair, but that's, that's neither here nor there. I still think Konami is, is in

20:15.360 --> 20:20.000
need of an intervention. And honestly, at this point, I would not be sad if there was a hostile

20:20.000 --> 20:24.880
takeover of the company and somebody else bought them. I, I, I would like actually somebody else

20:24.880 --> 20:29.200
to buy their intellectual property and do some good things with it. Um, I don't know if that'll

20:29.200 --> 20:33.280
realistically happen because yeah, Konami still does have this mobile arm and this,

20:33.280 --> 20:39.760
this pachinko arm. But at this point, I don't know who's running that company, but they're doing

20:41.360 --> 20:46.880
from the hardcore gamer perspective. They used to really, really respect Konami, love Konami

20:46.880 --> 20:51.680
and the products they're doing. Uh, they're really just burning all their bridges with us. And I've

20:51.680 --> 20:58.240
kind of had it like, and they can kind of go sit and spin and it's, it's frustrating. Uh,

20:58.240 --> 21:02.320
for Kojima though, at least, Hey, he's out of it now and we'll see what happens come January.

21:02.880 --> 21:06.640
He'll go independent, go somewhere else and some great games will come out from it.

21:06.640 --> 21:13.360
I am ready for the sit down interview that Hodea Kojima is going to do probably with Jeff Keighley

21:13.360 --> 21:17.600
come January after this mess. And we'll see, you know, he might still be restricted from

21:17.600 --> 21:22.720
saying some things, but I am ready for that interview. So we'll see what happens.

21:23.760 --> 21:29.040
But even before, like, you know, uh, Kojima, I mean like itagaki, I mean,

21:29.040 --> 21:32.640
shit, like all these people, you're like top talent. You're just fucking them over.

21:32.640 --> 21:38.160
And like, what's the point, uh, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh,

21:38.160 --> 21:42.560
sg100. Matt says the board is probably all for this because they all believe that mobile and

21:42.560 --> 21:46.800
pachi slots are highly profitable. Uh, can, can you even talk about what happened at the game

21:46.800 --> 21:51.600
awards sg100. Matt says it's a petty move. Konami knows Kojima made them in a way and they didn't

21:51.600 --> 21:56.880
want to give him his moment in the sun. Um, and then, uh, dungeon buster and chat says as cold

21:56.880 --> 22:02.080
as it sounds, as long as their bottom line remains, uh, Rosie from their other divisions,

22:02.080 --> 22:07.920
I doubt they'll care two or three quarters from now. Um, and blueberry and chat says,

22:07.920 --> 22:13.360
can't be fun for any of the employees. I would not want to be the people running

22:13.360 --> 22:17.680
Konami's Twitter right now. And it's not their fault. The people that have to run that Twitter,

22:17.680 --> 22:22.560
you know, the social media management or wherever that's their job, but I'm sure those people are

22:22.560 --> 22:28.000
probably just as easily frustrated. I mean, come on, haven't y'all worked for a company in the

22:28.000 --> 22:31.840
past at some point where you were like, I don't know what those people upstairs are doing, but

22:31.840 --> 22:41.040
I don't know if I totally agree with what's going on. So anyway, uh, stepping into the studio right

22:41.040 --> 22:44.160
here, Shane Alinko finally made it. I used to work for one of those companies, you know what

22:44.160 --> 22:49.920
it was called? Konami. What did you think of that whole, well, then I'm very curious what you have

22:49.920 --> 22:54.960
to say. I thought it was hilarious. I have no friends left at Konami. They've all left by now

22:54.960 --> 23:03.440
because they wised up. Um, but yeah, that was so good. What do you mean by they wised up?

23:04.320 --> 23:09.360
I mean, even back when I worked for Konami, you could still, you could tell something just wasn't

23:09.360 --> 23:16.320
right there, uh, with not my direct management. I actually liked my direct management even though,

23:16.320 --> 23:23.520
like, not everybody always got along. The people I worked with and my office, the Redwood City

23:23.520 --> 23:29.200
office, we were, it was awesome. Um, but there were decisions coming from higher up than the

23:29.200 --> 23:35.760
Redwood City office that never made any sense and you could just see the writing on the wall,

23:35.760 --> 23:45.120
um, that the company was not being run the best it could possibly be. So, uh, well, I'm, I'm of the

23:45.120 --> 23:49.680
mindset that somebody else needs to be running the company at this point. It's embarrassing.

23:49.680 --> 23:53.120
Also, breaking news, because I'm not sure if you guys talked about, but apparently there was a press

23:53.120 --> 23:57.360
release sent out tonight for Final Fantasy VII Remake. Looks like it's going to be episodic.

23:59.200 --> 24:05.600
Yeah, it says it will be told across a multi-part series with each entry providing its own unique

24:05.600 --> 24:10.800
experience. What's the source on that? Uh, press release, uh, that was sent out. Kotaku's posting

24:10.800 --> 24:15.120
it. I've saw it on Twitter too. I was, it's the first site I went to that talked about it. Huh.

24:16.400 --> 24:21.840
Oh, that's, uh, kind of makes me less interested in playing it, but we'll talk about the PlayStation

24:21.840 --> 24:27.600
Experience stuff. That, uh, that leaves a taste in my mouth that I don't like. I, I don't, I don't know.

24:27.600 --> 24:34.480
I, I feel like they're doing that to get the game out the door quicker, but that also makes me wonder

24:34.480 --> 24:39.680
if they're not planning on selling it in stores. If it's going to be episodic. Like download only.

24:39.680 --> 24:43.680
Like download only. Yeah, episodic stuff usually is until all the episodes are finished and then

24:43.680 --> 24:48.400
they release it. It makes sense, though, if they are going to put it out quicker, because usually at this point

24:48.400 --> 24:53.840
they just announced the remake there, um, last year and they were like, or no, this year, was it?

24:53.840 --> 24:58.880
Yeah, at E3 this year. They're like, oh, we really haven't done anything on it yet, but then come

24:58.880 --> 25:04.720
PlayStation Experience, we have not only, like, actual in-game combat footage, but we have English

25:04.720 --> 25:12.000
voices, which never happens this early on. So I could see that and I, when I put it that way, I'm not

25:12.000 --> 25:19.920
super offended by it. If they price it reasonably, which Square doesn't usually, um, it could be okay.

25:19.920 --> 25:23.920
Yeah, it looks like they have the prologue part of the game finished, because you could see that

25:23.920 --> 25:28.720
Scorpion boss and so they, basically what used to be the demo from SN7, they probably have done.

25:28.720 --> 25:32.800
Yeah, what I got in my PlayStation Underground way back in the day. Yeah, right, or, or, uh, which I

25:32.800 --> 25:39.360
still probably have that disc. Toeball number one or whatever, right? Yeah. So, um, ah, gosh, I just, I, I don't

25:39.360 --> 25:43.440
know, though, the episodic thing is still really weird to me. It depends on how many episodes, too. Like,

25:43.440 --> 25:51.440
I don't want a 28 episode game. I'll take, like, I could take up to, like, between five and ten at most.

25:51.520 --> 25:55.520
There is a part of me, though, that wonders if that's their key to trying to get it done faster.

25:55.520 --> 26:00.720
That maybe they're trying to get the first part out next year. But my thought was maybe they could

26:00.720 --> 26:05.360
just release the game as is and, like, all the other publishers do. Oh, it's half done? No, just patch it.

26:05.360 --> 26:13.120
It's ready to go. A day 375 patch to get some of the other game in it. Wow. Uh, Blueberry is letting me

26:13.120 --> 26:19.120
know in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Minecraft Story Mode is sold in box now as a season pass.

26:19.120 --> 26:23.680
So, let me guess, you open the box and there's probably a code that just downloads it online. Minecraft.

26:23.680 --> 26:28.800
That's kind of where we're at. Because not all the seasons are out yet. Yeah. Oh, that's so weird to me.

26:28.800 --> 26:34.000
Uh, as Jonah and Matt says, the game is going to be on PS4 first. I wonder if the game will come

26:34.000 --> 26:40.880
out on Xbox One when all the episodes are done. Maybe. Huh. Maybe. Very interesting. I'm very curious.

26:40.880 --> 26:45.360
That would make sense, too. And then we'd get a physical version at that point, probably. Are they

26:45.360 --> 26:49.040
going to try and do a thing where it's, like, because the game was on three discs originally,

26:49.040 --> 26:53.680
it's going to be three episodes? That's fine, too. A disc- No, because episode three was nothing but

26:53.680 --> 26:58.640
the last dungeon. There you go. The end movie. Well, they'll break it up a little better, but three episodes

26:58.640 --> 27:03.680
would be funny if that's it, because then it would be, like, three different discs. Yeah, I guess. I guess.

27:03.680 --> 27:08.640
I don't know. Again, I'm kind of with you. It's the price. But then if they charge $29.99 per episode,

27:08.640 --> 27:12.160
which I would argue they could probably get away with, then they just figured out a way to get you

27:12.160 --> 27:19.200
to buy a game for $90. That I would not feel comfortable with. That would be also EA that

27:19.200 --> 27:26.880
does that. Well, Square, no. Square puts their ports for ridiculously expensive prices, and they could

27:26.880 --> 27:32.720
easily do it with this, too. All right. Well, more to develop on that story, I'm sure. Yeah. But, Shane,

27:32.720 --> 27:37.200
welcome back. You are just back from San Francisco. I'm still hungry, but I'm taking a break from eating the

27:37.200 --> 27:41.840
rest of my food to try to talk. Well, thank you. But I could eat and also talk with my mouth full,

27:41.840 --> 27:45.040
and I'm fine with that, too. That's probably not the best thing to do on the radio. I don't care.

27:45.040 --> 27:50.880
So, how was PlayStation Experience? It was fantastic. I'm really happy I went. It was a lot of fun.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.640
Walk us through your experience at PlayStation Experience a little bit. You guys got there the

27:54.640 --> 27:59.200
day before to get your badges, right? Yeah, we went the night before to get our badges. First time at

27:59.200 --> 28:04.000
Moscone Center? For me, yeah. You know, I actually used to live in San Francisco, and I've never been

28:04.000 --> 28:08.400
to Moscone at all, so that was my first time. Describe for the listeners about how big it is.

28:08.400 --> 28:16.080
This big. He's choosing his hand. Great radio. It was, what, three floors? We were just in the

28:16.080 --> 28:22.960
west side of it, and it was, I don't know, I felt like it was a standard convention hall size.

28:22.960 --> 28:27.360
It's way smaller than E3, but from other conventions I've been to, it was about

28:27.360 --> 28:31.760
roughly the same size. I'd imagine if it was three floors, it's probably the exact same size

28:31.760 --> 28:36.560
as TwitchCon. It was probably a very similar layout, too. Two floors, the first floor and the second

28:36.560 --> 28:42.560
floor were where all the games and stuff were at, and the third floor was strictly for the

28:42.560 --> 28:51.040
keynote, the, what are they called? Panels. Panels, thank you. Panels, and then the Capcom Cup today.

28:51.040 --> 28:55.600
That sounds exactly like how Twitch was laid out, basically, yeah, except it's like second,

28:55.600 --> 29:00.080
I imagine maybe second floor was all the indie games? No, they were mixed in, well, mixed in

29:00.080 --> 29:05.440
in the sense that they're on first and second floor, but they were kind of like the outside

29:05.440 --> 29:11.760
of the space, so you had like all the big stuff kind of in the middle, and then you had like

29:11.760 --> 29:17.120
two rows. I'm moving the microphone away because I'm trying to gesture with my hands.

29:17.840 --> 29:25.200
They had two rows around the middle that were where the indies were, and then you actually had

29:25.200 --> 29:32.240
like another set beyond that that were some bigger publishers, and like I saw PDP there, too.

29:33.520 --> 29:36.800
That's kind of cool, so it's like you had to go through the indies to get to the bigger stuff.

29:36.800 --> 29:40.880
You didn't have to, I mean they were all kind of separated, but they weren't like,

29:40.880 --> 29:46.400
we're gonna just throw them on the outside and forget about them. They had a presence.

29:47.680 --> 29:50.720
Let's talk about the keynote a little bit. What time did you line up to get in there?

29:50.720 --> 29:54.640
Seven. And how good were your seats? Oh, they were okay. A lot of people?

29:54.640 --> 29:58.160
Lots of people. I heard it was sold out. Did it feel very sold out?

29:58.160 --> 30:02.880
Well, the show didn't sell out till last night. Yeah, yeah, they tweeted it last night.

30:02.880 --> 30:07.840
Yeah, but there were a lot of seats there. I didn't think there were going to be enough

30:07.840 --> 30:15.200
for all of us, even though we got there at seven, but I did see some people did have to stand,

30:15.200 --> 30:20.560
so yeah, but it was totally worth it. That keynote was fantastic. What was the vibe in the room?

30:21.200 --> 30:25.440
Oh, I was really excited, and I think a lot of people didn't go in with really high hopes

30:26.080 --> 30:31.120
or high expectations, but then they started saying like, oh, we've got games to announce,

30:31.120 --> 30:34.880
and I don't think anybody really expected game announcements. I kind of did because last year

30:34.880 --> 30:40.000
Street Fighter V was a huge thing last year. And like you said earlier, because I did catch it,

30:40.000 --> 30:45.200
you thought this was not as big as last year's, but last year's, okay, they had Street Fighter V,

30:45.200 --> 30:53.360
which is great, but this year they showed off footage from seven, they announced Ni No Kuni II,

30:53.360 --> 30:58.400
they announced Rez, they had all these announcements, even if they were like indie or

30:58.400 --> 31:04.480
indie style games, I feel like it was much bigger than what they offered last year.

31:06.160 --> 31:11.760
How was the vibe in the room when the seven stuff showed up? Because I told you the day before I

31:11.840 --> 31:14.480
think they were going to show new footage, and you were like, no, it's too soon.

31:14.480 --> 31:20.880
Yeah, it was too soon, but apparently not. But everybody lost it. Well, of course, and me being

31:20.880 --> 31:25.760
me, where I was sitting, I kept reading the prompter well in advance of what was going on

31:25.760 --> 31:29.280
on stage, because I just want to spoil stuff for me. I've done that at E3 Keynotes.

31:29.280 --> 31:33.520
Yeah, I did that too. That's how I learned what the Wii U was called before they announced it.

31:33.680 --> 31:44.560
Like, what's a Wii U? But yeah, everybody lost it then, and it was great. I'm not even a big

31:44.560 --> 31:51.440
seven fan, and even I was excited for what I saw. I'm still debating on the combat. I'm gonna have

31:51.440 --> 31:56.400
to watch the trailer again, because obviously I really haven't had access to looking at a lot of

31:56.400 --> 32:03.520
internet stuff, but I can't really tell if it's 15 style or Kingdom Hearts style, because at first

32:03.520 --> 32:06.640
glance I was like, oh, it plays like Kingdom Hearts, but then I was like, that's kind of how

32:06.640 --> 32:10.720
15 plays too, so I need to look at it again. I think we're all waiting for the details on what

32:10.720 --> 32:16.160
that really looks like. We're kind of reading into it a lot. I'm not sure I like that that's where

32:16.160 --> 32:22.160
they're going with the combat, and I heard Bobby talk about turn-based stuff. I'm not writing the

32:22.160 --> 32:29.040
game off. I'm not super disappointed that they switched it, but I would. Well, to be fair, I mean,

32:29.040 --> 32:34.560
if you want the turn-based stuff, hey, the Final Fantasy VII re-release is out right now. I guess

32:34.560 --> 32:41.360
I could get trophies on that. I just, not every game has to be that way. I like it when they switch

32:41.360 --> 32:48.400
up the battle systems. Like, you know, 9 was different than 10, which was different than 12,

32:48.400 --> 32:54.080
which was different than 13, which is different than 15, but now it looks like 7 and 15 might

32:54.080 --> 32:59.280
just be the same. I'm like, oh, okay. But we are making a lot of assumptions. To be fair, I mean,

32:59.280 --> 33:03.920
we're not going to know until they show it. The only real assumption we can make from that trailer

33:03.920 --> 33:10.080
is that, who is it? The fat one, Wedge? Is he the fat one? He has a terrible voice actor.

33:12.000 --> 33:17.600
He sounds like a lot of people I would expect sounded like at PlayStation Experience this

33:17.600 --> 33:22.640
weekend. I think the thing we can read into that trailer is the whole, like, the cut scenes

33:22.640 --> 33:26.800
and the battles and everything is going to be seamless. That's going to be amazing. Because,

33:26.800 --> 33:32.160
like, remember when we played Final Fantasy VII on PlayStation 1, it was very obvious. Like,

33:32.160 --> 33:35.680
it was like, there were kind of like three, there was like the battle models. There's the

33:35.680 --> 33:42.560
battle models, the LEGO hand models, and then the cut scenes. Exactly. But I think we were not going

33:42.560 --> 33:47.600
really have that this time. It'll be interesting. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. So your big fanboy

33:47.600 --> 33:53.920
moment, and I already know what this is, what made you, like, scream? And you told me in a text.

33:53.920 --> 33:58.800
Yeah. No, I said I freaked out. And I did. Jim was sitting right next to me because I'm reading

33:58.800 --> 34:05.600
the prompter. They're talking. And I see something that says, like, Rez video. I was like, oh, my

34:05.600 --> 34:13.440
god, no way. I just, like, freaked out. And, yeah, Rez existing again with getting at least,

34:13.440 --> 34:18.480
it looks like, a new stage. It just made me so happy to see that happen. It made me so happy

34:18.480 --> 34:23.280
just to see Tetsuya Mizuguchi again. I wanted that suit. I didn't get to try it because I'm not press

34:23.280 --> 34:26.720
and they're not, like, mass producing that suit. But I really wanted to see

34:27.360 --> 34:32.000
what that would feel like while playing the VR version. But you played, right? Oh, yeah. Oh,

34:32.000 --> 34:37.120
yeah. Because I whined. Because I had... You're really good at that.

34:39.200 --> 34:44.400
I had two VR appointments because you had to, like, sign up to go play VR games for the most

34:44.400 --> 34:49.120
part. Is it true? I heard that everybody signed up for these appointments and they lost them all.

34:49.120 --> 34:54.080
Like, there was some type of database corruption thing? Well, if there was, it wasn't by the time

34:54.080 --> 34:57.600
on my first day. My first day went fine, too. Okay. I heard there was some... But maybe earlier

34:57.600 --> 35:00.960
in the day, because I picked to go during the Call of Duty panel because, like, I'm really

35:00.960 --> 35:05.840
going to go sit through the Call of Duty panel. But, yeah, no, I didn't have a problem. But when

35:05.840 --> 35:10.320
I got up there, I was like, so how do I get to play Res? And she's like, well, you don't really

35:10.320 --> 35:13.920
get to pick. And I was like, well, I saw on the top. She's like, well, you can go this way. You

35:13.920 --> 35:18.160
might get a chance because they made you go either right or left. And if you went right, you went

35:18.160 --> 35:22.480
upstairs. If you went left, you stayed downstairs. And Res was upstairs. So I was like, okay, cool.

35:22.480 --> 35:27.040
So I go right and then I get to the part where we're waiting and they give us our PlayStation

35:27.040 --> 35:30.320
cards, which are awesome, the little collectible things. I want to ask about that, too, in a

35:30.320 --> 35:34.640
minute. But go on. And then I'm like, I talked to the lady. I'm like, man, I really just want

35:34.640 --> 35:39.280
to play Res. I really, you know, that's all I want. And she's like, well, we can't guarantee it.

35:39.280 --> 35:43.200
You know, you don't get to pick what game. You just get to go. I was like, that's fine. Cool.

35:43.200 --> 35:48.960
And then they announced that, you know, there's one for to go upstairs. And she's like, oh,

35:48.960 --> 35:52.480
there was another downstairs part, too, for that side. And she's like, well, if you want to go

35:52.480 --> 35:55.920
upstairs, that's your, you know, that's your chance. They don't say what game it is. I was

35:55.920 --> 36:00.000
like, okay, I'll go. And I get up there and I talked. I'm like, as I get up, I'm like,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.200
all I want to do is play Res. That's the only thing I want to play. And the girl's like,

36:03.200 --> 36:06.400
well, we can't, you know, let you pick. But the guy's like, you know, you, you know, you really

36:06.400 --> 36:12.320
like Res. I really like Res. Just wait right here and you can get on Res next. I'm like, yes. So I

36:12.320 --> 36:15.840
got to play Res HD. And it was just the first stage. Wait, you mean being nice to people

36:15.840 --> 36:21.760
sometimes works? I'm always nice to people. Just a note for people out there. Well, yeah,

36:21.760 --> 36:25.520
that's how I've got, like, first class tickets on planes before, too. Like, if it gets delayed or,

36:25.520 --> 36:29.040
like, canceled for the day and you have to go the next day, just don't care about it and be like,

36:29.040 --> 36:32.560
you know, it's fine. And they're like, here's a first grade class upgrade. Really? I don't know

36:32.560 --> 36:37.120
if you could be that passive about it. I was. But like, all the people in front of me were, like,

36:37.120 --> 36:40.400
all mad. And I get up there, I'm like, you know what, I'm sorry you had to deal with those people.

36:40.400 --> 36:44.240
I really don't care. Just, you know, book me. He's like, cool, here's a first class ticket.

36:44.240 --> 36:52.160
I'm like, all right, that's awesome. Anyway, but Res, it was basically everything I hoped it would

36:52.160 --> 37:03.520
be. The screens on the VR, not the sharpest quality. So they're touting, like, 1080p full

37:03.520 --> 37:10.560
60 frames per second. It looked good. It didn't look that to me. Well, you know, it's gonna be

37:10.560 --> 37:15.920
VR and television. Yeah, that's probably where the big thing's at. And I will never play it on

37:15.920 --> 37:24.400
television ever again. Ever. I will get it for that VR. But you only use X on the controller,

37:24.400 --> 37:29.040
and then everything else is your head. So you slightly move your head. Your little reticle is

37:29.040 --> 37:32.880
what moves with you. So, like, you have the enemies up here. You're moving your head all

37:32.880 --> 37:38.160
around there. You have to turn to, like, the left at times when the stage would normally scroll to

37:38.160 --> 37:45.680
the side. It was just fantastic. Did you, you said, I don't remember if this was you saying

37:45.680 --> 37:48.640
this to me, but you said something about you were kind of, like, bobbing to the music. Oh,

37:48.640 --> 37:52.240
yeah, I was like, that's the one thing you can't do. Because when I play music games, like, my head

37:52.240 --> 37:57.360
just goes up and down because I'm enjoying it. Well, and the guy next to me and myself, the lady

37:57.360 --> 38:01.840
told me our heads were bobbing up and down. And I could feel it because, like, my reticle's going

38:01.840 --> 38:08.640
up and down to the music. I'm like, oh, that's me doing that. So, that could potentially get

38:08.640 --> 38:16.640
in the way of playing. So, ResHD sold you on VR? Yes. It sold, well, I want to say yes. That was

38:16.640 --> 38:21.280
until I played VR games again today, because I had an appointment today, too, because I was like,

38:21.280 --> 38:25.200
well, I not have multiple appointments. So I could go play more games. Did you try to bat your

38:25.200 --> 38:29.920
eyelashes to get ResHD? Oh, no, I wanted to play Rush of Blood, the Until Dawn game, but they just

38:29.920 --> 38:34.880
weren't having it. I was like, oh, just, I guess I get to play whatever I get. And lucky me. Oh,

38:34.880 --> 38:38.240
so you're charm didn't work today. Well, I didn't try hard enough to because I was with

38:38.240 --> 38:43.920
Exeter and Matt. It's easier when it's just one? Yeah. It's kind of like when you're in a line at

38:43.920 --> 38:47.840
a theme park, it's like, usually there'll be an opening for one and you can kind of cut a lot.

38:47.840 --> 38:53.840
But if you're with a group, it's, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I guess. So, me and Exeter actually

38:53.840 --> 38:58.400
got thrown onto what I thought was going to be awful. We got Playroom VR. And I was like,

38:58.400 --> 39:02.640
great, you know, Playroom's kind of cool, but I really don't care about, like, Playroom VR.

39:03.360 --> 39:08.320
That is what sold me on, on the VR for real. Really? Yes. You haven't told me about this.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.320
No. What happened there? I didn't tell you anything about today.

39:11.760 --> 39:20.640
Fine. So I got to go first and my game was, I was this monster. And first of all, like,

39:20.640 --> 39:25.680
the graphics on Playroom VR, obviously better than what you're going to see on Res. So it already

39:25.680 --> 39:31.840
looks a lot better. But I was this monster and I had no control. I had no controller at all.

39:31.840 --> 39:36.400
All I could do is move my head left and right to try to run into buildings and break them,

39:36.400 --> 39:42.640
which was really fun. And then the other two players would try to stop me by throwing things.

39:42.640 --> 39:46.000
And every so often, like, helicopters would come and I'd have to headbutt them away,

39:46.000 --> 39:51.280
so I wouldn't lose health. That was super cool. And then at the end, you know, it's VR,

39:51.280 --> 39:53.840
so it's all... Wait, wait, wait. Were you playing against the other people in the room?

39:53.840 --> 39:55.280
Like multiplayer VR? Yeah.

39:55.280 --> 39:59.360
Wow. But they didn't have VR on them. They were looking at TV, and then I was the only one with

39:59.360 --> 40:03.120
VR. I don't know if there are two-player VR games because I didn't see any.

40:03.120 --> 40:08.480
Well, there was that whole Discs of Tron kind of thing that kind of didn't go.

40:08.480 --> 40:13.680
I hope what comes from that is a new sports champions game because I love that game series.

40:13.680 --> 40:18.080
Actually, you know, I remember when I got to do the VR, you know, at E3 when they first announced

40:18.080 --> 40:23.200
it, I remember the whole conversation about the fact that they wanted to have,

40:23.200 --> 40:27.920
that it wasn't just the VR, but, you know, the VR has a separate box that processes the VR.

40:27.920 --> 40:32.080
So it does the VR and the TV. Yeah. We saw different things on them.

40:32.080 --> 40:36.080
Exactly. So now you got that whole, like, Wii U thing going on, but instead of a game pad,

40:36.080 --> 40:40.800
it's whatever's the VR. So that's interesting that that could be... And I remember that discussion

40:40.800 --> 40:45.680
about we're trying to find ways to engage other people in the room besides just the person.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.440
I'll talk more about that because there were two other games.

40:47.440 --> 40:52.160
Go for it. But anyway, so the rest of my game was even better because I thought it was fun,

40:52.160 --> 40:56.640
like, hitting my head into buildings. It was great. And into helicopters. But at the end,

40:56.640 --> 41:02.560
we got to this, like, pier and it kind of sunk. So when it sunk, like, my headset,

41:02.560 --> 41:07.680
my virtual reality kind of bobbed and I felt it. It was so cool. And then they told me I should

41:07.680 --> 41:11.360
lose because I get the cooler thing if I lose. So I was like, OK, so I didn't dodge when they

41:11.360 --> 41:18.320
were attacking me. And so I lost. And then they pull out this big cannon and fire at me

41:18.320 --> 41:23.920
and they shoot me off of Earth. So I'm flying backwards. And that felt so cool.

41:23.920 --> 41:28.480
I absolutely loved it. Like, I think I got the best game out of the three we got to play.

41:28.480 --> 41:28.980
Wow.

41:30.400 --> 41:35.360
Then Xtaphir, it was his turn with the VR and we were playing this cat and mouse game. I didn't

41:35.360 --> 41:42.240
really care for that. He was a cat and he would have to, like, smack us from getting cheese.

41:42.240 --> 41:46.800
It was cute, but it wasn't really fun. And then the last game

41:47.760 --> 41:52.800
and we're doing this. So my game, I used no controllers. The other two people had just

41:52.800 --> 41:58.880
regular DualShock 4s. Christopher's game, he had no controllers. We had DualShock 4s. The last game,

41:58.880 --> 42:05.520
the random guy that we didn't know, he was a ghost hunter. And so he was using a DualShock 4. We had

42:05.520 --> 42:12.240
nothing. We were just in the room with him. So he's looking around and he has, like, sort of like

42:12.240 --> 42:18.560
a flashlight thing is basically what it turned out to be. And we would have to tell him on screen

42:18.560 --> 42:23.040
where to go to see the ghost. Because we could see the ghost on our TV, but he couldn't see the

42:23.040 --> 42:27.600
ghost in his VR. But he was the one that would capture them. So it's like a communication game,

42:27.600 --> 42:31.920
like Bomb Corp and all that stuff. Yeah, yeah. And it was really fun. I actually like that one too.

42:31.920 --> 42:36.720
So the cat game was probably my least favorite of the three. But yeah, so it was like a Ghostbusters

42:36.720 --> 42:41.200
game. That was really cool. So that sold you on VR. That sold me on it. Now let me ask this. Maybe

42:41.200 --> 42:44.880
going back to Rez a little bit, because that's a game I imagine a lot of our listeners...

42:44.880 --> 42:47.120
And I'm also gonna start eating too. I don't care.

42:47.120 --> 42:52.000
Well quickly, don't eat too much. Because that's a game I'm sure a lot of our listeners have played

42:52.000 --> 43:00.560
before. What was it about Rez VR that made it... Because you said, I can never play this on a TV

43:00.560 --> 43:05.760
again. Why? What was it about the VR that made it so that TV's ruined for you, for Rez?

43:06.320 --> 43:11.520
The feeling. Because while it's not the strongest in terms of VR except for moving your head,

43:12.400 --> 43:19.680
it did still have a feeling like I was the character flying in this space. And that was

43:19.680 --> 43:27.840
such a cool feeling. And it was so precise with the head movements. Given a little more practice,

43:27.840 --> 43:35.520
I could do all the same 100% everything and get all the 100% data that I used to get

43:35.920 --> 43:40.880
back in the day after I played Rez enough on Dreamcast or on PS2 or on Xbox 360.

43:41.440 --> 43:47.760
So the experience is just... It feels a lot different. It's a lot more fun.

43:49.280 --> 43:53.360
Okay. Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

43:53.360 --> 43:58.000
actdeaf says, Sony should probably hire Shane to sell the PlayStation VR at this point.

43:58.960 --> 44:05.520
Let's see. Akuma JP says, I can imagine Shane in sales. And Bobby Blackwolf says, presence.

44:05.840 --> 44:10.960
Is the term for what you felt. You felt presence, I guess, is something they probably used in the VR

44:10.960 --> 44:13.840
world for what you were describing there. Oh, I've never heard that term for that,

44:13.840 --> 44:19.280
but whatever. I felt like I was flying. Well, I like the way you described those games because

44:19.840 --> 44:24.480
here playing the home game, watching the streams, they say, we can't really show you VR. You have to

44:24.480 --> 44:29.200
experience it. Yeah, it's so true. You did a really good job explaining what that really was like to

44:29.200 --> 44:37.840
be there. The start screen for the Playroom VR was probably my third favorite part of Playroom VR,

44:37.840 --> 44:42.960
because I get the VR on and he's talking about how to play. I'm like, I don't care. I'm just

44:42.960 --> 44:46.080
going to look around a little bit. So I'm moving my head. I'm like, Oh yeah, this is VR because I

44:46.080 --> 44:51.520
can move around. But then I would lean forward and start to look at the little robots that are

44:51.520 --> 44:58.000
closer to me. And then I looked up and up high was the monster I was going to be in the game I played.

44:58.000 --> 45:04.800
And I was like, this is so amazing. I want this yesterday. Let me ask one more question about VR.

45:04.800 --> 45:09.120
Then I want to move on and talk about some of the other stuff at the Expo, but does PlayStation VR

45:09.120 --> 45:13.360
make you more interested in things like Oculus and the other VR technology out there? Yeah,

45:13.360 --> 45:18.720
I would actually, I've still never played Oculus and my computer could handle it. So I would like

45:18.800 --> 45:28.080
to try the Oculus Rift at some point. I worry that, I mean, Oculus already said they're going

45:28.080 --> 45:35.600
to be like $350 at least or $300 at least. I worry what the PlayStation VR is going to be,

45:36.160 --> 45:41.840
because if it costs the same amount as a PlayStation 4, that's not going to go over well.

45:41.840 --> 45:47.440
But I don't see it costing less than $200. It's going to be, my guess is $250. I think they're

45:47.440 --> 45:51.120
going to have to have two different SKUs, one with the camera and one without, because some

45:51.120 --> 45:57.040
of us already have the camera and I believe it uses the same PlayStation camera. I didn't even

45:57.040 --> 46:02.240
realize that the camera was there. Like the camera can see your lights, I'm assuming the lights on

46:02.240 --> 46:06.800
your helmet. And I believe for that game, you were all talking to him because could the camera see

46:06.800 --> 46:10.400
you guys? Could he see you guys in the thing? He couldn't see us. No, we had to just give him

46:10.400 --> 46:17.520
audio direction. I did find out though, Playroom VR, they wouldn't tell us obviously a launch date

46:17.520 --> 46:23.760
or a price. I'm sure people showing it to you didn't know. But they did say that they could

46:23.760 --> 46:30.560
say that it's going to come out day one with the headset, but they couldn't tell me if it's going

46:30.560 --> 46:36.080
to be free or bundled with the headset. Oh, interesting. It'll probably be bundled.

46:36.080 --> 46:42.080
I would say free. Yeah, bundled with Playroom was bundled with, well, Playroom came free with

46:42.080 --> 46:48.640
PlayStation 4. Yeah. So a good variety of games that they throw in with the headset will help

46:48.640 --> 46:53.680
lessen the blow of that cost because Bobby makes a great point in chat saying PlayStation VR will

46:53.680 --> 46:58.640
be more than Oculus because of that breakout box. The Rift is just a monitor and trackers.

46:58.640 --> 47:03.280
PlayStation VR adds a GPU and a CPU. That's a really good point. So that could really drive

47:03.280 --> 47:08.160
the price. Okay. But if it's more than Oculus, that's not worth it at that point. But I will,

47:08.160 --> 47:13.920
just to throw this out there too, makers like Sony and Microsoft, not so much Nintendo, but

47:13.920 --> 47:22.480
Sony and Microsoft have been known to take a loss on hardware to sell software. So that's true.

47:22.480 --> 47:25.920
It's true. I don't know how much of a loss they're willing to take on something like this,

47:25.920 --> 47:32.240
but just that there's something to think about. They could. So, okay. So outside of VR,

47:32.800 --> 47:38.320
what else did you get your hands on? I mean, I basically, with the exception of some really

47:38.320 --> 47:42.720
crappy looking games and some indie games, I got my hands on everything I wanted to play.

47:44.160 --> 47:47.120
Anything you played that you're like, ah, yep, I'm buying that when it comes out.

47:47.120 --> 47:51.520
Thumper. Been dying to play Thumper and I absolutely loved Thumper.

47:51.520 --> 47:59.360
That's the music game. The rhythm violence game is what they call it. And you're like this,

47:59.360 --> 48:05.200
they call it a space beetle. And it's just a music game. It's by two guys and their ex-harmonics.

48:05.200 --> 48:10.640
They are from the harmonics time when I still worked at Konami. So we all worked on the same

48:10.640 --> 48:16.960
games together because like karaoke revolution party that they worked on too. So it was fun

48:16.960 --> 48:24.880
chatting with one of them. And it's kind of like, it looks like to me, it looks like audio surf,

48:24.880 --> 48:34.160
like at first glance, but it plays kind of like a Parappa in the sense that musically the audio

48:34.160 --> 48:39.200
cues come first and then you're going to hit the buttons for it. But that's really hard for some

48:39.200 --> 48:48.960
people to grasp because with Parappa, you still see like visual cues. But you don't so much on

48:48.960 --> 48:56.480
this, but it was a lot of fun. He told me that they're going to be like 10 stages. It's rough.

48:56.480 --> 49:03.280
It is a pretty tough game too, but I loved it. I don't want to say it's a game of the show. It's

49:03.280 --> 49:08.720
hard to say a game of the show, but it's way up there. I will probably have a group of games of

49:08.720 --> 49:15.120
the show, but that would be one of them. I loved it so much. Quickly, anything else that you got

49:15.120 --> 49:17.920
your hands on that you want to share? There was like a ton. Why does it have to be quickly?

49:17.920 --> 49:20.560
We don't need to talk about anything else. We're almost an hour into the show,

49:20.560 --> 49:22.880
but we can always come back later if we still have more time.

49:23.920 --> 49:29.600
Other things. I played Amplitude. I played actually the remix of an old song from Amplitude,

49:29.600 --> 49:36.800
so that was fun. What else was amazing? There was an indie game called Shapes and Beats,

49:36.800 --> 49:45.280
and that was fun. It was a music like... everybody had a bit trip? You run around

49:45.280 --> 49:50.160
or fly around, try not to get hit by these things that are coming at you with the music.

49:50.160 --> 49:59.360
It was really cool. I played Parappa 2, the PS2 version, because it's not out yet for PS4,

49:59.360 --> 50:04.800
and it was just the PS2 version. I did not see any improvements, so whatever, but I'd still get it.

50:05.760 --> 50:09.520
Hot Shots Golf, the new one. Love that. I actually love golf games. Little-known fact.

50:10.480 --> 50:12.880
I always forget that myself, actually, until I start playing them.

50:14.000 --> 50:18.240
I was not impressed with a couple of games, so I think that's more fun to talk about.

50:18.240 --> 50:20.880
All right. I don't usually like to be negative.

50:20.880 --> 50:24.800
I'm not going to be super negative, because everything I played actually had redeeming

50:24.800 --> 50:32.240
qualities, but things that I was disappointed in. The Tomorrow Children. I didn't really know much

50:32.240 --> 50:39.600
about that, but when I played it, and it was a very long tutorial with the guy, and I'm sorry,

50:39.600 --> 50:46.080
they need to cut down some of these demos, because they just last way too long. He called it an MMO,

50:46.080 --> 50:51.680
which is not in the same vein of WoW or Final Fantasy XIV. It's just a massive world that you

50:51.680 --> 50:57.520
can interact with other players, but it's also mixed with Minecraft, and I'd also say SimCity.

50:57.760 --> 51:02.560
You got to go out, forage for materials, kill enemies that are trying to attack your town,

51:02.560 --> 51:08.640
and help build up your town. Everybody in your town helps to make it grow.

51:08.640 --> 51:11.760
Okay, but when you describe it, I'm kind of into it. What was wrong with it?

51:11.760 --> 51:18.160
The controls were a little clunky, and it was just a little bit boring. That might be

51:18.720 --> 51:23.440
because it was just a demo, and there wasn't a whole lot. It was also standing room only,

51:23.440 --> 51:27.280
and you're standing there for like, I swear that demo was like 25 minutes. It was not fun

51:27.840 --> 51:31.760
because of that, but there's going to be a beta. Everybody that went to the show and got their

51:31.760 --> 51:37.040
awesome badges scanned will be in it, so I'll be in it next month, but I don't know. I'm not

51:37.040 --> 51:41.840
really a big fan of Minecraft, and so this just felt kind of like a Minecraft game to me, but

51:41.840 --> 51:47.280
with really, really, really nice visuals. I have to give them credit. They did really nice work

51:47.280 --> 51:53.680
there, and then the other game I really, really wanted to like but was just kind of disappointed

51:53.680 --> 52:01.040
in was Bound. I forget which Sony studio that's coming from, but it was just announced on Thursday,

52:01.040 --> 52:05.920
but they had a playable demo. You're like a ballerina dancer sort of thing in this polygonal

52:05.920 --> 52:12.400
world. Visually amazing. The demo they had was pretty straightforward. It was a little bit of

52:12.480 --> 52:18.160
platforming, a little bit of story that I didn't understand. My problem is they are showing the

52:18.160 --> 52:22.160
character off to be some sort of dance dancer. She's very graceful. She does all these like

52:22.160 --> 52:28.480
dance moves whenever she does anything. There's a button to dance. You use it one time in the demo,

52:28.480 --> 52:33.920
and it seems pretty worthless, so I would like to see them incorporate more dancing,

52:33.920 --> 52:40.320
which I'm sure they will, just not in the demo, but I was disappointed with that.

52:41.040 --> 52:44.960
It's hard to be disappointed with that, though, because they did just announce it the day before.

52:47.440 --> 52:51.280
Heavy Rain didn't look that much better. Heavy Rain was there, the PS4 one,

52:51.280 --> 52:55.440
and it just got to look like Heavy Rain, whereas I think Beyond Two Souls actually did get a slight

52:55.440 --> 52:59.280
increase in visual quality. I love Heavy Rain.

53:02.320 --> 53:06.160
How about this whole metagame of the collecting the cards and getting a platinum trophy? What

53:06.160 --> 53:09.840
the hell was that all about? I don't know if people who weren't there really get that.

53:09.920 --> 53:15.120
They were giving away at booths these PlayStation cards. I guess it's something they want to do from

53:15.120 --> 53:19.840
now on because they're like, this is the first in the series or whatever. Basically, you had to do

53:19.840 --> 53:24.800
objectives to get cards sometimes, or sometimes they just gave them to you. There are rare versions

53:24.800 --> 53:29.600
of the cards, too. My first experience with the card is if you went to the keynote, you got this

53:29.600 --> 53:35.200
awesome card. It just says you went to the keynote. It's cool looking. Then after the keynote, we went

53:35.200 --> 53:39.520
downstairs, and we knew what we knew about these card things because me and Jim Flacco Jones were

53:39.520 --> 53:46.960
trying to get platinums. They had this whole trophy system, too. We go to the Last Guardian

53:46.960 --> 53:50.800
booth, which is just the big interactive wall that they had, I think, at Tokyo Game Show.

53:52.080 --> 53:55.440
This lady hands us both of the cards, the rare one and the regular one. We're like,

53:55.440 --> 54:00.880
cool. That's all we had to do. Some were uncharted, where you had to play the game,

54:00.880 --> 54:04.720
and you get the base card, but if you were the best on your team and your team won,

54:04.720 --> 54:09.600
you got the fancy card, which I did not get because our team lost. I was best on it. No,

54:09.600 --> 54:12.400
wait. I was third best, so I wouldn't have even got that. It just looked like I was first.

54:13.840 --> 54:17.200
But these cards, they're just collectible. They're cool. What? So funny.

54:17.200 --> 54:20.000
So I'm laughing at this comment in chat. S2100Matt says,

54:20.000 --> 54:23.520
a collectible card thing in Res? Did they cater this show to Shane?

54:24.960 --> 54:27.280
Yeah. I was like, what else could they do for me?

54:29.200 --> 54:32.240
And let's not forget the PlayStation's big color is blue.

54:32.240 --> 54:37.280
Oh, so blue. I think, honestly, if a Power Ranger had come out and hugged Shane,

54:38.720 --> 54:41.040
that's it. Shane would be in the hospital right now.

54:42.560 --> 54:50.080
Well, depending on which Power Ranger. But some of the things were ridiculous. So I got

54:50.080 --> 54:54.480
a Gravity Rush one because they had Gravity Rush remastered there. But to do that, I had to play

54:54.480 --> 54:59.200
the Hot Shots Golf, Gravity Rush, and the Tomorrow Children. I keep wanting to say People because

54:59.200 --> 55:07.680
that was a good Nickelodeon show. But I got done with the first two games. And then that Tomorrow

55:07.680 --> 55:11.200
Children game just took forever. I was like, I'm not going to get it. And eventually I did.

55:11.920 --> 55:19.600
But there was things like that. Sometimes our badges were their NFC. I think that's what it's

55:19.600 --> 55:24.560
called? Yeah, Near Field Communication stuff. So we'd have to get them scanned for other things.

55:24.560 --> 55:30.800
There were all these things we had to do on the PlayStation Experience app to get stuff too.

55:30.800 --> 55:34.960
And one of the things to get the Platinum Trophy was you had to go to the PlayStation Network

55:34.960 --> 55:42.080
booth and get it scanned. So I went there and I got mine scanned super quick. And then Flaco Jones

55:42.080 --> 55:45.920
and the rest of the people we went with, they went over there, but it was a different person

55:45.920 --> 55:54.320
at that time. Well, they had to go play or demo PlayStation View, PlayStation Now, Spotify.

55:54.880 --> 56:00.080
You guys got unlucky. So what was the point? You got a Platinum Trophy and?

56:00.080 --> 56:06.080
Nothing. That's it. So it's like the game? Well, here's well, first of all, this is my first

56:06.080 --> 56:10.800
Platinum Trophy on any PlayStation. You don't even get into your profile.

56:10.800 --> 56:16.960
No, I don't. And I don't. Yeah, I don't. That's sad. No, what's stupid is they're like,

56:16.960 --> 56:21.040
oh, it's super limited. The Platinum, not everybody's going to be able to get.

56:22.000 --> 56:27.760
Come to find out, somehow the gold trophies cards were the hardest to get. And they ran out when I

56:27.760 --> 56:33.680
went up to get mine because their app would not update yesterday, like at all for anybody. But

56:33.680 --> 56:37.440
some people got through with their apps. Some didn't. I was one of the unfortunate ones that

56:37.440 --> 56:43.360
none of my stuff came through until after the show last night. So I got two bronze trophies

56:43.360 --> 56:48.160
because they felt bad for me earlier yesterday, a silver one and a platinum one, but no gold one.

56:48.240 --> 56:51.600
And it just really makes me mad. This is a very interesting observation

56:51.600 --> 56:54.720
from our chat room. Make it a long one so I can take another bite.

56:54.720 --> 56:58.480
Sj100matt says, this is the most excited I've heard Shane be in a while.

56:58.480 --> 57:01.760
Bobby Black Wolf says, it's nice to hear Shane awake for once.

57:01.760 --> 57:05.280
Act Def says, it's like listening to a little kid excited about stuff.

57:05.280 --> 57:07.600
Go shopping with him for Power Rangers. Oh my gosh. Yeah.

57:08.480 --> 57:13.600
Sj100matt says his review of this show is far from meh, whatever.

57:13.600 --> 57:17.200
Because it wasn't. Like if it was, I would have said that.

57:18.720 --> 57:22.080
Um, so definitely going back next year. Yes.

57:22.080 --> 57:25.040
What if you have to go to Vegas to do it? I don't really like Vegas, but

57:26.080 --> 57:31.280
if enough people go, yeah, I think they'll keep it here because it's closer for them.

57:31.280 --> 57:33.840
Yeah. I think Vegas was just an accident.

57:35.440 --> 57:42.000
One thing, one funny thing though that happened, uh, was we were out in line today waiting to get

57:42.000 --> 57:50.160
in and you can't see because you're not here, but, uh, I'm wearing a PlayStation hat, a Nintendo,

57:50.160 --> 57:55.440
uh, zip up hoodie and an Apple shirt. And we were talking about that in line.

57:55.440 --> 58:01.360
And, uh, I think it was Annie asked, well, where's your Microsoft stuff?

58:01.360 --> 58:05.360
I said, well, I'm wearing Xbox underwear and the guy in front of us turned around and gave me this

58:05.360 --> 58:11.600
look. And then turned back around. I was like, that's awesome. I'm not really wearing Xbox

58:11.600 --> 58:17.600
underwear, but I thought it was funny at the time. I did run into like a lot of our friends

58:17.600 --> 58:24.160
too, like, uh, Justin and Carissa ran into the males. Um, you know, when that guy turned around

58:24.160 --> 58:28.560
and gave you that look, you should have said, and X marks the spot and given him a wink.

58:29.120 --> 58:30.400
I should have asked him if he wanted to see.

58:34.880 --> 58:38.480
All right. Uh, and that's the 200 Matt and Chad over at live.vognetwork.com says you're

58:38.480 --> 58:42.880
missing the point, Rob. It's collectible. It never matters. And bonds double 06 says

58:42.880 --> 58:47.840
Shane had an early Christmas. There it is. Well, they sure gave you a lot of stuff in

58:47.840 --> 58:51.520
those little swag bags. You kind of, I haven't opened everything up there. They gave us a really

58:51.520 --> 58:56.000
nice poster tube. I'm sure the poster inside is great. I don't even know what the poster is inside.

58:56.000 --> 59:01.200
Um, but the poster tube is so nice. They gave us a shirt. I got an uncharted shirt for playing the

59:01.200 --> 59:09.200
demo. Uh, I got an amplitude, uh, patch, uh, lots of cards. Um, they got another Sony shirt,

59:09.200 --> 59:14.640
this hat. It was overall, I mean, well, I'm, I'm sad. I wasn't able to go. I mean, just,

59:14.640 --> 59:19.600
I had the Capcom cup, which I thought was going to be awful. We sat through like the,

59:19.600 --> 59:24.560
the beginning of it today. So I don't know why I thought it was awful. I like Evo. I watch Evo

59:24.560 --> 59:30.240
sometimes and it was, it was a blast to watch too. So I'm glad that they, uh, they had something,

59:30.240 --> 59:35.840
but I would like more panels next year and yeah, more panels would be nice. Just more times where

59:35.840 --> 59:42.960
you can sit down because they just don't know how to do demos. Like you can't have a 25 minute demo

59:42.960 --> 59:47.760
standing up and then you're already in line waiting for somebody else to get off of it. So

59:47.760 --> 59:53.840
it's just, it's just was not very comfortable. Gotcha. All right. Well, cool. Oh, and a shout

59:53.840 --> 59:59.200
out to the Capcom lady, um, at her booth today. You're awful and you shouldn't do these events

59:59.200 --> 01:00:04.720
anymore cause you just, I wanted to punch you in the face. That's not a nice thing to say. Well,

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:09.120
okay. Me and Xfer went to go play Street Fighter and we get over there. She's like,

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:13.520
two. We're like, okay, we go over there. And, uh, um, his boyfriend goes to, we're, we're

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:18.320
staying there and it just says, press, press the options button. We're on arcade sticks. And we're

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.440
like, we don't know what this means. And so we don't touch anything. She comes over and she's

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.200
like, what did you guys do to the game? And I rudely back, I was like, nothing. We didn't do

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.840
anything to the game. And she kept screwing it up when she tried to get off that screen.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:36.080
So like, she needs to just not work conventions cause she was not very good. I can't believe

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.680
you just threatened to punch somebody in the face because you guys got rude. Like,

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.720
no, I mean, we don't, you know what? You're somebody first at a convention that,

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.280
that they're working. I understand. I had a very negative E3 experience involving a Capcom

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:56.320
employee as well. So for what it's all the other employees, they're great. Yeah. So just that one

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.720
Capcom, whatever it was the same person. Was it Capcom that it was at? I just said it was. Oh,

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.960
okay. Yeah. Um, yeah, it probably was. Who knows? Doesn't need to be, it is, it is a reflection of

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.800
your company. It's a customer service thing. Yeah. I was happy to leave when we were done.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.840
I wanted to play more, but I was like, I don't want to deal with her anymore.

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:18.960
All right. All right. Uh, G, Loki, you've been quiet over there while listening to

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:24.240
Shane be giddy. I am totally not doing anything. Anything you want to ask Loki about or Loki,

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:29.280
anything you want to ask Shane about whatever. No. All right. Well, uh, let's, let's move on

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.800
with the show. We still have plenty of news and other things we want to get into. Uh, but I'm,

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.160
I'm glad you had a good time. I mean, I'm kind of jealous. I didn't get to go, but I had some

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.120
other stuff that was important to going on here at home and I've, and I'm doing a con next weekend.

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.960
That was another thing is like, I didn't want to be conned out because the gamer X people were

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.720
there too. Remember? Right. Cause they were showing, I walked by them. I didn't read only

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.640
memories. I got my badge scan there. That was it. But, um, I was going to say last year, uh,

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.480
remember we did the final fantasy fan fest and then like, I think it was like three weeks later

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:04.800
was Blizzcon and even that I was like, I am conned out right now. So I didn't want to go through

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.960
that again this year, but we'll see. All right. Anyway, let's talk about, we usually at the top

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:13.680
of the show, Oh, it's only what, seven 15, uh, seven Oh eight. Uh, we usually talk about games

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.840
of the week. That's right. What games we've been playing this week. So, um, let's talk about what

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:23.200
types of video games we've been playing this week. Loki. Oh yes. I had lots of time to play Ingress.

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:30.400
So I played lots of Ingress and, you know, works boring. So I kind of look at Ingress stuff while

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:38.320
I work. And then, um, aside from the Ingress, I played fallout four and I love fallout four

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:43.280
and I'm glad that I can get it. This game for me is it was easier to get into than

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.880
new Vegas. For some reason I just did not like new Vegas. I don't know. The same time it was

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.280
with the Bolivian. I really could well believe in it kind of got into a little more, um, but

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.680
new Vegas, it was kind of hard to get into for a fall. You have a fall for it, no problem

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:04.320
whatsoever. And I'm definitely digging that game and not getting much of the story quest done

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.400
because I'm doing all the side stuff, get constantly distracted at all time.

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.440
So I'm definitely enjoying that. And then I also picked up just cause three, which I was

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.440
really looking forward to. Although the controls are a little wonky on that and it's kind of

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.760
frustrating. So I went back to fallout four after playing a few hours of that, I still need to go

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:25.040
back and play it because everybody seems to really like the wingsuit and stuff. I just found the

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:32.720
controls so fucking frustrating. Just wouldn't work right. And the vehicle physics just a little

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.640
too sensitive. You know, you hit a rock and this vehicle just flips over. It was really annoying.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:43.920
So, but I love just cause, and I really need to play more of the sandbox games. So I'm probably

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:49.600
gonna go back to that at some point. Um, so that's pretty much my week. Yeah. Mostly ingress.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.720
Okay. Uh, my gaming week, a lot of the same old stuff, but two new games.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.800
I can't wait to have an argument about one of these.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.000
Well then I'm going to do the first one that you can't argue with me about. So the first game that

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.320
I played, uh, was a stealth announcement, I guess, at the game awards. And I, I actually

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:10.640
didn't even, I tuned into the game awards way late because, okay, bad gamer. I forgot they were on.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:16.000
So I, but I caught up on Twitter and somebody said there was a new Tron game announced on steam and

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.280
I was like, what, what, what? And sure enough, you go to steam and there's a game called Tron

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:27.840
run R that's available on steam at steam early access, but it's, uh, it's there. And when it's

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:33.040
early access, it's definitely early access because there's like not even a title screen

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.960
or anything. It's like, here's, you launch the game and it's like, here's three files,

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:41.200
choose one. It's like level one, level two, level three. So you choose one. And then you kind of go

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.480
right into the interface of selecting the power ups your character is going to have. So, so here's

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:50.960
the thing, the Tron game, it's not an endless runner. You would think from the name run R it's

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:56.960
an endless runner. Um, it's, it's more of a runner with an end because each day is definitely has a

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:02.480
beginning and an end. And in that sense, it's kind of like a music game. Like it feels a little

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:09.120
bit audio surf ish to me, but music is an integral to what's going on with the game. Like when you

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.440
throw discs at enemies, you're not necessarily doing it in time to the music or trying to break

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:19.680
walls or whatever, but the visuals in the game are pretty hot. And like, you know, it looks a

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:24.480
lot like Tron. And so of course, you know, the music is kinda, you know, the, the same type of

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.040
electro stuff you'd expect to hear in Tron and you're moving fast through all these colors.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:33.120
And in some parts, you know, you jump. And so you'll like, and you, you get the butterfly

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.080
wings. Remember in the new Tron movie, they would have the butterfly wings that came out at some

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:40.800
point. I know they have another actual name, but, uh, so you use, you'll use the wings to fly. And

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:44.960
so you try to land on these other platforms that'll help you fly through. And it's just

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:50.640
like the, the visuals and the way things look in the game are great and kind of what really

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:55.840
sells me on it. So I'm hoping that the soundtrack continues to be awesome. And I really,

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:59.280
really hope if it's an official Tron game, which it must be, or they would have been seasoned

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.600
decision by now. I really hope they're able to get like some of the Tron legacy soundtrack in

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.920
the game or something, or, but, but it's so mysterious because I don't even think it says

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.600
who the publisher is. I don't know. I don't know who made the game. Uh, does anyone out there know

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:18.000
who made this? Cause I it's kind of a, and then, so that has some people going, is this like a

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.960
stealth announcement of Tron three? I don't know. I think that's a, well, one of the achievements

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:28.000
apparently is named Tron three, but you can't earn the achievements in the game yet. It's,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:34.160
it's kind of weird in that regard. So, um, but yeah, uh, act deft and chat says bit trip runner

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:39.520
with Tron. That is not a bad comparison, but again, bit trip runner, everything you do is

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:45.120
timed with the music and Tron runner doesn't really have that, but I enjoyed it. Um, it's

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:50.160
10 bucks, but it is early access. But the good news is that mean there's a lot, lot more to come.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.200
You're looking at some of the screenshots over there. Loki. I was just trying to see who the

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:59.680
publisher was, but yeah, it's not there. So that's kind of a mystery in itself. Like

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:04.880
where did this game come from and who did it? Um, so we'll see. The other game I played this week,

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:11.600
I picked up on Friday and that game is Xenoblade Chronicles. Well, I, I, here's the thing.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.200
I need to read the messages you sent me. Are you going to backtrack? No, go ahead. Read the

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.840
messages I sent you on this game, but I want to, I want to preface. This is a game that is hundreds

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:26.960
of hours long interactive because it's on their end user license agreement. Oh, so it is Disney

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:31.120
themselves. Did it? Does he interact? Okay. Good to know. Thank you. Um, I do want to say this.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:36.000
I'm only on chapter three, but these are some early impressions I have of the game. Go ahead.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.320
Read, read actual text. I can't believe you are violating our privacy. I'm not going to read like

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:44.800
important things. This is actually pretty important. All right, go ahead. Um, I'm just

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:50.320
going back to where I want to start. It's so negative about things on the stuff you said,

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:56.240
like talking about how you didn't think the presser was good or whatever. Um,

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.640
I should have planned this better. You should have planned this a little better. Live radio.

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:08.240
Where basically you can just talk about this instead. All right. Good job. Failed attempt

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:16.800
to violate my privacy by Shane lingo. Um, so, uh, when I'm trying really hard to like it,

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:22.000
but it's testing my patience. I might be done with Xenoblade. I don't like it.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:29.360
Uh, I think that was really, that's the most recent one. Okay. When I first played the game,

01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:35.760
I was really into it. I was like, Oh, this game is, is really pretty. Um, I was getting

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.920
kind of a white knight Chronicles vibe from it. Well, see, here's the thing. I liked that game

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:46.880
a lot more than most people did. So I kind of consider that a compliment, but some of the

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.280
problems I had with white knight Chronicles, like some of the dialogue and the cut scenes,

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:55.840
I started to notice I'm not really enjoying in Xenoblade Chronicles X either is that as the

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:02.240
game went on, I was like the writing in this game, it's written for text boxes, yet it's being acted

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:07.760
out. And it's kind of trying my patience in one of the scenes where they're going over the eight

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:14.640
different branches of the blade organization. And I'm like, Oh my God. And that's like at

01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:18.800
the end of another scene. I mean, some of the scenes go on a very long time, but whatever.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:24.320
I mean, I can, I can overlook that, but did you just as a quick interjection, when he asked that

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.640
one guy asks you, if you want, if you're going to join blade, it's like, yes or no. Did you do? No,

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:34.000
I did. No, it wasn't that great though. Cause he, the look he gives you and it zooms in on him.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:40.960
So funny. I didn't know. And guess what happens? The whole thing starts over the whole dialogue

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:45.280
changes. So a little bit, but then they go right back into the, well, eventually he just,

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:50.720
he's just looking at you with those eyes. It's like, really? Well, what I did, I, so I hit start

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.680
and I skipped once I realized it was a repeat and everything. I just hit start and skip the cut

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:58.480
scene. I was like, all right, that was a mistake. Um, so, so here's the thing. I was really into

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.520
the game. It's really good looking. Even if the interface is really, really busy, I'm kind of

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:08.640
surprised they don't use the game pad for more of that. The interface is busy. It's super busy. I

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.120
don't think so. Like I see complaints about that and I don't see it. Like the only time I could

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:18.000
consider it busy is when I hit the, the plus button to pull up all those extra menus. But if I'm not

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.160
in that, I don't think it's busy at all. But it's weird that that doesn't go down to the game pad.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.920
And I, they, they do use the game pad for other stuff, which you haven't probably got because

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.120
you've been at the PlayStation experience. You know, I'll talk about my, you know, blade,

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:33.200
you're only on chapter one, right? Oh, you know, I'm not technically even on chapter one. We'll

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:37.920
talk about that. This is my thing. As I said, Shane, I want to hear from you when you get to

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.320
the point in the game that I'm at, because for those first couple chapters, I was really into it.

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:45.920
And then here's, here's the problem where I'm at in chapter three. Okay. So I'm going through the

01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.680
story today. So now I get a story quest for chapter three and I'm going out into the world

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:54.880
and I'm going to kind of go from point A to point B to where I'm supposed to go on the map. And it's

01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:00.080
like, okay, so I'm level eight and I'm walking by all these little mobs that are like level seven,

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:04.800
maybe some level nine, but I'm like, Oh, keep walking that direction. Cause generally in JRPGs,

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.120
everything will be about your level and I can grind a little bit. Nope. I get not even halfway

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:14.400
to where I'm supposed to go. And the mobs are like 11, 12, 13, and there's this random ass

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:21.040
level 80 something gigantic thing that patrols around. It reminds me of having to stealth in

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:26.560
final fantasy 11 and all this stuff. So I was like, okay, so clearly I'm not at a point where

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:36.560
I can do chapter three. Okay. So I'll do some side quests and I try to do some of the side quests and

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.720
it's like the mobs for those quests are like level 13 or level 11. And I'm like, am I just supposed

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:48.400
to find the level seven and eight, nine mobs of which there's not a huge concentration of them

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:53.760
and just grind them over and over? Is that, I mean, I get it's a JRPG, but the, I mean,

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:59.200
I've played a lot of JRPGs. Okay. And I've stuck up for things like blue dragon, lost Odyssey.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.240
Oh, you don't have to stick up for lost Odyssey. Everybody loves lost Odyssey.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:05.760
But, but you know what I mean? Like I have a patient like lost Odyssey also had a lot

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:11.280
of grinding and I was okay with that, but the pacing feels really, really off to me in this

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:15.840
game. And it's kind of ruining it for me. And that's why I was sending these angry texts.

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.920
It was just a shame. I'm like, the pacing in this game is fucked and I don't like it at all.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:28.160
And, uh, the game tutorial, like it baffles my mind how they spend all this time talking about

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.360
some things, but then other things it's like, if you don't read the manual, you're not going to

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.280
understand it at all. And there's no paper manual. Of course you have to sit there and read it on

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:41.520
your game pad. You know, it's like, if it's one thing, if I could go take a potty break and read

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:48.080
the manual, you could take that in there with you. It's portable. Yes, that's true. But I'm just,

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:53.600
I don't know. Like the pacing feels really off to me. And that's why I'm like the Shane,

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.840
I don't think you're, I know you're here sticking up for it and that's fine,

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.720
but I don't think you're far enough to be bothered by what's bothering me.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.440
But what's bothering you when we, when I talk about, I will tell you why it doesn't bother me.

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.800
All right. Well, that was my gaming week. So Shane, how was your gaming week?

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.000
Well, first of all, well, okay. But it's the game I played the least out of the things I'm

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.040
going to talk about. My first one, I started playing Mass Effect 3 again. Why? I just wanted

01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:21.040
to, and I love it. I forgot how much I love it. You were secretly hoping Andromeda would somehow

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.000
be at the place. Yeah. I started watching videos on Andromeda. I think that was what was like,

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.240
it's time to start playing Mass Effect 3 again. And I am a huge lover of Mass Effect 3 and all

01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:34.480
things Mass Effect. So I'm having a blast with that. Cause I'm in my Final Fantasy 14

01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.600
funk phase right now. I'm just like, I don't really want to play it.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.880
So that's Mass Effect 3. Okay. Now I'll talk about Xenoblade. So I didn't get a lot of time

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.840
with Xenoblade Chronicles X, but I will say I haven't beaten it yet, but I do have Xenoblade

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:53.120
Chronicles 3D on my 3DS and I love it. It's great. Love the combat, love everything about it.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:14:00.240
So I spend like, you know, it's me an hour making my character on Xenoblade Chronicles X. I give

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:07.120
him Shulk's voice cause I love it. And then literally I play the little beginning part where

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:12.640
you're in the rain and I do the demo, the tutorial, whatever it's called. That's fine. And then

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:18.160
the scene where it turns sunny is breathtaking. Love it. Great. This music's awesome. And then

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.000
they're like, okay, let's go to town. You know, you shouldn't go down. It's going to be really

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.960
hard. You just, you know, take the upper path. And what I would assume if you do it, just, you know,

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.400
hit the enemies on the way and take the upper path, probably takes you 10 minutes.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:37.120
I took almost an hour and a half because I was having so much fun attacking,

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:40.720
so much fun running around. I saw enemies that there's no way I could have killed,

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.760
but I would try to get around them to go to other places. For the record,

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.920
I did do a little bit of that too. Okay. An hour and a half. I didn't take the lower path.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.960
I fell down to the lower path a couple of times. You said it took you about an hour to get to NLA.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.320
That was actually an hour and a half because it was like one hour and 20 minutes.

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.640
I probably got there at about an hour and 15.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.200
Okay. So you did the same thing as me. Okay. I don't understand.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.160
It was collecting the little blue diamonds. I was like...

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:06.240
Oh, you'll see those all over the place.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.080
Yes. Shane, I'm aware. I'm further than you.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:17.120
Well, I'm just saying from Xenoblade Chronicles regular reasoning. And then I hit New LA and I

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.240
do the fight there. And then I have to turn it off because I have to get ready to go to

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:27.520
PlayStation Experience. But everything that you said you don't like about it, I love already.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:35.200
I'm not an open world person. Somebody described this as Japanese developers take on a Western

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.000
open world RPG. I can kind of see that, but I love the combat. I love the music.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.480
I don't get bored with the combat at all. Even killing the same things over and over again.

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:51.840
I learned the little cat rat monsters that are down by the water, you can cut their ears off.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:55.600
And I was like, oh, that's something fun to try. So I kept doing that

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.440
because you can target different body parts.

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.160
Yeah. And the game never explains that.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:07.600
Yeah. Well, it doesn't explain it so much as it's always in the upper right corner. It says

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.240
lock on to...

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:11.200
But it doesn't tell you why you'd want to do that or the advantage it gives you.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.000
Well, I just think you should understand.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:18.000
Target ears. Advantage. You're a heartless bastard.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.120
Pretty much because these things are adorable. But no, everything that you say you don't like

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:27.760
about it. You're running from point A to point B and there's enemies that are way too high for you

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.400
or side quests that are a little too high. I like that stuff.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:33.440
Here's the thing. I'm willing to give the game another chance. I'm not sitting here going...

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:34.480
And I still want to do multiplayer.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:38.320
It's terrible. I don't know how because every time I go to the thing it says

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:44.400
currently undergoing maintenance. But anyway, I'm still willing to give the game a chance,

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:48.560
but I'm waiting for you because I know by noon tomorrow you'll be caught up to where I'm at.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:53.360
And I need you to tell me what I'm doing wrong to get through chapter three because

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:55.840
it's not working for me right now.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.000
What division did you pick?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.120
The pathfinders.

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.120
Okay. I don't know what I'm going to pick yet. I haven't decided.

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:08.080
Because the beacon things... Exploration sounded fun. And now I regret that choice.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.320
Apparently it doesn't really affect anything.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.800
I've tried to research. And I even went on Game Facts. I'm like,

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.480
has anyone done a fact? Nope. Let me go on the board. Search chapter three.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.080
And I'm not really finding a lot.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:23.360
The one thing I will hit the game for is the controls.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.280
I kind of thought they were going to be like Xenoblade Chronicles.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.920
And the buttons are in different spots. It's really weird because of that.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.120
They're not bad, I guess, if you're not currently playing Xenoblade Chronicles like I am.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:42.640
But that's the one thing I would say is unsatisfactory to me right now.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.040
But the music is great. The music is just the best.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.240
Yeah, it does have some good music.

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:48.800
I love the battle theme. I don't care if everybody else hates it because it's random.

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.880
The boss. Some of the boss music is really good.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:51.600
Oh, I can't wait.

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.640
Okay. Is that it for your gaming week?

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.760
That is it for my gaming week.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.600
Okay. We can get into housekeeping here in 90 minutes.

01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:02.080
Here's the thing. All right. We're not going to have a show next week.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.560
And I know that's probably disappointing to hear. And I kind of apologize.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:10.240
Well, I do apologize because we weren't here last week.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.840
And we weren't here a few weeks ago when I had the flu.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:18.320
And you know, I am very big on being regular with podcasts.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:23.200
And I really don't like to just take weeks off all the time, but life happens.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.920
And I know for most, most of you guys are really understanding.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:30.080
And I thank you for that. I just don't like to miss so many weeks.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:33.440
But the reality is November was just kind of a shit month.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.400
I got the flu, which, you know, obviously killed the show that week.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.040
And then last week, here's the thing.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:45.120
We had canned the show anyway, because the show was Thanksgiving weekend,

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.800
which also happened to be Dan's birthday.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.440
So we knew Jamie would be out and was like, all right, well, you know,

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.520
Loki and I will probably have some other stuff we want to do.

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.040
So let's just cancel the show.

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:58.880
I actually had, and I had a really bad accident on Sunday and I hurt myself pretty bad.

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.280
Where like, I had a swollen lip.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:05.920
So ironically, even if we hadn't canceled the show in advance,

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.400
I couldn't talk for three hours last Sunday.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:09.680
So we would have had to cancel it anyway.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.360
So that was kind of just a shitty thing that happened.

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:12.400
I'm fine, by the way.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.480
I got checked out by a doctor and everything, and I'm fine.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:18.320
But it was just still kind of ruined my day that day.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.280
And what's happening next week.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:25.520
I mean, this is a good reason to cancel is that we're going to a convention.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.200
We're going to be sponsoring VOG Network.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:31.360
We'll be sponsoring GX, Everybody Games, which is going to be in San Jose next week.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:33.360
And we have a table there, but here's the thing.

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:34.800
The convention actually doesn't end.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.880
I thought we'd be able to sneak out of there early,

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:39.680
but the convention doesn't end until like seven.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:44.640
And Jamie is all about the cosplay stuff, and that's the very last thing they're doing.

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:47.760
So we're just, we're not going to be able to get home in time to do the show.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.760
So again, I know many of you are understanding,

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.040
but I know there's also some of you out there that are like, oh, what are we?

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:55.840
And I take, I'm very flattered when it's, you know,

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:59.440
how am I going to fill three hours this week with no OLR?

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:02.000
So, yeah.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.400
So, and I'm looking at some of the comments in chat.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.880
SGA100Matt says, OLR, the fiber of podcasts.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.680
We're regular.

01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:08.880
Yes, that's where I like to be.

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:13.280
And also some well wishes and glad I'm okay.

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.720
Yeah, I'm perfectly fine.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.280
I actually, I don't know how much I should talk about this.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:22.960
I actually, because I took a really nasty fall, I chipped my tooth and it's my front tooth.

01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:28.000
Luckily it's not very noticeable, but certainly I notice it.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.840
And I'm just paranoid it's going to get worse.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.560
But thank God I have a dentist appointment this coming week.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:35.440
And they were like, oh yeah, we can just do a little filling and your insurance covers it.

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.240
And I'm like, whew.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:38.080
But still like it kind of freaked me out.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:41.040
You know, you chip your front tooth and it's like, that's like a permanent thing, right?

01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:43.120
So whew, thankfully that's going to be an easy fix.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.200
But just to give you an idea, like how serious it was

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.360
and why I wouldn't have been able to do a show last week anyway.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:50.080
So anyway, yeah, we will not be here next week.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:54.720
But the good news is, whereas I bet many of your podcasts are not going to tape

01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.240
for Christmas and New Year's as many of us don't, which is fine.

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.440
Actually the days work out really well for us this year.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:07.760
We will still be continuing to give you Sunday shows throughout the holidays.

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.280
So we will still be here Christmas week.

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.560
We will still be here New Year's week.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:14.560
So that's the trade-off is that we will continue through the holidays.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.440
So at least you get that.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:19.920
I don't foresee after next week we will have any more shows off.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.440
Until February when I'm going to MAGFest.

01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:27.200
Which I can't believe that's already kind of creeping up on us.

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:31.040
But yeah, February I'll be going to MAGFest in the Washington DC area.

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:32.640
So we won't have a show way out there.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.840
So no show next week.

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:39.200
But if you are going to be at GX, please come by and say hi.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.800
VOG Network will be in the expo hall.

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.680
We'll have a small table.

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:43.200
I will have some little things to give away.

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.400
I can't wait to help spread more awareness out there.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.800
Because I think a lot of the 20-somethings that are probably attending this con probably

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.320
do more of the live streaming and that stuff.

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.120
Which is cool.

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:58.000
But I want to say, hey, podcasting is out there too for your car rides or for your data

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.480
entry job or things where you can do audio but not visual.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.920
I just want to remind people that podcasts are out there.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:07.280
And hopefully help them find a podcast on the network that's good for them.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:09.760
I'm not just there to sell OLR, though I certainly will.

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:13.520
If people say we like video games, I'm going to say, hey, there's OLR.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.560
There's also Bobby Black Wolf.

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:19.680
There's Ninja and Panda on Electric Sisterhood.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.520
And then if they say they like Star Trek, then there's Grandpa's show.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:27.600
And if they like movies and TV, there's certainly Critical Myth, Pod Culture, that

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.160
whole thing.

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:29.760
So we'll be there.

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:37.440
Also at GX, a panel Friday 3 o'clock is podcast Cross Zone 3.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.800
I will be moderating and with some other podcasting pals out there.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.160
Jamie's going to be on the panel as well.

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.280
We have some other people you haven't seen on the panel before.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.320
We have some new people this year.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.240
DJ Kirkland, who does Joystick Jockeys, is going to be joining us.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.840
And Mario from La Polanca is going to be on the panel as well.

01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:59.200
And this year's theme is Using Your Voice Constructively.

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:01.680
Can you believe they're letting me moderate that?

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.440
Using Your Voice Constructively.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:04.480
No, in all seriousness.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.840
And we'll take your questions as well.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.240
So please come out and say hello if you're going to be at GX Friday at 3 o'clock and

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:10.720
at the table.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.640
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with bognetwork.com,

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.480
use the passphrase, vacation.

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:24.080
I have an update to my week of gaming or whatever, because this is really important to me.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:24.960
I forgot about it.

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.400
We know how much I love Splatoon.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.080
So there was a Splatfest this weekend that I did not get to participate in.

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.040
And I did pick a shirt because I picked a team.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:39.040
And this is in all the history of Splatfest, this is the first time I picked the winning

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:41.360
team, but I did not get to participate.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.840
And it kills me.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.600
You played the psychology game, right?

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:47.120
Because you knew burgers would be less popular.

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:47.600
Exactly.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:53.360
I didn't want to, I wanted to be pizza, but I picked burgers because history has shown

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:56.640
for the most part, if you pick the least popular team, you're going to win.

01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:01.840
So I'm just really upset that I actually had a winning team this time.

01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:05.120
And I could have got a lot of stupid sea snails.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.640
But no, I was at something else and I didn't get to play.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:11.840
I totally forgot to play too, because I was too busy trying to figure out what the fuck

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.200
to do in XCX.

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:15.920
But you were lost.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:16.640
You picked pizza.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.400
No, I didn't pick any of them.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.840
Oh, well you didn't pick any of them.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:24.640
I was probably going to pick burgers for the same reason, your rationale, was that it was

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.240
going to be less popular and therefore it was going to...

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.000
Yeah, it just, it hurts so bad to actually know I could have won finally.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.480
Well, the good news is they should do, they'll have another one in two weeks.

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:33.920
Yeah, Europe got theirs announced.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.040
Theirs is pineapple on pizza, yay or nay.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:40.480
I'm like, oh my gosh, who's running Europe's Splatfest?

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.400
It's so bad every time.

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:44.880
Pineapple on pizza, yay or nay.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:49.360
But like, I'm that crowd, I love pineapple.

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.520
It's a little weird on pizza, but I don't hate it.

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.560
It's not even the point.

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:56.080
It's like, why is that something that you have to pick a side on for Splatfest?

01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:02.320
Maybe they should have done like Hawaiian pizza or pepperoni and sau-

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:03.520
That's a little better.

01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:04.400
What's a popular combination?

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.640
Live or die, make a choice.

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:11.360
It's just like they've had North Pole versus South Pole.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.720
Well, Europe probably doesn't care about either pole, so why do you have to pick?

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:17.040
Okay, because the South Pole has penguins.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.480
Now the North Pole has Santa Claus, but I'm still going to side with penguins.

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:21.680
Yeah, I probably would too.

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:22.400
There you go, right?

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.560
Wait, there was, did you see the penguin in the mech at the-

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.240
Yeah, I was like, that's so cute.

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.280
And then it started talking, I'm like, that is not as cute now.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.120
I do not like its voice.

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:36.240
But it was a game I didn't really have any interest in.

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.240
All right, we got to get into some news.

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:42.160
DarkSagra is texting me going, you guys haven't gotten to my segment yet.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.680
I'm like, actually, we're just now in How Was Your Gaming Week?

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:48.800
Because Shane talked for a good 45 minutes about the PlayStation Switch.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.600
You asked me to come over.

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.560
But you did a great job.

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:51.520
No, you did a great job.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.080
You really did.

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:55.760
There's a lot more too, but apparently I'm not talking about that.

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:59.120
Some shows, man, some of those episodes of Hoard House, you wouldn't say a damn thing,

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.640
but you just have to get excited.

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.640
I just have to care about what I'm talking about.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.800
If I don't care, then I'm not going to be excited to talk about it.

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.720
All right, now let's talk about Final Fantasy 14.

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:10.560
All right.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.760
Don't care about that right now.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.520
All right, moving on.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.720
Let's get into some news.

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:16.160
Loki's probably getting bored too.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.040
I'm sorry, Loki.

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.000
You all right?

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.040
Planning your next field?

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:22.080
Planning my drive home.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:22.320
All right.

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.040
Oh, actually, no, we already did your story for the kickoff topics.

01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.000
We need to do me, huh?

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:28.560
I don't know.

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.080
I'm prepared too.

01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:31.440
I don't even have the show roll up.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:31.680
Yep.

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.200
Talk more about the PlayStation experience.

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:37.520
All right, yeah.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:39.520
Tell us one other quick thing you haven't talked about yet.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.160
Oh, crap.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:40.720
Only one?

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:44.720
Pick one.

01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:47.280
Another game you played.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.400
What was another game I played?

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:51.840
I'll just talk about Thumper some more because everybody needs to play Thumper when it comes

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:52.400
out.

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:54.560
Thumper is so good visually.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.600
It's really pretty.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:00.560
If you like rhythm games, because that's all it really is, despite the way it looks, is

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.680
such a good rhythm game.

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.680
Do they have a release date window for it yet?

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.280
He just told me 2016.

01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:07.120
Like every game.

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.600
But they do have a Twitter and a mailing list and all that.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.480
So you should definitely check it out.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.840
Watch some videos.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:16.240
It feels violent when you play.

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.360
It's pretty awesome.

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:21.360
So if you like beating things up, this is good too for you.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.680
Like you were about to do to somebody over a controller.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.920
Well, if they were, no, they're just rude.

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:26.400
All right.

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.800
If you want to play something that's coming out this year, and for free.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.760
Then there was nothing at that PlayStation experience for you.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.800
You could, you know, well, no, I guess.

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.240
And a lot of stuff that's already out, actually.

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.000
This came out of the Game Awards.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.520
But anyway, here's the deal.

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.080
Shadow Complex Remastered.

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.360
It was actually announced during the Game Awards.

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:52.480
And there's a PC version that's available right now on the Shadow Complex website.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.280
Here's the deal.

01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:54.240
It's free.

01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:59.760
So if you want to play the Shadow Complex remaster, you can go do that for free on PC.

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:03.040
There will be a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version, but no date on that yet.

01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.880
And I imagine those will not be free.

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:10.000
Also, when I say free, when I went to the website to start to do it, it wanted to install

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.400
the Epic Games installer and all this stuff.

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:17.200
So I kind of feel like, yeah, it's free, but they're probably going to try to push some

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.240
other games on you.

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.840
So I haven't done it.

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.840
Maybe somebody in chat who has actually played at this point can enlighten me if there's

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:28.400
any types of advertisements or how they justify that free price.

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.600
Yeah, Dark Tetsuya says, oh yeah, you need the Epic installer for that.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:35.360
So anyway, Shadow Complex, if you've never played it, it was on the Xbox 360.

01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:38.800
It was one of their Xbox Live Arcade releases in 2009.

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:43.600
And it was given a lot of praise for being a Metroidvania type of game.

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.560
But it's more like a spy shoot type of thing.

01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:52.000
So I guess it's maybe more like Bionic Commando in that regard.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:52.560
I don't know.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:55.840
But anyway, yeah, I like Shadow Complex enough.

01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:57.600
So I hope to check this out soon.

01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:58.820
Loki.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:00.560
All right.

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:08.080
So this is really exciting because I haven't been able to play my Fallout 4 in Just Cause

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:09.680
3 because my wife's watching TV.

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:17.760
But just like on the Xbox One, they are working on remote play support for PC and Mac.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:22.320
So you'll be able to stream your games to your PC, which is fantastic.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:25.920
I would seriously get a ton of use out of this.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.840
And so I hope that is a thing that happens very soon.

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:34.720
Otherwise, I'm going to have to actually build my second screen controller device thing that

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.560
I bought the parts for but never did anything with.

01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:40.640
Do you guys find that you use this remote play feature?

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:44.720
Because I'm kind of, I was going to ask this as the Fugu question of the week, but I opted

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.600
for something else.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:49.440
Like, do you guys use these remote play features?

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.280
Are they useful for you, Shane?

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:54.080
I never, I think I've done it once.

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:58.800
Actually, back when it was PSP and PS3, I streamed to my PSP.

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:05.120
I was like, I don't really like this, but I see it now, especially with the Vita.

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.760
And I'm sorry, I really wasn't paying attention to what this, what we're talking about.

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:09.600
No, I completely forgot.

01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:14.240
I have my stupid PlayStation TV that's just sitting there buried because it's so small.

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.960
I just strapped that to my screen in remote play.

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:17.520
There you go.

01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:21.040
I saw Sony really position the, I mean, they talked about Vita.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:25.440
This weekend randomly, it was weird, but I think they're really trying to show with

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:31.520
all these like cross buys with PS4 and Vita now that the Vita is basically your remote

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.840
play thing for your PS4.

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.320
So I would like to use it more.

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:40.960
I think there are some really good games that would be more fun if I didn't have to always

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.160
just be by my TV.

01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:47.760
And I guess now that it's for, that they're talking about doing it on your PC, I could

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:50.640
play something on my PC that I wanted to play on my TV.

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:54.720
And then my TV can play Twitch because it's all I watch on TV anymore, I feel like.

01:30:54.720 --> 01:31:01.280
I have found that the remote play is something I use on the PC for the Xbox One.

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:05.520
I actually have streamed Xbox One to my PC because my PC is in my office.

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:08.240
So like if Alan's gaming, then I can kind of be in there too.

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:10.400
We can kind of both be gaming, doing our own thing.

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:13.920
And it's usually, especially in these winter months, it's a little warmer in my office.

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.520
So I tend to kind of like to be in there.

01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.720
And I was playing, funny enough, I didn't talk about this during my gaming week because

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:24.240
it's a really old game, but Dungeon Siege 3 was free on the Xbox games with gold.

01:31:24.240 --> 01:31:26.160
So I actually downloaded that to Xbox One.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.360
I've been streaming that over to my PC and playing a little bit of that.

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.120
So that is a feature I use.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:35.040
That'd be kind of cool if the PlayStation did that without me having to get one of those

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:35.600
TVs.

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.240
Yeah, exactly.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.720
Because well, they're only $20 now.

01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:41.680
Yeah, they'll be at the dollar store soon enough.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.400
But no, they're, it's small enough.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.320
I should just put that together.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:51.920
I just haven't bothered to do that because it's kind of awkward to have that second screen.

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:54.240
I have a battery pack and everything ready to go.

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.800
I just need to wire it up and build a case for it.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.360
Actually, the building the case for it was actually what's holding it back.

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:02.000
But I can duct tape it together.

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:04.080
That'll be just as good, right?

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:06.080
Maybe.

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:09.760
All right, let's talk about the NX.

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:12.160
Not to leave Nintendo out of these discussions.

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.880
We've talked a lot about Sony and I just talked a little bit about Microsoft.

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:20.640
But Nintendo, you know, a lot of folks curious what 2016 is going to bring as far as the

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.000
NX goes.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.840
And it seems, which obviously won't be its final name, but that's what everybody's calling

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.320
it for now.

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.520
Just like, what was everybody calling the Wii U before they gave it a name?

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:31.280
Wasn't like, was that the one that they called?

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.880
No, Dolphin was GameCube.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:34.480
Revolution was Wii.

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:35.520
What did they call Wii U?

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.520
I don't remember, but I know everybody...

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:38.400
Unnecessary?

01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:40.320
They called it the Wii U.

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.680
I remember everybody was like...

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:42.640
A disappointment.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.360
The project name was way better than the real name.

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:49.360
So anyway, with NX, Tatsume Kimishima.

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.240
Do you guys know that name?

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.080
President of Nintendo.

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:52.720
Okay, good.

01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:57.120
I bet a lot of people don't know, kind of forget that he's now the new president of

01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:00.320
Nintendo ever since the unfortunate passing of Satoru Iwata.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:03.840
But he made some comments this week in Time magazine.

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:09.040
And he was talking about his involvement with the Wii shortages in the mid 2000s.

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:10.640
So they were getting on some other topics.

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:12.880
But of course, the NX got brought up.

01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:13.920
And he said this quote,

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:19.120
I can assure you, we're not building the next version of Wii or Wii U.

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:24.160
NX is something unique and different.

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:29.120
It's something where we have to move away from those platforms in order to make it something

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.720
that will appeal.

01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:37.120
Now, the reason why I think this is interesting is because all the rumors right now about

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:44.720
NX make it sound like it's a Wii U, but the gamepad detaches in a way where you can take

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:49.440
that with you out on the street, out on the road, and it's a fully functional device that

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:50.560
plays the same games.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:54.480
That's some of the rumor, at least the impression I'm getting from some of these early rumors

01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:55.760
what this thing is all about.

01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:00.400
So the fact that he's coming out and saying it's nothing like Wii U kind of directly conflicts

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:00.800
with that.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:05.760
But these rumors sound like remote play, which is what everybody's already doing, basically.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:10.000
I do also want to chime in with my 10 seconds of internet research.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.320
Codename for Wii U was Project Cafe.

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:15.840
And actually Bobby Blackwolf, to his credit, chimed in the chat room with that.

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.280
I was going to get to that.

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:20.800
That's not even better than Wii U, so it was a step up.

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:24.000
To be fair, yeah, that was kind of the worst of all the different names, but yeah.

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.480
Project Cafe.

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:27.600
I always think of that DDR song.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:30.320
Yeah, I was like, that's kind of cool.

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:35.040
With Charlie Brown and Sally.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.840
Anyway, and Tigerclaw noting, since we were talking about Nintendo today, would have been

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.680
Satoru Iwata's 56th birthday.

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:44.800
And of course, he got a great tribute at the Game Awards as well.

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:48.000
So, all right.

01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:52.800
So anyway, yeah, the NX is going to be something completely different.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:56.320
It may not include a disk drive, apparently, but again, he hasn't commented on that.

01:34:56.320 --> 01:35:01.680
If it doesn't include a disk drive, then it better come with a massive amount of storage

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:08.560
space because I've seen people champion that the Wii U is such a consumer-friendly system

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:12.480
with its 32GB hard drive and you can buy extra stuff.

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:14.160
Sorry, that is just a complete lie.

01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.200
It is not.

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.360
I really hope it does have a disk drive.

01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:21.840
And the reason why is even though I do buy a lot of my games digitally, I like having

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:24.720
the option to be able to get those at a discounted rate.

01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.520
And at least with Sony and Microsoft, they tend to discount their stuff pretty often.

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:31.200
Nintendo, not so much.

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.280
And you have that closed market where they aren't dropping the price of their games.

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.200
I'm just not expecting much.

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:44.080
And just to have the option period, like, I do a lot of digital now too, but you all

01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.440
start to run out of space.

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.320
And that's something that happened with Xenoblade for me.

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.400
And I went out and, like, there's no good...

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.880
Xenoblade's like 22GB and the hard drive in that thing is, what, 32GB?

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.880
But only 25GB that you get to use.

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:57.840
So if you have any other...

01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:03.440
I had to delete, like, half my stuff off of my Wii U because there's no good storage

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:03.920
options.

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:08.080
I deleted the Metroid Prime trilogy, regretfully, so I could make space for those Xenoblade

01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:08.160
Miracles packs.

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:13.120
I deleted Nintendo Land, which was not a big loss, but I did delete that.

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:15.920
But when I say delete, it's not like I can't re-download it later.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.720
So don't be all like, Rob, why are you hating on Metroid?

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:19.680
I can always download it later.

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:20.640
You're not hating on Metroid.

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:23.200
You're hating on the lack of storage space.

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.280
Yes, I'm hating on lack of storage space.

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:29.120
And, to be fair, I did have more fun with the Metroid Prime trilogy than I'm having

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:30.800
with XCX right now.

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.560
Lots of fighting words.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.200
I'm leaving the door open to change my opinion on XCX later.

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.120
Just so you can slam it in its face.

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:38.960
Stop it.

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.200
All right, so...

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:42.400
I'll figure it out tonight.

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:44.320
We'll see what happens with the NX later on.

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:48.160
Hey, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what's coming

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:51.120
out, although I imagine things are slowing down significantly.

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.760
But we'll check in with Loki with US releases.

01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:55.840
Yes, so things are slowing down significantly.

01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:00.160
But this week is pretty exciting because not only are there Earth Defense Force games coming

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:03.120
out, there's two Earth Defense Force games coming out.

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:08.000
So Earth Defense Force 4.1, The Shadow of Despair, coming out on PlayStation 4, and

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.600
Earth Defense Force 2, Invaders from Planet Space for the Vita.

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:14.960
And then the Wii U is getting Devil's Third.

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:16.640
Oh, finally.

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:18.000
In America.

01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:19.280
Yes.

01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:22.160
I watched some streams of that when it came out in Japan.

01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.840
Maybe they should have canceled it.

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.880
It just is not great.

01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:32.000
It seems like, as well, a lot of games are getting patches and things like that this

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:32.400
week.

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.360
Like, it's not just...

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.280
Like, as I know, Rock Band's got its, like...

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.880
Tony Hawk's getting one too.

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:40.320
We made the game now that we promised.

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.640
Well, hey, does this mean I can actually buy the game now?

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.160
Oh, I still wouldn't, probably.

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.000
Is that it for...

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:46.640
That is it.

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:47.280
Yeah, those three.

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:50.800
Let's go to Japan real quick and check out the releases there.

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:55.360
On the 10th of December in Japan, Gravity Days with the...

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:56.320
That's Gravity Rush.

01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:57.760
Oh, is that the sequel?

01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.960
Wait, what's it say?

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:00.400
D-A-Z-E, Gravity Days.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:01.920
No, Gravity Days would still be...

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:02.560
No, that's a different...

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:04.080
That's just the remaster if it's PS4.

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:05.120
Oh, got it, got it, got it.

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.000
Yeah, they have a different name for it.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:07.120
That's right, they have a different name for it.

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:07.600
Okay, so that's...

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.960
That looks like my card I got.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:13.200
That's the remaster, or I'm sorry, yeah, the PlayStation 4 remaster.

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:13.840
That's out in...

01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:15.760
Excuse me, Japan this week.

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:21.280
As is Nitro Plus Blaster's Heroine Infinite Duel and Steins Gate Zero.

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:23.760
And Koffing.

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.360
And lots of Koffing, excuse me.

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:30.400
And Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, all coming out on the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:31.760
So things not slowing down over there.

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:35.280
On the Wii U, however, things are still slow.

01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:38.720
Wii U doesn't have anything until after Christmas in Japan at this point.

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:42.080
So lastly, though, I do want to look at the handhelds,

01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:46.960
because even though Nintendo doesn't usually have Wii U stuff, they sometimes have 3DS stuff.

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:52.000
And yeah, this week, Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire in a gift pack.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.280
Yeah, it's just a bundle.

01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:56.880
You know, it's just a bundle with both games for the few of you that don't have that yet.

01:38:56.880 --> 01:38:58.720
It may come with something too, I forget.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:06.320
Also, Baymax Heroes Battle and Nico Pucci Girls Runway comes out this week.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:10.480
Lastly, on the Vita, because, you know, Vita in Japan is still a big thing.

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:16.480
The Eiyu Densetsu Sora no Kiseuke SC Evolution in regular limited edition.

01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.760
Steins Gate Zero.

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.720
Idolmaster, Musongs, Blueboard, and Redboard.

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.400
I'm assuming those are different song lists.

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:24.640
And then Valkyrie Drive B.

01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:27.520
Kakuni comes out this week as well.

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:30.720
So still a busy week over in Japan.

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:34.720
And I'm going to try to peek here at the Europe release dates for Jamie,

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:35.840
since she's not here tonight.

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.000
Although we will hear from her in a little bit.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.080
Things slowing down in Europe significantly.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.240
The only release I see of note this week.

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.480
Darius Burst Chronicle Saviors on PlayStation 4 and Vita.

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:49.760
But I bet this list I'm looking at doesn't include anything they

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:52.400
surprise unveiled at that PlayStation Expo.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.280
So keep that in mind.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.160
All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.

01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:00.800
And then we're going to get Jamie here to do the Classic Game of the Week.

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:01.840
First, Loki.

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:05.920
All right, so there apparently has been some leaks on Steam.

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:08.240
And this is regarding the Steam database.

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:12.880
Some games that have popped up that have appeared in the database.

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.400
As potential help topics or part of the help desk.

01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:22.000
So included with this, they've got, let's see.

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.160
Stranger of Sword City, Criminal Girls, Earth Defense Force 4.1.

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:28.240
I may have to get that for PC as well.

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:29.920
Sonic Boom.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:32.080
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:32.880
Steins Gate.

01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:33.920
Little King's Story.

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:34.960
Guilty Gear.

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.080
Xrd Sign.

01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:39.680
Bad Rat Show.

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:41.520
Final Fantasy 6.

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.520
Final Fantasy X and X2.

01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:44.960
HD Remaster.

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.760
Danganronpa 1 and 2.

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:49.680
And Half Life 3, of course.

01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:50.880
Everybody needs to get on that.

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.000
Everybody's Gone to the Rapture because that is one of the best games of this year.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.960
So if you don't have a PS4, get it on PC.

01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:00.480
I still have a hard time calling that a game.

01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:04.080
But it's one of the best interactive experiences I've had.

01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:06.560
So if you had like a top five games of the year list,

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.560
it couldn't make it there because you can't call it a game?

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:12.320
No, it probably will be on my list for the greatest games of the year.

01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:16.560
But I with the footnote that this is very unlike other games that you're used to.

01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:22.720
It's no different than like a visual novel.

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.000
Right, but when I was talking about Gone Home, I said the same thing.

01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:29.120
But at least Gone Home had like three puzzles in it.

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.720
I never played that.

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:32.560
That's really not a bad game.

01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.160
It's definitely worth looking at.

01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:35.440
But that's cool.

01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:37.760
If everybody's Gone to the Rapture is coming to PC, will you buy it again?

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:38.560
Because I probably will.

01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.760
Actually, depending on the price.

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.840
I do like it a lot.

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:46.640
I would like to support them so they make more games

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:49.360
because they do have one of my favorite games of the year.

01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:51.840
Yeah, I probably would.

01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:52.340
Okay.

01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:57.780
All right, well, speaking of Steam, if you have way too many games on Steam,

01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:00.660
you are wanting to get rid of something permanently.

01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:02.340
You can now do that.

01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:05.380
You can delete games from your Steam account forever,

01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:09.140
which I don't know really why you'd want to do this.

01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:13.060
But it was suggested that maybe like a friend buys you a gag gift or something

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:14.580
that you don't really want.

01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:17.140
But then I'm like, can't you just put it in your inventory?

01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:19.860
Yeah, you don't have to sell it or give it to somebody else.

01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:21.860
Or it's a little weird to me.

01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:24.180
Can you just give games that you own to other people?

01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:28.580
No, once you've played them, you can't put them back in your inventory.

01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:30.900
If someone buys you a gift copy, you don't have to redeem it.

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:32.500
You can just keep it in your inventory.

01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:34.820
And then after like so many days, you can trade it.

01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:35.540
I see.

01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:36.040
Yeah.

01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:39.300
But if you want to get rid of a game, then you can do that.

01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:42.180
So now Steam has the option.

01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:44.420
If you want to eliminate something for your Steam account altogether,

01:42:44.420 --> 01:42:45.060
you can do that.

01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:46.660
You do not get a refund for it.

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:49.060
It just removes it from your library.

01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:52.660
Also interesting, games, if they were a part of a bundle,

01:42:52.660 --> 01:42:54.340
cannot be removed individually.

01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:56.500
You will have to remove the entire bundle.

01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:59.380
So anything that shared the same key is what.

01:42:59.380 --> 01:43:02.100
So basically, it's lifting the keys from your account, it sounds like.

01:43:02.740 --> 01:43:04.580
Once again, though, I don't understand why you would do that.

01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:07.460
If you're just like looking to get rid of something off your list,

01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:10.180
you can sort them into like folders and stuff now, I think.

01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:13.380
Yeah, or if you're looking to uninstall the files,

01:43:13.380 --> 01:43:16.820
if that's your problem is you're running out of hard drive space, maybe.

01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:18.420
I could see you want to do that.

01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:23.780
But isn't the point of your Steam collection is to make it as big as possible?

01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:24.980
I mean, isn't that the point?

01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:27.300
Why would we want to remove keys?

01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:29.220
It depends on how you want to play the game.

01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:31.620
It depends on how you want to do that.

01:43:31.620 --> 01:43:32.340
Collect them all.

01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:34.740
But, you know, Jamie did buy me Hatful Boyfriend,

01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:36.260
and I'm like, do I really want this game?

01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:37.220
No, I'm kidding.

01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:38.500
Of course, I want that game.

01:43:38.500 --> 01:43:41.380
I do need to spend more time with it at some point.

01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:45.220
Anyway, speaking of Jamie, we're going to get her on the line.

01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:48.980
It's time to bring her on because she needs to do one of her segments for us.

01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:52.180
So we're going to do this old school here and call her phone right now.

01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:56.660
And hopefully she knows that we're on our way and we'll be there

01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:01.540
because that would be very embarrassing if she doesn't end up picking the phone up.

01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:02.340
So we'll see.

01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:03.300
Oh, boy, this.

01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:05.380
Hi.

01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:06.180
Hi, how are you?

01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:09.460
I'm okay. How are you?

01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:12.020
Good. So you're not here in studio tonight.

01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:15.060
Are you okay, Jamie? We're worried about you.

01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:17.460
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:22.420
I just I started helping my friends move around one o'clock.

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:24.820
We didn't get done with the whole thing until 4 a.m.

01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:26.340
Oh, my God.

01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:29.140
So we moved from 1 p.m. to 4 a.m.

01:44:29.940 --> 01:44:31.380
Moving sucks.

01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:33.380
It sucks so bad.

01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:35.860
I think it's punishment for stealing in some countries.

01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:36.420
It really is.

01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:38.740
It's awful.

01:44:38.740 --> 01:44:44.660
Well, I am well medicated and the cold muscles are feeling better.

01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:46.900
But when you're medicated, that means you can't drive.

01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:48.900
Exactly.

01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:49.940
Exactly. All right.

01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:52.180
Well, at least we get you on the show tonight in some capacity.

01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:52.820
Don't worry.

01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:57.140
Shane has been talking our ears off about the PlayStation experience,

01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:59.860
but we've learned a lot about PlayStation VR tonight.

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:00.900
He did a very good job.

01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:01.700
Thank you.

01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:02.200
All right.

01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:05.620
But I guess I can say this.

01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:08.500
Shane was like, hey, if I'm coming to the show, can I do the classic game of the week?

01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:09.380
And I was like, nope.

01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:13.540
Because I was just going to do like one of the bus to move games or dance.

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:15.220
So I just have to get that out there.

01:45:15.220 --> 01:45:15.780
All right.

01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:16.180
That's fair.

01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:18.580
Although I believe he's probably done them all.

01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:20.420
Probably not dance summit, though.

01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:21.380
Maybe not.

01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:21.700
Maybe not.

01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:22.020
All right.

01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:25.300
No, I don't think I've done dance on it, but it depends on if it's over 10 years old.

01:45:25.300 --> 01:45:27.540
Well, now, yeah, it is tonight over.

01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:30.820
I think for the classic of the week tonight, let me play a little music.

01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:32.340
You give the spiel every week.

01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:35.540
Dark soccer jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey,

01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:43.220
you people need to put down your episodic remakes and your VR headsets and play this.

01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:46.340
And this is a game that I think should come to VR headsets, by the way.

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:50.260
And tonight's game is, I think, one of those games where I think you're all going to love it,

01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:54.260
but you're all also going to go, oh, my God, that's 10 years old.

01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:55.620
Because remember, that's the criteria.

01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:59.700
Game has to be 10 years old to be considered a classic game.

01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:00.500
So dark soccer.

01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:02.420
And dance summit does qualify, by the way.

01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:03.460
I bet.

01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:06.020
Yeah, I know dance summit qualifies if this one does.

01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:07.540
Dark soccer.

01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.860
What is the classic game of the week?

01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:12.500
Katamari Damacy.

01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:15.220
Katamari Damacy.

01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:22.500
Yeah, I finally, finally decided to do this because I had already done Tetris,

01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:25.380
and Tetris sort of fit the theme of all the moving last night.

01:46:25.380 --> 01:46:27.380
But we did move a lot of stuff.

01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:30.500
So Katamari, yeah, I can qualify.

01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:35.060
So, um, Katamari is actually, for the record, just real quick,

01:46:35.060 --> 01:46:38.340
Katamari is actually 11 years old, if you can believe it.

01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:39.700
It's not just 10, it's 11.

01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:40.200
Yeah.

01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:45.060
And it's something that's come out in the lifetime of the show, too,

01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:48.500
because we remember we had the giant Katamari at E3 that year.

01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:50.580
We were obsessed with this shit when it came out.

01:46:50.580 --> 01:47:00.660
We got one of our demo discs that we were giving to people was on the official Katamari.

01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:05.060
To be fair, I think that was actually when they were doing Beautiful Katamari,

01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:06.660
which was the sequel on 360.

01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:08.100
I think that's what Namco is promoting,

01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:11.700
because when this came out with kind of little fanfare in the States,

01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:12.980
whenever it was kind of a cult game.

01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:14.500
Yeah, super hard to find at times.

01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:15.000
True.

01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:21.780
Well, at any rate, Katamari Damacy literally translates to clumped soul.

01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:27.540
It came out, um, it was done by Namco.

01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:32.180
It came out on PS2, first of course in Japan and then in North America.

01:47:32.180 --> 01:47:35.460
And it was actually the result of a school project from

01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:37.540
Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory.

01:47:38.580 --> 01:47:41.220
It cost less than a million to make.

01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:48.500
So it actually cost, I believe, just under a tenth of what Ridge Racer cost to make.

01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:56.420
So the whole point was that it needed to be novel, easy to understand, and highly enjoyable.

01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:01.940
So the whole point of the game, I mean, and if you don't know what this is by now,

01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:03.220
then come out from under a rock.

01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:10.900
But the king of all cosmos got drunk and partied and destroyed all the stars.

01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:11.960
And the moon.

01:48:13.700 --> 01:48:17.220
So he attacked his son with cleaning up his mess.

01:48:17.860 --> 01:48:22.100
So he has to roll over things in the world to make stars and

01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:25.300
build constellations and even remake the moon.

01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:29.700
And it is very stylized.

01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:31.140
The world is very surreal.

01:48:31.140 --> 01:48:34.100
I mean, when you've got people walking on the back development,

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:38.340
you know, in the middle of the city district, then that's weird.

01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:41.860
Either that or that could be San Francisco, I don't know.

01:48:44.740 --> 01:48:50.340
So basically, it was kind of a sleeper when it came out.

01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:51.620
People were like, what's this?

01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:53.460
And then, oh, that's what that is.

01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:57.620
And it's made a bunch of sequels and stuff.

01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:03.700
But let's go ahead and start back with the control of the game.

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:14.900
Basically, one of the things that actually was put into kind of the background story

01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:17.060
is that there...

01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:21.780
Because you start in the family homes of the Hoshino family.

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:26.180
And the father, who's an astronaut, can't go to the moon

01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:28.500
because the king danced around and destroyed it.

01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:31.620
And one of the things that...

01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:34.100
I guess this wasn't really played up a lot for the US one,

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:39.620
but his daughter could see that the prince was going to work putting things together.

01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:45.060
However, for their entire family, their house and their town are now part of the moon.

01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:50.020
So anyway, you basically use the little analog to control

01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:53.300
how you're steering the Katamari.

01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:59.060
It kind of feels like battle zones where you can kind of turn, kind of flip, move them around.

01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:02.580
You can also wiggle them and make it spin so you can go faster.

01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:05.140
And you start with small things and then you pick up bigger things.

01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:06.900
And sometimes you need specific things.

01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:09.780
Like, I think there's one where you pick up, like, all cats.

01:50:10.580 --> 01:50:11.220
Wasn't that it?

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:14.500
I seem to remember something like that.

01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:15.780
Yeah, it was like all one thing.

01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:22.820
Yeah, so the more of things of that size, the bigger you make the Katamari, the bigger it'll grow.

01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:27.220
And then your perspective changes until, like, the last level,

01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:32.020
you start off kind of human size, or maybe less than human size,

01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:36.580
and you grow to world size, picking up islands and files and shit.

01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:41.860
So, um, but the basic gameplay is the naked star mode,

01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:46.580
where you have to build your Katamari to a particular size within your time limit.

01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:51.780
And, you know, the king kind of gives you a hard time as you're going through the level.

01:50:53.060 --> 01:50:54.340
But the king is fabulous.

01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:56.180
I love the king of all causes.

01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:59.620
And then a two-player you can play as the prince or his cousins.

01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:06.420
So you can kind of do a simultaneous sort of versus as you go.

01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:13.140
But anyway, the game was designed by Takahashi Keita

01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:17.460
at his school project for the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory.

01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:21.780
And it was an institute for game development education.

01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:27.140
And his thesis was that if you have core gameplay ideas,

01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:32.340
that it could make a successful game,

01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:38.980
meaning that it has to be easy to understand, novel, and enjoyable,

01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:41.380
and on top of that includes humor with it.

01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:49.860
And he was, I think, singled out by Iwatani Toru,

01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:52.500
who is the head of research and development at Namco,

01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:57.300
that this could be something that was very similar to how Pac-Man works,

01:51:57.300 --> 01:52:02.100
you know, that its simplicity and easy fun could make it successful.

01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:09.620
So the gameplay was patented and they started working on it.

01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:16.180
So it was revealed in 2003 at Tokyo Game Show as a snowball simulator.

01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:17.620
Well, that's what the press called it.

01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:26.820
And the demo had this red ball called Tamako Barashi,

01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:31.940
which is part of a school game the kids play.

01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:37.220
And then depending on how well they thought it was in the US,

01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:39.940
but if they were going to give it a full release.

01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:41.860
So it got really good reviews and they said,

01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:42.900
you know what, we're going to do this.

01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:47.620
So it was moderately successful in Japan.

01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:51.460
It sold its first week 32,000 units,

01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:55.460
and then over 155,000 by Nancy Spelt and Co.,

01:52:57.380 --> 01:52:59.700
which was less than what they hoped would sell.

01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:05.780
But then in the US, it sold pretty well

01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:09.140
and just gained momentum over and over.

01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:12.500
It was not released in Europe and Australia

01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:15.140
because they thought it was going to be too quirky.

01:53:15.140 --> 01:53:18.340
However, EA picked up the sequels for release in Europe.

01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:22.740
The games had sequels.

01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:25.780
I mean, we had the sequel We Love Katamari,

01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:30.260
which was pretty much the Japanese name Mima Daisuke Katamari Damachi.

01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:34.580
Well, technically it was Everyone Loves Katamari Damachi.

01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:38.980
And then there were Me and My Katamari,

01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:44.980
which was Mokumo Itashi no Katamari Damachi in Japanese,

01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:47.300
which was basically My My Katamari Damachi,

01:53:48.900 --> 01:53:52.660
meaning a masculine and a neutral speaker.

01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:54.020
That was for PST.

01:53:54.900 --> 01:53:58.980
Beautiful Katamari Damachi also came out on Xbox 360,

01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:01.460
which is what we had our thing up for, right?

01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:08.420
And the story of that one is to close up black holes

01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:11.300
that were made when the team played tennis.

01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:14.340
The king just needs to retire.

01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:21.860
And then there was a Kobarashi Puzzle Katamari Damachi

01:54:21.860 --> 01:54:26.980
that came for DSiWare, which was more of a puzzle game.

01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:30.900
There was Touch My Katamari.

01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:32.820
Yay, fun name.

01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:39.540
Rolling with Katamari, which was the Nintendo DCP-904i for the phone.

01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:46.740
And then Katamari Damachi Mobile came out for a bunch of different services,

01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:49.140
and then I Love Katamari came out for iOS.

01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:55.380
I was just going to say, the series has been kind of quiet for a little while.

01:54:57.540 --> 01:54:59.540
I guess the iPhone one is the most recent,

01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:02.980
but I really feel like the Vita version was really the last one I played,

01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:04.820
and that was during the Vita launch.

01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:07.300
So I think it's time for Katamari to come back, personally.

01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:08.100
I think we're ready.

01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:10.580
There's a little bit more.

01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:15.460
The last one that came out was in 2011, which was Katamari Amore,

01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:19.620
but it was a kind of a pay-to-play type of thing,

01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:21.300
and it's since been removed from the App Store.

01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:25.060
There's a Korean developer called WindySoft

01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:28.180
that said they were going to do a Katamari Damachi online

01:55:28.180 --> 01:55:31.460
that was supposed to be on 2007, but it never came out in the US.

01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:35.060
And that was really kind of the end of it.

01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:38.500
That last thing we had was in Council 11, which was the Katamari Amore.

01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:42.420
So no more.

01:55:42.420 --> 01:55:46.020
Although we did have one of the cousins show up in Namco High.

01:55:47.300 --> 01:55:48.340
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:50.340
I remember that with that whole game.

01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:54.980
There was a lot of cameos from different Namco characters there.

01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:55.620
So there it is.

01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:57.700
Yeah, the main character you play at is the cousin.

01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:00.580
There it is, folks, your classic game of the week,

01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:04.260
Katamari Damachi, one of the all-time classics, in my opinion.

01:56:05.620 --> 01:56:09.220
And the album, by the way, I do have to make a comment about the music.

01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:11.220
The music is highly eclectic.

01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:18.500
I mean, we have a combination of like lounge jazz to easy listening stuff to kind of poppy tunes,

01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:23.540
but the album was put out as Katamari Fortissimo Damachi.

01:56:23.540 --> 01:56:26.980
So definitely worth listening to.

01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:27.780
It's a very good album.

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:30.740
Yeah, the music is almost what makes the game for a lot of people, I think.

01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:31.700
It's so, so funny.

01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:37.860
I still have three of the tracks in my car that I drive around to.

01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:38.360
Nice.

01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:40.820
But don't use your car to roll things up.

01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:41.780
It doesn't work like that.

01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:42.500
It doesn't work like that.

01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:44.020
No, I just roll over people.

01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:44.900
I'm kidding.

01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:45.540
All right.

01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:46.420
Well, Dark Soccer...

01:56:47.300 --> 01:56:47.860
Oh, go ahead.

01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:52.020
Don't forget, this gave us No B No B Boy, which no one still gets.

01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:54.500
I don't think anyone does get that game to this day.

01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:55.380
Do they still sell that one?

01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:56.900
I thought they did listed that one too.

01:56:56.900 --> 01:56:57.460
Maybe I'm wrong.

01:56:58.740 --> 01:57:03.540
Well, it had a physical release, but I've been playing it on iOS randomly

01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:06.420
and posting up how close Boy and Girl are to meeting.

01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:09.380
I wonder if Boy and Girl has met yet.

01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:12.020
I wonder if he's ever going to make another game.

01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:14.500
I know he kind of left to go make playgrounds and stuff,

01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:16.740
but I'm curious to see if he ever comes back to gaming.

01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:17.460
It'll be pretty cool.

01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:19.700
We'll have to find out.

01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:23.860
Dark Soccer, we will not be here next week because you and I are going to go to GX,

01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:26.900
and I believe you are planning to participate in the cosplay pageant.

01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:28.980
That's going to happen at the time the show is on.

01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:31.060
I am.

01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:33.860
So we will not be back until late Sunday, and it's all your fault.

01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:34.900
No, I'm kidding.

01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:40.020
We're going to have a lot of fun, and I'm very excited to see a lot of people there at the con.

01:57:40.020 --> 01:57:44.580
So you can come by and meet Jamie and I at the table, assuming that one of us...

01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:47.300
Because Jamie is going to have to hold down the fort when there's a panel I want to see,

01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:50.020
and vice versa, and luckily we have Alan to help with some of that too.

01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:54.420
But come by and meet us, and it'll be a lot of fun.

01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:57.940
So Jamie, we will see you in studio again here in two weeks.

01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:00.020
Indeed.

01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:01.220
And have a happy Hanukkah.

01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:02.660
I know today was first day, so...

01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:04.820
Yep.

01:58:04.820 --> 01:58:09.700
So yeah, and I wish everybody else happy Hanukkah through celebrating.

01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:14.420
And for the folks at GamerX, I'm trying to get my hands on LEDs now because

01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:17.780
we need to have candle lighting because I can't be the only Jew there.

01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:23.060
Yeah, so you may be leading the Jews in a Hanukkah celebration at GX.

01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:23.780
I think that's great.

01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:26.580
Yeah, it'll be fabulous.

01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:27.220
All right.

01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:27.460
All right.

01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:30.660
Well, Dark Sakura, we'll talk to you in a couple weeks, but I will see you very soon.

01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:32.580
See you soon.

01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:33.140
See you.

01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:33.700
All right.

01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:34.500
Bye, dear.

01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:34.900
Rest up.

01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:35.540
Bye.

01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:35.780
Bye.

01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:37.140
All right.

01:58:37.140 --> 01:58:42.820
Dark Sakura, not here in studio tonight, but still able to deliver one of her classic

01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:44.420
segments there, the classic game of the week.

01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:46.980
And one of those games, again, she says it and it's like,

01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:48.660
how has that not been a classic game yet?

01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:51.060
But 11 years old.

01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:52.420
I have great memories of Katamari.

01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:55.300
Shane, big fan of Katamari Damacy.

01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:56.420
The first two games.

01:58:56.420 --> 01:59:00.260
I think it really lost its charm and steam after that second one.

01:59:00.260 --> 01:59:04.500
You know why it did is because the games that came after it were all kind of like,

01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.180
just biting off those first two games.

01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:07.220
It was like compilation games.

01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:09.220
Yeah, it was like, yeah, of like two games.

01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:11.140
So I think that's kind of where they went wrong with it.

01:59:11.140 --> 01:59:14.980
And I thought, wasn't there like a trademark for a new Katamari game recently?

01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:17.860
Let us pray because I think it would be great to read that up while you're talking.

01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:20.740
Wouldn't that be hilarious if that was in VR?

01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:22.340
Cause that's something, I don't know.

01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:25.460
I'd probably get motion sick though playing something like that, but who knows?

01:59:25.460 --> 01:59:26.420
We'll see what's coming.

01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:29.620
Anyway, actually, Shane, though, I do want to say we are going to break here and take

01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:32.420
a break before we come back for Orange Falls Radio part B, but you're actually going to

01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:34.420
take off because you haven't been home yet.

01:59:34.420 --> 01:59:34.980
You came.

01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:36.180
No, I came straight over.

01:59:36.180 --> 01:59:37.540
You came straight over PlayStation experience.

01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:38.660
Well, thank you for stopping by.

01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:42.900
Tap Mike Katamari was a new trademark by Namco Bandai about a week ago.

01:59:42.900 --> 01:59:44.500
That sounds like another phone game though.

01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:45.220
Yeah, it sure does.

01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:47.060
I don't know about that.

01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:50.820
Maybe Wii U, I can dream.

01:59:50.820 --> 01:59:51.780
I don't know.

01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:52.580
NX, maybe?

01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:52.980
Who knows?

01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:53.140
All right.

01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:55.060
Shane, anything else?

01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:55.780
Thank you very much.

01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:59.940
You did a great job explaining the VR stuff and we all appreciated your enthusiasm and

01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:00.260
I agree.

02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:02.900
Sony should probably just hire you as a salesperson at this point.

02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:08.260
But anything you want to add to that before we let you go?

02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:09.700
Not really.

02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:13.540
I think everybody should try to go next year if you can, if it's feasible.

02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:16.260
Do you think Microsoft and Nintendo should do something similar?

02:00:16.340 --> 02:00:20.100
It's hard to say because we were actually talking about this earlier today.

02:00:20.100 --> 02:00:22.900
Microsoft I think could try to pull it off.

02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:28.580
I don't think it would have the same excitement because whether you like to admit it or not,

02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:34.500
they're still like the groups or the types of people associated with each product and

02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:37.300
PlayStation has become the more eclectic group.

02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:38.740
So there's lots of stuff for everybody.

02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:43.380
But Microsoft, if they had one, I think it'd be mostly shooters because they can't seem

02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:44.900
to show off anything else.

02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:49.860
I think if they talk about anything else, I think if they did one maybe between E3 and

02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:53.860
now, I think that would have been a great time for them to show those exclusive games.

02:00:53.860 --> 02:00:57.940
Like they could have probably done a show around Rise of the Tomb Raider, you know,

02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:03.140
all the things that came out this holiday that were exclusive to them.

02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:04.500
And maybe they could have had a pretty.

02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:06.820
So I don't know if I would like count them out completely.

02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:10.420
Well, you'd also have to get the indie support, which I don't think Microsoft really has.

02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:12.500
I think they have more than you think they have more than you think.

02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:14.420
Keep in mind, like Ori and the Blind Forest.

02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:17.460
That's also on PC.

02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:18.740
It is.

02:01:18.740 --> 02:01:20.740
And that's going to happen a lot with Microsoft, though.

02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:24.500
But anyway, you would never be able to get tickets to it.

02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:30.900
Well, not only that, but I feel like it would be the one that would get the most hype,

02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:34.980
but would be ultimately the one that would let the most people down

02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:40.980
because Nintendo is so guarded with their stuff that I don't feel like you would get

02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:42.660
a great experience out of it.

02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:47.780
I don't think they would showcase as much new stuff as the other two would.

02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:52.660
I think they would be more resting on these are the games that you can play right now.

02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:57.540
Or these are our titles that are really popular versus these are coming out.

02:01:57.540 --> 02:01:58.660
This is something we just announced.

02:01:58.660 --> 02:01:59.780
Go crazy over it.

02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:01.700
That's how I feel about that.

02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:02.180
All right.

02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:07.460
Enact.F in chat at live.vognetwork.com points out Nintendo has their directs too.

02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:11.380
Although with the Universal Studios Park deal, you could have one.

02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:15.860
So that's an interesting concept that Nintendo may have like a year round type of thing.

02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:19.540
They do holiday tours through malls showing off their stuff.

02:02:19.540 --> 02:02:22.980
And from what I hear, this year's is kind of lackluster.

02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:26.820
And that's kind of also shaping my opinion of if Nintendo did one.

02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:34.660
I just think it would not be to the scale as Sony's was this year or what Microsoft

02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:35.940
could potentially do.

02:02:35.940 --> 02:02:36.340
Right.

02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:40.500
And Sony is going to have to do something similar with that VR.

02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:42.660
They're going to have to put it out there for people to try.

02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:46.980
Yes, because even though I knew I'd like it, I was still hesitant.

02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:49.300
I was like, that thing is kind of clunky.

02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:52.580
Look, it actually feels really good on your head, but it looks clunky.

02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:56.340
I don't see why I'd really want one with playing those two games.

02:02:56.340 --> 02:03:00.420
I definitely want one as long as the price isn't crazy.

02:03:00.980 --> 02:03:01.700
All right.

02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:02.900
Well, Shane, thank you for being here.

02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:05.140
You're always here once a month or so.

02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:06.740
So I'm sure we'll see you again.

02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:11.700
So maybe we can have another argument about XCX once we've spent more time with it.

02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:15.380
Or maybe I'll come around or maybe you'll get the frustrations I have.

02:03:15.380 --> 02:03:15.780
We'll see.

02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:16.180
We'll see.

02:03:16.180 --> 02:03:17.460
We'll find out tonight, probably.

02:03:17.460 --> 02:03:20.660
We'll find out and we'll let you guys know in two weeks when OLR is back.

02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:21.700
So, okay.

02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:25.700
But actually, OLR was just going to take a quick break and we'll be back.

02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:29.060
We still have part B of the show to come because we still have some more news to get into.

02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:32.740
The FUGA question of the week, the mailbag, which I think we have like four emails tonight.

02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:37.060
And we're going to talk about whatever you guys want with your phone calls.

02:03:37.060 --> 02:03:40.900
1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:03:40.900 --> 02:03:44.100
Sadly, Shane won't be here, so you can't ask him about the show.

02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:44.580
Although, I don't know.

02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:45.540
You're going to listen to your car or whatever.

02:03:45.540 --> 02:03:46.980
You can still ask.

02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:48.740
I just won't answer because I won't be here.

02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:50.260
Just pretend I'm here.

02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:51.300
Still ask your question.

02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:52.820
Sometimes Shane listens and then he'll text me.

02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:54.500
Well, it's usually if I have to correct you on something.

02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:55.380
Yeah, exactly.

02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:57.300
So if I mess something up, I'll get a text message.

02:03:57.300 --> 02:03:58.820
We'll see if I'm listening tonight.

02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:00.980
I got to drive and do a couple of things.

02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:01.460
Gotcha.

02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:01.780
All right.

02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:02.180
Fair enough.

02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:04.580
I have to go pick up amiibo that we have ordered.

02:04:04.580 --> 02:04:05.060
Yeah.

02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:06.500
Where's my modern Mario?

02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:07.620
I came right over here.

02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:08.260
No, I understand.

02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:08.740
I understand.

02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:09.780
All right, let's do it.

02:04:09.780 --> 02:04:10.420
We're going to go to break.

02:04:10.420 --> 02:04:13.620
We will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, everybody, right after this.

02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:24.580
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:28.820
Live tonight on December the 6th of 2015.

02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:31.540
Yes, we are in December, the end of the years in sight.

02:04:31.540 --> 02:04:35.940
Episode number 623 of our show already in progress.

02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:38.660
Shane was here for the first half of the show,

02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:40.820
had an extended chat about the PlayStation experience.

02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:42.500
He had a lot to say about the VR.

02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:45.780
We talked a little bit about that and also letting you guys know

02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:47.540
we're not going to be here next week again.

02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:50.740
And I know that's three missed shows in the span of about six weeks.

02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:53.860
We apologize, but life sucks sometimes.

02:04:53.860 --> 02:04:55.380
That's really the easiest I can put it.

02:04:55.380 --> 02:05:00.180
Although, this coming weekend is really not a bad reason at all.

02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:02.900
We love conventions, and GX is going to be a fun one.

02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:05.540
And hoping that we'll get to meet some of you guys there.

02:05:05.540 --> 02:05:07.300
And hey, at least there's going to be the panel.

02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:10.740
And they don't live stream the panels, but they will put it up on YouTube.

02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:15.620
You can actually see if you search for podcast space X space zone.

02:05:15.620 --> 02:05:18.260
I know the one we did last year comes right up.

02:05:18.260 --> 02:05:21.860
I don't remember about the one with the first year when Fox Van Allen moderated.

02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:25.060
But I think that's out there on YouTube somewhere as well.

02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:27.940
So you can check those out, some of our podcasting talks.

02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:31.380
We're going to have a third one coming up at GX this weekend,

02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:32.500
which is almost sold out.

02:05:32.500 --> 02:05:36.180
So if you are going to plan on buying your ticket on site,

02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:37.860
I really would encourage you not to do that

02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:39.780
because there's not going to be a lot left, it sounds like.

02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:41.220
So get that in advance.

02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:45.300
They were down to like 200, I think, last I looked.

02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:46.900
So they're starting to run out.

02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:49.540
Anyway, we got some rapid-fire news coming at you.

02:05:49.540 --> 02:05:53.140
And we're going to get into your calls in a little while at 1877 Game O-L-R.

02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:54.900
We're using them on Skype, Orange, Orange Radio.

02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:57.860
Real quick though, I have to say this before we get into rapid-fire news.

02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:02.820
I need to say something about this because it's crucially important.

02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:08.100
I want to take a moment here to tip our proverbial hat here at Orange Lounge Radio

02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:15.700
to some good friends of mine that I've been podcasting with for a very, very, very long,

02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:16.340
long time.

02:06:17.060 --> 02:06:24.180
Travis Donovan and Jessica Harper finally ended the long-running under sedation live

02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:29.380
last night was actually the last show and I was honored they asked me to be on it.

02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:33.140
I was hoping I'd get a phone call and at the end to say something silly,

02:06:33.140 --> 02:06:38.660
but they let me on the show to really razz Travis as he deserved for the time.

02:06:38.660 --> 02:06:41.460
And yeah, under station live here.

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:45.540
Saturday is on the network for the past few years since we've been doing VOG.

02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:49.300
Under station live on the air since 2001.

02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:53.860
Under station live was actually a show I was doing before Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:58.660
In some ways, Orange Lounge Radio was actually a spin-off of under station live.

02:06:58.660 --> 02:07:02.660
I mean, I kind of say that just because I was on them both and Jamie was a very frequent

02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:04.500
guest host over on under station live.

02:07:05.300 --> 02:07:07.300
And then we kind of went and did this thing.

02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:11.460
Under station live started around the Rocky or a picture show community, which you guys

02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:12.340
know I've been involved with.

02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:13.860
I've talked about it here on this show.

02:07:13.860 --> 02:07:18.020
And then, you know, we kind of had the idea with our soccer myself.

02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:21.780
Hey, let's do something about music games.

02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:25.140
You know, DDR and Beatmania and all the stuff we were playing at the time.

02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:28.820
And then that kind of evolved into where we're at now, where we talk about all video games

02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:30.020
and more of a gaming show.

02:07:30.020 --> 02:07:33.540
And then, of course, Loki, who we also met playing DDR, came along for the ride.

02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:35.140
You never did under station live, though, huh?

02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:38.340
That was a little I think Travis moved before we knew you.

02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:41.380
So there's really no opportunity there for you to be on that show.

02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:42.580
But it did finally end.

02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:47.860
So Travis Donovan is retiring and he's not really feeling it if he's going to come back

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.060
anytime soon.

02:07:49.060 --> 02:07:51.540
But I'm hoping for some movie specials.

02:07:51.540 --> 02:07:53.060
I was joking with him last night.

02:07:53.060 --> 02:07:56.740
You know, when Murder, She Wrote went off the air, they still did like three TV movies.

02:07:57.380 --> 02:07:59.140
And I think Matlock did the same thing.

02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:00.500
So we'll see.

02:08:00.500 --> 02:08:01.220
We'll see what happens.

02:08:01.220 --> 02:08:05.860
But thanks, Travis, for showing me that any idiot can podcast.

02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:08.820
I gave him the same line last night, but it's true.

02:08:09.860 --> 02:08:13.700
You know, he really opened the door and showed me that you can set up this internet broadcasting

02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:14.820
thing in your house.

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:18.500
And it kind of enabled what we ended up with here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:23.060
So this show would not exist, certainly in the same way it does now if it weren't for

02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:23.620
Travis.

02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:28.980
And Jessica, big thanks to you as well for being a co-host those first few years with

02:08:28.980 --> 02:08:31.940
me and keeping Travis's ass in check these last few years.

02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:32.740
I really appreciate that.

02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:33.700
All right.

02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:36.820
Anyhow, let's get back into some rapid fire news.

02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:41.700
Loki, I think your mic is muted, Loki.

02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:46.900
I want to make sure your mic is not because I unmuted the wrong thing.

02:08:46.900 --> 02:08:47.940
Sorry about that, Loki.

02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:48.340
Go ahead.

02:08:49.700 --> 02:08:52.420
I unmuted Shane's mic, not your mic, and he's not even here.

02:08:52.420 --> 02:08:52.900
Sorry about that.

02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:58.420
Anyways, I was gonna say Rock Band is hard enough in my opinion, but hey, if you want

02:08:58.420 --> 02:09:02.020
it even harder, they're gonna be putting out this brand new mode.

02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:07.220
It is, I guess, like a brutal mode.

02:09:07.220 --> 02:09:13.940
And what brutal is, is it's basically the expert difficulty, but the notes disappear

02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:17.860
as they come towards the spot where you actually have to strum to hit them.

02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:21.060
So it's like, was it hidden?

02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:23.380
Yeah, hidden in DDR.

02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:26.900
So that'll be coming out soon in an update.

02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:29.620
I guess it's on December 8th.

02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:30.340
So look for that.

02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:34.500
Amplitude will be coming to PlayStation 4 soon as well.

02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:38.100
It's gonna be hitting on January 5th for $19.99.

02:09:38.100 --> 02:09:41.940
It's gonna include 30 songs, a single player campaign, and multiplayer.

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:46.420
And the track list looks pretty nice, so I may have to pick that up.

02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:50.660
And then Tony Hawk 5, or Pro Skater 5.

02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:58.420
Not a great game when it came out, and hopefully this will help fix some of the problems.

02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:02.420
But they have a massive patch that's gonna be adding content to the game and fixing a

02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:04.420
lot of the bugs that were in the game as well.

02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:09.300
They're including some new levels, including Underground and Wild West.

02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:13.700
Some new character campaigns, I guess Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

02:10:15.460 --> 02:10:16.820
Tyler the Creator as well.

02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:22.980
And hopefully fixing some of the bugs that were in the game, because it was pretty buggy.

02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:25.460
So, we'll see.

02:10:26.740 --> 02:10:28.580
All right, my turn.

02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:31.700
Let's get to Super Mario Maker.

02:10:31.700 --> 02:10:35.140
Some updates on that game, which is a game that I find I'm really addicted to watching

02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:36.900
people stream that on Twitch, I gotta say.

02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:42.180
Shane is always telling me about how he watches all these people playing games on Twitch.

02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:46.420
And then I kind of started just getting into watching random people play Super Mario Maker.

02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:48.100
So, that's kind of fun.

02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:50.660
But anyway, Super Mario Maker, some updates coming to that game.

02:10:51.140 --> 02:10:56.260
There is a new course based on the NES Remix series that's available in Super Mario Maker.

02:10:56.260 --> 02:11:00.980
And when you beat it, you will unlock the Frog Suit from Mario Brothers 3, which is

02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:01.620
pretty cool.

02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:06.420
But keep in mind, it's a costume for 8-bit Mario Brothers.

02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:11.060
It doesn't actually provide the functionality, nor can you use it in the Super Mario Brothers

02:11:11.060 --> 02:11:11.780
3 stages.

02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:12.500
That is lame.

02:11:12.500 --> 02:11:16.500
Now, I think Nintendo kind of realized the game was missing it, and there's been a lot

02:11:16.500 --> 02:11:17.300
of fan feedback.

02:11:17.300 --> 02:11:20.420
So, I think this is them kind of like at least throwing a bone to that whole thing.

02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:23.140
Maybe doing whatever they can with that.

02:11:23.140 --> 02:11:23.540
Who knows?

02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:26.980
Maybe there'll be a better patch or something later on.

02:11:26.980 --> 02:11:29.220
After all, they did add checkpoints to the game.

02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:30.500
They haven't had DLC yet.

02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:36.660
Not official DLC, but they have had these extra costumes through special levels you

02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:37.460
can play online.

02:11:37.460 --> 02:11:39.860
So, that's something.

02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:42.580
The level, by the way, is apparently really easy.

02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:45.380
So, you can unlock that costume no problem.

02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:50.980
Yacht Club Games talking about DLC and amiibo functionality.

02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:55.540
Because, you know, the Shovel Knight amiibo I think finally got dated for early January.

02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:58.020
So, there's also some DLC going to be coming for that.

02:11:58.980 --> 02:12:04.420
But, they are talking about new relics, equipment, the ability to customize Shovel Knight's

02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:08.260
look, challenge stages, and of course on Wii U there's going to be two-player co-op,

02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:09.620
which I think will be very exciting.

02:12:10.580 --> 02:12:17.700
Now, I guess somebody suggested that they should add Tingle as a character to the game.

02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:22.020
Since, you know, there's a Nintendo tie-in, and what an appropriate character for Shovel

02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:22.740
Knight, right?

02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:27.940
To which they replied, we don't have any plans for more Nintendo-specific DLC content.

02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:30.260
But, we'd love to do something with Tingle.

02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:31.140
He's the best.

02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:33.460
That is accurate.

02:12:33.460 --> 02:12:34.260
He is the best.

02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:37.540
Loki is available, by the way, for your voiceover needs.

02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:40.740
Just go play Flappy Vog if you want to get a preview.

02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:42.820
Yeah, don't.

02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:46.980
Last but not least, Retro City Rampage.

02:12:46.980 --> 02:12:49.540
Maybe this is a game more suited to your talents, Loki.

02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:52.900
Retro City Rampage going to be getting a sequel.

02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:57.220
And, if you ever played Retro City Rampage, you know, it's kind of an 8-bit looking game.

02:12:57.220 --> 02:12:59.860
So, of course, the sequel, it's a 16-bit looking game.

02:13:00.580 --> 02:13:06.980
Shakedown Hawaii is the same character that was in Retro City Rampage named Player.

02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:11.140
And it's going to be taking place 30 years after the events of Retro City Rampage.

02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:12.900
There you go.

02:13:12.900 --> 02:13:17.460
We know that Shakedown Hawaii will be coming out for Nintendo, PlayStation, and Steam.

02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:20.820
But, we don't know if there's anything extra beyond that at this point.

02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:26.100
But, if Retro City Rampage is any indication, it'll probably be everywhere.

02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:30.740
All right, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:34.900
You take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam those together, you get foogle.

02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:38.420
That is not the right song.

02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:40.980
That's awkward.

02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:43.620
Let's try that again.

02:13:43.620 --> 02:13:47.620
You take Facebook and Google and you throw them together and you get foogle.

02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:56.420
Much better.

02:13:56.420 --> 02:13:57.700
That's the song I was looking for.

02:13:57.700 --> 02:13:59.700
Why do I even have that other song in the playlist?

02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:01.620
Do we have a segment that uses that song?

02:14:01.620 --> 02:14:02.100
Which song?

02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:03.700
Santa Milette?

02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:05.540
I don't think we never heard that.

02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:07.140
Maybe we did at one point and I forgot.

02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:07.540
I don't know.

02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:12.100
It's been a long decade plus of our own here at O.L.R.

02:14:12.100 --> 02:14:14.980
When did we do that for Ask Orange Lounge?

02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:17.380
No, that's the Keyboard Mania song.

02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:20.820
It's the Keyboard Mania song, but I don't know if we did other things.

02:14:20.820 --> 02:14:21.540
I don't know.

02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:22.900
I have weird stuff in the playlist.

02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:24.580
Anyway, I was asked to ask Tetsuya.

02:14:24.580 --> 02:14:26.340
He knows more about the show than I do.

02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:29.140
All right, so let's get to tonight's question.

02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:33.140
This weekend, of course, is the PlayStation experience and more information was detailed

02:14:33.140 --> 02:14:37.460
on the PlayStation VR, including some game announcements like Res Infinite.

02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:42.580
Now that we're getting details on the games, how excited are you for PlayStation VR?

02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:44.660
Is it something you plan to purchase?

02:14:44.660 --> 02:14:48.260
Although admittedly, we don't know a price, but you're probably still forming some opinions.

02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:49.940
Why or why not?

02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:54.980
So we get to Andy R who says, I'm currently leaning towards getting PlayStation VR.

02:14:54.980 --> 02:15:00.100
I tried it at PSX last year and I liked the tech, but wasn't as impressed by the games

02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:01.300
or lack thereof.

02:15:01.300 --> 02:15:06.820
Playing Rigs at E3 and now seeing the several game announcements at PSX, I'm more convinced

02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:11.060
that Sony is making an effort to support it and devs are working on stuff I'll actually

02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:12.020
want to play.

02:15:12.020 --> 02:15:15.380
Price will obviously be the biggest hurdle for me, so I hope they give us news on that

02:15:15.380 --> 02:15:16.180
front soon.

02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:20.980
Fabrice A on Facebook says, I'll wait for a while.

02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:25.300
I'm afraid virtual reality will be a fad, just like 3D televisions were.

02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:28.020
The bulky goggles don't really help and it's expensive.

02:15:28.020 --> 02:15:32.180
Much like the Kinect, it's great technology with great potential, but I'm not convinced

02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:32.500
yet.

02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:36.100
SSG100Matt says, I'm still in a wait and see pattern.

02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:40.580
While I am a VR believer, I do think it will take some time for Sony and its partners to

02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:43.300
get a handle on the VR before it's optimal.

02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:48.900
Sadly, unless there is that must-have AAA title that Sony is hiding, I foresee consumers

02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:50.180
holding off as well.

02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:54.500
It's going to be a slow going and I'm sure initially for VR, but Sony needs to ride it

02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:55.380
out and support it.

02:15:56.020 --> 02:16:07.300
Degenerate Johnny says, I'm going to wait and see before I decide on Sony's VR system.

02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:11.700
Past disappointing gaming experiences have led me to wait, think, and look before leaping

02:16:11.700 --> 02:16:13.380
instead of taking leaps of faith.

02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:15.460
It all depends on how the market looks at VR.

02:16:15.460 --> 02:16:19.620
From what I'm seeing, it seems like this whole VR craze is a little too niche for comfort.

02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:22.340
Of course, that can change if it has enough support from developers.

02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:28.100
Rettertainment says, VR headsets strike me as the kind of thing I want to try for myself

02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:29.220
before I buy it.

02:16:29.220 --> 02:16:32.980
That's why I hope there's a HoloLens demo display set up at the Microsoft store or one

02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:34.100
of the balls near me.

02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:37.940
That way I can try it out, see how I like it, and hit up the Sbarro's for some pizza

02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:39.220
while I think things over.

02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:39.860
That's a plan.

02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:43.380
As far as the PlayStation VR, I don't think there's a Sony store near me.

02:16:43.380 --> 02:16:44.900
Maybe Best Buy can pick up the slack.

02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:48.900
Yeah, you never know who they might partner with or they may just take the show on the

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:49.140
road.

02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:51.140
They may get a truck out there to some malls near you.

02:16:51.140 --> 02:16:51.780
Who knows?

02:16:51.780 --> 02:16:53.460
Hopefully they have Sbarro's for entertainment.

02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:58.660
Jordan T says, I'm very excited for VR but nervous about how it will be embraced.

02:16:58.660 --> 02:17:02.820
One problem I think Sony may face is that by creating certain games only for VR, they

02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:04.900
divide their potential customer base.

02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:09.140
Well, the good news is, I'll say this, Jordan, Res, for example, and I think that 100-foot

02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:11.460
robot game, they are meant for both.

02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:14.740
So take that for what it is.

02:17:14.740 --> 02:17:19.060
Anyway, I'm hoping this will lead to third-party companies that develop VR experiences that

02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:24.820
can be ported to the many VR platforms because the alternative will be a future of VR-compatible

02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:28.660
games, which will essentially just replace the right joystick with head movement and

02:17:28.660 --> 02:17:32.740
add slight advantages like freedom of hand movement and driving and cockpit games and

02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:33.300
so forth.

02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:39.460
Hitstun says, looks like another Blu-ray versus HD DVD war coming on.

02:17:39.460 --> 02:17:45.460
I'll wait for one VR technology to emerge as the standard on PC and buy that one.

02:17:45.460 --> 02:17:47.620
The games might be worth it by them.

02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:54.020
You know, Hitstun, I respect that opinion, but I just don't see that happening with Oculus

02:17:54.020 --> 02:17:56.820
versus PlayStation VR.

02:17:56.820 --> 02:18:01.220
Maybe with all the other stuff, but I really feel like the way Facebook is approaching

02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:01.700
Oculus.

02:18:01.700 --> 02:18:04.020
Okay, have you seen this on Facebook feeds yet?

02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:09.220
That there's those 3D videos where you can move your phone around and you get the 3D,

02:18:09.220 --> 02:18:10.820
like that's starting to show up on my feed.

02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:12.420
Have you ever seen that come through on Facebook?

02:18:12.420 --> 02:18:12.820
No.

02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:13.700
Because I have.

02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:18.420
And when I first saw that, I said, you know what this is?

02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:20.980
This is the doorway into what's going to happen with Oculus.

02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:27.780
So I kind of feel like Oculus is going to really have the support of events, you know,

02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:28.580
concerts.

02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:30.580
And not to say it's not going to have games.

02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:32.020
But how do I take those photos?

02:18:32.020 --> 02:18:33.540
Of course it's going to fucking have games.

02:18:35.700 --> 02:18:36.900
However, they're doing it now.

02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:40.740
They taped that Paul McCartney concert in the Cirque du Soleil thing I saw somehow.

02:18:40.740 --> 02:18:42.660
I think there's specialized cameras that do it.

02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:45.700
But anyway, I'm not saying that's the only thing Oculus is going to have, but that's

02:18:45.700 --> 02:18:47.540
something that will differentiate it.

02:18:47.540 --> 02:18:51.780
Whereas PlayStation VR, you know, being a dedicated gaming thing, it's going to have

02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:54.100
a, one, it's going to have the baseline specs.

02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:57.780
So you don't have to worry about, you know, will my computer run it or will it not be

02:18:57.780 --> 02:18:59.140
good enough and all that stuff.

02:18:59.140 --> 02:19:04.740
But also the whole fact, like when Shane was describing the games where you saw one thing

02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:08.340
on VR and you saw another thing on the TV and that led to some co-op experiences, I

02:19:08.340 --> 02:19:10.340
don't think that's something that's planned for Oculus.

02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:13.540
So I do see some differences between them.

02:19:14.500 --> 02:19:20.740
But to be fair, to hit Stunt's point, I do totally see the point where it's going to

02:19:20.740 --> 02:19:26.660
be a very hard sell to convince somebody they need to spend $400 for an Oculus and who knows

02:19:26.660 --> 02:19:30.180
$400 or whatever it ends up being for a PlayStation VR.

02:19:30.180 --> 02:19:34.100
So by that nature, yes, there's probably going to be a little competition because most

02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:36.900
people aren't going to be able to break it down the way I just did, where there are some

02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:37.620
differences.

02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:39.620
The average consumer, if that makes sense.

02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:40.980
It's going to be VR is VR.

02:19:41.540 --> 02:19:44.500
So with respect to that, I totally get your point hits done.

02:19:45.860 --> 02:19:46.260
All right.

02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:52.660
Let's go over to me coughing and then we'll go over to Google Plus and read some of the

02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:54.180
answers over there.

02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:58.660
Actually, Tigerclaw in chat over at live.vognetware.com says you mean the YouTube videos.

02:19:58.660 --> 02:20:02.420
YouTube had that 360 Warcraft video and they had one for The Force Awakens recently.

02:20:03.460 --> 02:20:08.820
Actually, maybe it's the same thing, but I swear it was on my Facebook feed and it wasn't

02:20:08.820 --> 02:20:09.380
a YouTube.

02:20:10.180 --> 02:20:11.220
It was A Force Awakens.

02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:12.500
It was like a pod race or something.

02:20:12.500 --> 02:20:14.500
You can actually like look around.

02:20:14.500 --> 02:20:20.420
So I was like, I'm pretty sure that was something that's going to be coming for Oculus.

02:20:20.420 --> 02:20:23.940
And by the way, chatters to the rescue.

02:20:24.900 --> 02:20:29.300
Some folks in chat saying the song that I misplayed used to be what I would play when

02:20:29.300 --> 02:20:33.940
I read tweets more regularly, which by the way, I never really eliminated tweets.

02:20:33.940 --> 02:20:37.540
It's just that I still read them all the time.

02:20:37.540 --> 02:20:41.380
I just don't necessarily do them all on the show just because we have all these other

02:20:41.380 --> 02:20:46.100
segments like reading the answers on Google Plus, of which there's one from ActDeft who

02:20:46.100 --> 02:20:51.540
says the moment they showed Rez in there and for PlayStation VR, they pretty much sold

02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:52.180
it for me.

02:20:52.180 --> 02:20:52.980
I need it.

02:20:53.860 --> 02:20:59.460
And I'm sure when ActDeft heard Shane's review earlier tonight, that probably just cemented

02:20:59.460 --> 02:21:00.500
it for what it's worth.

02:21:01.140 --> 02:21:01.460
All right.

02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:01.940
So there you go.

02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:04.340
The FUGL question of the week.

02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:06.740
Have you made any decision on PlayStation VR yet, Loki?

02:21:07.540 --> 02:21:09.300
No, I have to see how much of it is.

02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:10.900
Yeah, price is going to be a big deal.

02:21:10.900 --> 02:21:11.940
And what games are for it.

02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:14.580
I mean, I like Rez and everything, but I'm not buying it just for Rez.

02:21:14.580 --> 02:21:21.220
And again, back to the whole HD DVD and Blu-ray war, even though I do definitely see the

02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:26.420
differences in the two VR, I do feel like I have to choose which one I want.

02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:32.020
I do feel like I'm going to end up getting one of them and I'm kind of leaning towards

02:21:32.020 --> 02:21:37.300
PlayStation VR at the moment simply because I am more of a gamer.

02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:39.140
But I do need to see what those games look like.

02:21:40.020 --> 02:21:42.180
And I don't really want to...

02:21:42.180 --> 02:21:45.300
I feel weird counting Oculus out because I don't think I should do that.

02:21:45.300 --> 02:21:47.700
So we'll see what happens in the coming months.

02:21:48.340 --> 02:21:50.100
2016 is going to be a very interesting year.

02:21:50.660 --> 02:21:51.700
Very interesting year.

02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:53.220
Let's get back to some news, Loki.

02:21:53.860 --> 02:21:54.740
All right.

02:21:54.740 --> 02:21:57.940
So Sony has revealed that they're going to be putting...

02:21:57.940 --> 02:22:01.540
Hey, you were looking to play some PlayStation 2 titles on your PlayStation 4.

02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:03.460
Well, hey, we've got those coming for you.

02:22:04.020 --> 02:22:06.340
Although it's not exactly how you might think it would be.

02:22:07.380 --> 02:22:11.700
Instead of being able to play your old games that you may have on disk or purchased as

02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:16.100
PS2 classics on your PlayStation 3, you get to buy them again.

02:22:17.220 --> 02:22:20.260
And they're going to be putting them out on PlayStation 4.

02:22:20.260 --> 02:22:23.060
They're going to be adding some support for trophies.

02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:26.740
Also, the games have been up-rendered to 1080p.

02:22:27.620 --> 02:22:32.420
And they have share play, remote play, live broadcasts, activity feeds, all that fun stuff.

02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:37.700
And second screen support for manuals on Vita or on the PlayStation app.

02:22:38.420 --> 02:22:45.460
And they're going to be priced between at least the first ones that came out, $9.99 and $14.99.

02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:52.020
I was really surprised this ended up being like a footnote at PlayStation's conference.

02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:52.500
They didn't...

02:22:52.500 --> 02:22:55.140
I think it's a terrible way to do it.

02:22:55.140 --> 02:22:56.100
Yeah, you're not a fan?

02:22:56.100 --> 02:22:56.740
Not a fan at all.

02:22:56.740 --> 02:22:58.340
Even with three Grand Theft Auto games?

02:22:58.340 --> 02:23:00.420
I don't even give a shit because you know why?

02:23:00.420 --> 02:23:02.660
Because I'm not buying those games again.

02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:05.380
I have Grand Theft Auto on disk.

02:23:05.380 --> 02:23:10.100
And the fact that Microsoft is able to pull it off where they can play their games and everything.

02:23:10.660 --> 02:23:12.100
Fuck, you can play...

02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:14.180
I mean, I'm not talking necessarily PlayStation 2,

02:23:14.180 --> 02:23:16.420
but like PlayStation 1 games, you can play those on a PSP.

02:23:17.780 --> 02:23:20.100
Why the hell do we not have emulation to support this yet?

02:23:20.100 --> 02:23:21.940
And why do I have to rebuy these stupid games?

02:23:21.940 --> 02:23:23.540
I understand that they're adding the functionality.

02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:26.180
Devil's advocate, they are adding some new things.

02:23:26.180 --> 02:23:26.900
Okay, okay.

02:23:27.780 --> 02:23:29.620
I don't need the fucking trophy support.

02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:31.380
And let's put it this way.

02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:35.940
I mean, the streaming and everything, that's just what you do on your system.

02:23:35.940 --> 02:23:38.660
I don't see why that's something that needs to be added.

02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:40.500
And they have streaming support on the Xbox.

02:23:41.140 --> 02:23:43.060
So I don't get it.

02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:45.700
Like, how about giving me the option?

02:23:45.700 --> 02:23:46.580
How about, hey...

02:23:46.580 --> 02:23:49.540
Well, of course it's not gonna give you the option because then you're gonna, you know,

02:23:49.540 --> 02:23:51.060
just pick the ones you already have.

02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:54.740
But like, I bought, you know, Twisted Mail Black already for like five bucks.

02:23:54.740 --> 02:23:58.820
I've got that in my library, but I can't play it until I buy it again.

02:23:58.900 --> 02:24:01.620
And let's be honest, I even watched like the videos that they had.

02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:04.580
It doesn't look that much better up res to 1080p.

02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:07.780
And maybe that's why ultimately this ended up being a footnote.

02:24:07.780 --> 02:24:11.060
Because maybe this is something that was planned for a while,

02:24:11.060 --> 02:24:13.220
but then when Microsoft came out with their thing,

02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:15.620
maybe PlayStation is having to re-evaluate their strategy,

02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:18.980
or they're just gonna stick to the whole, you know, we don't think people really want it.

02:24:18.980 --> 02:24:22.580
So they're kind of putting out maybe whatever they finished and gotten the rights for.

02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:26.820
But maybe this is just gonna be something that there's only ever a handful of them that show up.

02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:32.020
I guess sales will dictate a large part of that, but I have to admit,

02:24:32.020 --> 02:24:36.580
I mean, I'm not really super impressed with the launch lineup.

02:24:37.380 --> 02:24:38.100
I mean, I get it.

02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:39.700
Grand Theft Auto is obviously a huge-

02:24:39.700 --> 02:24:44.580
Same dress is a great game, but like, I just, it doesn't, I'm sorry.

02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:49.540
It's not, it, it doesn't, it shows its age.

02:24:49.540 --> 02:24:50.340
Let's put it that way.

02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:53.300
And upresing at the 1080p does not help.

02:24:53.300 --> 02:24:56.020
Like, a perfect example would be Final Fantasy 7.

02:24:56.020 --> 02:24:59.940
Okay, I bought Final Fantasy 7, the PC version for Steam.

02:25:01.300 --> 02:25:06.580
And yeah, everything's upresed, but it looks like shit, you know, upresed.

02:25:06.580 --> 02:25:11.300
It's not like, oh hey, you know, the models look better and everything, you know,

02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:14.260
they redid it, kind of like, you know, those HD collections and stuff.

02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:16.180
It looks like crap.

02:25:16.180 --> 02:25:17.460
Like, and that's cool.

02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:20.100
If you want to do like the HD remakes or whatever,

02:25:20.100 --> 02:25:24.100
or HD-ified versions of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,

02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:27.540
where it looks better, and hey, let's add some multiplayer into that,

02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:28.580
would be nice.

02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:32.820
Or hell, if you want to do like, you know, the Grand Theft Auto PSP games,

02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:35.540
upres that a little bit and add the multiplayer,

02:25:35.540 --> 02:25:38.580
because it did have multiplayer originally, just local multiplayer,

02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:41.460
but make it, you know, available for everybody.

02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:43.220
That would be cool.

02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:47.860
I'd purchase those again, but I'm not going to buy Twisted Metal Black again

02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:49.780
to play it on PlayStation 4.

02:25:49.780 --> 02:25:51.060
I'll play it on PlayStation 3.

02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:54.100
Fair enough.

02:25:54.100 --> 02:25:56.820
I guess they do have to convince people to part with that sum of money.

02:25:56.820 --> 02:26:00.500
I wonder if these games aren't going to end up being PlayStation Plus giveaways

02:26:00.500 --> 02:26:01.220
in the near future.

02:26:01.220 --> 02:26:02.180
Hey, that's cool.

02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:04.740
I kind of feel like they're sandbagging for that.

02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:06.820
If they want to do that, then that's fine.

02:26:06.820 --> 02:26:07.700
I'll accept that.

02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:10.260
I'll play Twisted Metal Black when it comes out free.

02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:13.300
So maybe a positive note to end on there.

02:26:13.300 --> 02:26:13.800
Who knows?

02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:14.760
All right.

02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:19.460
Hey, so VR is going to really rely on the games that come out for it, right?

02:26:19.460 --> 02:26:23.540
So getting the third-party publishers on board, pretty important.

02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:26.900
Or you have some problems, like maybe what the Wii U was going through

02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:30.420
before it had, you know, a library of Nintendo-created games.

02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:32.340
But some good news for VR.

02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:35.540
It looks like EA is looking into this.

02:26:36.100 --> 02:26:40.900
And that's because DICE has started hiring some engineers and creative folk

02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:44.100
to bring VR support to the Frostbite engine,

02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:47.060
which is, you know, EA's engine that they use for.

02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:49.060
I think that's what's in Dragon Age Origins.

02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:53.620
And what is going to be for Mass Effect Andromeda is the Mirror's Edge game.

02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:54.900
Pretty much everything's Frostbite now.

02:26:54.900 --> 02:26:59.300
When I think of what could go to VR, I think about Mirror's Edge.

02:26:59.300 --> 02:27:00.180
But then again, that game might be too...

02:27:00.180 --> 02:27:01.700
Battlefield, Battlefront.

02:27:02.660 --> 02:27:07.140
I think I want to say that even their sports games are using Frostbite now.

02:27:07.140 --> 02:27:08.740
Some of those games might be too fast.

02:27:08.740 --> 02:27:11.060
Like Mirror's Edge might be like a barfy VR game.

02:27:11.060 --> 02:27:13.220
You know, you'd have to tailor the experience, but you never know.

02:27:14.900 --> 02:27:19.300
So anyway, technical director Johanna Anderson was asked about this.

02:27:19.700 --> 02:27:21.940
Said it was a small and collaborative team.

02:27:21.940 --> 02:27:23.780
So don't expect anything big yet.

02:27:23.780 --> 02:27:26.180
But maybe this is them testing the waters.

02:27:26.180 --> 02:27:30.340
Maybe get some pet projects out there after all, as Jamie was saying earlier.

02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:34.260
Katamari Damacy kind of started as a project out of a school-related thing.

02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:36.340
So there is that.

02:27:36.340 --> 02:27:40.900
So anyhow, EA seems to be plotting something.

02:27:40.900 --> 02:27:43.460
So we'll see what comes of that maybe at E3 this next year.

02:27:44.900 --> 02:27:45.620
All right, Loki.

02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:47.000
All right.

02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:50.840
So apparently Capcom's decided, hey, you know what?

02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:53.800
We're gonna go ahead and trademark Onomusha.

02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:55.640
Maybe they're gonna be putting out another game.

02:27:55.640 --> 02:27:57.720
Or doing like some sort of remaster.

02:27:57.720 --> 02:28:02.360
Or maybe they're trademarking this so they can release this as a PlayStation 2 title.

02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:03.640
I mean, I don't know at this point.

02:28:03.640 --> 02:28:06.920
But all we know that they have trademarked it.

02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:07.420
It's...

02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:09.800
I don't know.

02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:12.040
But I guess they were saying that also...

02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:17.560
They have the Onomusha Soul, which is a browser game.

02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:22.600
But they're saying that it was ported to the PlayStation platforms in Japan.

02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:24.200
So hopefully it's not necessarily that.

02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:27.560
But hey, that'd be kind of cool if they didn't do a new Onomusha game.

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:33.320
I'd like to know kind of what Capcom's up to outside of Street Fighter right now.

02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:36.760
So that would be pretty cool if Onomusha is what they end up returning with.

02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:38.760
We'll see.

02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:40.040
Would you pick up a new Onomusha game?

02:28:40.040 --> 02:28:41.160
Is that something you'd be interested in?

02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:43.320
Never a series I got into.

02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:43.820
Yeah?

02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:45.180
Fair enough.

02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:48.200
I don't know if this is a series that might interest you.

02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:53.640
But you know, we're liking to remake a lot of old PlayStation 3 stuff for the new generation.

02:28:53.640 --> 02:28:56.520
For PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and of course PC.

02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:01.720
And it appears that Dead Island could be the next target for that sort of treatment.

02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:09.160
There's a Dutch retailer that has apparently listed a redo version of Dead Island

02:29:09.160 --> 02:29:11.720
for 39.99 euro.

02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:14.280
That's about $40 our currency.

02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:17.000
No release date or anything.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:22.680
It's published though by Metro redo publisher Deep Silver.

02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:28.040
So I mean it does kind of all add up that if Metro got one and this is a Deep Silver game too.

02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:29.400
This could very well happen.

02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:34.040
I wonder if it would be the first one and Riptide kind of together.

02:29:34.040 --> 02:29:36.280
And I wonder if they'd fix some of the bugs.

02:29:36.280 --> 02:29:39.000
Because when I played Dead Island Riptide it was pretty buggy.

02:29:39.080 --> 02:29:40.600
So we'll see.

02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:43.160
But that could be interesting.

02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:44.600
Especially if the price is lower.

02:29:44.600 --> 02:29:50.120
And again I'm theorizing it could be the first game and the second game.

02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:52.200
But who knows it may just be the first game.

02:29:52.200 --> 02:29:53.480
So we'll see.

02:29:54.360 --> 02:29:57.960
It could look really good visually though if they get it with the 60 frames a second and all that stuff.

02:29:59.640 --> 02:30:03.080
All right Brad from Pod Culture over at live.vognetwork.com says,

02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:06.840
I love Dead Island and I'd kill for a Left 4 Dead remake.

02:30:07.480 --> 02:30:11.800
You know I'd like to see Valve put out something with the number 3 in it.

02:30:11.800 --> 02:30:13.480
Like Left 4 Dead 3.

02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:14.840
Or Left 3 Dead for all I care.

02:30:14.840 --> 02:30:16.840
I would like to see them put out something.

02:30:16.840 --> 02:30:19.560
Yeah Valve's been so quiet.

02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:22.040
There's Dota but that's...

02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:25.000
That was huge but I'd like to see something new.

02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:26.920
Yeah.

02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:27.560
Just something.

02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:28.760
What's going on Valve?

02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:31.480
Gabe you never call you never write?

02:30:32.840 --> 02:30:33.640
What's going on?

02:30:34.600 --> 02:30:37.240
Unless they're planning like something like the orange box where they're just

02:30:37.240 --> 02:30:40.040
going to drop a whole bunch of shit on us at once which could be...

02:30:40.760 --> 02:30:41.160
I don't know.

02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:43.000
It might be overload.

02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:44.040
We'll see.

02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:46.760
All right let's get into the mailbag.

02:30:53.880 --> 02:30:56.840
Every week we invite your emails to our email address.

02:30:56.840 --> 02:30:59.880
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:30:59.880 --> 02:31:05.800
And usually DarkSakura dives in the mailbag and picks out her favorite emails but tonight

02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:06.440
it's me.

02:31:07.240 --> 02:31:10.440
DarkSakura's not here so I'm going to do the emails for you guys.

02:31:10.440 --> 02:31:12.520
So let's get into it.

02:31:13.240 --> 02:31:17.720
We have a few emails tonight so I'm going to try to get through these since we're already

02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:18.920
running along here.

02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:23.560
But let's get to our first email tonight which is from Sam Shepherd who says,

02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:24.680
Hello OLR crew.

02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:25.720
I love the show.

02:31:25.720 --> 02:31:28.280
Are any of you looking forward to backward compatibility?

02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:33.000
Would any of you have purchased the Xbox One and or the PlayStation 4 sooner if backwards

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
compatibility was available at launch?

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:38.840
What gets me is that in the beginning of this console generation back compatibility was

02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:40.200
thought to be impossible.

02:31:40.200 --> 02:31:45.320
Why do you think Microsoft and Sony are all of a sudden able to make back compatibility

02:31:45.320 --> 02:31:46.840
happen with such ease?

02:31:46.840 --> 02:31:47.480
Thank you.

02:31:47.480 --> 02:31:48.680
Love Sam Shepherd.

02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:51.160
Thank you for the email.

02:31:52.600 --> 02:31:53.880
Well I don't think they have.

02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:55.800
I mean they've had their basics.

02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:57.080
Sony clearly hasn't.

02:31:57.080 --> 02:31:59.000
Well actually I take that back.

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:03.240
I kind of think Sony's plan has always been this PlayStation Now thing.

02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:08.760
I kind of think that's their thing but so it seems weird that they haven't seen me taking

02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:13.560
off though it's not having that appeal that like Netflix has like I don't see that as

02:32:13.560 --> 02:32:17.640
a service like oh my God I need to I'm gonna go on there and like just be blown away about

02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:21.800
the amount of games that are on there and if they got PS2 and PS1 games in there too

02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:23.320
which I thought they were supposed to do.

02:32:24.120 --> 02:32:29.800
So I don't know Sony's Sony's sending a lot of mixed signals on backwards compatibility

02:32:29.800 --> 02:32:32.360
right now and I think that's why a lot of us are confused.

02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:37.720
So I don't know I'm not sure I'm understanding what the hell Sony is doing but I always thought

02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:41.400
as far as the tech was concerned Sony was just going to solve that through the streaming

02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:47.160
thing but the streaming thing you know where that really shines is SharePlay and that whole

02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:51.880
thing I mean that that's great because of the streaming so it's kind of funny that I

02:32:51.880 --> 02:32:56.360
use that way more than I probably would use PlayStation now so kind of interesting.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:02.600
But as far as Xbox One that is interesting how that popped up later and you know your

02:33:02.600 --> 02:33:06.440
question was why do you think they all of a sudden are able to make it happen with such

02:33:06.440 --> 02:33:11.640
ease because they put effort into it because Microsoft got clobbered and they needed something

02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:15.640
to really kind of differentiate themselves from PlayStation and you'll notice that when

02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:20.360
they sell the backwards compatibility thing they're not afraid to take the dig that

02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:25.480
oh well your existing Xbox 360 games are playable and you don't have to rebuy them

02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:28.680
who does that you know that type of things that's where that's Microsoft's whole thing

02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:33.400
and to their credit I mean good for them I mean seriously and and the other thing too

02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:38.680
is that they're doing those X the their version of the PlayStation Plus free games or whatever

02:33:38.680 --> 02:33:43.720
yeah in the games of gold and hey you own an Xbox One guess what those Xbox 360 games are

02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:49.480
giving away free those work as well yeah so I have to say Microsoft kind of has a great

02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:55.560
plan with that and something I really appreciate and if they had done this at launch it might have

02:33:55.560 --> 02:34:02.040
swayed me on a Xbox One a lot sooner than I ended up getting one the only thing is that the library

02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:07.400
does still feel really limited and I hope when they talk about expanding it I really hope they

02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:12.520
aren't just blowing smoke up our ass because I feel like the Xbox 360 with the original Xbox

02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:17.000
they expanded it like twice and then it was done a lot of these really big things and they promised

02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:22.520
to like make you know really support it and get behind it game room thousands of games the

02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:30.840
original backwards compatibility yeah you know Xbox that's why I still have caution this cautionist

02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:37.080
optimism with that um here's the big thing though is that I think the guy running Xbox now

02:34:38.120 --> 02:34:44.680
is way better and knows what he's doing way more than uh Don Mattrick did and sorry for the shade

02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:49.240
but it's just it's obvious and I kind of think backwards compatibility didn't start

02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:56.920
until the the changing of the guards at Microsoft and I think it was uh on an agenda that it wasn't

02:34:56.920 --> 02:35:02.440
on before and I think that I mean because when did Microsoft start making better decisions when

02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:08.920
Don Mattrick was gone and I I you know I kind of feel bad kicking that guy but I mean it's just

02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:17.400
that's the reality when he left things got better yeah so anyway there it is our long-winded answer

02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:23.480
to your email but hey thanks for the email I appreciate that let's get to another email

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:29.960
tonight from uh Raginator uh hi everyone as per usual it's Raginator after listening to the last

02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:34.840
show's podcast dated 1122 and having heard your responses to my last email I thought I should

02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:40.040
follow up with responses and clarifications just a reminder thank you because it has been two weeks

02:35:40.040 --> 02:35:47.080
my last email dealt with my eventual purchase of a gaming PC plus the idea for Loki regarding the

02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:53.320
rocket-propelled asplosing weasels I like the idea about Newegg I'm gonna truncate this a little bit

02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:56.920
because it's long I went through them once or twice before it didn't occur to me to look at

02:35:56.920 --> 02:36:01.320
Newegg again while I agree wholeheartedly that building a PC would make sense from a financial

02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:05.880
standpoint there's several issues regarding that namely aside from upgrading a PlayStation 3's

02:36:05.880 --> 02:36:11.640
hard drive I have no knowledge direct or indirect pertaining to building PCs never built one before

02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:17.960
nor watched anyone do it before I'm gonna interject real quick guess what you have a resource out

02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:22.760
there where you can watch anyone do almost anything and it's called YouTube and I have

02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:27.400
learned how to do some crazy shit on YouTube you can learn how to bake things sometimes by

02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:33.640
drunk people you can learn how to fix weed whackers and lawn mowers you can learn how to

02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:39.960
fix the I've used it to learn because my car's windshield wiper blade has this weird lock thing

02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:44.840
on it like in my old car was super easy to change the blades and on this one it's a lot harder and

02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:50.440
YouTube showed me how to do it so just the thought rage nator if you're able to do it from where

02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:55.320
you're accessing internet now YouTube some tutorials and yes you can watch somebody build

02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:01.960
it and it's I mean it's it seems daunting but it's not too difficult I mean it's really there's

02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:07.080
not a lot of moving parts there mm-hmm it's just kind of plugging some stuff together that's it

02:37:07.080 --> 02:37:11.320
don't break anything and he goes on to talk about his comfort level and he doesn't have a background

02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:16.760
in it and so forth and he figures by being he'd be better buying off building a pre-built PC

02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:21.160
and over time easing his way into that area by learning a little over time and you know what I

02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:24.600
think I said this two weeks ago and I say it again there's no shame in doing that if that's

02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:27.800
what you got to do you got to make the decision that's best for you and if you got to get a pre-built

02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:33.480
PC it's going to work it'll be it'll meet your needs it might have a lot of adware and bullshit

02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:37.800
on it but you'll figure out how to deactivate all that stuff it'll be fine Loki did mention

02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:42.040
possibly getting a laptop at this point I want to shy away from that granted laptops are portable

02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:45.800
but the thing is that from what I've seen and heard aside from RAM and internal hard drive

02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:50.280
you really can't upgrade a laptop not only that but all the laptops I've previously seen had

02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:55.160
integrated graphics I'd want something with a dedicated and beefy GPU and video card you can

02:37:55.160 --> 02:37:59.720
get that you can get that with a laptop but I do feel like you make a valid point otherwise

02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:05.160
so it's a fair thing to consider Rob did make a good point where I tend to play a lot of games

02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:09.560
on Steam like Magic etc stuff that will fall under the umbrella of casual games that aren't resource

02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:13.880
hogs the thing is although I do like games like that that's not all I'm interested in as it stands

02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:19.080
there's games on my Steam library like Portal 2 that crash within seconds at most of my $400

02:38:19.080 --> 02:38:25.480
laptop other games like Saints Row 4, Injustice and so on they run poorly so if I don't have

02:38:25.480 --> 02:38:30.680
anyone to help me build a PC I want to build something that can play fairly beefy games so

02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:34.520
well good luck to you Rage Nator I appreciate the follow-up and again I don't know how much access

02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:38.600
to YouTube you have but that could help with the tutorial but at the same time if you end up having

02:38:38.600 --> 02:38:44.760
to go with a PC in a box go for it but don't be afraid to ask questions you know don't buy the

02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:49.800
first PC in a box or the one that matches descriptions ask questions and you know what

02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:56.920
a question is that you should ask how easy is this to upgrade this machine myself and listen

02:38:56.920 --> 02:39:01.400
carefully to the answer because you may get an answer that talks about how you can upgrade the

02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:07.800
machine yourself but you may also get an answer that is well you can call and order a part and

02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:12.760
you know and they try to lock you into and I would shy away from that if you're gonna have to buy

02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:18.840
something from within the same ecosystem so just a food for thought I really think though with any

02:39:18.840 --> 02:39:23.640
machine you really can upgrade the parts yourself it just might be kind of hard because I did have

02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:27.560
a gateway I did buy a computer in a box once because I had a lot of the same reservations

02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:33.080
you had and I remember replacing the video card it was a pain in the ass because it didn't really

02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:39.640
fit in there right but we did it eventually I think we ended up burning not burning metal

02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:42.120
bending metal metal in the process but we made it happen

02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:48.840
uh SG100Matt in our chat says research research research you have to do research you could email

02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:53.480
the show a dozen times but you won't know unless you research yourself fair enough I'm sure he's

02:39:53.480 --> 02:40:01.240
doing some research already uh Martin emailing us tonight uh from uh Belgium Belgium he says

02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:04.920
Martin the Belgian here although he's not actually in Belgium anymore he moved to the States a while

02:40:04.920 --> 02:40:08.920
ago remember I think he said he's in Atlanta because I remember you saying why didn't you

02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:13.480
go to Dragon Con uh Martin the Belgian here it seems like an eternity since you guys have been

02:40:13.480 --> 02:40:17.880
on the air yeah that's not going to get any better I apologize but here we are listen to this show

02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:21.800
half and half make it last uh starting to miss listening to you while you're at work hope you

02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:27.080
guys had a great Thanksgiving I wanted to mention how excited I was at my first Black Friday video

02:40:27.080 --> 02:40:32.840
game deal since I moved to the States I picked up Until Dawn for $20 at Best Buy that's a hell

02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:37.160
of a deal and I didn't even have to trample or stab anyone to get it just ordered it online

02:40:37.160 --> 02:40:41.560
very happy about this because I wanted to check this game out but not a full price

02:40:41.560 --> 02:40:47.000
you guys kind of make fun of Best Buy sometimes and I agree that to some extent however for gamers

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:51.480
they have this membership card that is actually awesome and this doesn't ever get mentioned it's

02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:57.480
$30 for a two-year membership and gives you 20% off all new games new as in not secondhand this

02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:03.560
basically means all $60 games are by default $48 all the time over time this can save you a ton of

02:41:03.560 --> 02:41:07.000
money I'm not affiliated with Best Buy in any way I just want to mention this as some people

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:11.400
might not know about this and video games are expensive you know it's really funny you bring

02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:17.320
this up how do you think I got Xenoblade Chronicles X you know it's ironic too about all that too

02:41:17.320 --> 02:41:23.080
having worked in the video game industry $48 is cost for most games yeah so they're selling it at

02:41:23.080 --> 02:41:29.880
cost so or below cost so their profit is purely from coming from that card and anything else that

02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:33.880
you get in Best Buy at the time interesting uh I want to say this though you know what's

02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:41.080
interesting um I got Xenoblade Chronicles X but Shane gets the games for me and he'll get two

02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:46.040
copies and he gets them for $48 and then I just give him cash you know because he knows I'm good

02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:50.920
for it we probably should sign up for that I mean I just have I'm too lazy to go he's actually

02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:56.840
yelled at me like why did you order that on Amazon because I can get it for you for 48 bucks so uh

02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:03.320
yeah it's it's it is a pretty good program I must admit so um do you know of any other

02:42:03.320 --> 02:42:07.320
good ways to save on console games there's steam sales of course but for consoles it's

02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:12.200
a bit more difficult no that's actually I mean just keep an eye on for the sales like I just

02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:19.960
purchased um Wolfenstein the new order for $10 they had it on sale during the their flash sales

02:42:19.960 --> 02:42:24.200
that they do on the Playstation store and that's how I get a lot of my games I got like I just

02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:29.640
wait you know I don't get stuff right away I got Battlefield 4 for $10 a while back I haven't

02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:34.600
played very much of it but I still bought it you know and I kind of shop that way I just wait for

02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:39.480
stuff to go on sale if you don't already have one get a Twitter account and follow gamers because

02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:43.960
usually if there's a really good need to know about sale it gets tweeted about a million times

02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:48.520
otherwise the internet is a great resource for all that stuff um I know a lot of people use that

02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:54.520
cheap ass gamer site which has forums uh where somebody like posts target ads and Walmart ads

02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:58.920
and all that stuff like every week um so I know that's a good way that's kind of like an all-in-one

02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:04.920
type of resource so um but yeah if you don't have a Twitter account get one and follow uh gaming

02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:08.920
accounts and uh probably that cheap ass gamer probably has a Twitter account and I imagine

02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:12.920
they put the best stuff on there yes they do yeah so because I'm like I'm pretty sure I've seen

02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:18.520
their retweets before so yeah there you go so uh internet research would be our suggestion

02:43:19.320 --> 02:43:23.880
one more thing from Martin here another thing I recall Rob mentioning that Rob Roberts is his

02:43:23.880 --> 02:43:29.480
radio name last show Rob Roberts is not his real name it's not I've been listening to you guys on

02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:35.160
and off probably for about 10 years and never realized this mind blown well Martin then I'm

02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:42.200
doing it right keep up the great show Martin again it's about separating the radio life from

02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:49.640
the work life two separate lives all right uh we still have some more emails here we have a short

02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:55.560
one here from Emily hi Emily thanks for the email who emails us tonight Rob asked last week about

02:43:55.560 --> 02:44:01.480
our usernames and what they mean I have been using mere muse for at least 15 years it comes from an

02:44:01.480 --> 02:44:07.000
episode of Batman the animated series in the episode a rich crazy man believes he is Thor

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:10.920
when Batman shows up he decides Batman is his brother Hades of the underworld

02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:15.240
Thor's lawyer or accountant was in the room and he mumbles something talking to Hades away from

02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:21.720
these mere muses the lady slams her briefcase shut and mumbles yep that's me just a muse I've

02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:27.800
been using the name since that's me just a mere muse I like that story uh for a while when I was

02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:33.960
younger and naive I was learning to read tarot cards I use seek 21 it is the last card of the

02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:41.560
major arcana and it is known as the world so seek 21 meant seek the world oh that's pretty cool

02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:44.680
I had some friends that were into that a long time ago the tarot card stuff so

02:44:45.320 --> 02:44:50.120
that's really cool thank you for sharing the story and I saw a few more you uh post on the

02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:53.960
Fugu question of the week so I appreciate that I did read all those and I always find those

02:44:53.960 --> 02:45:00.760
stories really fascinating all right one more email from yyr so it's long but not as long as

02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:06.680
he usually makes them and of course he's starting off hello lr starts off rob I've got a bone to

02:45:06.680 --> 02:45:11.480
pick with you and the email's done I'm just kidding uh why do you gotta hate on toad and

02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:16.440
super mario brothers too because he sucks uh toad is my go-to guy for almost every level because

02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:21.400
he's the fastest and I don't have to wait an hour for him to pick stuff up a year if we're talking

02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:26.280
about the princess toad is the man by the way if you haven't picked up captain toad for Wii U I

02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:30.600
highly recommend it it's great but it's even better if you play it with someone else two heads

02:45:30.600 --> 02:45:34.200
are better than one for some of the trickier puzzles I do have captain toad and captain toad

02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:40.440
is a lot of fun uh but I do still want to say I have an irrational hatred for toadette uh that I

02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:45.080
think has come up on this show before uh that probably dates back to mario kart double dash

02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:53.160
um I just I really don't like toadette um but here's it's the jump thing he can't jump for crap

02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:57.720
that's why I don't like toad and super mario brothers too Luigi he's the man he does his

02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:03.160
little flappy legs he's like he does little kinky legs and he can fly and he practically

02:46:03.160 --> 02:46:08.520
floats too if you you know what you're doing when you're playing luigi so I don't like toad

02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:15.160
because even though he's tiny he doesn't float so there's there's my my opinion deal with it

02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:20.840
uh oh he has some advice on reginator's new pc when the program world network was still a thing

02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:25.960
and 2d x 20 was coming out it required a major hardware update as it was the first hd version

02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:30.200
of 2d x I actually volunteered to build a computer for an arcade in queens new york

02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:34.360
I'd never built one before but I also had realized how much easier the process had become over the

02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:39.640
years it's now so easy even I can do it and I've been described by others as mechanically inept

02:46:39.640 --> 02:46:44.520
which is accurate you're essentially snapping a motherboard in a case snapping a cpu and some ram

02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:49.480
into it plugging in a power supply then installing a hard drive and a dvd or blu-ray drive as a

02:46:49.480 --> 02:46:55.400
cinch see but you you did just name like four steps so it's all right I agree though it's a

02:46:55.400 --> 02:46:59.720
lot easier than it used to be uh finally you have to drop in a video card and you're finished that

02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:04.200
is literally everything you have to do youtube has tons of videos on all of this it's so funny

02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:08.600
we thought the same thing there it was so easy that then I built another computer for myself

02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:13.560
afterwards with a modest video card and intel cpu and I couldn't be happier I run bimani and steam

02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:18.520
games on it and it costs less than 450 in total I would encourage anyone to try it even if you

02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:22.760
are mechanically inept as I am but if you're absolutely against the idea I recommend buying

02:47:22.760 --> 02:47:29.080
a general a decent general purpose computer making sure it has a full length PCI express

02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:35.080
slot and then adding a video card of your choice lastly I want to announce that the multitasking

02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:40.280
is through the first round of the selection process for the magfest indie video game showcase

02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:44.440
oh I hope you get picked because I'll be at magfest uh for the second round I am required

02:47:44.520 --> 02:47:49.400
to produce a demo and I've been warned that not all the judges may have xbox 360 controllers

02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:54.840
so I've added keyboard controls does that sound interesting uh it should because I'm now thinking

02:47:54.840 --> 02:48:00.040
about the possibility of a pc version if there's any listeners who would like to try out this demo

02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:09.560
and offer feedback I invite them to email me at yyr at yyr games.com um where's my demo where's

02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:15.800
the demo attached to this email you forgot somebody yyr me me me me me hope you all had

02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:19.800
an awesome thanksgiving and that you didn't blow all your money in the sales that followed

02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:25.000
that was from yyr thank you all for the emails we had some good emails tonight that's the one good

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:29.000
thing about taking a show off is that then we have a lot of emails to come back to I did work

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:34.440
on my game for about one minute this entire two weeks no seriously I've been trying I've been

02:48:34.440 --> 02:48:38.520
seriously like just scolding myself listen why aren't you working on the game why don't you

02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:42.760
work in the but I'm just like so brain dead I can't I can't do it and I really want to

02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:48.040
I kind of work want to work on something else but I do want to get my game done and I'm

02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:56.040
gonna try harder to work on it you can do it I believe in you I need to get something out this

02:48:56.040 --> 02:49:02.760
year that's my goals to get it done something out this year even if it's absolute shit even if it's

02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:09.480
on the 31st of December and it probably will be at midnight all right well uh let's get

02:49:09.480 --> 02:49:23.000
what an appropriate while we're beating ourselves up let's get to the FUs of the week

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:37.640
um I don't know I guess fu for some of the players I'm playing with for ingress you know it's

02:49:37.640 --> 02:49:42.600
not their fault their best intentions you know they're trying to block the other team but I

02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:46.680
spent two hours driving to auburn to create a field to go from auburn to shingle springs

02:49:47.320 --> 02:49:52.360
and one of our team members blocked me on the way back from auburn when I said I was on my way back

02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:56.440
from auburn and that I was going to do this in specifically outlined it he's like I kind of

02:49:56.440 --> 02:50:04.120
fucked you I'm like a little bit at least got to see auburn is pretty but scary the as fuck driving

02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:10.440
on those roads when the rain's coming down and wind and leaves it's like uh but yeah I wasted

02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:16.600
two hours you should have 88 what he did at least you got unique no but I did myself no here's the

02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:20.440
thing though I didn't realize it until I got to shingle springs and I would have had to drive back

02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:24.680
another 45 minutes to go with ada that and then drive and I had to pick up my son anyways and

02:50:24.680 --> 02:50:28.600
it's just like okay well had I known he had blocked me I wouldn't have driven the shingle

02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:33.720
springs I would have just gone picked up my son so we needed to communicate better as a team I think

02:50:34.280 --> 02:50:40.200
it's fucking us all right uh let's see my fu of the week goes to the fact that I was sick a month

02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:46.040
ago and I'm still coughing and also to the fact that I I banged myself up real good a week ago

02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:50.120
you guys and uh that was that was a shitty experience to go through today is the first

02:50:50.120 --> 02:50:56.040
day where my lip finally has no pain even like a really really really dull pain but it was bad

02:50:56.040 --> 02:51:00.600
uh like my two front teeth slammed into my lip and like you could see the impressions

02:51:00.600 --> 02:51:06.680
that the teeth made in my lip it was crazy so ew but you know you didn't buy a chunk out of

02:51:06.680 --> 02:51:11.160
your tongue like my sister did actually yeah actually in some ways I was really lucky that

02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:15.960
I didn't have a worse injury honestly so I was I was very fortunate in that regard

02:51:16.760 --> 02:51:21.640
so uh william murder face and chat over at live.vog network.com says rob did you get falcon

02:51:21.640 --> 02:51:26.600
punched uh it felt like it definitely felt like it a couple more stories for you guys then we're

02:51:26.600 --> 02:51:32.120
going to open up the skype line at 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio I do

02:51:32.120 --> 02:51:37.080
want to warn you guys though if nobody calls then we're going to close shop because it's already

02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:40.680
nine o'clock but I do want to at least give time for a few of you to get through so get ready to

02:51:40.680 --> 02:51:46.040
call uh if you want to call uh loki so um apparently

02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:56.520
namco is teaming up with hooters to bring some gaming like barcades I guess to japan

02:51:57.080 --> 02:52:04.680
and I guess they're going to open this um it's called gaming bar side b and it's uh coming in

02:52:04.680 --> 02:52:11.800
I guess shibuya on december 18th it features all you can eat um and game for 30 minutes

02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:21.400
for 1500 yen and then I guess you know I don't know I like the idea of uh

02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:28.040
busy japanese women I mean that that's a plus um however though if it's anything like the

02:52:28.040 --> 02:52:33.080
hooters over here their food is fucking terrible so but I do like video games so

02:52:33.640 --> 02:52:40.200
two out of best two out of three I guess right so yes uh and you know people don't go to hooters

02:52:40.200 --> 02:52:45.640
for the food so it'll be nice to be able to go to hooters for the game and let's just say you know

02:52:45.640 --> 02:52:49.720
if it's in japan the food might be better because they probably serve different type of food there

02:52:49.720 --> 02:52:55.240
and it's probably not as crap as the food that we have here because I've tried hooters several times

02:52:56.200 --> 02:53:00.760
sometimes mostly out of desperation because it was just it happened to be the location nearby

02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:05.320
we wanted food and I've tried three different things and every single time it's fucking sucked

02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:10.040
and it's been awkward and like uncomfortable and the food has been fucking terrible

02:53:11.960 --> 02:53:16.280
yeah again we don't I haven't been in a while I think the last time I went was with my friend

02:53:16.280 --> 02:53:20.760
victoria and it was just more of a just tip for the laughs type of thing and I was like

02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:26.120
this isn't this isn't very good food but but the the servers are all really nice

02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:28.200
yeah the servers are nice and I mean

02:53:30.200 --> 02:53:33.000
it's just like you should take your boys there for a family dinner

02:53:33.640 --> 02:53:36.520
they wouldn't care yeah they're not gonna care is it just

02:53:38.520 --> 02:53:44.360
maybe nelly will have fun who knows all right uh moving on one more story for you guys tonight and

02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:50.200
this is uh this be getting a lot of people talking this week uh project m you guys know about this

02:53:50.200 --> 02:53:56.840
this was a super smash brothers melee uh it was like a mod uh that I'm sorry sorry not

02:53:56.840 --> 02:54:03.400
not melee it was for the Wii version super smash brothers brawl that was modded uh but some people

02:54:03.400 --> 02:54:08.120
liked what was in melee in the gamecube that remains the popular one uh a lot for a lot of

02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:14.200
people uh Wii U isn't necessarily the go-to one for everybody so some folks retooled the

02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:20.200
Wii version super smash brothers brawl to have more of the features like the gamecube version

02:54:20.200 --> 02:54:25.080
and then they actually were putting in some extra characters as well although I think they did have

02:54:25.080 --> 02:54:31.560
some rules to try and avoid legal uh squabbles with Nintendo like uh they didn't have Nintendo

02:54:31.560 --> 02:54:37.400
characters that weren't already in the smash series I think uh something like that uh so yeah

02:54:37.400 --> 02:54:42.760
um here's the thing though they abruptly ended the project and they said it was not a legal

02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:47.560
takedown by Nintendo but they said it's been an excruciating call to make but it's been made a

02:54:47.560 --> 02:54:53.560
bit easier by our satisfaction with the previous and final release 3.6 we spent six years polishing

02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:58.200
project m and rather than let it drag on through another several years of dwindling development and

02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:03.320
change fatigue in the competitive circle we're going to consider our work complete they go on

02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:06.760
to say we can't spill the beans just yet but know that we're looking towards a fresh start with

02:55:06.760 --> 02:55:11.480
brand new designs rather than splitting our focus many of us want to dedicate ourselves to this new

02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:16.360
venture fully in this way we hope to maintain the level of quality and professionalism you've come

02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:20.840
to expect from us so there it is they're gonna make their own game or something I wonder if they

02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:25.080
won't make their own game uh but the interesting thing about project m it shows up in tournaments

02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:31.880
and stuff like not anything on the super but you see the cons it was of basically it was just a

02:55:31.880 --> 02:55:37.800
modded save file that you could load on an unmodded system you can just pop in the sd card

02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:45.400
and load up the stage and away you go yeah so uh some uh interesting comments in chat over at live.vog

02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:50.440
network.com uh william murderface says rumor is that nintendo was planning on dropping a massive

02:55:50.440 --> 02:55:56.200
lawsuit around the time of their next patch we'll see uh act f says project m the reason why we

02:55:56.200 --> 02:56:00.920
can't have nice things tiger claw says the problem is the smash melee community is a bunch of elitists

02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:06.840
um kaijuta says i'm sure brawl had game exploits that those noobs want to hold on to so they don't

02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:12.600
update wow all right uh and william murderface says then again high level gaming and elitism

02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:17.880
seem to go hand in hand far too often i will admit i've never played project m i thought it was

02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:23.800
fascinating that it went on as long as it did without getting shut down by nintendo i find that

02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:30.440
extremely fascinating um but you know people got to do what they got to do for their own reasons

02:56:30.440 --> 02:56:36.120
uh last night my buddy ended his show after 14 years project m wants to pull the plug after

02:56:36.120 --> 02:56:40.760
six years that's their prerogative and maybe they have a different idea on what they want to do from

02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:47.160
here on out so all right that's going to do it for news stories tonight we are now going to open up

02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:53.400
the skype line over at 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio which is already

02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:58.440
lighting up dang we're getting to it let's get to the phones hi you're on orange launch radio

02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:04.040
who's this hey there's like death hey act f how you doing uh really great really great right now

02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:10.040
good good to hear from you what's up well when when are you saying uh sorry when when are we

02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:17.960
starting the petition to get the uh the rest rest infinity uh suits oh my god those suits they were

02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:23.720
wearing on stage that kind of looked like that's what tron run r looks like is those suits that

02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:30.040
were on the stage it looked uh it looked amazing um so yeah that was that was such a surprise to

02:57:30.040 --> 02:57:34.760
see tetsuya mizuguchi in one of those uh suits as well because i don't think we've heard a lot from

02:57:34.760 --> 02:57:44.200
him i thought i could be wrong i thought i heard he parted ways with his former studio that made

02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:50.120
all the stuff like luminous and and all those q entertainment i so yeah maybe not because

02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:54.680
rez entertainment would still kind of be that right so i don't know so maybe they've worked

02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:59.160
something out i don't know but it was it was really a delight to see him yeah i was i was

02:57:59.160 --> 02:58:04.920
really surprised to see the uh see him at the end of the of the video wearing the suit and all that

02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:11.480
stuff uh many people didn't recognize him at first but i admittedly knew who he was and i was pretty

02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:17.320
excited watching all the video i was i was like oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god

02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:27.160
oh my god uh i i really really wasn't that sold on playstation br but seen uh rest infinity

02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:34.680
yeah i'm sold on it uh i'm pretty much getting it at one point at least but yeah and probably

02:58:34.680 --> 02:58:38.920
hearing shane talk so enthusiastically about it probably only uh heightened that a little bit

02:58:38.920 --> 02:58:44.280
i'm sure well and the other thing too i was sorry to interject um but like they showed off that ace

02:58:44.280 --> 02:58:50.680
combat game which looked pretty awesome but that made me think i want a vr ridge racer game come on

02:58:50.680 --> 02:58:56.920
me too actually i was thinking about the same thing where's my ridge racer br like seriously

02:58:56.920 --> 02:59:00.920
now were you the one that had like a relative that was super into ace combat you were tweeting about

02:59:00.920 --> 02:59:06.760
that that they were very yeah yeah yeah my brother uh who's uh sitting right next to me playing

02:59:06.760 --> 02:59:13.640
destiny uh yeah he was pretty excited to see uh ace combat 7 especially with br too that series

02:59:13.640 --> 02:59:17.720
has been dormant a while wasn't the last release on xbox 360 if i'm not mistaken it's been a little

02:59:17.720 --> 02:59:24.200
while yeah well i think the last release was ace combat 6 or either one of the psp ones but yeah

02:59:25.080 --> 02:59:31.320
but i think it was uh really oh yeah sorry no no he's correcting me right now assault

02:59:31.320 --> 02:59:36.760
horizon was the last one oh right right right i was just thinking of the ones in the numbered

02:59:36.760 --> 02:59:43.560
series but yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yeah that was released on pc and also 3ds also got it

02:59:44.040 --> 02:59:47.320
well yeah that's exciting i mean i know they didn't show any gameplay from it but at least

02:59:47.320 --> 02:59:51.400
it shows that you've got big studios because you know namco bandai is a pretty big developer

02:59:51.400 --> 02:59:55.720
you know that are embracing the vr thing and then of course ubisoft showed that interesting vr thing

02:59:55.720 --> 03:00:00.680
with the birds and all that um so and now we're hearing that ea might be kind of putting their

03:00:00.680 --> 03:00:04.680
foot in the pool to see if if the temperature is good for them so uh be interesting to see what

03:00:04.680 --> 03:00:12.600
comes that because yeah vr is going to really need the big triple a experiences that necessitate the

03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:21.400
peripheral you know just kind of like the the we sold its concept on we sports uh playstation vr

03:00:21.400 --> 03:00:25.720
needs its we sports and i'm not saying it literally needs a sports title but it needs a title like

03:00:25.720 --> 03:00:32.200
that to really get people to buy in yeah hopefully it will get one uh it looks it's looking pretty

03:00:32.200 --> 03:00:39.800
good i i like i said i wasn't that sold about though uh sorry though i there wasn't really

03:00:39.800 --> 03:00:46.680
like a game to oh i i need to get playstation vr because of that for me right now it's pretty

03:00:46.680 --> 03:00:54.680
much rest but hey my brother wants uh is combat by uh seven and there's other games like shane

03:00:54.680 --> 03:01:02.840
talked about uh tonight that that sound really great there the at least uh he made it sound like

03:01:02.840 --> 03:01:09.240
really great game so at least fun so yeah there's there's a lot to uh look forward to

03:01:09.240 --> 03:01:15.480
uh on playstation vr and nakolas on all on all vr stuff that's pretty helpful too where like when

03:01:15.480 --> 03:01:20.440
in the family it's like okay you guys can make an investment for your whole household because

03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:24.840
you know that your brother will be into ace combat and you'll be into res and there's kind of like

03:01:24.840 --> 03:01:29.000
that whole something for everyone so that diversity uh in the titles that you put out

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:34.760
there is very important as well yeah pretty much yeah awesome well anything else you want

03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:40.440

much it is it um what about uh real quick i'll just kind of ask you overall with the game awards

03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:40.840
we didn't really dig into a whole lot of the uh details about the news out of that i think

03:03:40.840 --> 03:03:45.480
everything's kind of come up another conversation tonight but uh what did what do you i know you

03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:48.840
didn't really watch the awards but what did you think about the whole thing itself do you think

03:03:48.840 --> 03:03:52.680
a third year will be necessary do you think it'll continue i think they should do it i mean i didn't

03:03:52.680 --> 03:03:59.960
think it was a bad show i mean it was fine i mean i didn't i really kind of skimmed it i watched the

03:03:59.960 --> 03:04:04.520
trailer so that's really kind of what i wanted to see is the new game trailers um so i you know

03:04:04.520 --> 03:04:09.800
checked out far cry primal it looks different not a game i'm gonna pick up but it looks interesting

03:04:09.800 --> 03:04:15.000
i know a lot of people are kind of excited about that because it's a little bit of a different

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:23.960
take on far cry um so the batman telltale game looks pretty oh yeah that does that sounds awesome

03:04:23.960 --> 03:04:29.160
um i don't know i mean there's a lot of stuff to be excited for i just hope a lot of the stuff

03:04:29.160 --> 03:04:33.240
that's being announced isn't going to be delayed and and here's the thing i'm kind of noticing too

03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:38.280
is like there's a lot of stuff that's coming out for 2016 like i don't realize that it's coming out

03:04:38.280 --> 03:04:43.160
like maybe it's because i'm not like working in the industry anymore but like i just saw the a

03:04:43.160 --> 03:04:50.600
release date for uh fire what was it fire watch or like um i think it's called fire watch that

03:04:50.600 --> 03:04:56.520
is kind of like a stylistic indie game or something like that it's you know for the first

03:04:56.520 --> 03:05:03.720
person and it looked interesting and then you know what next year they'll start delaying it all to

03:05:03.800 --> 03:05:09.800
2017 and we'll be having this year's crackdown i do like crackdown i'm not gonna buy an xbox

03:05:09.800 --> 03:05:17.400
