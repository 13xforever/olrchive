0	17640	This week, after a round of expected and unexpected wins, happiness and outrage swept
17640	21320	the internet during the Game Awards, but perhaps the biggest surprise is who is not present.
21320	24320	There's much to cover as we enter the final month of the year, and it all starts right
24320	31320	now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
31320	34600	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34600	40560	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight on December the
40560	48000	6th of 2015 with episode number 623 of our show. My name is Rob Roberts, coming to you
48000	54760	live from Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, and we'll be here to talk about gaming, gaming
54760	59640	culture, and the gamer lifestyle. Here in studio with my co-host tonight, I only have
59640	64440	with me tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki. Hello. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing
64440	70400	okay. Yeah? I know you were Ingersing a little bit before you came over here. Yeah, I bet.
70400	76240	She's like an hour and a half. I still, the whole fact that that used to be a thing that
76240	79400	you would, I don't know if you'd say make fun of me for, but you gave me a hard time
79400	83520	over is now something you probably play more of than me at this point. Maybe. I don't know.
83520	89560	I don't know. I mean, and it really was only during like, um, the double AP things, double
89560	94080	experience and, and now I'm at a level like where it's going to take a lot of time to
94080	100200	get to the next level, but there's, I don't know. I'm not like that. No, I, I, I'm totally
100200	103960	the, you know, like looking at maps and shit, you know, and driving the fucking Auburn for
103960	109360	no fucking reason. So I can't say that I'm not that into it because it is interesting
109360	114600	how that game gets you out and seeing the world. Like I've learned so many like backroads
114600	119840	in my community and places that I never knew existed. So I'll give the game that, you know,
119840	124920	for what it's worth. Yeah. So is that, but then I'm also like, Ooh, next weekend I'm
124920	132200	going to be in San Jose. I get to get all those uniques. I'm really excited. So, uh,
132200	137160	anyhow, not joining us tonight in studio, the one and only dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
137160	143120	She will not be joining us in studio tonight. She will join us via telephone later on, uh,
143120	147680	for one of her regular segments. Uh, she could not be here tonight as, um, something and
147680	151120	I guess I'll have to have her explain it later when she's here, but something about, she
151120	156080	kind of hurt herself. She was helping a friend move, uh, yesterday and I guess she can't
156080	159680	drive right now cause something, I don't know if she did something to her neck or something,
159680	162920	but anyway, uh, so she unfortunately couldn't get over to the studio tonight, but we will
162920	167940	be welcoming, welcoming her by phone later on. Uh, and if you want to call us on Skype,
167940	172940	you can later on in the show, we will open that up. Uh, you can also participate along
172940	177300	the show along with the show in our chat room. Uh, if you are listening live to us because
177300	181960	we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network, a vog network.com
181960	185760	six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby black will show. And if you
185760	191440	do happen to be listening live, you should join our chat room live.vog network.com where
191440	197240	you can have a comment such as Akuma JP who says, telephone, what's that? I know it's
197240	203200	a, it's that other thing your cell phone does besides check Facebook and use apps. It's
203200	206760	that that old fashioned thing. Actually, it's funny that Akuma JP says that in our chat
206760	212040	room because I saw a pay phone the other day, like at a gas station, like a legit old school
212040	215760	pay phone. And I actually took a picture and I was like, what is this relic? It's just
215760	221120	really funny. Like how far technology's gone where, um, you know, I remember what 20 years
221120	226040	ago, it was a car phone, not really a flip phone or handheld. Maybe it was kind of right
226040	231160	around that transition, but a cellular telephone. That's right. A cellular telephone. And I
231160	235480	always, I, Oh, this is such an obscure reference, but I don't even care. I always think of that
235480	239120	movie Romy and Michelle's high school reunion, which is one of my favorites. Like it's one
239120	243280	of those like stupid comedies, but like, so stupid. It's, it's great. And there's a
243280	248160	whole scene involving a cell phone and it's like a gigantic, like brick looking phone.
248160	252160	And she goes, if anyone needs to make a call, I've got a phone. Cause she's trying to show
252160	256440	that she's like really successful at her high school reunion, even though, you know, they're,
256440	262920	they're unemployed or whatever the plot was. So derailed by a tangent. Yay. Uh, anyhow,
262920	267120	uh, you can join us via Skype. We'll open that up later on in the show, orange lounge
267120	272360	radio. I like, I like how it says, I don't know the way the Loki said it made me think
272360	278120	of a random bit in Kung free. Yes. That's cause that's exactly why I said it that way.
278120	283880	Because of everything in your life is Kung fury. Not everything, almost everything. It
283880	288600	should be. All right. But, and I don't think we were doing the show yet when this announcement
288600	294640	came out, one of my most favorite movies of all time, similar title Kung pow is getting
294640	299520	a sequel. Congratulations. I remember when you were obsessed with that movie. I want
299520	302640	to say it was when we were living together in the early days of OR. Oh, I don't even
302640	306380	know how many times I've seen that movie. It's ridiculous. But they're finally making
306380	311040	a sequel about damn time. Congratulations. Yes. That'll be, how long is this going to
311040	313600	take for the sequel to get a sequel? I don't know, but I've got enough movies lined up.
313600	318240	So I've got the Deadpool movie. I've got ready player one at some point and now Kung pow
318240	323640	2. Isn't that the theme of like this decade? I swear like, and it's like all things entertainment.
323640	328240	I mean, with television, uh, what twin peaks is coming back, which don't get me wrong.
328240	332200	I'm here for that. Cause I fricking love twin peaks, but uh, what X files is coming back
332200	336400	as well. You know, we have all these old TV shows that are coming back after a hiatus.
336400	340960	Um, and then, uh, the same thing's kind of happening with movies. Like you talked about
340960	345680	there, uh, and star Wars. Hell, I mean, most people figure, I wasn't that hyped about star
345680	350440	Wars. And then I watched, I actually watched like a fan clip where they took all the clips
350440	353560	from everything and tried to put it in like what they think is the chronological order.
353560	356240	I'm like, Ooh, that looks really cool. Yeah. Right. Right. Like I'm like, I got to watch
356240	360600	that now. I'm not, I always considered myself more of a Trek guy than a Wars guy. And, and
360600	364920	especially after you see the prequels, you're like, ah, I think, I think this might be done,
364920	368600	but I mean, I, I'm, I'm even kind of hyped about the new movie. Like I really want to
368600	373240	go see it. I don't know if I'll see it in the theater opening night cause uh, I think
373240	377600	there's going to be a lot of very loud people, but uh, I'll go see it, you know, during the
377600	382080	day on Christmas week or something. Who knows? I'll go see it a little bit later. Um, but
382080	387000	yeah, I'm excited about that. But then also since this is a video game podcast, hell,
387000	391560	what was one of the biggest things to come out of the PlayStation experience yesterday
391560	395760	was that update on the final fantasy seven remake and that, that new trailer. Did you
395760	402040	watch that trailer? Oh yes. Yeah. Yes. I, I was really surprised. Final fantasy seven
402040	408040	cross 13 basically. I don't even know versus cross 15 I think. Yeah, I'm sorry. That's
408040	413640	right. It's 15 now. Yeah, it's cross 15. Am I the only one that has a really hard time
413640	418780	at this point calling it a remake? I mean, it's not a remake. It's a reimagining to me.
418780	422360	It's the final fantasy seven reimagining. It's like we took the plot and the characters
422360	425720	and just call it final fantasy seven. I mean, by the time it comes out, just call it final
425720	430520	fantasy seven. Just like now they did like hit man and you know, in tomb Raider, you
430520	434160	don't need to like have seven remake. It's just, that's a good comparison. It's like
434160	438520	tomb Raider, like the new tomb Raider really had nothing in common with the old tomb Raider
438520	444900	besides Laura Croft. And she had kind of the same job. You know what I mean? Yeah. So,
444900	449320	but the new tomb Raider was obviously flipping fantastic. And I think, I don't know. I'm
449320	454260	super hyped after seeing the final fantasy seven reimagining trailer. Uh, I know some
454260	459560	people a little awkward with the battle system. I think we really don't know enough about
459560	463840	it. I think we're reading a lot into it from what we saw. It's awesome. Yeah. One of the
463840	468160	things about final fantasy has always been presentation. And I think, you know, the one
468160	473120	thing we didn't see in that trailer that we needed to see, that's going to really like,
473120	476800	I think maybe if people were really upset with what they saw in the battle system, we'll
476800	483400	bring them back. Summons. What was always the Epic part of a final fantasy games? Summons.
483400	488160	Right. So, uh, Knights of the brand. I'm going to go make a sandwich. Let's, let's hope the
488160	494080	summons are skippable this time for God's sake. They shouldn't be, you know, we'll see what
494080	497720	happens there. Uh, go into our chat for some other comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
497720	503320	Akuma JP says final fantasy seven reskin. When you say reskin, that makes me think, that makes
503320	506080	me think of, and I know we'll get into it later in the show, but that makes me think of what
506080	510560	they're doing to the PS2 games on PS4. It's like a little bit of a cosmetic upgrade and,
510560	515240	and kind of done. Uh, I don't know. Uh, let's see. SSG100Matt says, I think they're just
515280	519520	calling it final fantasy seven remake until they think of a creative name to call it something
519520	523640	else. I just hope they add like more to the game, like advent children or something like that,
523640	527400	like that whole storyline would be awesome. Well, but it's going to be the same story,
527400	531640	I think. So I think I I'm with you where they ought to just call it final fantasy seven,
531640	536960	but we all kind of know it's the remake. Unless you weren't old enough to know,
536960	542000	but the media's definitely let you know that this is a remake of an older game. I wonder
542240	547000	if Aerith's going to still die in this. No, that'll be the DLC expansion. She lives.
547000	553040	The Aerith revive potion for only $4.99. Who knows? Oh, Hey, cool. We can, you know,
553040	557360	get her limit breaks and whatever. I don't know. Well, anyway, speaking of that trailer,
557360	562520	uh, we're going to have joining us in studio in a little bit. Uh, Shane Alinko is going to join
562520	567680	us here. He's not here at the top of the show because he is driving back from San Francisco
567680	572720	right now. Um, so he's going to be joining us. I think he's, he's only about, you just texted me
572720	576600	and he's not that far away. So he should be here in probably about 15 minutes. He was actually at
576600	582020	PlayStation experience this weekend. So I, we want to talk to him about what it was like, um, to be
582020	587320	there at the show, the energy in the room, what we might not have seen on the stream. Um, I think
587320	590360	sometimes you can really see a lot when you're there in person that might not always come
590360	595160	through on a broadcast. Um, and I know he got hands on with a lot of the games. Uh, he actually
595400	600200	did get to play rez infinite in the full VR and he has some strong opinions on it. So we're gonna
600200	604960	talk to him about that, uh, in a little bit whenever he gets here. So, uh, we'll look forward to that.
604960	610160	So, uh, overall, did you follow the news out of PlayStation experience where you kind of, I had it
610160	616080	on a screen while I was taking phone calls cause I was at work. So I had it on my laptop screen. I
616080	620480	was kind of like occasionally trying to listen to it and stuff. So I didn't really follow it too
620480	626560	closely. Um, I thought that they showed, you know, it wasn't expecting a whole lot and I thought
626560	631520	they showed a lot more than, you know, I was expecting them to, I felt like they dropped more
631520	636200	bombshells last year. And I know I was commenting this to Shane and we were texting each other a
636200	639200	little bit during the thing. I was kinda like, I feel like they dropped more bombshells last year
639200	644680	and it was more of a like, like a action packed conference last year. But I admittedly, I'm
644680	650440	probably not being very fair because last year the bar was not a, it was the first time they ever
650440	655160	did it. So we had no expectations going into it. So when we heard about things like street fighter
655160	662200	five and you know, the things they announced last year, uh, the final fantasy seven first remake that
662200	666080	then they just kind of had as a footnote this year. Oh, by the way, if you wanted that, it's out
666080	670760	today. That whole thing, right? That was a big thing last year. Um, we didn't, weren't expecting
670760	676320	anything. I think this year now it was like a precedent's been set. So we knew to expect some
676320	681480	things. And I think in all fairness, I think it was about probably the same that they had last
681480	687720	year. Um, I know the Nino Cooney two thing caught a lot of people by surprise myself included. I
687720	693720	mean, I enjoyed the game and I know, I know that game is a VOG network in joke of sorts because
693760	698720	Bobby, um, our pal who's on before us here at VOG couldn't finish the demo. Yeah. Well, well, and
698720	703720	to be fair, the demo for Nino Cooney was terrible. It really was. Um, I took a chance on the game
703720	708760	anyway, and I'm glad, I'm glad I did because the full game explains things a lot better than the
708760	715320	demo did. Um, but I, I enjoyed the game, but I kind of wasn't expecting it to get a sequel. And so
715320	720280	the fact that they announced one genuinely surprised me. I kind of thought that wasn't going
720280	725960	to be a thing, but it is. So I guess, hooray, I'm sure Flacco Jones was doing cartwheels. Yeah, he
725960	729940	was there at the, uh, PlayStation experience as well. So I'm sure he was excited about that. I
729940	733240	don't think they had it playable by any means though. I think that was a very early announced
733240	739120	trailer. Probably. Yeah. Awesome. All right. Uh, well, let's get into, um, since Shane's still
739120	742480	not here yet, let's get into a kickoff topic tonight and then we'll get into our gaming week.
742480	748040	So, uh, Loki, another big of, I mean, PlayStation experience was one thing. Do you remember when
748040	752320	December was like no news month and it was like, well, we're just going to enjoy all the games that
752320	757960	came out in November and, uh, we'll have new games to talk about come March or so like that
758080	764200	dynamic has changed just in the past two years with PlayStation experience. And now another event
764440	769760	that has a lot of people talking about a certain moment, right? Loki, the game awards, uh, 2015,
769760	773880	they hosted it again this year and streamed it live on the internet. I didn't actually get to
773880	780400	watch it live because I just didn't unfortunately. Um, but I got to catch up on it after it was,
780400	784800	everything was done, but I did get to watch the video playback of some things. I mainly just want
784800	789360	to watch the trailers and everything cause you know, just don't care who wins. But, uh, one of
789360	796240	the awards that was given out was her best action adventure game and the award went to Metal Gear
796240	802800	Solid Five Phantom Pain. And so of course you'd expect, okay, you know, the developer, um, Hideo
802800	808040	Kojima should be accepting that award because you know, he's kind of the face of that series.
808960	815320	However, he wasn't there. Um, instead Kiefer Sutherland, um, accepted the award on his behalf
815360	822680	anyways. And the reason he wasn't able to attend is because he is barred legally by Konami from
822680	827080	attending the award ceremony. And this was actually explained right after the acceptance by
827080	833160	Jeff Keeley. Um, basically saying, as you notice, Hideo Kojima is not here. Mr. Kojima had every
833160	837920	intention of being here, but unfortunately he was informed by a lawyer representing Konami that he
837920	843120	would not be allowed to travel to tonight's award ceremony to accept any awards. He is still under
843200	849360	employment and contract or employment in contract. And it's disappointing. It's inconceivable to me
849360	854400	that an artist like Hideo Kojima would not be allowed to come here and celebrate with his peers
854400	855400	and fellow teammates.
857800	863120	I have to admit, I was pretty impressed by that moment. I mean, for all the shit that Jeff Keeley
863120	868480	has gotten about being the Dorito Pope and all that stuff, I thought that was a pretty rad moment
868480	873520	that he kind of broke the fourth wall in that regard. And, you know, we all know something's been
873520	879760	really off with Konami for a couple years now, right? We've all kind of like, what's going on with
879760	884080	that company that we used to love so much because they've fallen from grace and hidden every branch
884080	890080	on the tree on the way down, it seems like. And, um, you know, I thought that was really interesting
890080	896560	for him. It was kind of a risk too, for him to call out Konami because, I mean, just a couple
896560	899440	weeks ago on the show, we were talking about the whole blacklisting and that whole thing, right?
899440	904800	And that was a big controversy was going on. Yeah. To see like what there are no games that they're
904800	909520	making. You're not going to get access to nothing that we're making. You beat me to the easy punch
909520	912800	line. What's he going to get blacklisted from? You're not going to play this particular machine
912800	919520	before it comes out. But I thought that was pretty ballsy of him to break the fourth wall in that
919520	923520	regard. And I think a lot of people kind of applauded him for it. And certainly on the other
923520	928720	token, there's a lot of people that are going, okay, what is Konami fucking smoking at this
928720	934000	point? And like, seriously, I would love once, I'm sure it's probably an NDA and stuff, but like,
934000	941440	seriously, what the fuck transpired to cause all this to like, just why, who is deciding that this
941440	946560	is like the way to treat your developer? That's bringing basically in a ton of money for you.
946560	953280	And I get that he's under contract and I get that he has this non-compete clause, but to bar him
953280	960080	from an award show to pick up an award, that's kind of a dick move right there. Like there's
960080	965520	what, what possible good thing. It's the same dick move when they took off his
965520	970320	name from the actual game, when they dropped his name off the title there. Yeah. I mean, that,
970320	974880	that's, that's the thing. They want that game associated with Konami and not with Hideo Kojima,
974880	982480	which is like, right. That's not going to happen. Yeah. Dungeonbuster in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
982480	988720	says, this is not the Konami I grew up with. And I think that really sums up how I feel too. And
988720	995360	you know, this, again, this has been just this slow. It's, this is going to be a horrible
995360	1001280	comparison and I apologize in advance. It's like Atari. But it's like watching your friend overdose
1001280	1005680	on something or something. It's like, or, or be in a really bad, horrible relationship where it's
1005680	1012480	like, it's slowly like getting worse and worse. And it's like, this is not the Konami that I
1013040	1018720	remember at all. And of course, you know, here at Orange Lounge Radio, myself, Loki, Dark Sakura,
1018720	1023520	we all met playing a Konami video game, a series of Konami video games, really. You've been invited
1023520	1029520	to Konami press events a couple of times. Yeah. But it's like, but none of those people that we
1029520	1035920	were friends with are working for them anymore because Konami's really changed. So let me ask a
1035920	1041840	very honest, blunt type of question. Is Konami fucked beyond repair at this point? I think so.
1041840	1047120	I think that they were fucked beyond repair before this event. And it's just even worse now. They,
1047120	1051680	and I don't think they fucking care. I think they're just like, whatever, we're done. We're
1051680	1058000	done with this segment of the business anyways. So it's all mobile in pachinko slots. I hope it
1058000	1064800	does well. So you think Konami has just basically written off hardcore gamers for lack of a better
1064800	1069280	term. Konami has basically decided, and you know, I guess we have heard this before in so many
1069280	1075040	words. Konami is not interested in this side of the business anymore. I hope that they know what
1075040	1080480	they're doing because I know the mobile space is, I mean, it can be profitable, but it's just,
1081040	1086720	there's so much out there. I mean, you're not going to have like the Angry Birds game,
1086720	1091360	or you're not going to have, you know, the next Candy Crush saga or whatever the hell that you
1091360	1096720	think you're going to release. I mean, so I don't know what they're expecting. I hope that they're
1096720	1100800	successful in that. But at this point, I don't really fucking care either, to be honest. I mean,
1100800	1108320	it's like at this point, I just, whatever. I wish, I hope their IPs that I do enjoy are maybe
1108320	1114400	sold to somebody else. Well, as tacky as my earlier comparison might have been, you know,
1114640	1118160	the thing I think Konami really needs at this point is an intervention.
1118160	1125920	Like, and I'm talking about the people that are investing, the board. I like, how is the company
1125920	1130080	continuing to make these type of decisions? I like, it just kind of blows my mind how they
1130080	1135440	can shoot themselves in the foot so often and so repeatedly. Like, is there any PR at Konami?
1135440	1138880	I don't even understand what the point would have been if, like, he showed up at the awards
1138880	1143760	ceremony. I mean, what would that have done for Konami? Nothing. That would have done nothing
1143760	1148000	negative to Konami. It might have even been a positive to kind of be like, hey, you know,
1148000	1152960	Konami made this game that's getting this award. Woohoo. Like, it could have been kind of an okay
1152960	1158080	moment for Konami amongst all this messed up stuff. But were they worried that Konami was
1158080	1163760	going to get up there and go fuck Konami? Hashtag. Like, were they, were they worried about that?
1163760	1168400	I, it just seems really silly to me. I don't know. I mean, at this point though now, I mean,
1168400	1172240	even if you have those casual games coming out, I mean, I guess we're not the same audience for it,
1172240	1178320	but, like, you would think that you wouldn't try to burn those bridges. I mean, maybe try to get
1178320	1182320	those people involved in those games. Like, hey, you like this license? Because what's the point
1182320	1188080	in licensing this stuff? Stuff that really is going to be appealing to fans of that series that
1188080	1193040	love those hardcore games. What's the point in licensing that for these casual games if these
1193040	1198480	casual game players don't know what the fuck those licenses are? Yeah. It's like, does, like,
1199440	1203200	does grandma know what the fuck Metal Gear Solid is? Is she going to fucking care when
1203200	1206560	she's playing the Castlevania pachinko slot machine or whatever the case may be?
1206560	1210400	It's like, they don't fucking care. Well, the goal might be to lure a younger audience into
1210400	1215360	gambling, to be fair, but that's, that's neither here nor there. I still think Konami is, is in
1215360	1220000	need of an intervention. And honestly, at this point, I would not be sad if there was a hostile
1220000	1224880	takeover of the company and somebody else bought them. I, I, I would like actually somebody else
1224880	1229200	to buy their intellectual property and do some good things with it. Um, I don't know if that'll
1229200	1233280	realistically happen because yeah, Konami still does have this mobile arm and this,
1233280	1239760	this pachinko arm. But at this point, I don't know who's running that company, but they're doing
1241360	1246880	from the hardcore gamer perspective. They used to really, really respect Konami, love Konami
1246880	1251680	and the products they're doing. Uh, they're really just burning all their bridges with us. And I've
1251680	1258240	kind of had it like, and they can kind of go sit and spin and it's, it's frustrating. Uh,
1258240	1262320	for Kojima though, at least, Hey, he's out of it now and we'll see what happens come January.
1262880	1266640	He'll go independent, go somewhere else and some great games will come out from it.
1266640	1273360	I am ready for the sit down interview that Hodea Kojima is going to do probably with Jeff Keighley
1273360	1277600	come January after this mess. And we'll see, you know, he might still be restricted from
1277600	1282720	saying some things, but I am ready for that interview. So we'll see what happens.
1283760	1289040	But even before, like, you know, uh, Kojima, I mean like itagaki, I mean,
1289040	1292640	shit, like all these people, you're like top talent. You're just fucking them over.
1292640	1298160	And like, what's the point, uh, looking at chat over at live.vognetwork.com, uh,
1298160	1302560	sg100. Matt says the board is probably all for this because they all believe that mobile and
1302560	1306800	pachi slots are highly profitable. Uh, can, can you even talk about what happened at the game
1306800	1311600	awards sg100. Matt says it's a petty move. Konami knows Kojima made them in a way and they didn't
1311600	1316880	want to give him his moment in the sun. Um, and then, uh, dungeon buster and chat says as cold
1316880	1322080	as it sounds, as long as their bottom line remains, uh, Rosie from their other divisions,
1322080	1327920	I doubt they'll care two or three quarters from now. Um, and blueberry and chat says,
1327920	1333360	can't be fun for any of the employees. I would not want to be the people running
1333360	1337680	Konami's Twitter right now. And it's not their fault. The people that have to run that Twitter,
1337680	1342560	you know, the social media management or wherever that's their job, but I'm sure those people are
1342560	1348000	probably just as easily frustrated. I mean, come on, haven't y'all worked for a company in the
1348000	1351840	past at some point where you were like, I don't know what those people upstairs are doing, but
1351840	1361040	I don't know if I totally agree with what's going on. So anyway, uh, stepping into the studio right
1361040	1364160	here, Shane Alinko finally made it. I used to work for one of those companies, you know what
1364160	1369920	it was called? Konami. What did you think of that whole, well, then I'm very curious what you have
1369920	1374960	to say. I thought it was hilarious. I have no friends left at Konami. They've all left by now
1374960	1383440	because they wised up. Um, but yeah, that was so good. What do you mean by they wised up?
1384320	1389360	I mean, even back when I worked for Konami, you could still, you could tell something just wasn't
1389360	1396320	right there, uh, with not my direct management. I actually liked my direct management even though,
1396320	1403520	like, not everybody always got along. The people I worked with and my office, the Redwood City
1403520	1409200	office, we were, it was awesome. Um, but there were decisions coming from higher up than the
1409200	1415760	Redwood City office that never made any sense and you could just see the writing on the wall,
1415760	1425120	um, that the company was not being run the best it could possibly be. So, uh, well, I'm, I'm of the
1425120	1429680	mindset that somebody else needs to be running the company at this point. It's embarrassing.
1429680	1433120	Also, breaking news, because I'm not sure if you guys talked about, but apparently there was a press
1433120	1437360	release sent out tonight for Final Fantasy VII Remake. Looks like it's going to be episodic.
1439200	1445600	Yeah, it says it will be told across a multi-part series with each entry providing its own unique
1445600	1450800	experience. What's the source on that? Uh, press release, uh, that was sent out. Kotaku's posting
1450800	1455120	it. I've saw it on Twitter too. I was, it's the first site I went to that talked about it. Huh.
1456400	1461840	Oh, that's, uh, kind of makes me less interested in playing it, but we'll talk about the PlayStation
1461840	1467600	Experience stuff. That, uh, that leaves a taste in my mouth that I don't like. I, I don't, I don't know.
1467600	1474480	I, I feel like they're doing that to get the game out the door quicker, but that also makes me wonder
1474480	1479680	if they're not planning on selling it in stores. If it's going to be episodic. Like download only.
1479680	1483680	Like download only. Yeah, episodic stuff usually is until all the episodes are finished and then
1483680	1488400	they release it. It makes sense, though, if they are going to put it out quicker, because usually at this point
1488400	1493840	they just announced the remake there, um, last year and they were like, or no, this year, was it?
1493840	1498880	Yeah, at E3 this year. They're like, oh, we really haven't done anything on it yet, but then come
1498880	1504720	PlayStation Experience, we have not only, like, actual in-game combat footage, but we have English
1504720	1512000	voices, which never happens this early on. So I could see that and I, when I put it that way, I'm not
1512000	1519920	super offended by it. If they price it reasonably, which Square doesn't usually, um, it could be okay.
1519920	1523920	Yeah, it looks like they have the prologue part of the game finished, because you could see that
1523920	1528720	Scorpion boss and so they, basically what used to be the demo from SN7, they probably have done.
1528720	1532800	Yeah, what I got in my PlayStation Underground way back in the day. Yeah, right, or, or, uh, which I
1532800	1539360	still probably have that disc. Toeball number one or whatever, right? Yeah. So, um, ah, gosh, I just, I, I don't
1539360	1543440	know, though, the episodic thing is still really weird to me. It depends on how many episodes, too. Like,
1543440	1551440	I don't want a 28 episode game. I'll take, like, I could take up to, like, between five and ten at most.
1551520	1555520	There is a part of me, though, that wonders if that's their key to trying to get it done faster.
1555520	1560720	That maybe they're trying to get the first part out next year. But my thought was maybe they could
1560720	1565360	just release the game as is and, like, all the other publishers do. Oh, it's half done? No, just patch it.
1565360	1573120	It's ready to go. A day 375 patch to get some of the other game in it. Wow. Uh, Blueberry is letting me
1573120	1579120	know in chat over at live.vognetwork.com. Minecraft Story Mode is sold in box now as a season pass.
1579120	1583680	So, let me guess, you open the box and there's probably a code that just downloads it online. Minecraft.
1583680	1588800	That's kind of where we're at. Because not all the seasons are out yet. Yeah. Oh, that's so weird to me.
1588800	1594000	Uh, as Jonah and Matt says, the game is going to be on PS4 first. I wonder if the game will come
1594000	1600880	out on Xbox One when all the episodes are done. Maybe. Huh. Maybe. Very interesting. I'm very curious.
1600880	1605360	That would make sense, too. And then we'd get a physical version at that point, probably. Are they
1605360	1609040	going to try and do a thing where it's, like, because the game was on three discs originally,
1609040	1613680	it's going to be three episodes? That's fine, too. A disc- No, because episode three was nothing but
1613680	1618640	the last dungeon. There you go. The end movie. Well, they'll break it up a little better, but three episodes
1618640	1623680	would be funny if that's it, because then it would be, like, three different discs. Yeah, I guess. I guess.
1623680	1628640	I don't know. Again, I'm kind of with you. It's the price. But then if they charge $29.99 per episode,
1628640	1632160	which I would argue they could probably get away with, then they just figured out a way to get you
1632160	1639200	to buy a game for $90. That I would not feel comfortable with. That would be also EA that
1639200	1646880	does that. Well, Square, no. Square puts their ports for ridiculously expensive prices, and they could
1646880	1652720	easily do it with this, too. All right. Well, more to develop on that story, I'm sure. Yeah. But, Shane,
1652720	1657200	welcome back. You are just back from San Francisco. I'm still hungry, but I'm taking a break from eating the
1657200	1661840	rest of my food to try to talk. Well, thank you. But I could eat and also talk with my mouth full,
1661840	1665040	and I'm fine with that, too. That's probably not the best thing to do on the radio. I don't care.
1665040	1670880	So, how was PlayStation Experience? It was fantastic. I'm really happy I went. It was a lot of fun.
1670880	1674640	Walk us through your experience at PlayStation Experience a little bit. You guys got there the
1674640	1679200	day before to get your badges, right? Yeah, we went the night before to get our badges. First time at
1679200	1684000	Moscone Center? For me, yeah. You know, I actually used to live in San Francisco, and I've never been
1684000	1688400	to Moscone at all, so that was my first time. Describe for the listeners about how big it is.
1688400	1696080	This big. He's choosing his hand. Great radio. It was, what, three floors? We were just in the
1696080	1702960	west side of it, and it was, I don't know, I felt like it was a standard convention hall size.
1702960	1707360	It's way smaller than E3, but from other conventions I've been to, it was about
1707360	1711760	roughly the same size. I'd imagine if it was three floors, it's probably the exact same size
1711760	1716560	as TwitchCon. It was probably a very similar layout, too. Two floors, the first floor and the second
1716560	1722560	floor were where all the games and stuff were at, and the third floor was strictly for the
1722560	1731040	keynote, the, what are they called? Panels. Panels, thank you. Panels, and then the Capcom Cup today.
1731040	1735600	That sounds exactly like how Twitch was laid out, basically, yeah, except it's like second,
1735600	1740080	I imagine maybe second floor was all the indie games? No, they were mixed in, well, mixed in
1740080	1745440	in the sense that they're on first and second floor, but they were kind of like the outside
1745440	1751760	of the space, so you had like all the big stuff kind of in the middle, and then you had like
1751760	1757120	two rows. I'm moving the microphone away because I'm trying to gesture with my hands.
1757840	1765200	They had two rows around the middle that were where the indies were, and then you actually had
1765200	1772240	like another set beyond that that were some bigger publishers, and like I saw PDP there, too.
1773520	1776800	That's kind of cool, so it's like you had to go through the indies to get to the bigger stuff.
1776800	1780880	You didn't have to, I mean they were all kind of separated, but they weren't like,
1780880	1786400	we're gonna just throw them on the outside and forget about them. They had a presence.
1787680	1790720	Let's talk about the keynote a little bit. What time did you line up to get in there?
1790720	1794640	Seven. And how good were your seats? Oh, they were okay. A lot of people?
1794640	1798160	Lots of people. I heard it was sold out. Did it feel very sold out?
1798160	1802880	Well, the show didn't sell out till last night. Yeah, yeah, they tweeted it last night.
1802880	1807840	Yeah, but there were a lot of seats there. I didn't think there were going to be enough
1807840	1815200	for all of us, even though we got there at seven, but I did see some people did have to stand,
1815200	1820560	so yeah, but it was totally worth it. That keynote was fantastic. What was the vibe in the room?
1821200	1825440	Oh, I was really excited, and I think a lot of people didn't go in with really high hopes
1826080	1831120	or high expectations, but then they started saying like, oh, we've got games to announce,
1831120	1834880	and I don't think anybody really expected game announcements. I kind of did because last year
1834880	1840000	Street Fighter V was a huge thing last year. And like you said earlier, because I did catch it,
1840000	1845200	you thought this was not as big as last year's, but last year's, okay, they had Street Fighter V,
1845200	1853360	which is great, but this year they showed off footage from seven, they announced Ni No Kuni II,
1853360	1858400	they announced Rez, they had all these announcements, even if they were like indie or
1858400	1864480	indie style games, I feel like it was much bigger than what they offered last year.
1866160	1871760	How was the vibe in the room when the seven stuff showed up? Because I told you the day before I
1871840	1874480	think they were going to show new footage, and you were like, no, it's too soon.
1874480	1880880	Yeah, it was too soon, but apparently not. But everybody lost it. Well, of course, and me being
1880880	1885760	me, where I was sitting, I kept reading the prompter well in advance of what was going on
1885760	1889280	on stage, because I just want to spoil stuff for me. I've done that at E3 Keynotes.
1889280	1893520	Yeah, I did that too. That's how I learned what the Wii U was called before they announced it.
1893680	1904560	Like, what's a Wii U? But yeah, everybody lost it then, and it was great. I'm not even a big
1904560	1911440	seven fan, and even I was excited for what I saw. I'm still debating on the combat. I'm gonna have
1911440	1916400	to watch the trailer again, because obviously I really haven't had access to looking at a lot of
1916400	1923520	internet stuff, but I can't really tell if it's 15 style or Kingdom Hearts style, because at first
1923520	1926640	glance I was like, oh, it plays like Kingdom Hearts, but then I was like, that's kind of how
1926640	1930720	15 plays too, so I need to look at it again. I think we're all waiting for the details on what
1930720	1936160	that really looks like. We're kind of reading into it a lot. I'm not sure I like that that's where
1936160	1942160	they're going with the combat, and I heard Bobby talk about turn-based stuff. I'm not writing the
1942160	1949040	game off. I'm not super disappointed that they switched it, but I would. Well, to be fair, I mean,
1949040	1954560	if you want the turn-based stuff, hey, the Final Fantasy VII re-release is out right now. I guess
1954560	1961360	I could get trophies on that. I just, not every game has to be that way. I like it when they switch
1961360	1968400	up the battle systems. Like, you know, 9 was different than 10, which was different than 12,
1968400	1974080	which was different than 13, which is different than 15, but now it looks like 7 and 15 might
1974080	1979280	just be the same. I'm like, oh, okay. But we are making a lot of assumptions. To be fair, I mean,
1979280	1983920	we're not going to know until they show it. The only real assumption we can make from that trailer
1983920	1990080	is that, who is it? The fat one, Wedge? Is he the fat one? He has a terrible voice actor.
1992000	1997600	He sounds like a lot of people I would expect sounded like at PlayStation Experience this
1997600	2002640	weekend. I think the thing we can read into that trailer is the whole, like, the cut scenes
2002640	2006800	and the battles and everything is going to be seamless. That's going to be amazing. Because,
2006800	2012160	like, remember when we played Final Fantasy VII on PlayStation 1, it was very obvious. Like,
2012160	2015680	it was like, there were kind of like three, there was like the battle models. There's the
2015680	2022560	battle models, the LEGO hand models, and then the cut scenes. Exactly. But I think we were not going
2022560	2027600	really have that this time. It'll be interesting. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. So your big fanboy
2027600	2033920	moment, and I already know what this is, what made you, like, scream? And you told me in a text.
2033920	2038800	Yeah. No, I said I freaked out. And I did. Jim was sitting right next to me because I'm reading
2038800	2045600	the prompter. They're talking. And I see something that says, like, Rez video. I was like, oh, my
2045600	2053440	god, no way. I just, like, freaked out. And, yeah, Rez existing again with getting at least,
2053440	2058480	it looks like, a new stage. It just made me so happy to see that happen. It made me so happy
2058480	2063280	just to see Tetsuya Mizuguchi again. I wanted that suit. I didn't get to try it because I'm not press
2063280	2066720	and they're not, like, mass producing that suit. But I really wanted to see
2067360	2072000	what that would feel like while playing the VR version. But you played, right? Oh, yeah. Oh,
2072000	2077120	yeah. Because I whined. Because I had... You're really good at that.
2079200	2084400	I had two VR appointments because you had to, like, sign up to go play VR games for the most
2084400	2089120	part. Is it true? I heard that everybody signed up for these appointments and they lost them all.
2089120	2094080	Like, there was some type of database corruption thing? Well, if there was, it wasn't by the time
2094080	2097600	on my first day. My first day went fine, too. Okay. I heard there was some... But maybe earlier
2097600	2100960	in the day, because I picked to go during the Call of Duty panel because, like, I'm really
2100960	2105840	going to go sit through the Call of Duty panel. But, yeah, no, I didn't have a problem. But when
2105840	2110320	I got up there, I was like, so how do I get to play Res? And she's like, well, you don't really
2110320	2113920	get to pick. And I was like, well, I saw on the top. She's like, well, you can go this way. You
2113920	2118160	might get a chance because they made you go either right or left. And if you went right, you went
2118160	2122480	upstairs. If you went left, you stayed downstairs. And Res was upstairs. So I was like, okay, cool.
2122480	2127040	So I go right and then I get to the part where we're waiting and they give us our PlayStation
2127040	2130320	cards, which are awesome, the little collectible things. I want to ask about that, too, in a
2130320	2134640	minute. But go on. And then I'm like, I talked to the lady. I'm like, man, I really just want
2134640	2139280	to play Res. I really, you know, that's all I want. And she's like, well, we can't guarantee it.
2139280	2143200	You know, you don't get to pick what game. You just get to go. I was like, that's fine. Cool.
2143200	2148960	And then they announced that, you know, there's one for to go upstairs. And she's like, oh,
2148960	2152480	there was another downstairs part, too, for that side. And she's like, well, if you want to go
2152480	2155920	upstairs, that's your, you know, that's your chance. They don't say what game it is. I was
2155920	2160000	like, okay, I'll go. And I get up there and I talked. I'm like, as I get up, I'm like,
2160000	2163200	all I want to do is play Res. That's the only thing I want to play. And the girl's like,
2163200	2166400	well, we can't, you know, let you pick. But the guy's like, you know, you, you know, you really
2166400	2172320	like Res. I really like Res. Just wait right here and you can get on Res next. I'm like, yes. So I
2172320	2175840	got to play Res HD. And it was just the first stage. Wait, you mean being nice to people
2175840	2181760	sometimes works? I'm always nice to people. Just a note for people out there. Well, yeah,
2181760	2185520	that's how I've got, like, first class tickets on planes before, too. Like, if it gets delayed or,
2185520	2189040	like, canceled for the day and you have to go the next day, just don't care about it and be like,
2189040	2192560	you know, it's fine. And they're like, here's a first grade class upgrade. Really? I don't know
2192560	2197120	if you could be that passive about it. I was. But like, all the people in front of me were, like,
2197120	2200400	all mad. And I get up there, I'm like, you know what, I'm sorry you had to deal with those people.
2200400	2204240	I really don't care. Just, you know, book me. He's like, cool, here's a first class ticket.
2204240	2212160	I'm like, all right, that's awesome. Anyway, but Res, it was basically everything I hoped it would
2212160	2223520	be. The screens on the VR, not the sharpest quality. So they're touting, like, 1080p full
2223520	2230560	60 frames per second. It looked good. It didn't look that to me. Well, you know, it's gonna be
2230560	2235920	VR and television. Yeah, that's probably where the big thing's at. And I will never play it on
2235920	2244400	television ever again. Ever. I will get it for that VR. But you only use X on the controller,
2244400	2249040	and then everything else is your head. So you slightly move your head. Your little reticle is
2249040	2252880	what moves with you. So, like, you have the enemies up here. You're moving your head all
2252880	2258160	around there. You have to turn to, like, the left at times when the stage would normally scroll to
2258160	2265680	the side. It was just fantastic. Did you, you said, I don't remember if this was you saying
2265680	2268640	this to me, but you said something about you were kind of, like, bobbing to the music. Oh,
2268640	2272240	yeah, I was like, that's the one thing you can't do. Because when I play music games, like, my head
2272240	2277360	just goes up and down because I'm enjoying it. Well, and the guy next to me and myself, the lady
2277360	2281840	told me our heads were bobbing up and down. And I could feel it because, like, my reticle's going
2281840	2288640	up and down to the music. I'm like, oh, that's me doing that. So, that could potentially get
2288640	2296640	in the way of playing. So, ResHD sold you on VR? Yes. It sold, well, I want to say yes. That was
2296640	2301280	until I played VR games again today, because I had an appointment today, too, because I was like,
2301280	2305200	well, I not have multiple appointments. So I could go play more games. Did you try to bat your
2305200	2309920	eyelashes to get ResHD? Oh, no, I wanted to play Rush of Blood, the Until Dawn game, but they just
2309920	2314880	weren't having it. I was like, oh, just, I guess I get to play whatever I get. And lucky me. Oh,
2314880	2318240	so you're charm didn't work today. Well, I didn't try hard enough to because I was with
2318240	2323920	Exeter and Matt. It's easier when it's just one? Yeah. It's kind of like when you're in a line at
2323920	2327840	a theme park, it's like, usually there'll be an opening for one and you can kind of cut a lot.
2327840	2333840	But if you're with a group, it's, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I guess. So, me and Exeter actually
2333840	2338400	got thrown onto what I thought was going to be awful. We got Playroom VR. And I was like,
2338400	2342640	great, you know, Playroom's kind of cool, but I really don't care about, like, Playroom VR.
2343360	2348320	That is what sold me on, on the VR for real. Really? Yes. You haven't told me about this.
2348320	2350320	No. What happened there? I didn't tell you anything about today.
2351760	2360640	Fine. So I got to go first and my game was, I was this monster. And first of all, like,
2360640	2365680	the graphics on Playroom VR, obviously better than what you're going to see on Res. So it already
2365680	2371840	looks a lot better. But I was this monster and I had no control. I had no controller at all.
2371840	2376400	All I could do is move my head left and right to try to run into buildings and break them,
2376400	2382640	which was really fun. And then the other two players would try to stop me by throwing things.
2382640	2386000	And every so often, like, helicopters would come and I'd have to headbutt them away,
2386000	2391280	so I wouldn't lose health. That was super cool. And then at the end, you know, it's VR,
2391280	2393840	so it's all... Wait, wait, wait. Were you playing against the other people in the room?
2393840	2395280	Like multiplayer VR? Yeah.
2395280	2399360	Wow. But they didn't have VR on them. They were looking at TV, and then I was the only one with
2399360	2403120	VR. I don't know if there are two-player VR games because I didn't see any.
2403120	2408480	Well, there was that whole Discs of Tron kind of thing that kind of didn't go.
2408480	2413680	I hope what comes from that is a new sports champions game because I love that game series.
2413680	2418080	Actually, you know, I remember when I got to do the VR, you know, at E3 when they first announced
2418080	2423200	it, I remember the whole conversation about the fact that they wanted to have,
2423200	2427920	that it wasn't just the VR, but, you know, the VR has a separate box that processes the VR.
2427920	2432080	So it does the VR and the TV. Yeah. We saw different things on them.
2432080	2436080	Exactly. So now you got that whole, like, Wii U thing going on, but instead of a game pad,
2436080	2440800	it's whatever's the VR. So that's interesting that that could be... And I remember that discussion
2440800	2445680	about we're trying to find ways to engage other people in the room besides just the person.
2445680	2447440	I'll talk more about that because there were two other games.
2447440	2452160	Go for it. But anyway, so the rest of my game was even better because I thought it was fun,
2452160	2456640	like, hitting my head into buildings. It was great. And into helicopters. But at the end,
2456640	2462560	we got to this, like, pier and it kind of sunk. So when it sunk, like, my headset,
2462560	2467680	my virtual reality kind of bobbed and I felt it. It was so cool. And then they told me I should
2467680	2471360	lose because I get the cooler thing if I lose. So I was like, OK, so I didn't dodge when they
2471360	2478320	were attacking me. And so I lost. And then they pull out this big cannon and fire at me
2478320	2483920	and they shoot me off of Earth. So I'm flying backwards. And that felt so cool.
2483920	2488480	I absolutely loved it. Like, I think I got the best game out of the three we got to play.
2488480	2488980	Wow.
2490400	2495360	Then Xtaphir, it was his turn with the VR and we were playing this cat and mouse game. I didn't
2495360	2502240	really care for that. He was a cat and he would have to, like, smack us from getting cheese.
2502240	2506800	It was cute, but it wasn't really fun. And then the last game
2507760	2512800	and we're doing this. So my game, I used no controllers. The other two people had just
2512800	2518880	regular DualShock 4s. Christopher's game, he had no controllers. We had DualShock 4s. The last game,
2518880	2525520	the random guy that we didn't know, he was a ghost hunter. And so he was using a DualShock 4. We had
2525520	2532240	nothing. We were just in the room with him. So he's looking around and he has, like, sort of like
2532240	2538560	a flashlight thing is basically what it turned out to be. And we would have to tell him on screen
2538560	2543040	where to go to see the ghost. Because we could see the ghost on our TV, but he couldn't see the
2543040	2547600	ghost in his VR. But he was the one that would capture them. So it's like a communication game,
2547600	2551920	like Bomb Corp and all that stuff. Yeah, yeah. And it was really fun. I actually like that one too.
2551920	2556720	So the cat game was probably my least favorite of the three. But yeah, so it was like a Ghostbusters
2556720	2561200	game. That was really cool. So that sold you on VR. That sold me on it. Now let me ask this. Maybe
2561200	2564880	going back to Rez a little bit, because that's a game I imagine a lot of our listeners...
2564880	2567120	And I'm also gonna start eating too. I don't care.
2567120	2572000	Well quickly, don't eat too much. Because that's a game I'm sure a lot of our listeners have played
2572000	2580560	before. What was it about Rez VR that made it... Because you said, I can never play this on a TV
2580560	2585760	again. Why? What was it about the VR that made it so that TV's ruined for you, for Rez?
2586320	2591520	The feeling. Because while it's not the strongest in terms of VR except for moving your head,
2592400	2599680	it did still have a feeling like I was the character flying in this space. And that was
2599680	2607840	such a cool feeling. And it was so precise with the head movements. Given a little more practice,
2607840	2615520	I could do all the same 100% everything and get all the 100% data that I used to get
2615920	2620880	back in the day after I played Rez enough on Dreamcast or on PS2 or on Xbox 360.
2621440	2627760	So the experience is just... It feels a lot different. It's a lot more fun.
2629280	2633360	Okay. Going to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
2633360	2638000	actdeaf says, Sony should probably hire Shane to sell the PlayStation VR at this point.
2638960	2645520	Let's see. Akuma JP says, I can imagine Shane in sales. And Bobby Blackwolf says, presence.
2645840	2650960	Is the term for what you felt. You felt presence, I guess, is something they probably used in the VR
2650960	2653840	world for what you were describing there. Oh, I've never heard that term for that,
2653840	2659280	but whatever. I felt like I was flying. Well, I like the way you described those games because
2659840	2664480	here playing the home game, watching the streams, they say, we can't really show you VR. You have to
2664480	2669200	experience it. Yeah, it's so true. You did a really good job explaining what that really was like to
2669200	2677840	be there. The start screen for the Playroom VR was probably my third favorite part of Playroom VR,
2677840	2682960	because I get the VR on and he's talking about how to play. I'm like, I don't care. I'm just
2682960	2686080	going to look around a little bit. So I'm moving my head. I'm like, Oh yeah, this is VR because I
2686080	2691520	can move around. But then I would lean forward and start to look at the little robots that are
2691520	2698000	closer to me. And then I looked up and up high was the monster I was going to be in the game I played.
2698000	2704800	And I was like, this is so amazing. I want this yesterday. Let me ask one more question about VR.
2704800	2709120	Then I want to move on and talk about some of the other stuff at the Expo, but does PlayStation VR
2709120	2713360	make you more interested in things like Oculus and the other VR technology out there? Yeah,
2713360	2718720	I would actually, I've still never played Oculus and my computer could handle it. So I would like
2718800	2728080	to try the Oculus Rift at some point. I worry that, I mean, Oculus already said they're going
2728080	2735600	to be like $350 at least or $300 at least. I worry what the PlayStation VR is going to be,
2736160	2741840	because if it costs the same amount as a PlayStation 4, that's not going to go over well.
2741840	2747440	But I don't see it costing less than $200. It's going to be, my guess is $250. I think they're
2747440	2751120	going to have to have two different SKUs, one with the camera and one without, because some
2751120	2757040	of us already have the camera and I believe it uses the same PlayStation camera. I didn't even
2757040	2762240	realize that the camera was there. Like the camera can see your lights, I'm assuming the lights on
2762240	2766800	your helmet. And I believe for that game, you were all talking to him because could the camera see
2766800	2770400	you guys? Could he see you guys in the thing? He couldn't see us. No, we had to just give him
2770400	2777520	audio direction. I did find out though, Playroom VR, they wouldn't tell us obviously a launch date
2777520	2783760	or a price. I'm sure people showing it to you didn't know. But they did say that they could
2783760	2790560	say that it's going to come out day one with the headset, but they couldn't tell me if it's going
2790560	2796080	to be free or bundled with the headset. Oh, interesting. It'll probably be bundled.
2796080	2802080	I would say free. Yeah, bundled with Playroom was bundled with, well, Playroom came free with
2802080	2808640	PlayStation 4. Yeah. So a good variety of games that they throw in with the headset will help
2808640	2813680	lessen the blow of that cost because Bobby makes a great point in chat saying PlayStation VR will
2813680	2818640	be more than Oculus because of that breakout box. The Rift is just a monitor and trackers.
2818640	2823280	PlayStation VR adds a GPU and a CPU. That's a really good point. So that could really drive
2823280	2828160	the price. Okay. But if it's more than Oculus, that's not worth it at that point. But I will,
2828160	2833920	just to throw this out there too, makers like Sony and Microsoft, not so much Nintendo, but
2833920	2842480	Sony and Microsoft have been known to take a loss on hardware to sell software. So that's true.
2842480	2845920	It's true. I don't know how much of a loss they're willing to take on something like this,
2845920	2852240	but just that there's something to think about. They could. So, okay. So outside of VR,
2852800	2858320	what else did you get your hands on? I mean, I basically, with the exception of some really
2858320	2862720	crappy looking games and some indie games, I got my hands on everything I wanted to play.
2864160	2867120	Anything you played that you're like, ah, yep, I'm buying that when it comes out.
2867120	2871520	Thumper. Been dying to play Thumper and I absolutely loved Thumper.
2871520	2879360	That's the music game. The rhythm violence game is what they call it. And you're like this,
2879360	2885200	they call it a space beetle. And it's just a music game. It's by two guys and their ex-harmonics.
2885200	2890640	They are from the harmonics time when I still worked at Konami. So we all worked on the same
2890640	2896960	games together because like karaoke revolution party that they worked on too. So it was fun
2896960	2904880	chatting with one of them. And it's kind of like, it looks like to me, it looks like audio surf,
2904880	2914160	like at first glance, but it plays kind of like a Parappa in the sense that musically the audio
2914160	2919200	cues come first and then you're going to hit the buttons for it. But that's really hard for some
2919200	2928960	people to grasp because with Parappa, you still see like visual cues. But you don't so much on
2928960	2936480	this, but it was a lot of fun. He told me that they're going to be like 10 stages. It's rough.
2936480	2943280	It is a pretty tough game too, but I loved it. I don't want to say it's a game of the show. It's
2943280	2948720	hard to say a game of the show, but it's way up there. I will probably have a group of games of
2948720	2955120	the show, but that would be one of them. I loved it so much. Quickly, anything else that you got
2955120	2957920	your hands on that you want to share? There was like a ton. Why does it have to be quickly?
2957920	2960560	We don't need to talk about anything else. We're almost an hour into the show,
2960560	2962880	but we can always come back later if we still have more time.
2963920	2969600	Other things. I played Amplitude. I played actually the remix of an old song from Amplitude,
2969600	2976800	so that was fun. What else was amazing? There was an indie game called Shapes and Beats,
2976800	2985280	and that was fun. It was a music like... everybody had a bit trip? You run around
2985280	2990160	or fly around, try not to get hit by these things that are coming at you with the music.
2990160	2999360	It was really cool. I played Parappa 2, the PS2 version, because it's not out yet for PS4,
2999360	3004800	and it was just the PS2 version. I did not see any improvements, so whatever, but I'd still get it.
3005760	3009520	Hot Shots Golf, the new one. Love that. I actually love golf games. Little-known fact.
3010480	3012880	I always forget that myself, actually, until I start playing them.
3014000	3018240	I was not impressed with a couple of games, so I think that's more fun to talk about.
3018240	3020880	All right. I don't usually like to be negative.
3020880	3024800	I'm not going to be super negative, because everything I played actually had redeeming
3024800	3032240	qualities, but things that I was disappointed in. The Tomorrow Children. I didn't really know much
3032240	3039600	about that, but when I played it, and it was a very long tutorial with the guy, and I'm sorry,
3039600	3046080	they need to cut down some of these demos, because they just last way too long. He called it an MMO,
3046080	3051680	which is not in the same vein of WoW or Final Fantasy XIV. It's just a massive world that you
3051680	3057520	can interact with other players, but it's also mixed with Minecraft, and I'd also say SimCity.
3057760	3062560	You got to go out, forage for materials, kill enemies that are trying to attack your town,
3062560	3068640	and help build up your town. Everybody in your town helps to make it grow.
3068640	3071760	Okay, but when you describe it, I'm kind of into it. What was wrong with it?
3071760	3078160	The controls were a little clunky, and it was just a little bit boring. That might be
3078720	3083440	because it was just a demo, and there wasn't a whole lot. It was also standing room only,
3083440	3087280	and you're standing there for like, I swear that demo was like 25 minutes. It was not fun
3087840	3091760	because of that, but there's going to be a beta. Everybody that went to the show and got their
3091760	3097040	awesome badges scanned will be in it, so I'll be in it next month, but I don't know. I'm not
3097040	3101840	really a big fan of Minecraft, and so this just felt kind of like a Minecraft game to me, but
3101840	3107280	with really, really, really nice visuals. I have to give them credit. They did really nice work
3107280	3113680	there, and then the other game I really, really wanted to like but was just kind of disappointed
3113680	3121040	in was Bound. I forget which Sony studio that's coming from, but it was just announced on Thursday,
3121040	3125920	but they had a playable demo. You're like a ballerina dancer sort of thing in this polygonal
3125920	3132400	world. Visually amazing. The demo they had was pretty straightforward. It was a little bit of
3132480	3138160	platforming, a little bit of story that I didn't understand. My problem is they are showing the
3138160	3142160	character off to be some sort of dance dancer. She's very graceful. She does all these like
3142160	3148480	dance moves whenever she does anything. There's a button to dance. You use it one time in the demo,
3148480	3153920	and it seems pretty worthless, so I would like to see them incorporate more dancing,
3153920	3160320	which I'm sure they will, just not in the demo, but I was disappointed with that.
3161040	3164960	It's hard to be disappointed with that, though, because they did just announce it the day before.
3167440	3171280	Heavy Rain didn't look that much better. Heavy Rain was there, the PS4 one,
3171280	3175440	and it just got to look like Heavy Rain, whereas I think Beyond Two Souls actually did get a slight
3175440	3179280	increase in visual quality. I love Heavy Rain.
3182320	3186160	How about this whole metagame of the collecting the cards and getting a platinum trophy? What
3186160	3189840	the hell was that all about? I don't know if people who weren't there really get that.
3189920	3195120	They were giving away at booths these PlayStation cards. I guess it's something they want to do from
3195120	3199840	now on because they're like, this is the first in the series or whatever. Basically, you had to do
3199840	3204800	objectives to get cards sometimes, or sometimes they just gave them to you. There are rare versions
3204800	3209600	of the cards, too. My first experience with the card is if you went to the keynote, you got this
3209600	3215200	awesome card. It just says you went to the keynote. It's cool looking. Then after the keynote, we went
3215200	3219520	downstairs, and we knew what we knew about these card things because me and Jim Flacco Jones were
3219520	3226960	trying to get platinums. They had this whole trophy system, too. We go to the Last Guardian
3226960	3230800	booth, which is just the big interactive wall that they had, I think, at Tokyo Game Show.
3232080	3235440	This lady hands us both of the cards, the rare one and the regular one. We're like,
3235440	3240880	cool. That's all we had to do. Some were uncharted, where you had to play the game,
3240880	3244720	and you get the base card, but if you were the best on your team and your team won,
3244720	3249600	you got the fancy card, which I did not get because our team lost. I was best on it. No,
3249600	3252400	wait. I was third best, so I wouldn't have even got that. It just looked like I was first.
3253840	3257200	But these cards, they're just collectible. They're cool. What? So funny.
3257200	3260000	So I'm laughing at this comment in chat. S2100Matt says,
3260000	3263520	a collectible card thing in Res? Did they cater this show to Shane?
3264960	3267280	Yeah. I was like, what else could they do for me?
3269200	3272240	And let's not forget the PlayStation's big color is blue.
3272240	3277280	Oh, so blue. I think, honestly, if a Power Ranger had come out and hugged Shane,
3278720	3281040	that's it. Shane would be in the hospital right now.
3282560	3290080	Well, depending on which Power Ranger. But some of the things were ridiculous. So I got
3290080	3294480	a Gravity Rush one because they had Gravity Rush remastered there. But to do that, I had to play
3294480	3299200	the Hot Shots Golf, Gravity Rush, and the Tomorrow Children. I keep wanting to say People because
3299200	3307680	that was a good Nickelodeon show. But I got done with the first two games. And then that Tomorrow
3307680	3311200	Children game just took forever. I was like, I'm not going to get it. And eventually I did.
3311920	3319600	But there was things like that. Sometimes our badges were their NFC. I think that's what it's
3319600	3324560	called? Yeah, Near Field Communication stuff. So we'd have to get them scanned for other things.
3324560	3330800	There were all these things we had to do on the PlayStation Experience app to get stuff too.
3330800	3334960	And one of the things to get the Platinum Trophy was you had to go to the PlayStation Network
3334960	3342080	booth and get it scanned. So I went there and I got mine scanned super quick. And then Flaco Jones
3342080	3345920	and the rest of the people we went with, they went over there, but it was a different person
3345920	3354320	at that time. Well, they had to go play or demo PlayStation View, PlayStation Now, Spotify.
3354880	3360080	You guys got unlucky. So what was the point? You got a Platinum Trophy and?
3360080	3366080	Nothing. That's it. So it's like the game? Well, here's well, first of all, this is my first
3366080	3370800	Platinum Trophy on any PlayStation. You don't even get into your profile.
3370800	3376960	No, I don't. And I don't. Yeah, I don't. That's sad. No, what's stupid is they're like,
3376960	3381040	oh, it's super limited. The Platinum, not everybody's going to be able to get.
3382000	3387760	Come to find out, somehow the gold trophies cards were the hardest to get. And they ran out when I
3387760	3393680	went up to get mine because their app would not update yesterday, like at all for anybody. But
3393680	3397440	some people got through with their apps. Some didn't. I was one of the unfortunate ones that
3397440	3403360	none of my stuff came through until after the show last night. So I got two bronze trophies
3403360	3408160	because they felt bad for me earlier yesterday, a silver one and a platinum one, but no gold one.
3408240	3411600	And it just really makes me mad. This is a very interesting observation
3411600	3414720	from our chat room. Make it a long one so I can take another bite.
3414720	3418480	Sj100matt says, this is the most excited I've heard Shane be in a while.
3418480	3421760	Bobby Black Wolf says, it's nice to hear Shane awake for once.
3421760	3425280	Act Def says, it's like listening to a little kid excited about stuff.
3425280	3427600	Go shopping with him for Power Rangers. Oh my gosh. Yeah.
3428480	3433600	Sj100matt says his review of this show is far from meh, whatever.
3433600	3437200	Because it wasn't. Like if it was, I would have said that.
3438720	3442080	Um, so definitely going back next year. Yes.
3442080	3445040	What if you have to go to Vegas to do it? I don't really like Vegas, but
3446080	3451280	if enough people go, yeah, I think they'll keep it here because it's closer for them.
3451280	3453840	Yeah. I think Vegas was just an accident.
3455440	3462000	One thing, one funny thing though that happened, uh, was we were out in line today waiting to get
3462000	3470160	in and you can't see because you're not here, but, uh, I'm wearing a PlayStation hat, a Nintendo,
3470160	3475440	uh, zip up hoodie and an Apple shirt. And we were talking about that in line.
3475440	3481360	And, uh, I think it was Annie asked, well, where's your Microsoft stuff?
3481360	3485360	I said, well, I'm wearing Xbox underwear and the guy in front of us turned around and gave me this
3485360	3491600	look. And then turned back around. I was like, that's awesome. I'm not really wearing Xbox
3491600	3497600	underwear, but I thought it was funny at the time. I did run into like a lot of our friends
3497600	3504160	too, like, uh, Justin and Carissa ran into the males. Um, you know, when that guy turned around
3504160	3508560	and gave you that look, you should have said, and X marks the spot and given him a wink.
3509120	3510400	I should have asked him if he wanted to see.
3514880	3518480	All right. Uh, and that's the 200 Matt and Chad over at live.vognetwork.com says you're
3518480	3522880	missing the point, Rob. It's collectible. It never matters. And bonds double 06 says
3522880	3527840	Shane had an early Christmas. There it is. Well, they sure gave you a lot of stuff in
3527840	3531520	those little swag bags. You kind of, I haven't opened everything up there. They gave us a really
3531520	3536000	nice poster tube. I'm sure the poster inside is great. I don't even know what the poster is inside.
3536000	3541200	Um, but the poster tube is so nice. They gave us a shirt. I got an uncharted shirt for playing the
3541200	3549200	demo. Uh, I got an amplitude, uh, patch, uh, lots of cards. Um, they got another Sony shirt,
3549200	3554640	this hat. It was overall, I mean, well, I'm, I'm sad. I wasn't able to go. I mean, just,
3554640	3559600	I had the Capcom cup, which I thought was going to be awful. We sat through like the,
3559600	3564560	the beginning of it today. So I don't know why I thought it was awful. I like Evo. I watch Evo
3564560	3570240	sometimes and it was, it was a blast to watch too. So I'm glad that they, uh, they had something,
3570240	3575840	but I would like more panels next year and yeah, more panels would be nice. Just more times where
3575840	3582960	you can sit down because they just don't know how to do demos. Like you can't have a 25 minute demo
3582960	3587760	standing up and then you're already in line waiting for somebody else to get off of it. So
3587760	3593840	it's just, it's just was not very comfortable. Gotcha. All right. Well, cool. Oh, and a shout
3593840	3599200	out to the Capcom lady, um, at her booth today. You're awful and you shouldn't do these events
3599200	3604720	anymore cause you just, I wanted to punch you in the face. That's not a nice thing to say. Well,
3604720	3609120	okay. Me and Xfer went to go play Street Fighter and we get over there. She's like,
3609120	3613520	two. We're like, okay, we go over there. And, uh, um, his boyfriend goes to, we're, we're
3613520	3618320	staying there and it just says, press, press the options button. We're on arcade sticks. And we're
3618320	3621440	like, we don't know what this means. And so we don't touch anything. She comes over and she's
3621440	3625200	like, what did you guys do to the game? And I rudely back, I was like, nothing. We didn't do
3625200	3629840	anything to the game. And she kept screwing it up when she tried to get off that screen.
3629840	3636080	So like, she needs to just not work conventions cause she was not very good. I can't believe
3636080	3641680	you just threatened to punch somebody in the face because you guys got rude. Like,
3642560	3646720	no, I mean, we don't, you know what? You're somebody first at a convention that,
3646720	3651280	that they're working. I understand. I had a very negative E3 experience involving a Capcom
3651280	3656320	employee as well. So for what it's all the other employees, they're great. Yeah. So just that one
3656320	3660720	Capcom, whatever it was the same person. Was it Capcom that it was at? I just said it was. Oh,
3660720	3666960	okay. Yeah. Um, yeah, it probably was. Who knows? Doesn't need to be, it is, it is a reflection of
3666960	3670800	your company. It's a customer service thing. Yeah. I was happy to leave when we were done.
3670800	3673840	I wanted to play more, but I was like, I don't want to deal with her anymore.
3674560	3678960	All right. All right. Uh, G, Loki, you've been quiet over there while listening to
3678960	3684240	Shane be giddy. I am totally not doing anything. Anything you want to ask Loki about or Loki,
3684240	3689280	anything you want to ask Shane about whatever. No. All right. Well, uh, let's, let's move on
3689280	3692800	with the show. We still have plenty of news and other things we want to get into. Uh, but I'm,
3692800	3696160	I'm glad you had a good time. I mean, I'm kind of jealous. I didn't get to go, but I had some
3696160	3701120	other stuff that was important to going on here at home and I've, and I'm doing a con next weekend.
3701120	3704960	That was another thing is like, I didn't want to be conned out because the gamer X people were
3704960	3708720	there too. Remember? Right. Cause they were showing, I walked by them. I didn't read only
3708720	3714640	memories. I got my badge scan there. That was it. But, um, I was going to say last year, uh,
3714640	3718480	remember we did the final fantasy fan fest and then like, I think it was like three weeks later
3718480	3724800	was Blizzcon and even that I was like, I am conned out right now. So I didn't want to go through
3724800	3728960	that again this year, but we'll see. All right. Anyway, let's talk about, we usually at the top
3728960	3733680	of the show, Oh, it's only what, seven 15, uh, seven Oh eight. Uh, we usually talk about games
3733680	3737840	of the week. That's right. What games we've been playing this week. So, um, let's talk about what
3737840	3743200	types of video games we've been playing this week. Loki. Oh yes. I had lots of time to play Ingress.
3743200	3750400	So I played lots of Ingress and, you know, works boring. So I kind of look at Ingress stuff while
3750400	3758320	I work. And then, um, aside from the Ingress, I played fallout four and I love fallout four
3758320	3763280	and I'm glad that I can get it. This game for me is it was easier to get into than
3763280	3768880	new Vegas. For some reason I just did not like new Vegas. I don't know. The same time it was
3768880	3773280	with the Bolivian. I really could well believe in it kind of got into a little more, um, but
3773920	3777680	new Vegas, it was kind of hard to get into for a fall. You have a fall for it, no problem
3777680	3784320	whatsoever. And I'm definitely digging that game and not getting much of the story quest done
3784320	3788400	because I'm doing all the side stuff, get constantly distracted at all time.
3789600	3793440	So I'm definitely enjoying that. And then I also picked up just cause three, which I was
3793440	3797440	really looking forward to. Although the controls are a little wonky on that and it's kind of
3797440	3801760	frustrating. So I went back to fallout four after playing a few hours of that, I still need to go
3801760	3805040	back and play it because everybody seems to really like the wingsuit and stuff. I just found the
3805040	3812720	controls so fucking frustrating. Just wouldn't work right. And the vehicle physics just a little
3812720	3818640	too sensitive. You know, you hit a rock and this vehicle just flips over. It was really annoying.
3818640	3823920	So, but I love just cause, and I really need to play more of the sandbox games. So I'm probably
3823920	3829600	gonna go back to that at some point. Um, so that's pretty much my week. Yeah. Mostly ingress.
3830320	3834720	Okay. Uh, my gaming week, a lot of the same old stuff, but two new games.
3834720	3836800	I can't wait to have an argument about one of these.
3836800	3840000	Well then I'm going to do the first one that you can't argue with me about. So the first game that
3840000	3844320	I played, uh, was a stealth announcement, I guess, at the game awards. And I, I actually
3844320	3850640	didn't even, I tuned into the game awards way late because, okay, bad gamer. I forgot they were on.
3850640	3856000	So I, but I caught up on Twitter and somebody said there was a new Tron game announced on steam and
3856000	3861280	I was like, what, what, what? And sure enough, you go to steam and there's a game called Tron
3861280	3867840	run R that's available on steam at steam early access, but it's, uh, it's there. And when it's
3867840	3873040	early access, it's definitely early access because there's like not even a title screen
3873040	3876960	or anything. It's like, here's, you launch the game and it's like, here's three files,
3876960	3881200	choose one. It's like level one, level two, level three. So you choose one. And then you kind of go
3881200	3886480	right into the interface of selecting the power ups your character is going to have. So, so here's
3886480	3890960	the thing, the Tron game, it's not an endless runner. You would think from the name run R it's
3890960	3896960	an endless runner. Um, it's, it's more of a runner with an end because each day is definitely has a
3896960	3902480	beginning and an end. And in that sense, it's kind of like a music game. Like it feels a little
3902480	3909120	bit audio surf ish to me, but music is an integral to what's going on with the game. Like when you
3909120	3913440	throw discs at enemies, you're not necessarily doing it in time to the music or trying to break
3913440	3919680	walls or whatever, but the visuals in the game are pretty hot. And like, you know, it looks a
3919680	3924480	lot like Tron. And so of course, you know, the music is kinda, you know, the, the same type of
3924480	3929040	electro stuff you'd expect to hear in Tron and you're moving fast through all these colors.
3929040	3933120	And in some parts, you know, you jump. And so you'll like, and you, you get the butterfly
3933120	3936080	wings. Remember in the new Tron movie, they would have the butterfly wings that came out at some
3936080	3940800	point. I know they have another actual name, but, uh, so you use, you'll use the wings to fly. And
3940800	3944960	so you try to land on these other platforms that'll help you fly through. And it's just
3944960	3950640	like the, the visuals and the way things look in the game are great and kind of what really
3950640	3955840	sells me on it. So I'm hoping that the soundtrack continues to be awesome. And I really,
3955840	3959280	really hope if it's an official Tron game, which it must be, or they would have been seasoned
3959280	3963600	decision by now. I really hope they're able to get like some of the Tron legacy soundtrack in
3963600	3967920	the game or something, or, but, but it's so mysterious because I don't even think it says
3967920	3971600	who the publisher is. I don't know. I don't know who made the game. Uh, does anyone out there know
3971600	3978000	who made this? Cause I it's kind of a, and then, so that has some people going, is this like a
3978080	3982960	stealth announcement of Tron three? I don't know. I think that's a, well, one of the achievements
3982960	3988000	apparently is named Tron three, but you can't earn the achievements in the game yet. It's,
3988000	3994160	it's kind of weird in that regard. So, um, but yeah, uh, act deft and chat says bit trip runner
3994160	3999520	with Tron. That is not a bad comparison, but again, bit trip runner, everything you do is
3999520	4005120	timed with the music and Tron runner doesn't really have that, but I enjoyed it. Um, it's
4005200	4010160	10 bucks, but it is early access. But the good news is that mean there's a lot, lot more to come.
4010160	4013200	You're looking at some of the screenshots over there. Loki. I was just trying to see who the
4013200	4019680	publisher was, but yeah, it's not there. So that's kind of a mystery in itself. Like
4019680	4024880	where did this game come from and who did it? Um, so we'll see. The other game I played this week,
4024880	4031600	I picked up on Friday and that game is Xenoblade Chronicles. Well, I, I, here's the thing.
4032400	4037200	I need to read the messages you sent me. Are you going to backtrack? No, go ahead. Read the
4037200	4041840	messages I sent you on this game, but I want to, I want to preface. This is a game that is hundreds
4041840	4046960	of hours long interactive because it's on their end user license agreement. Oh, so it is Disney
4046960	4051120	themselves. Did it? Does he interact? Okay. Good to know. Thank you. Um, I do want to say this.
4051120	4056000	I'm only on chapter three, but these are some early impressions I have of the game. Go ahead.
4056000	4060320	Read, read actual text. I can't believe you are violating our privacy. I'm not going to read like
4060320	4064800	important things. This is actually pretty important. All right, go ahead. Um, I'm just
4064800	4070320	going back to where I want to start. It's so negative about things on the stuff you said,
4071840	4076240	like talking about how you didn't think the presser was good or whatever. Um,
4078960	4082640	I should have planned this better. You should have planned this a little better. Live radio.
4082640	4088240	Where basically you can just talk about this instead. All right. Good job. Failed attempt
4088240	4096800	to violate my privacy by Shane lingo. Um, so, uh, when I'm trying really hard to like it,
4096800	4102000	but it's testing my patience. I might be done with Xenoblade. I don't like it.
4103040	4109360	Uh, I think that was really, that's the most recent one. Okay. When I first played the game,
4109360	4115760	I was really into it. I was like, Oh, this game is, is really pretty. Um, I was getting
4115760	4121920	kind of a white knight Chronicles vibe from it. Well, see, here's the thing. I liked that game
4121920	4126880	a lot more than most people did. So I kind of consider that a compliment, but some of the
4126880	4131280	problems I had with white knight Chronicles, like some of the dialogue and the cut scenes,
4131280	4135840	I started to notice I'm not really enjoying in Xenoblade Chronicles X either is that as the
4135840	4142240	game went on, I was like the writing in this game, it's written for text boxes, yet it's being acted
4142240	4147760	out. And it's kind of trying my patience in one of the scenes where they're going over the eight
4147760	4154640	different branches of the blade organization. And I'm like, Oh my God. And that's like at
4154640	4158800	the end of another scene. I mean, some of the scenes go on a very long time, but whatever.
4158800	4164320	I mean, I can, I can overlook that, but did you just as a quick interjection, when he asked that
4164320	4168640	one guy asks you, if you want, if you're going to join blade, it's like, yes or no. Did you do? No,
4168720	4174000	I did. No, it wasn't that great though. Cause he, the look he gives you and it zooms in on him.
4174000	4180960	So funny. I didn't know. And guess what happens? The whole thing starts over the whole dialogue
4180960	4185280	changes. So a little bit, but then they go right back into the, well, eventually he just,
4185280	4190720	he's just looking at you with those eyes. It's like, really? Well, what I did, I, so I hit start
4190720	4193680	and I skipped once I realized it was a repeat and everything. I just hit start and skip the cut
4193680	4198480	scene. I was like, all right, that was a mistake. Um, so, so here's the thing. I was really into
4198480	4203520	the game. It's really good looking. Even if the interface is really, really busy, I'm kind of
4203520	4208640	surprised they don't use the game pad for more of that. The interface is busy. It's super busy. I
4208640	4213120	don't think so. Like I see complaints about that and I don't see it. Like the only time I could
4213120	4218000	consider it busy is when I hit the, the plus button to pull up all those extra menus. But if I'm not
4218000	4222160	in that, I don't think it's busy at all. But it's weird that that doesn't go down to the game pad.
4222160	4225920	And I, they, they do use the game pad for other stuff, which you haven't probably got because
4225920	4229120	you've been at the PlayStation experience. You know, I'll talk about my, you know, blade,
4229120	4233200	you're only on chapter one, right? Oh, you know, I'm not technically even on chapter one. We'll
4233200	4237920	talk about that. This is my thing. As I said, Shane, I want to hear from you when you get to
4237920	4242320	the point in the game that I'm at, because for those first couple chapters, I was really into it.
4242320	4245920	And then here's, here's the problem where I'm at in chapter three. Okay. So I'm going through the
4245920	4249680	story today. So now I get a story quest for chapter three and I'm going out into the world
4250400	4254880	and I'm going to kind of go from point A to point B to where I'm supposed to go on the map. And it's
4254880	4260080	like, okay, so I'm level eight and I'm walking by all these little mobs that are like level seven,
4260080	4264800	maybe some level nine, but I'm like, Oh, keep walking that direction. Cause generally in JRPGs,
4264800	4269120	everything will be about your level and I can grind a little bit. Nope. I get not even halfway
4269120	4274400	to where I'm supposed to go. And the mobs are like 11, 12, 13, and there's this random ass
4274400	4281040	level 80 something gigantic thing that patrols around. It reminds me of having to stealth in
4281040	4286560	final fantasy 11 and all this stuff. So I was like, okay, so clearly I'm not at a point where
4286560	4296560	I can do chapter three. Okay. So I'll do some side quests and I try to do some of the side quests and
4296560	4302720	it's like the mobs for those quests are like level 13 or level 11. And I'm like, am I just supposed
4302720	4308400	to find the level seven and eight, nine mobs of which there's not a huge concentration of them
4308400	4313760	and just grind them over and over? Is that, I mean, I get it's a JRPG, but the, I mean,
4313760	4319200	I've played a lot of JRPGs. Okay. And I've stuck up for things like blue dragon, lost Odyssey.
4319200	4322240	Oh, you don't have to stick up for lost Odyssey. Everybody loves lost Odyssey.
4322240	4325760	But, but you know what I mean? Like I have a patient like lost Odyssey also had a lot
4325760	4331280	of grinding and I was okay with that, but the pacing feels really, really off to me in this
4331280	4335840	game. And it's kind of ruining it for me. And that's why I was sending these angry texts.
4335840	4339920	It was just a shame. I'm like, the pacing in this game is fucked and I don't like it at all.
4340560	4348160	And, uh, the game tutorial, like it baffles my mind how they spend all this time talking about
4348160	4353360	some things, but then other things it's like, if you don't read the manual, you're not going to
4353360	4357280	understand it at all. And there's no paper manual. Of course you have to sit there and read it on
4357280	4361520	your game pad. You know, it's like, if it's one thing, if I could go take a potty break and read
4361520	4368080	the manual, you could take that in there with you. It's portable. Yes, that's true. But I'm just,
4369040	4373600	I don't know. Like the pacing feels really off to me. And that's why I'm like the Shane,
4373600	4375840	I don't think you're, I know you're here sticking up for it and that's fine,
4375840	4378720	but I don't think you're far enough to be bothered by what's bothering me.
4378720	4383440	But what's bothering you when we, when I talk about, I will tell you why it doesn't bother me.
4383440	4386800	All right. Well, that was my gaming week. So Shane, how was your gaming week?
4386880	4392000	Well, first of all, well, okay. But it's the game I played the least out of the things I'm
4392000	4397040	going to talk about. My first one, I started playing Mass Effect 3 again. Why? I just wanted
4397040	4401040	to, and I love it. I forgot how much I love it. You were secretly hoping Andromeda would somehow
4401040	4406000	be at the place. Yeah. I started watching videos on Andromeda. I think that was what was like,
4406000	4410240	it's time to start playing Mass Effect 3 again. And I am a huge lover of Mass Effect 3 and all
4410240	4414480	things Mass Effect. So I'm having a blast with that. Cause I'm in my Final Fantasy 14
4415040	4417600	funk phase right now. I'm just like, I don't really want to play it.
4419280	4422880	So that's Mass Effect 3. Okay. Now I'll talk about Xenoblade. So I didn't get a lot of time
4422880	4427840	with Xenoblade Chronicles X, but I will say I haven't beaten it yet, but I do have Xenoblade
4428560	4433120	Chronicles 3D on my 3DS and I love it. It's great. Love the combat, love everything about it.
4434160	4440240	So I spend like, you know, it's me an hour making my character on Xenoblade Chronicles X. I give
4440240	4447120	him Shulk's voice cause I love it. And then literally I play the little beginning part where
4447120	4452640	you're in the rain and I do the demo, the tutorial, whatever it's called. That's fine. And then
4452640	4458160	the scene where it turns sunny is breathtaking. Love it. Great. This music's awesome. And then
4458160	4462000	they're like, okay, let's go to town. You know, you shouldn't go down. It's going to be really
4462000	4466960	hard. You just, you know, take the upper path. And what I would assume if you do it, just, you know,
4467040	4470400	hit the enemies on the way and take the upper path, probably takes you 10 minutes.
4472400	4477120	I took almost an hour and a half because I was having so much fun attacking,
4477120	4480720	so much fun running around. I saw enemies that there's no way I could have killed,
4480720	4483760	but I would try to get around them to go to other places. For the record,
4483760	4487920	I did do a little bit of that too. Okay. An hour and a half. I didn't take the lower path.
4488560	4492960	I fell down to the lower path a couple of times. You said it took you about an hour to get to NLA.
4493920	4496320	That was actually an hour and a half because it was like one hour and 20 minutes.
4496320	4498640	I probably got there at about an hour and 15.
4498640	4501200	Okay. So you did the same thing as me. Okay. I don't understand.
4502000	4504160	It was collecting the little blue diamonds. I was like...
4504160	4506240	Oh, you'll see those all over the place.
4506240	4508080	Yes. Shane, I'm aware. I'm further than you.
4508720	4517120	Well, I'm just saying from Xenoblade Chronicles regular reasoning. And then I hit New LA and I
4517120	4520240	do the fight there. And then I have to turn it off because I have to get ready to go to
4520240	4527520	PlayStation Experience. But everything that you said you don't like about it, I love already.
4527520	4535200	I'm not an open world person. Somebody described this as Japanese developers take on a Western
4535200	4540000	open world RPG. I can kind of see that, but I love the combat. I love the music.
4540560	4544480	I don't get bored with the combat at all. Even killing the same things over and over again.
4544480	4551840	I learned the little cat rat monsters that are down by the water, you can cut their ears off.
4551840	4555600	And I was like, oh, that's something fun to try. So I kept doing that
4555600	4557440	because you can target different body parts.
4557440	4560160	Yeah. And the game never explains that.
4561040	4567600	Yeah. Well, it doesn't explain it so much as it's always in the upper right corner. It says
4567600	4568240	lock on to...
4568240	4571200	But it doesn't tell you why you'd want to do that or the advantage it gives you.
4571200	4574000	Well, I just think you should understand.
4574640	4578000	Target ears. Advantage. You're a heartless bastard.
4578000	4583120	Pretty much because these things are adorable. But no, everything that you say you don't like
4583120	4587760	about it. You're running from point A to point B and there's enemies that are way too high for you
4587760	4590400	or side quests that are a little too high. I like that stuff.
4590400	4593440	Here's the thing. I'm willing to give the game another chance. I'm not sitting here going...
4593440	4594480	And I still want to do multiplayer.
4594480	4598320	It's terrible. I don't know how because every time I go to the thing it says
4598320	4604400	currently undergoing maintenance. But anyway, I'm still willing to give the game a chance,
4604400	4608560	but I'm waiting for you because I know by noon tomorrow you'll be caught up to where I'm at.
4608560	4613360	And I need you to tell me what I'm doing wrong to get through chapter three because
4614160	4615840	it's not working for me right now.
4615840	4618000	What division did you pick?
4618000	4619120	The pathfinders.
4619120	4621120	Okay. I don't know what I'm going to pick yet. I haven't decided.
4621120	4628080	Because the beacon things... Exploration sounded fun. And now I regret that choice.
4628720	4630320	Apparently it doesn't really affect anything.
4631280	4634800	I've tried to research. And I even went on Game Facts. I'm like,
4634800	4638480	has anyone done a fact? Nope. Let me go on the board. Search chapter three.
4638480	4640080	And I'm not really finding a lot.
4640080	4643360	The one thing I will hit the game for is the controls.
4644640	4647280	I kind of thought they were going to be like Xenoblade Chronicles.
4648000	4651920	And the buttons are in different spots. It's really weird because of that.
4651920	4657120	They're not bad, I guess, if you're not currently playing Xenoblade Chronicles like I am.
4657120	4662640	But that's the one thing I would say is unsatisfactory to me right now.
4662640	4665040	But the music is great. The music is just the best.
4665040	4666240	Yeah, it does have some good music.
4666240	4668800	I love the battle theme. I don't care if everybody else hates it because it's random.
4668800	4670880	The boss. Some of the boss music is really good.
4670880	4671600	Oh, I can't wait.
4672960	4674640	Okay. Is that it for your gaming week?
4674640	4675760	That is it for my gaming week.
4675760	4677600	Okay. We can get into housekeeping here in 90 minutes.
4679120	4682080	Here's the thing. All right. We're not going to have a show next week.
4682080	4686560	And I know that's probably disappointing to hear. And I kind of apologize.
4687120	4690240	Well, I do apologize because we weren't here last week.
4690240	4693840	And we weren't here a few weeks ago when I had the flu.
4693840	4698320	And you know, I am very big on being regular with podcasts.
4698320	4703200	And I really don't like to just take weeks off all the time, but life happens.
4703200	4705920	And I know for most, most of you guys are really understanding.
4705920	4710080	And I thank you for that. I just don't like to miss so many weeks.
4710720	4713440	But the reality is November was just kind of a shit month.
4714320	4718400	I got the flu, which, you know, obviously killed the show that week.
4718400	4721040	And then last week, here's the thing.
4721040	4725120	We had canned the show anyway, because the show was Thanksgiving weekend,
4725120	4726800	which also happened to be Dan's birthday.
4726800	4729440	So we knew Jamie would be out and was like, all right, well, you know,
4729440	4731520	Loki and I will probably have some other stuff we want to do.
4731520	4733040	So let's just cancel the show.
4733040	4738880	I actually had, and I had a really bad accident on Sunday and I hurt myself pretty bad.
4739840	4741280	Where like, I had a swollen lip.
4742320	4745920	So ironically, even if we hadn't canceled the show in advance,
4745920	4748400	I couldn't talk for three hours last Sunday.
4748400	4749680	So we would have had to cancel it anyway.
4749680	4751360	So that was kind of just a shitty thing that happened.
4751360	4752400	I'm fine, by the way.
4752400	4754480	I got checked out by a doctor and everything, and I'm fine.
4755760	4758320	But it was just still kind of ruined my day that day.
4760000	4761280	And what's happening next week.
4761280	4765520	I mean, this is a good reason to cancel is that we're going to a convention.
4765520	4767200	We're going to be sponsoring VOG Network.
4767200	4771360	We'll be sponsoring GX, Everybody Games, which is going to be in San Jose next week.
4771360	4773360	And we have a table there, but here's the thing.
4773360	4774800	The convention actually doesn't end.
4774800	4776880	I thought we'd be able to sneak out of there early,
4776880	4779680	but the convention doesn't end until like seven.
4780240	4784640	And Jamie is all about the cosplay stuff, and that's the very last thing they're doing.
4784640	4787760	So we're just, we're not going to be able to get home in time to do the show.
4787760	4789760	So again, I know many of you are understanding,
4789760	4793040	but I know there's also some of you out there that are like, oh, what are we?
4793040	4795840	And I take, I'm very flattered when it's, you know,
4795840	4799440	how am I going to fill three hours this week with no OLR?
4799440	4802000	So, yeah.
4802000	4804400	So, and I'm looking at some of the comments in chat.
4804400	4806880	SGA100Matt says, OLR, the fiber of podcasts.
4806880	4807680	We're regular.
4807680	4808880	Yes, that's where I like to be.
4809760	4813280	And also some well wishes and glad I'm okay.
4813280	4814720	Yeah, I'm perfectly fine.
4814720	4817280	I actually, I don't know how much I should talk about this.
4817280	4822960	I actually, because I took a really nasty fall, I chipped my tooth and it's my front tooth.
4823520	4828000	Luckily it's not very noticeable, but certainly I notice it.
4828000	4829840	And I'm just paranoid it's going to get worse.
4829840	4832560	But thank God I have a dentist appointment this coming week.
4832560	4835440	And they were like, oh yeah, we can just do a little filling and your insurance covers it.
4835440	4836240	And I'm like, whew.
4836240	4838080	But still like it kind of freaked me out.
4838080	4841040	You know, you chip your front tooth and it's like, that's like a permanent thing, right?
4841040	4843120	So whew, thankfully that's going to be an easy fix.
4843120	4845200	But just to give you an idea, like how serious it was
4845200	4847360	and why I wouldn't have been able to do a show last week anyway.
4848400	4850080	So anyway, yeah, we will not be here next week.
4850080	4854720	But the good news is, whereas I bet many of your podcasts are not going to tape
4854720	4860240	for Christmas and New Year's as many of us don't, which is fine.
4860800	4863440	Actually the days work out really well for us this year.
4863440	4867760	We will still be continuing to give you Sunday shows throughout the holidays.
4867760	4869280	So we will still be here Christmas week.
4869280	4870560	We will still be here New Year's week.
4871120	4874560	So that's the trade-off is that we will continue through the holidays.
4874560	4875440	So at least you get that.
4876160	4879920	I don't foresee after next week we will have any more shows off.
4880000	4883440	Until February when I'm going to MAGFest.
4884080	4887200	Which I can't believe that's already kind of creeping up on us.
4887200	4891040	But yeah, February I'll be going to MAGFest in the Washington DC area.
4891040	4892640	So we won't have a show way out there.
4893440	4895840	So no show next week.
4895840	4899200	But if you are going to be at GX, please come by and say hi.
4899200	4900800	VOG Network will be in the expo hall.
4900800	4901680	We'll have a small table.
4901680	4903200	I will have some little things to give away.
4903920	4906400	I can't wait to help spread more awareness out there.
4906480	4910800	Because I think a lot of the 20-somethings that are probably attending this con probably
4910800	4912320	do more of the live streaming and that stuff.
4912320	4913120	Which is cool.
4913120	4918000	But I want to say, hey, podcasting is out there too for your car rides or for your data
4918000	4920480	entry job or things where you can do audio but not visual.
4921040	4923920	I just want to remind people that podcasts are out there.
4923920	4927280	And hopefully help them find a podcast on the network that's good for them.
4927280	4929760	I'm not just there to sell OLR, though I certainly will.
4930320	4933520	If people say we like video games, I'm going to say, hey, there's OLR.
4933520	4934560	There's also Bobby Black Wolf.
4934560	4939680	There's Ninja and Panda on Electric Sisterhood.
4940320	4943520	And then if they say they like Star Trek, then there's Grandpa's show.
4943520	4947600	And if they like movies and TV, there's certainly Critical Myth, Pod Culture, that
4947600	4948160	whole thing.
4948160	4949760	So we'll be there.
4949760	4957440	Also at GX, a panel Friday 3 o'clock is podcast Cross Zone 3.
4958000	4962800	I will be moderating and with some other podcasting pals out there.
4962800	4964160	Jamie's going to be on the panel as well.
4965040	4967280	We have some other people you haven't seen on the panel before.
4967280	4968320	We have some new people this year.
4968960	4972240	DJ Kirkland, who does Joystick Jockeys, is going to be joining us.
4972240	4975840	And Mario from La Polanca is going to be on the panel as well.
4975840	4979200	And this year's theme is Using Your Voice Constructively.
4979840	4981680	Can you believe they're letting me moderate that?
4981680	4983440	Using Your Voice Constructively.
4983440	4984480	No, in all seriousness.
4984480	4985840	And we'll take your questions as well.
4985840	4990240	So please come out and say hello if you're going to be at GX Friday at 3 o'clock and
4990240	4990720	at the table.
4990720	4996640	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with bognetwork.com,
4996640	4998480	use the passphrase, vacation.
4999280	5004080	I have an update to my week of gaming or whatever, because this is really important to me.
5004080	5004960	I forgot about it.
5004960	5006400	We know how much I love Splatoon.
5006960	5010080	So there was a Splatfest this weekend that I did not get to participate in.
5010800	5013040	And I did pick a shirt because I picked a team.
5013760	5019040	And this is in all the history of Splatfest, this is the first time I picked the winning
5019040	5021360	team, but I did not get to participate.
5021360	5023840	And it kills me.
5023840	5025600	You played the psychology game, right?
5025600	5027120	Because you knew burgers would be less popular.
5027120	5027600	Exactly.
5027600	5033360	I didn't want to, I wanted to be pizza, but I picked burgers because history has shown
5033360	5036640	for the most part, if you pick the least popular team, you're going to win.
5037520	5041840	So I'm just really upset that I actually had a winning team this time.
5041840	5045120	And I could have got a lot of stupid sea snails.
5045120	5048640	But no, I was at something else and I didn't get to play.
5048640	5051840	I totally forgot to play too, because I was too busy trying to figure out what the fuck
5051840	5053200	to do in XCX.
5055200	5055920	But you were lost.
5055920	5056640	You picked pizza.
5057360	5058400	No, I didn't pick any of them.
5058400	5059840	Oh, well you didn't pick any of them.
5059840	5064640	I was probably going to pick burgers for the same reason, your rationale, was that it was
5064640	5066240	going to be less popular and therefore it was going to...
5066240	5070000	Yeah, it just, it hurts so bad to actually know I could have won finally.
5070000	5072480	Well, the good news is they should do, they'll have another one in two weeks.
5072480	5073920	Yeah, Europe got theirs announced.
5073920	5077040	Theirs is pineapple on pizza, yay or nay.
5077040	5080480	I'm like, oh my gosh, who's running Europe's Splatfest?
5080480	5082400	It's so bad every time.
5082400	5084880	Pineapple on pizza, yay or nay.
5086400	5089360	But like, I'm that crowd, I love pineapple.
5089360	5091520	It's a little weird on pizza, but I don't hate it.
5091520	5092560	It's not even the point.
5092560	5096080	It's like, why is that something that you have to pick a side on for Splatfest?
5096080	5102320	Maybe they should have done like Hawaiian pizza or pepperoni and sau-
5102320	5103520	That's a little better.
5103520	5104400	What's a popular combination?
5104880	5106640	Live or die, make a choice.
5108880	5111360	It's just like they've had North Pole versus South Pole.
5111360	5114720	Well, Europe probably doesn't care about either pole, so why do you have to pick?
5114720	5117040	Okay, because the South Pole has penguins.
5117040	5120480	Now the North Pole has Santa Claus, but I'm still going to side with penguins.
5120480	5121680	Yeah, I probably would too.
5121680	5122400	There you go, right?
5123440	5126560	Wait, there was, did you see the penguin in the mech at the-
5126560	5128240	Yeah, I was like, that's so cute.
5128240	5131280	And then it started talking, I'm like, that is not as cute now.
5131280	5133120	I do not like its voice.
5133120	5136240	But it was a game I didn't really have any interest in.
5136240	5138240	All right, we got to get into some news.
5138240	5142160	DarkSagra is texting me going, you guys haven't gotten to my segment yet.
5142160	5145680	I'm like, actually, we're just now in How Was Your Gaming Week?
5145680	5148800	Because Shane talked for a good 45 minutes about the PlayStation Switch.
5148800	5149600	You asked me to come over.
5149600	5150560	But you did a great job.
5150560	5151520	No, you did a great job.
5151520	5152080	You really did.
5152800	5155760	There's a lot more too, but apparently I'm not talking about that.
5155760	5159120	Some shows, man, some of those episodes of Hoard House, you wouldn't say a damn thing,
5159120	5160640	but you just have to get excited.
5160640	5162640	I just have to care about what I'm talking about.
5163760	5166800	If I don't care, then I'm not going to be excited to talk about it.
5166800	5168720	All right, now let's talk about Final Fantasy 14.
5170240	5170560	All right.
5170560	5171760	Don't care about that right now.
5172560	5173520	All right, moving on.
5173520	5174720	Let's get into some news.
5174720	5176160	Loki's probably getting bored too.
5176160	5177040	I'm sorry, Loki.
5177040	5178000	You all right?
5178000	5179040	Planning your next field?
5180880	5182080	Planning my drive home.
5182080	5182320	All right.
5182320	5185040	Oh, actually, no, we already did your story for the kickoff topics.
5185040	5186000	We need to do me, huh?
5188000	5188560	I don't know.
5189280	5190080	I'm prepared too.
5190080	5191440	I don't even have the show roll up.
5191440	5191680	Yep.
5195680	5197200	Talk more about the PlayStation experience.
5197200	5197520	All right, yeah.
5197520	5199520	Tell us one other quick thing you haven't talked about yet.
5199520	5200160	Oh, crap.
5200160	5200720	Only one?
5204240	5204720	Pick one.
5206080	5207280	Another game you played.
5207280	5208400	What was another game I played?
5208400	5211840	I'll just talk about Thumper some more because everybody needs to play Thumper when it comes
5211840	5212400	out.
5212400	5214560	Thumper is so good visually.
5214560	5215600	It's really pretty.
5216720	5220560	If you like rhythm games, because that's all it really is, despite the way it looks, is
5220560	5221680	such a good rhythm game.
5221680	5223680	Do they have a release date window for it yet?
5223680	5225280	He just told me 2016.
5226240	5227120	Like every game.
5227120	5229600	But they do have a Twitter and a mailing list and all that.
5229600	5232480	So you should definitely check it out.
5232480	5233840	Watch some videos.
5233840	5236240	It feels violent when you play.
5236240	5237360	It's pretty awesome.
5237360	5241360	So if you like beating things up, this is good too for you.
5241360	5243680	Like you were about to do to somebody over a controller.
5243680	5245920	Well, if they were, no, they're just rude.
5245920	5246400	All right.
5247200	5250800	If you want to play something that's coming out this year, and for free.
5250800	5253760	Then there was nothing at that PlayStation experience for you.
5253760	5256800	You could, you know, well, no, I guess.
5256800	5258240	And a lot of stuff that's already out, actually.
5258240	5260000	This came out of the Game Awards.
5260000	5261520	But anyway, here's the deal.
5261520	5264080	Shadow Complex Remastered.
5264080	5267360	It was actually announced during the Game Awards.
5267360	5272480	And there's a PC version that's available right now on the Shadow Complex website.
5272480	5273280	Here's the deal.
5273280	5274240	It's free.
5274240	5279760	So if you want to play the Shadow Complex remaster, you can go do that for free on PC.
5279760	5283040	There will be a PlayStation 4 and Xbox One version, but no date on that yet.
5283040	5284880	And I imagine those will not be free.
5285520	5290000	Also, when I say free, when I went to the website to start to do it, it wanted to install
5290000	5292400	the Epic Games installer and all this stuff.
5292400	5297200	So I kind of feel like, yeah, it's free, but they're probably going to try to push some
5297200	5298240	other games on you.
5298240	5299840	So I haven't done it.
5299840	5303840	Maybe somebody in chat who has actually played at this point can enlighten me if there's
5303840	5308400	any types of advertisements or how they justify that free price.
5308400	5311600	Yeah, Dark Tetsuya says, oh yeah, you need the Epic installer for that.
5311600	5315360	So anyway, Shadow Complex, if you've never played it, it was on the Xbox 360.
5315360	5318800	It was one of their Xbox Live Arcade releases in 2009.
5318800	5323600	And it was given a lot of praise for being a Metroidvania type of game.
5323600	5328560	But it's more like a spy shoot type of thing.
5328560	5332000	So I guess it's maybe more like Bionic Commando in that regard.
5332000	5332560	I don't know.
5332560	5335840	But anyway, yeah, I like Shadow Complex enough.
5335840	5337600	So I hope to check this out soon.
5338320	5338820	Loki.
5340000	5340560	All right.
5340560	5348080	So this is really exciting because I haven't been able to play my Fallout 4 in Just Cause
5348080	5349680	3 because my wife's watching TV.
5349680	5357760	But just like on the Xbox One, they are working on remote play support for PC and Mac.
5357760	5362320	So you'll be able to stream your games to your PC, which is fantastic.
5362560	5365920	I would seriously get a ton of use out of this.
5366800	5369840	And so I hope that is a thing that happens very soon.
5369840	5374720	Otherwise, I'm going to have to actually build my second screen controller device thing that
5374720	5376560	I bought the parts for but never did anything with.
5377680	5380640	Do you guys find that you use this remote play feature?
5380640	5384720	Because I'm kind of, I was going to ask this as the Fugu question of the week, but I opted
5384720	5385600	for something else.
5385600	5389440	Like, do you guys use these remote play features?
5389440	5391280	Are they useful for you, Shane?
5391280	5394080	I never, I think I've done it once.
5394080	5398800	Actually, back when it was PSP and PS3, I streamed to my PSP.
5398800	5405120	I was like, I don't really like this, but I see it now, especially with the Vita.
5405120	5407760	And I'm sorry, I really wasn't paying attention to what this, what we're talking about.
5407760	5409600	No, I completely forgot.
5409600	5414240	I have my stupid PlayStation TV that's just sitting there buried because it's so small.
5414240	5416960	I just strapped that to my screen in remote play.
5416960	5417520	There you go.
5417520	5421040	I saw Sony really position the, I mean, they talked about Vita.
5421040	5425440	This weekend randomly, it was weird, but I think they're really trying to show with
5425440	5431520	all these like cross buys with PS4 and Vita now that the Vita is basically your remote
5431520	5433840	play thing for your PS4.
5433840	5436320	So I would like to use it more.
5436320	5440960	I think there are some really good games that would be more fun if I didn't have to always
5440960	5442160	just be by my TV.
5442880	5447760	And I guess now that it's for, that they're talking about doing it on your PC, I could
5447840	5450640	play something on my PC that I wanted to play on my TV.
5450640	5454720	And then my TV can play Twitch because it's all I watch on TV anymore, I feel like.
5454720	5461280	I have found that the remote play is something I use on the PC for the Xbox One.
5461280	5465520	I actually have streamed Xbox One to my PC because my PC is in my office.
5465520	5468240	So like if Alan's gaming, then I can kind of be in there too.
5468240	5470400	We can kind of both be gaming, doing our own thing.
5470400	5473920	And it's usually, especially in these winter months, it's a little warmer in my office.
5473920	5475520	So I tend to kind of like to be in there.
5475520	5478720	And I was playing, funny enough, I didn't talk about this during my gaming week because
5478720	5484240	it's a really old game, but Dungeon Siege 3 was free on the Xbox games with gold.
5484240	5486160	So I actually downloaded that to Xbox One.
5486160	5489360	I've been streaming that over to my PC and playing a little bit of that.
5489360	5491120	So that is a feature I use.
5491120	5495040	That'd be kind of cool if the PlayStation did that without me having to get one of those
5495040	5495600	TVs.
5495600	5496240	Yeah, exactly.
5496240	5498720	Because well, they're only $20 now.
5498720	5501680	Yeah, they'll be at the dollar store soon enough.
5502000	5506400	But no, they're, it's small enough.
5506400	5508320	I should just put that together.
5508320	5511920	I just haven't bothered to do that because it's kind of awkward to have that second screen.
5511920	5514240	I have a battery pack and everything ready to go.
5514240	5516800	I just need to wire it up and build a case for it.
5516800	5519360	Actually, the building the case for it was actually what's holding it back.
5519360	5522000	But I can duct tape it together.
5522560	5524080	That'll be just as good, right?
5525680	5526080	Maybe.
5526080	5529760	All right, let's talk about the NX.
5529760	5532160	Not to leave Nintendo out of these discussions.
5532160	5534880	We've talked a lot about Sony and I just talked a little bit about Microsoft.
5534880	5540640	But Nintendo, you know, a lot of folks curious what 2016 is going to bring as far as the
5540640	5542000	NX goes.
5542000	5545840	And it seems, which obviously won't be its final name, but that's what everybody's calling
5545840	5546320	it for now.
5547120	5549520	Just like, what was everybody calling the Wii U before they gave it a name?
5549520	5551280	Wasn't like, was that the one that they called?
5551280	5552880	No, Dolphin was GameCube.
5552880	5554480	Revolution was Wii.
5554480	5555520	What did they call Wii U?
5556240	5557520	I don't remember, but I know everybody...
5557520	5558400	Unnecessary?
5559040	5560320	They called it the Wii U.
5560320	5561680	I remember everybody was like...
5561680	5562640	A disappointment.
5562640	5565360	The project name was way better than the real name.
5565360	5569360	So anyway, with NX, Tatsume Kimishima.
5569360	5570240	Do you guys know that name?
5570880	5572080	President of Nintendo.
5572080	5572720	Okay, good.
5572720	5577120	I bet a lot of people don't know, kind of forget that he's now the new president of
5577120	5580320	Nintendo ever since the unfortunate passing of Satoru Iwata.
5580320	5583840	But he made some comments this week in Time magazine.
5584720	5589040	And he was talking about his involvement with the Wii shortages in the mid 2000s.
5589040	5590640	So they were getting on some other topics.
5590640	5592880	But of course, the NX got brought up.
5592880	5593920	And he said this quote,
5594480	5599120	I can assure you, we're not building the next version of Wii or Wii U.
5601840	5604160	NX is something unique and different.
5604160	5609120	It's something where we have to move away from those platforms in order to make it something
5609120	5610720	that will appeal.
5610720	5617120	Now, the reason why I think this is interesting is because all the rumors right now about
5617120	5624720	NX make it sound like it's a Wii U, but the gamepad detaches in a way where you can take
5624720	5629440	that with you out on the street, out on the road, and it's a fully functional device that
5629440	5630560	plays the same games.
5630560	5634480	That's some of the rumor, at least the impression I'm getting from some of these early rumors
5634480	5635760	what this thing is all about.
5635760	5640400	So the fact that he's coming out and saying it's nothing like Wii U kind of directly conflicts
5640400	5640800	with that.
5641600	5645760	But these rumors sound like remote play, which is what everybody's already doing, basically.
5646560	5650000	I do also want to chime in with my 10 seconds of internet research.
5650000	5652320	Codename for Wii U was Project Cafe.
5652320	5655840	And actually Bobby Blackwolf, to his credit, chimed in the chat room with that.
5655840	5657280	I was going to get to that.
5657280	5660800	That's not even better than Wii U, so it was a step up.
5660800	5664000	To be fair, yeah, that was kind of the worst of all the different names, but yeah.
5665040	5666480	Project Cafe.
5666480	5667600	I always think of that DDR song.
5667600	5670320	Yeah, I was like, that's kind of cool.
5670320	5675040	With Charlie Brown and Sally.
5675040	5679840	Anyway, and Tigerclaw noting, since we were talking about Nintendo today, would have been
5679840	5681680	Satoru Iwata's 56th birthday.
5681680	5684800	And of course, he got a great tribute at the Game Awards as well.
5684800	5688000	So, all right.
5689680	5692800	So anyway, yeah, the NX is going to be something completely different.
5692800	5696320	It may not include a disk drive, apparently, but again, he hasn't commented on that.
5696320	5701680	If it doesn't include a disk drive, then it better come with a massive amount of storage
5701680	5708560	space because I've seen people champion that the Wii U is such a consumer-friendly system
5708560	5712480	with its 32GB hard drive and you can buy extra stuff.
5712480	5714160	Sorry, that is just a complete lie.
5714160	5715200	It is not.
5715200	5717360	I really hope it does have a disk drive.
5717360	5721840	And the reason why is even though I do buy a lot of my games digitally, I like having
5721840	5724720	the option to be able to get those at a discounted rate.
5724720	5729520	And at least with Sony and Microsoft, they tend to discount their stuff pretty often.
5729520	5731200	Nintendo, not so much.
5731200	5735280	And you have that closed market where they aren't dropping the price of their games.
5735920	5737200	I'm just not expecting much.
5738800	5744080	And just to have the option period, like, I do a lot of digital now too, but you all
5744080	5745440	start to run out of space.
5745440	5748320	And that's something that happened with Xenoblade for me.
5748320	5750400	And I went out and, like, there's no good...
5750400	5754880	Xenoblade's like 22GB and the hard drive in that thing is, what, 32GB?
5754880	5756880	But only 25GB that you get to use.
5756880	5757840	So if you have any other...
5757840	5763440	I had to delete, like, half my stuff off of my Wii U because there's no good storage
5763440	5763920	options.
5763920	5768080	I deleted the Metroid Prime trilogy, regretfully, so I could make space for those Xenoblade
5768080	5768160	Miracles packs.
5768160	5773120	I deleted Nintendo Land, which was not a big loss, but I did delete that.
5773120	5775920	But when I say delete, it's not like I can't re-download it later.
5776000	5778720	So don't be all like, Rob, why are you hating on Metroid?
5778720	5779680	I can always download it later.
5779680	5780640	You're not hating on Metroid.
5780640	5783200	You're hating on the lack of storage space.
5783840	5785280	Yes, I'm hating on lack of storage space.
5785280	5789120	And, to be fair, I did have more fun with the Metroid Prime trilogy than I'm having
5789120	5790800	with XCX right now.
5790800	5792560	Lots of fighting words.
5792560	5795200	I'm leaving the door open to change my opinion on XCX later.
5795200	5797120	Just so you can slam it in its face.
5798400	5798960	Stop it.
5800320	5801200	All right, so...
5801200	5802400	I'll figure it out tonight.
5802400	5804320	We'll see what happens with the NX later on.
5804320	5808160	Hey, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what's coming
5808160	5811120	out, although I imagine things are slowing down significantly.
5811120	5813760	But we'll check in with Loki with US releases.
5813760	5815840	Yes, so things are slowing down significantly.
5815840	5820160	But this week is pretty exciting because not only are there Earth Defense Force games coming
5820160	5823120	out, there's two Earth Defense Force games coming out.
5823120	5828000	So Earth Defense Force 4.1, The Shadow of Despair, coming out on PlayStation 4, and
5828000	5831600	Earth Defense Force 2, Invaders from Planet Space for the Vita.
5831600	5834960	And then the Wii U is getting Devil's Third.
5835840	5836640	Oh, finally.
5837280	5838000	In America.
5838960	5839280	Yes.
5840240	5842160	I watched some streams of that when it came out in Japan.
5843440	5845840	Maybe they should have canceled it.
5845840	5848880	It just is not great.
5848880	5852000	It seems like, as well, a lot of games are getting patches and things like that this
5852000	5852400	week.
5852400	5853360	Like, it's not just...
5853360	5855280	Like, as I know, Rock Band's got its, like...
5855280	5856880	Tony Hawk's getting one too.
5856880	5860320	We made the game now that we promised.
5860320	5862640	Well, hey, does this mean I can actually buy the game now?
5862640	5864160	Oh, I still wouldn't, probably.
5864880	5866000	Is that it for...
5866000	5866640	That is it.
5866640	5867280	Yeah, those three.
5868400	5870800	Let's go to Japan real quick and check out the releases there.
5872160	5875360	On the 10th of December in Japan, Gravity Days with the...
5875360	5876320	That's Gravity Rush.
5876320	5877760	Oh, is that the sequel?
5877760	5878960	Wait, what's it say?
5878960	5880400	D-A-Z-E, Gravity Days.
5880400	5881920	No, Gravity Days would still be...
5881920	5882560	No, that's a different...
5882560	5884080	That's just the remaster if it's PS4.
5884080	5885120	Oh, got it, got it, got it.
5885120	5886000	Yeah, they have a different name for it.
5886000	5887120	That's right, they have a different name for it.
5887120	5887600	Okay, so that's...
5887600	5888960	That looks like my card I got.
5889600	5893200	That's the remaster, or I'm sorry, yeah, the PlayStation 4 remaster.
5893200	5893840	That's out in...
5894400	5895760	Excuse me, Japan this week.
5895760	5901280	As is Nitro Plus Blaster's Heroine Infinite Duel and Steins Gate Zero.
5902640	5903760	And Koffing.
5903760	5905360	And lots of Koffing, excuse me.
5905360	5910400	And Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, all coming out on the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.
5910400	5911760	So things not slowing down over there.
5912400	5915280	On the Wii U, however, things are still slow.
5915280	5918720	Wii U doesn't have anything until after Christmas in Japan at this point.
5918720	5922080	So lastly, though, I do want to look at the handhelds,
5922080	5926960	because even though Nintendo doesn't usually have Wii U stuff, they sometimes have 3DS stuff.
5926960	5932000	And yeah, this week, Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire in a gift pack.
5932000	5933280	Yeah, it's just a bundle.
5933280	5936880	You know, it's just a bundle with both games for the few of you that don't have that yet.
5936880	5938720	It may come with something too, I forget.
5939600	5946320	Also, Baymax Heroes Battle and Nico Pucci Girls Runway comes out this week.
5946320	5950480	Lastly, on the Vita, because, you know, Vita in Japan is still a big thing.
5951040	5956480	The Eiyu Densetsu Sora no Kiseuke SC Evolution in regular limited edition.
5956480	5957760	Steins Gate Zero.
5957760	5960720	Idolmaster, Musongs, Blueboard, and Redboard.
5960720	5962400	I'm assuming those are different song lists.
5962400	5964640	And then Valkyrie Drive B.
5964640	5967520	Kakuni comes out this week as well.
5967520	5970720	So still a busy week over in Japan.
5970720	5974720	And I'm going to try to peek here at the Europe release dates for Jamie,
5974720	5975840	since she's not here tonight.
5975840	5978000	Although we will hear from her in a little bit.
5978000	5980080	Things slowing down in Europe significantly.
5980080	5982240	The only release I see of note this week.
5982800	5986480	Darius Burst Chronicle Saviors on PlayStation 4 and Vita.
5986480	5989760	But I bet this list I'm looking at doesn't include anything they
5989760	5992400	surprise unveiled at that PlayStation Expo.
5992400	5993280	So keep that in mind.
5994000	5996160	All right, just a couple more stories for you guys.
5996160	6000800	And then we're going to get Jamie here to do the Classic Game of the Week.
6000800	6001840	First, Loki.
6001840	6005920	All right, so there apparently has been some leaks on Steam.
6005920	6008240	And this is regarding the Steam database.
6009120	6012880	Some games that have popped up that have appeared in the database.
6014480	6018400	As potential help topics or part of the help desk.
6018400	6022000	So included with this, they've got, let's see.
6022720	6026160	Stranger of Sword City, Criminal Girls, Earth Defense Force 4.1.
6026880	6028240	I may have to get that for PC as well.
6029040	6029920	Sonic Boom.
6030720	6032080	Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
6032080	6032880	Steins Gate.
6032880	6033920	Little King's Story.
6033920	6034960	Guilty Gear.
6034960	6036080	Xrd Sign.
6038240	6039680	Bad Rat Show.
6039680	6041520	Final Fantasy 6.
6041520	6043520	Final Fantasy X and X2.
6043520	6044960	HD Remaster.
6045760	6047760	Danganronpa 1 and 2.
6048400	6049680	And Half Life 3, of course.
6049680	6050880	Everybody needs to get on that.
6050880	6054000	Everybody's Gone to the Rapture because that is one of the best games of this year.
6054000	6056960	So if you don't have a PS4, get it on PC.
6056960	6060480	I still have a hard time calling that a game.
6060480	6064080	But it's one of the best interactive experiences I've had.
6064080	6066560	So if you had like a top five games of the year list,
6066560	6068560	it couldn't make it there because you can't call it a game?
6068560	6072320	No, it probably will be on my list for the greatest games of the year.
6072320	6076560	But I with the footnote that this is very unlike other games that you're used to.
6078880	6082720	It's no different than like a visual novel.
6082720	6086000	Right, but when I was talking about Gone Home, I said the same thing.
6086640	6089120	But at least Gone Home had like three puzzles in it.
6089120	6090720	I never played that.
6090720	6092560	That's really not a bad game.
6092560	6094160	It's definitely worth looking at.
6094880	6095440	But that's cool.
6095440	6097760	If everybody's Gone to the Rapture is coming to PC, will you buy it again?
6097760	6098560	Because I probably will.
6099280	6101760	Actually, depending on the price.
6102800	6103840	I do like it a lot.
6103840	6106640	I would like to support them so they make more games
6107280	6109360	because they do have one of my favorite games of the year.
6110640	6111840	Yeah, I probably would.
6111840	6112340	Okay.
6112900	6117780	All right, well, speaking of Steam, if you have way too many games on Steam,
6117780	6120660	you are wanting to get rid of something permanently.
6121300	6122340	You can now do that.
6122340	6125380	You can delete games from your Steam account forever,
6126180	6129140	which I don't know really why you'd want to do this.
6129140	6133060	But it was suggested that maybe like a friend buys you a gag gift or something
6133060	6134580	that you don't really want.
6134580	6137140	But then I'm like, can't you just put it in your inventory?
6137140	6139860	Yeah, you don't have to sell it or give it to somebody else.
6139860	6141860	Or it's a little weird to me.
6141940	6144180	Can you just give games that you own to other people?
6144980	6148580	No, once you've played them, you can't put them back in your inventory.
6148580	6150900	If someone buys you a gift copy, you don't have to redeem it.
6150900	6152500	You can just keep it in your inventory.
6152500	6154820	And then after like so many days, you can trade it.
6154820	6155540	I see.
6155540	6156040	Yeah.
6156820	6159300	But if you want to get rid of a game, then you can do that.
6160180	6162180	So now Steam has the option.
6162180	6164420	If you want to eliminate something for your Steam account altogether,
6164420	6165060	you can do that.
6165060	6166660	You do not get a refund for it.
6166660	6169060	It just removes it from your library.
6169060	6172660	Also interesting, games, if they were a part of a bundle,
6172660	6174340	cannot be removed individually.
6174340	6176500	You will have to remove the entire bundle.
6176500	6179380	So anything that shared the same key is what.
6179380	6182100	So basically, it's lifting the keys from your account, it sounds like.
6182740	6184580	Once again, though, I don't understand why you would do that.
6184580	6187460	If you're just like looking to get rid of something off your list,
6187460	6190180	you can sort them into like folders and stuff now, I think.
6190180	6193380	Yeah, or if you're looking to uninstall the files,
6193380	6196820	if that's your problem is you're running out of hard drive space, maybe.
6196820	6198420	I could see you want to do that.
6198420	6203780	But isn't the point of your Steam collection is to make it as big as possible?
6203780	6204980	I mean, isn't that the point?
6204980	6207300	Why would we want to remove keys?
6207300	6209220	It depends on how you want to play the game.
6210340	6211620	It depends on how you want to do that.
6211620	6212340	Collect them all.
6212340	6214740	But, you know, Jamie did buy me Hatful Boyfriend,
6214740	6216260	and I'm like, do I really want this game?
6216260	6217220	No, I'm kidding.
6217220	6218500	Of course, I want that game.
6218500	6221380	I do need to spend more time with it at some point.
6221380	6225220	Anyway, speaking of Jamie, we're going to get her on the line.
6225300	6228980	It's time to bring her on because she needs to do one of her segments for us.
6228980	6232180	So we're going to do this old school here and call her phone right now.
6232180	6236660	And hopefully she knows that we're on our way and we'll be there
6236660	6241540	because that would be very embarrassing if she doesn't end up picking the phone up.
6241540	6242340	So we'll see.
6242340	6243300	Oh, boy, this.
6244900	6245380	Hi.
6245380	6246180	Hi, how are you?
6247620	6249460	I'm okay. How are you?
6249460	6252020	Good. So you're not here in studio tonight.
6252980	6255060	Are you okay, Jamie? We're worried about you.
6256180	6257460	Yeah, I'm okay.
6257460	6262420	I just I started helping my friends move around one o'clock.
6262420	6264820	We didn't get done with the whole thing until 4 a.m.
6265380	6266340	Oh, my God.
6266340	6269140	So we moved from 1 p.m. to 4 a.m.
6269940	6271380	Moving sucks.
6271380	6273380	It sucks so bad.
6273380	6275860	I think it's punishment for stealing in some countries.
6275860	6276420	It really is.
6278100	6278740	It's awful.
6278740	6284660	Well, I am well medicated and the cold muscles are feeling better.
6284660	6286900	But when you're medicated, that means you can't drive.
6288180	6288900	Exactly.
6288900	6289940	Exactly. All right.
6289940	6292180	Well, at least we get you on the show tonight in some capacity.
6292180	6292820	Don't worry.
6292820	6297140	Shane has been talking our ears off about the PlayStation experience,
6297140	6299860	but we've learned a lot about PlayStation VR tonight.
6299860	6300900	He did a very good job.
6300900	6301700	Thank you.
6301700	6302200	All right.
6303060	6305620	But I guess I can say this.
6305620	6308500	Shane was like, hey, if I'm coming to the show, can I do the classic game of the week?
6308500	6309380	And I was like, nope.
6309380	6313540	Because I was just going to do like one of the bus to move games or dance.
6313540	6315220	So I just have to get that out there.
6315220	6315780	All right.
6315780	6316180	That's fair.
6316180	6318580	Although I believe he's probably done them all.
6319300	6320420	Probably not dance summit, though.
6320980	6321380	Maybe not.
6321380	6321700	Maybe not.
6321700	6322020	All right.
6322020	6325300	No, I don't think I've done dance on it, but it depends on if it's over 10 years old.
6325300	6327540	Well, now, yeah, it is tonight over.
6327540	6330820	I think for the classic of the week tonight, let me play a little music.
6330820	6332340	You give the spiel every week.
6332340	6335540	Dark soccer jumps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, hey,
6335540	6343220	you people need to put down your episodic remakes and your VR headsets and play this.
6343220	6346340	And this is a game that I think should come to VR headsets, by the way.
6346340	6350260	And tonight's game is, I think, one of those games where I think you're all going to love it,
6350260	6354260	but you're all also going to go, oh, my God, that's 10 years old.
6354260	6355620	Because remember, that's the criteria.
6355620	6359700	Game has to be 10 years old to be considered a classic game.
6359700	6360500	So dark soccer.
6360500	6362420	And dance summit does qualify, by the way.
6363060	6363460	I bet.
6363460	6366020	Yeah, I know dance summit qualifies if this one does.
6366580	6367540	Dark soccer.
6367540	6369860	What is the classic game of the week?
6371300	6372500	Katamari Damacy.
6373860	6375220	Katamari Damacy.
6378500	6382500	Yeah, I finally, finally decided to do this because I had already done Tetris,
6382500	6385380	and Tetris sort of fit the theme of all the moving last night.
6385380	6387380	But we did move a lot of stuff.
6387380	6390500	So Katamari, yeah, I can qualify.
6391460	6395060	So, um, Katamari is actually, for the record, just real quick,
6395060	6398340	Katamari is actually 11 years old, if you can believe it.
6398340	6399700	It's not just 10, it's 11.
6399700	6400200	Yeah.
6402260	6405060	And it's something that's come out in the lifetime of the show, too,
6405060	6408500	because we remember we had the giant Katamari at E3 that year.
6408500	6410580	We were obsessed with this shit when it came out.
6410580	6420660	We got one of our demo discs that we were giving to people was on the official Katamari.
6421700	6425060	To be fair, I think that was actually when they were doing Beautiful Katamari,
6425060	6426660	which was the sequel on 360.
6426660	6428100	I think that's what Namco is promoting,
6428100	6431700	because when this came out with kind of little fanfare in the States,
6431700	6432980	whenever it was kind of a cult game.
6432980	6434500	Yeah, super hard to find at times.
6434500	6435000	True.
6436580	6441780	Well, at any rate, Katamari Damacy literally translates to clumped soul.
6444260	6447540	It came out, um, it was done by Namco.
6447540	6452180	It came out on PS2, first of course in Japan and then in North America.
6452180	6455460	And it was actually the result of a school project from
6455460	6457540	Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory.
6458580	6461220	It cost less than a million to make.
6461220	6468500	So it actually cost, I believe, just under a tenth of what Ridge Racer cost to make.
6470340	6476420	So the whole point was that it needed to be novel, easy to understand, and highly enjoyable.
6477460	6481940	So the whole point of the game, I mean, and if you don't know what this is by now,
6481940	6483220	then come out from under a rock.
6483860	6490900	But the king of all cosmos got drunk and partied and destroyed all the stars.
6491460	6491960	And the moon.
6493700	6497220	So he attacked his son with cleaning up his mess.
6497860	6502100	So he has to roll over things in the world to make stars and
6502660	6505300	build constellations and even remake the moon.
6506340	6509700	And it is very stylized.
6509700	6511140	The world is very surreal.
6511140	6514100	I mean, when you've got people walking on the back development,
6514100	6518340	you know, in the middle of the city district, then that's weird.
6519300	6521860	Either that or that could be San Francisco, I don't know.
6524740	6530340	So basically, it was kind of a sleeper when it came out.
6530340	6531620	People were like, what's this?
6531620	6533460	And then, oh, that's what that is.
6534260	6537620	And it's made a bunch of sequels and stuff.
6537620	6543700	But let's go ahead and start back with the control of the game.
6544580	6554900	Basically, one of the things that actually was put into kind of the background story
6555540	6557060	is that there...
6557060	6561780	Because you start in the family homes of the Hoshino family.
6563940	6566180	And the father, who's an astronaut, can't go to the moon
6566180	6568500	because the king danced around and destroyed it.
6569140	6571620	And one of the things that...
6571620	6574100	I guess this wasn't really played up a lot for the US one,
6574100	6579620	but his daughter could see that the prince was going to work putting things together.
6580180	6585060	However, for their entire family, their house and their town are now part of the moon.
6585620	6590020	So anyway, you basically use the little analog to control
6591860	6593300	how you're steering the Katamari.
6593300	6599060	It kind of feels like battle zones where you can kind of turn, kind of flip, move them around.
6599060	6602580	You can also wiggle them and make it spin so you can go faster.
6602580	6605140	And you start with small things and then you pick up bigger things.
6605140	6606900	And sometimes you need specific things.
6606900	6609780	Like, I think there's one where you pick up, like, all cats.
6610580	6611220	Wasn't that it?
6612900	6614500	I seem to remember something like that.
6614500	6615780	Yeah, it was like all one thing.
6617140	6622820	Yeah, so the more of things of that size, the bigger you make the Katamari, the bigger it'll grow.
6622820	6627220	And then your perspective changes until, like, the last level,
6627220	6632020	you start off kind of human size, or maybe less than human size,
6632020	6636580	and you grow to world size, picking up islands and files and shit.
6637380	6641860	So, um, but the basic gameplay is the naked star mode,
6641860	6646580	where you have to build your Katamari to a particular size within your time limit.
6647780	6651780	And, you know, the king kind of gives you a hard time as you're going through the level.
6653060	6654340	But the king is fabulous.
6654340	6656180	I love the king of all causes.
6656180	6659620	And then a two-player you can play as the prince or his cousins.
6659620	6666420	So you can kind of do a simultaneous sort of versus as you go.
6667940	6673140	But anyway, the game was designed by Takahashi Keita
6674180	6677460	at his school project for the Namco Digital Hollywood Game Laboratory.
6678340	6681780	And it was an institute for game development education.
6682420	6687140	And his thesis was that if you have core gameplay ideas,
6688660	6692340	that it could make a successful game,
6692340	6698980	meaning that it has to be easy to understand, novel, and enjoyable,
6698980	6701380	and on top of that includes humor with it.
6701380	6709860	And he was, I think, singled out by Iwatani Toru,
6709860	6712500	who is the head of research and development at Namco,
6713220	6717300	that this could be something that was very similar to how Pac-Man works,
6717300	6722100	you know, that its simplicity and easy fun could make it successful.
6722900	6729620	So the gameplay was patented and they started working on it.
6729620	6736180	So it was revealed in 2003 at Tokyo Game Show as a snowball simulator.
6736180	6737620	Well, that's what the press called it.
6738260	6746820	And the demo had this red ball called Tamako Barashi,
6747540	6751940	which is part of a school game the kids play.
6753060	6757220	And then depending on how well they thought it was in the US,
6757220	6759940	but if they were going to give it a full release.
6759940	6761860	So it got really good reviews and they said,
6761860	6762900	you know what, we're going to do this.
6763700	6767620	So it was moderately successful in Japan.
6768420	6771460	It sold its first week 32,000 units,
6771460	6775460	and then over 155,000 by Nancy Spelt and Co.,
6777380	6779700	which was less than what they hoped would sell.
6780420	6785780	But then in the US, it sold pretty well
6786900	6789140	and just gained momentum over and over.
6789940	6792500	It was not released in Europe and Australia
6792500	6795140	because they thought it was going to be too quirky.
6795140	6798340	However, EA picked up the sequels for release in Europe.
6800980	6802740	The games had sequels.
6802740	6805780	I mean, we had the sequel We Love Katamari,
6805780	6810260	which was pretty much the Japanese name Mima Daisuke Katamari Damachi.
6812020	6814580	Well, technically it was Everyone Loves Katamari Damachi.
6816340	6818980	And then there were Me and My Katamari,
6819540	6824980	which was Mokumo Itashi no Katamari Damachi in Japanese,
6824980	6827300	which was basically My My Katamari Damachi,
6828900	6832660	meaning a masculine and a neutral speaker.
6832660	6834020	That was for PST.
6834900	6838980	Beautiful Katamari Damachi also came out on Xbox 360,
6838980	6841460	which is what we had our thing up for, right?
6845780	6848420	And the story of that one is to close up black holes
6848420	6851300	that were made when the team played tennis.
6852740	6854340	The king just needs to retire.
6857060	6861860	And then there was a Kobarashi Puzzle Katamari Damachi
6861860	6866980	that came for DSiWare, which was more of a puzzle game.
6868820	6870900	There was Touch My Katamari.
6871460	6872820	Yay, fun name.
6873380	6879540	Rolling with Katamari, which was the Nintendo DCP-904i for the phone.
6881940	6886740	And then Katamari Damachi Mobile came out for a bunch of different services,
6886740	6889140	and then I Love Katamari came out for iOS.
6892500	6895380	I was just going to say, the series has been kind of quiet for a little while.
6897540	6899540	I guess the iPhone one is the most recent,
6899540	6902980	but I really feel like the Vita version was really the last one I played,
6902980	6904820	and that was during the Vita launch.
6904820	6907300	So I think it's time for Katamari to come back, personally.
6907300	6908100	I think we're ready.
6909620	6910580	There's a little bit more.
6910580	6915460	The last one that came out was in 2011, which was Katamari Amore,
6915460	6919620	but it was a kind of a pay-to-play type of thing,
6919620	6921300	and it's since been removed from the App Store.
6922900	6925060	There's a Korean developer called WindySoft
6925060	6928180	that said they were going to do a Katamari Damachi online
6928180	6931460	that was supposed to be on 2007, but it never came out in the US.
6933300	6935060	And that was really kind of the end of it.
6935060	6938500	That last thing we had was in Council 11, which was the Katamari Amore.
6940740	6942420	So no more.
6942420	6946020	Although we did have one of the cousins show up in Namco High.
6947300	6948340	Oh yeah, that's right.
6948340	6950340	I remember that with that whole game.
6950980	6954980	There was a lot of cameos from different Namco characters there.
6954980	6955620	So there it is.
6955620	6957700	Yeah, the main character you play at is the cousin.
6958420	6960580	There it is, folks, your classic game of the week,
6960580	6964260	Katamari Damachi, one of the all-time classics, in my opinion.
6965620	6969220	And the album, by the way, I do have to make a comment about the music.
6969220	6971220	The music is highly eclectic.
6971220	6978500	I mean, we have a combination of like lounge jazz to easy listening stuff to kind of poppy tunes,
6978500	6983540	but the album was put out as Katamari Fortissimo Damachi.
6983540	6986980	So definitely worth listening to.
6986980	6987780	It's a very good album.
6987780	6990740	Yeah, the music is almost what makes the game for a lot of people, I think.
6990740	6991700	It's so, so funny.
6991700	6997860	I still have three of the tracks in my car that I drive around to.
6997860	6998360	Nice.
6999220	7000820	But don't use your car to roll things up.
7000820	7001780	It doesn't work like that.
7001780	7002500	It doesn't work like that.
7002500	7004020	No, I just roll over people.
7004020	7004900	I'm kidding.
7004900	7005540	All right.
7005540	7006420	Well, Dark Soccer...
7007300	7007860	Oh, go ahead.
7008980	7012020	Don't forget, this gave us No B No B Boy, which no one still gets.
7012820	7014500	I don't think anyone does get that game to this day.
7014500	7015380	Do they still sell that one?
7015380	7016900	I thought they did listed that one too.
7016900	7017460	Maybe I'm wrong.
7018740	7023540	Well, it had a physical release, but I've been playing it on iOS randomly
7023540	7026420	and posting up how close Boy and Girl are to meeting.
7027300	7029380	I wonder if Boy and Girl has met yet.
7029380	7032020	I wonder if he's ever going to make another game.
7032020	7034500	I know he kind of left to go make playgrounds and stuff,
7034500	7036740	but I'm curious to see if he ever comes back to gaming.
7036740	7037460	It'll be pretty cool.
7038500	7039700	We'll have to find out.
7039700	7043860	Dark Soccer, we will not be here next week because you and I are going to go to GX,
7043860	7046900	and I believe you are planning to participate in the cosplay pageant.
7046900	7048980	That's going to happen at the time the show is on.
7050100	7051060	I am.
7051060	7053860	So we will not be back until late Sunday, and it's all your fault.
7053860	7054900	No, I'm kidding.
7054900	7060020	We're going to have a lot of fun, and I'm very excited to see a lot of people there at the con.
7060020	7064580	So you can come by and meet Jamie and I at the table, assuming that one of us...
7064580	7067300	Because Jamie is going to have to hold down the fort when there's a panel I want to see,
7067300	7070020	and vice versa, and luckily we have Alan to help with some of that too.
7071620	7074420	But come by and meet us, and it'll be a lot of fun.
7074420	7077940	So Jamie, we will see you in studio again here in two weeks.
7079380	7080020	Indeed.
7080020	7081220	And have a happy Hanukkah.
7081220	7082660	I know today was first day, so...
7084100	7084820	Yep.
7084820	7089700	So yeah, and I wish everybody else happy Hanukkah through celebrating.
7089700	7094420	And for the folks at GamerX, I'm trying to get my hands on LEDs now because
7094980	7097780	we need to have candle lighting because I can't be the only Jew there.
7098500	7103060	Yeah, so you may be leading the Jews in a Hanukkah celebration at GX.
7103060	7103780	I think that's great.
7105060	7106580	Yeah, it'll be fabulous.
7106580	7107220	All right.
7107220	7107460	All right.
7107460	7110660	Well, Dark Sakura, we'll talk to you in a couple weeks, but I will see you very soon.
7111780	7112580	See you soon.
7112580	7113140	See you.
7113140	7113700	All right.
7113700	7114500	Bye, dear.
7114500	7114900	Rest up.
7114900	7115540	Bye.
7115540	7115780	Bye.
7116660	7117140	All right.
7117140	7122820	Dark Sakura, not here in studio tonight, but still able to deliver one of her classic
7122820	7124420	segments there, the classic game of the week.
7124420	7126980	And one of those games, again, she says it and it's like,
7126980	7128660	how has that not been a classic game yet?
7128660	7131060	But 11 years old.
7131060	7132420	I have great memories of Katamari.
7133220	7135300	Shane, big fan of Katamari Damacy.
7135300	7136420	The first two games.
7136420	7140260	I think it really lost its charm and steam after that second one.
7140260	7144500	You know why it did is because the games that came after it were all kind of like,
7144500	7146180	just biting off those first two games.
7146180	7147220	It was like compilation games.
7147220	7149220	Yeah, it was like, yeah, of like two games.
7149220	7151140	So I think that's kind of where they went wrong with it.
7151140	7154980	And I thought, wasn't there like a trademark for a new Katamari game recently?
7154980	7157860	Let us pray because I think it would be great to read that up while you're talking.
7157860	7160740	Wouldn't that be hilarious if that was in VR?
7160740	7162340	Cause that's something, I don't know.
7162340	7165460	I'd probably get motion sick though playing something like that, but who knows?
7165460	7166420	We'll see what's coming.
7166420	7169620	Anyway, actually, Shane, though, I do want to say we are going to break here and take
7169620	7172420	a break before we come back for Orange Falls Radio part B, but you're actually going to
7172420	7174420	take off because you haven't been home yet.
7174420	7174980	You came.
7174980	7176180	No, I came straight over.
7176180	7177540	You came straight over PlayStation experience.
7177540	7178660	Well, thank you for stopping by.
7178660	7182900	Tap Mike Katamari was a new trademark by Namco Bandai about a week ago.
7182900	7184500	That sounds like another phone game though.
7184500	7185220	Yeah, it sure does.
7185220	7187060	I don't know about that.
7187700	7190820	Maybe Wii U, I can dream.
7190820	7191780	I don't know.
7191780	7192580	NX, maybe?
7192580	7192980	Who knows?
7192980	7193140	All right.
7194260	7195060	Shane, anything else?
7195060	7195780	Thank you very much.
7195780	7199940	You did a great job explaining the VR stuff and we all appreciated your enthusiasm and
7199940	7200260	I agree.
7200260	7202900	Sony should probably just hire you as a salesperson at this point.
7202900	7208260	But anything you want to add to that before we let you go?
7209140	7209700	Not really.
7209700	7213540	I think everybody should try to go next year if you can, if it's feasible.
7213540	7216260	Do you think Microsoft and Nintendo should do something similar?
7216340	7220100	It's hard to say because we were actually talking about this earlier today.
7220100	7222900	Microsoft I think could try to pull it off.
7222900	7228580	I don't think it would have the same excitement because whether you like to admit it or not,
7228580	7234500	they're still like the groups or the types of people associated with each product and
7234500	7237300	PlayStation has become the more eclectic group.
7237300	7238740	So there's lots of stuff for everybody.
7238740	7243380	But Microsoft, if they had one, I think it'd be mostly shooters because they can't seem
7243380	7244900	to show off anything else.
7244900	7249860	I think if they talk about anything else, I think if they did one maybe between E3 and
7249860	7253860	now, I think that would have been a great time for them to show those exclusive games.
7253860	7257940	Like they could have probably done a show around Rise of the Tomb Raider, you know,
7258900	7263140	all the things that came out this holiday that were exclusive to them.
7263140	7264500	And maybe they could have had a pretty.
7264500	7266820	So I don't know if I would like count them out completely.
7266820	7270420	Well, you'd also have to get the indie support, which I don't think Microsoft really has.
7270420	7272500	I think they have more than you think they have more than you think.
7272740	7274420	Keep in mind, like Ori and the Blind Forest.
7276020	7277460	That's also on PC.
7278180	7278740	It is.
7278740	7280740	And that's going to happen a lot with Microsoft, though.
7280740	7284500	But anyway, you would never be able to get tickets to it.
7284500	7290900	Well, not only that, but I feel like it would be the one that would get the most hype,
7291780	7294980	but would be ultimately the one that would let the most people down
7295620	7300980	because Nintendo is so guarded with their stuff that I don't feel like you would get
7300980	7302660	a great experience out of it.
7303700	7307780	I don't think they would showcase as much new stuff as the other two would.
7308580	7312660	I think they would be more resting on these are the games that you can play right now.
7314100	7317540	Or these are our titles that are really popular versus these are coming out.
7317540	7318660	This is something we just announced.
7318660	7319780	Go crazy over it.
7320580	7321700	That's how I feel about that.
7321700	7322180	All right.
7322180	7327460	Enact.F in chat at live.vognetwork.com points out Nintendo has their directs too.
7327460	7331380	Although with the Universal Studios Park deal, you could have one.
7331380	7335860	So that's an interesting concept that Nintendo may have like a year round type of thing.
7335860	7339540	They do holiday tours through malls showing off their stuff.
7339540	7342980	And from what I hear, this year's is kind of lackluster.
7342980	7346820	And that's kind of also shaping my opinion of if Nintendo did one.
7346820	7354660	I just think it would not be to the scale as Sony's was this year or what Microsoft
7354660	7355940	could potentially do.
7355940	7356340	Right.
7356340	7360500	And Sony is going to have to do something similar with that VR.
7360500	7362660	They're going to have to put it out there for people to try.
7362660	7366980	Yes, because even though I knew I'd like it, I was still hesitant.
7366980	7369300	I was like, that thing is kind of clunky.
7369300	7372580	Look, it actually feels really good on your head, but it looks clunky.
7372580	7376340	I don't see why I'd really want one with playing those two games.
7376340	7380420	I definitely want one as long as the price isn't crazy.
7380980	7381700	All right.
7381700	7382900	Well, Shane, thank you for being here.
7383460	7385140	You're always here once a month or so.
7385220	7386740	So I'm sure we'll see you again.
7386740	7391700	So maybe we can have another argument about XCX once we've spent more time with it.
7391700	7395380	Or maybe I'll come around or maybe you'll get the frustrations I have.
7395380	7395780	We'll see.
7395780	7396180	We'll see.
7396180	7397460	We'll find out tonight, probably.
7397460	7400660	We'll find out and we'll let you guys know in two weeks when OLR is back.
7400660	7401700	So, okay.
7401700	7405700	But actually, OLR was just going to take a quick break and we'll be back.
7405700	7409060	We still have part B of the show to come because we still have some more news to get into.
7409060	7412740	The FUGA question of the week, the mailbag, which I think we have like four emails tonight.
7412740	7417060	And we're going to talk about whatever you guys want with your phone calls.
7417060	7420900	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
7420900	7424100	Sadly, Shane won't be here, so you can't ask him about the show.
7424100	7424580	Although, I don't know.
7424580	7425540	You're going to listen to your car or whatever.
7425540	7426980	You can still ask.
7426980	7428740	I just won't answer because I won't be here.
7429300	7430260	Just pretend I'm here.
7430260	7431300	Still ask your question.
7431300	7432820	Sometimes Shane listens and then he'll text me.
7432820	7434500	Well, it's usually if I have to correct you on something.
7434500	7435380	Yeah, exactly.
7435380	7437300	So if I mess something up, I'll get a text message.
7437300	7438820	We'll see if I'm listening tonight.
7438820	7440980	I got to drive and do a couple of things.
7440980	7441460	Gotcha.
7441460	7441780	All right.
7441780	7442180	Fair enough.
7442180	7444580	I have to go pick up amiibo that we have ordered.
7444580	7445060	Yeah.
7445060	7446500	Where's my modern Mario?
7446500	7447620	I came right over here.
7447620	7448260	No, I understand.
7448260	7448740	I understand.
7448740	7449780	All right, let's do it.
7449780	7450420	We're going to go to break.
7450420	7453620	We will be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, everybody, right after this.
7460980	7464580	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
7464580	7468820	Live tonight on December the 6th of 2015.
7468820	7471540	Yes, we are in December, the end of the years in sight.
7471540	7475940	Episode number 623 of our show already in progress.
7476580	7478660	Shane was here for the first half of the show,
7478660	7480820	had an extended chat about the PlayStation experience.
7480820	7482500	He had a lot to say about the VR.
7482500	7485780	We talked a little bit about that and also letting you guys know
7485780	7487540	we're not going to be here next week again.
7487540	7490740	And I know that's three missed shows in the span of about six weeks.
7490740	7493860	We apologize, but life sucks sometimes.
7493860	7495380	That's really the easiest I can put it.
7495380	7500180	Although, this coming weekend is really not a bad reason at all.
7500180	7502900	We love conventions, and GX is going to be a fun one.
7502900	7505540	And hoping that we'll get to meet some of you guys there.
7505540	7507300	And hey, at least there's going to be the panel.
7507300	7510740	And they don't live stream the panels, but they will put it up on YouTube.
7510740	7515620	You can actually see if you search for podcast space X space zone.
7515620	7518260	I know the one we did last year comes right up.
7518260	7521860	I don't remember about the one with the first year when Fox Van Allen moderated.
7522580	7525060	But I think that's out there on YouTube somewhere as well.
7525140	7527940	So you can check those out, some of our podcasting talks.
7527940	7531380	We're going to have a third one coming up at GX this weekend,
7531380	7532500	which is almost sold out.
7532500	7536180	So if you are going to plan on buying your ticket on site,
7536180	7537860	I really would encourage you not to do that
7537860	7539780	because there's not going to be a lot left, it sounds like.
7539780	7541220	So get that in advance.
7541220	7545300	They were down to like 200, I think, last I looked.
7545300	7546900	So they're starting to run out.
7546900	7549540	Anyway, we got some rapid-fire news coming at you.
7549540	7553140	And we're going to get into your calls in a little while at 1877 Game O-L-R.
7553140	7554900	We're using them on Skype, Orange, Orange Radio.
7554980	7557860	Real quick though, I have to say this before we get into rapid-fire news.
7559060	7562820	I need to say something about this because it's crucially important.
7563540	7568100	I want to take a moment here to tip our proverbial hat here at Orange Lounge Radio
7568980	7575700	to some good friends of mine that I've been podcasting with for a very, very, very long,
7575700	7576340	long time.
7577060	7584180	Travis Donovan and Jessica Harper finally ended the long-running under sedation live
7584820	7589380	last night was actually the last show and I was honored they asked me to be on it.
7589380	7593140	I was hoping I'd get a phone call and at the end to say something silly,
7593140	7598660	but they let me on the show to really razz Travis as he deserved for the time.
7598660	7601460	And yeah, under station live here.
7601460	7605540	Saturday is on the network for the past few years since we've been doing VOG.
7605540	7609300	Under station live on the air since 2001.
7609300	7613860	Under station live was actually a show I was doing before Orange Lounge Radio.
7614660	7618660	In some ways, Orange Lounge Radio was actually a spin-off of under station live.
7618660	7622660	I mean, I kind of say that just because I was on them both and Jamie was a very frequent
7622660	7624500	guest host over on under station live.
7625300	7627300	And then we kind of went and did this thing.
7627300	7631460	Under station live started around the Rocky or a picture show community, which you guys
7631460	7632340	know I've been involved with.
7632340	7633860	I've talked about it here on this show.
7633860	7638020	And then, you know, we kind of had the idea with our soccer myself.
7638020	7641780	Hey, let's do something about music games.
7641780	7645140	You know, DDR and Beatmania and all the stuff we were playing at the time.
7645140	7648820	And then that kind of evolved into where we're at now, where we talk about all video games
7648820	7650020	and more of a gaming show.
7650020	7653540	And then, of course, Loki, who we also met playing DDR, came along for the ride.
7653540	7655140	You never did under station live, though, huh?
7655140	7658340	That was a little I think Travis moved before we knew you.
7658340	7661380	So there's really no opportunity there for you to be on that show.
7661380	7662580	But it did finally end.
7663220	7667860	So Travis Donovan is retiring and he's not really feeling it if he's going to come back
7667860	7669060	anytime soon.
7669060	7671540	But I'm hoping for some movie specials.
7671540	7673060	I was joking with him last night.
7673060	7676740	You know, when Murder, She Wrote went off the air, they still did like three TV movies.
7677380	7679140	And I think Matlock did the same thing.
7679140	7680500	So we'll see.
7680500	7681220	We'll see what happens.
7681220	7685860	But thanks, Travis, for showing me that any idiot can podcast.
7686980	7688820	I gave him the same line last night, but it's true.
7689860	7693700	You know, he really opened the door and showed me that you can set up this internet broadcasting
7693700	7694820	thing in your house.
7694820	7698500	And it kind of enabled what we ended up with here at Orange Lounge Radio.
7698500	7703060	So this show would not exist, certainly in the same way it does now if it weren't for
7703060	7703620	Travis.
7703620	7708980	And Jessica, big thanks to you as well for being a co-host those first few years with
7708980	7711940	me and keeping Travis's ass in check these last few years.
7711940	7712740	I really appreciate that.
7713380	7713700	All right.
7713700	7716820	Anyhow, let's get back into some rapid fire news.
7716820	7721700	Loki, I think your mic is muted, Loki.
7721700	7726900	I want to make sure your mic is not because I unmuted the wrong thing.
7726900	7727940	Sorry about that, Loki.
7727940	7728340	Go ahead.
7729700	7732420	I unmuted Shane's mic, not your mic, and he's not even here.
7732420	7732900	Sorry about that.
7733780	7738420	Anyways, I was gonna say Rock Band is hard enough in my opinion, but hey, if you want
7738420	7742020	it even harder, they're gonna be putting out this brand new mode.
7742660	7747220	It is, I guess, like a brutal mode.
7747220	7753940	And what brutal is, is it's basically the expert difficulty, but the notes disappear
7753940	7757860	as they come towards the spot where you actually have to strum to hit them.
7758740	7761060	So it's like, was it hidden?
7762100	7763380	Yeah, hidden in DDR.
7763940	7766900	So that'll be coming out soon in an update.
7767940	7769620	I guess it's on December 8th.
7769620	7770340	So look for that.
7771220	7774500	Amplitude will be coming to PlayStation 4 soon as well.
7774500	7778100	It's gonna be hitting on January 5th for $19.99.
7778100	7781940	It's gonna include 30 songs, a single player campaign, and multiplayer.
7781940	7786420	And the track list looks pretty nice, so I may have to pick that up.
7787780	7790660	And then Tony Hawk 5, or Pro Skater 5.
7792180	7798420	Not a great game when it came out, and hopefully this will help fix some of the problems.
7798420	7802420	But they have a massive patch that's gonna be adding content to the game and fixing a
7802420	7804420	lot of the bugs that were in the game as well.
7804980	7809300	They're including some new levels, including Underground and Wild West.
7809300	7813700	Some new character campaigns, I guess Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
7815460	7816820	Tyler the Creator as well.
7817460	7822980	And hopefully fixing some of the bugs that were in the game, because it was pretty buggy.
7824100	7825460	So, we'll see.
7826740	7828580	All right, my turn.
7829860	7831700	Let's get to Super Mario Maker.
7831700	7835140	Some updates on that game, which is a game that I find I'm really addicted to watching
7835140	7836900	people stream that on Twitch, I gotta say.
7837860	7842180	Shane is always telling me about how he watches all these people playing games on Twitch.
7842180	7846420	And then I kind of started just getting into watching random people play Super Mario Maker.
7846420	7848100	So, that's kind of fun.
7848100	7850660	But anyway, Super Mario Maker, some updates coming to that game.
7851140	7856260	There is a new course based on the NES Remix series that's available in Super Mario Maker.
7856260	7860980	And when you beat it, you will unlock the Frog Suit from Mario Brothers 3, which is
7860980	7861620	pretty cool.
7861620	7866420	But keep in mind, it's a costume for 8-bit Mario Brothers.
7866500	7871060	It doesn't actually provide the functionality, nor can you use it in the Super Mario Brothers
7871060	7871780	3 stages.
7871780	7872500	That is lame.
7872500	7876500	Now, I think Nintendo kind of realized the game was missing it, and there's been a lot
7876500	7877300	of fan feedback.
7877300	7880420	So, I think this is them kind of like at least throwing a bone to that whole thing.
7881140	7883140	Maybe doing whatever they can with that.
7883140	7883540	Who knows?
7883540	7886980	Maybe there'll be a better patch or something later on.
7886980	7889220	After all, they did add checkpoints to the game.
7889220	7890500	They haven't had DLC yet.
7890500	7896660	Not official DLC, but they have had these extra costumes through special levels you
7896660	7897460	can play online.
7897460	7899860	So, that's something.
7900420	7902580	The level, by the way, is apparently really easy.
7902580	7905380	So, you can unlock that costume no problem.
7906500	7910980	Yacht Club Games talking about DLC and amiibo functionality.
7910980	7915540	Because, you know, the Shovel Knight amiibo I think finally got dated for early January.
7915540	7918020	So, there's also some DLC going to be coming for that.
7918980	7924420	But, they are talking about new relics, equipment, the ability to customize Shovel Knight's
7924420	7928260	look, challenge stages, and of course on Wii U there's going to be two-player co-op,
7928260	7929620	which I think will be very exciting.
7930580	7937700	Now, I guess somebody suggested that they should add Tingle as a character to the game.
7937700	7942020	Since, you know, there's a Nintendo tie-in, and what an appropriate character for Shovel
7942020	7942740	Knight, right?
7942740	7947940	To which they replied, we don't have any plans for more Nintendo-specific DLC content.
7947940	7950260	But, we'd love to do something with Tingle.
7950260	7951140	He's the best.
7952260	7953460	That is accurate.
7953460	7954260	He is the best.
7955140	7957540	Loki is available, by the way, for your voiceover needs.
7958260	7960740	Just go play Flappy Vog if you want to get a preview.
7960740	7962820	Yeah, don't.
7964820	7966980	Last but not least, Retro City Rampage.
7966980	7969540	Maybe this is a game more suited to your talents, Loki.
7969540	7972900	Retro City Rampage going to be getting a sequel.
7972900	7977220	And, if you ever played Retro City Rampage, you know, it's kind of an 8-bit looking game.
7977220	7979860	So, of course, the sequel, it's a 16-bit looking game.
7980580	7986980	Shakedown Hawaii is the same character that was in Retro City Rampage named Player.
7986980	7991140	And it's going to be taking place 30 years after the events of Retro City Rampage.
7992020	7992900	There you go.
7992900	7997460	We know that Shakedown Hawaii will be coming out for Nintendo, PlayStation, and Steam.
7997460	8000820	But, we don't know if there's anything extra beyond that at this point.
8000820	8006100	But, if Retro City Rampage is any indication, it'll probably be everywhere.
8007300	8010740	All right, let's get to the foogle question of the week.
8010740	8014900	You take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam those together, you get foogle.
8016820	8018420	That is not the right song.
8020020	8020980	That's awkward.
8022260	8023620	Let's try that again.
8023620	8027620	You take Facebook and Google and you throw them together and you get foogle.
8027620	8036420	Much better.
8036420	8037700	That's the song I was looking for.
8037700	8039700	Why do I even have that other song in the playlist?
8039700	8041620	Do we have a segment that uses that song?
8041620	8042100	Which song?
8042820	8043700	Santa Milette?
8043700	8045540	I don't think we never heard that.
8045540	8047140	Maybe we did at one point and I forgot.
8047140	8047540	I don't know.
8048500	8052100	It's been a long decade plus of our own here at O.L.R.
8052100	8054980	When did we do that for Ask Orange Lounge?
8054980	8057380	No, that's the Keyboard Mania song.
8057780	8060820	It's the Keyboard Mania song, but I don't know if we did other things.
8060820	8061540	I don't know.
8061540	8062900	I have weird stuff in the playlist.
8062900	8064580	Anyway, I was asked to ask Tetsuya.
8064580	8066340	He knows more about the show than I do.
8066340	8069140	All right, so let's get to tonight's question.
8069780	8073140	This weekend, of course, is the PlayStation experience and more information was detailed
8073140	8077460	on the PlayStation VR, including some game announcements like Res Infinite.
8077460	8082580	Now that we're getting details on the games, how excited are you for PlayStation VR?
8082580	8084660	Is it something you plan to purchase?
8084660	8088260	Although admittedly, we don't know a price, but you're probably still forming some opinions.
8088900	8089940	Why or why not?
8089940	8094980	So we get to Andy R who says, I'm currently leaning towards getting PlayStation VR.
8094980	8100100	I tried it at PSX last year and I liked the tech, but wasn't as impressed by the games
8100100	8101300	or lack thereof.
8101300	8106820	Playing Rigs at E3 and now seeing the several game announcements at PSX, I'm more convinced
8106820	8111060	that Sony is making an effort to support it and devs are working on stuff I'll actually
8111060	8112020	want to play.
8112020	8115380	Price will obviously be the biggest hurdle for me, so I hope they give us news on that
8115380	8116180	front soon.
8117220	8120980	Fabrice A on Facebook says, I'll wait for a while.
8120980	8125300	I'm afraid virtual reality will be a fad, just like 3D televisions were.
8125300	8128020	The bulky goggles don't really help and it's expensive.
8128020	8132180	Much like the Kinect, it's great technology with great potential, but I'm not convinced
8132180	8132500	yet.
8133060	8136100	SSG100Matt says, I'm still in a wait and see pattern.
8136100	8140580	While I am a VR believer, I do think it will take some time for Sony and its partners to
8140580	8143300	get a handle on the VR before it's optimal.
8143300	8148900	Sadly, unless there is that must-have AAA title that Sony is hiding, I foresee consumers
8148900	8150180	holding off as well.
8150180	8154500	It's going to be a slow going and I'm sure initially for VR, but Sony needs to ride it
8154500	8155380	out and support it.
8156020	8167300	Degenerate Johnny says, I'm going to wait and see before I decide on Sony's VR system.
8167300	8171700	Past disappointing gaming experiences have led me to wait, think, and look before leaping
8171700	8173380	instead of taking leaps of faith.
8173380	8175460	It all depends on how the market looks at VR.
8175460	8179620	From what I'm seeing, it seems like this whole VR craze is a little too niche for comfort.
8179620	8182340	Of course, that can change if it has enough support from developers.
8183620	8188100	Rettertainment says, VR headsets strike me as the kind of thing I want to try for myself
8188100	8189220	before I buy it.
8189220	8192980	That's why I hope there's a HoloLens demo display set up at the Microsoft store or one
8192980	8194100	of the balls near me.
8194100	8197940	That way I can try it out, see how I like it, and hit up the Sbarro's for some pizza
8197940	8199220	while I think things over.
8199220	8199860	That's a plan.
8200500	8203380	As far as the PlayStation VR, I don't think there's a Sony store near me.
8203380	8204900	Maybe Best Buy can pick up the slack.
8205780	8208900	Yeah, you never know who they might partner with or they may just take the show on the
8208900	8209140	road.
8209140	8211140	They may get a truck out there to some malls near you.
8211140	8211780	Who knows?
8211780	8213460	Hopefully they have Sbarro's for entertainment.
8214340	8218660	Jordan T says, I'm very excited for VR but nervous about how it will be embraced.
8218660	8222820	One problem I think Sony may face is that by creating certain games only for VR, they
8222900	8224900	divide their potential customer base.
8224900	8229140	Well, the good news is, I'll say this, Jordan, Res, for example, and I think that 100-foot
8229140	8231460	robot game, they are meant for both.
8232100	8234740	So take that for what it is.
8234740	8239060	Anyway, I'm hoping this will lead to third-party companies that develop VR experiences that
8239060	8244820	can be ported to the many VR platforms because the alternative will be a future of VR-compatible
8244820	8248660	games, which will essentially just replace the right joystick with head movement and
8248660	8252740	add slight advantages like freedom of hand movement and driving and cockpit games and
8252740	8253300	so forth.
8254260	8259460	Hitstun says, looks like another Blu-ray versus HD DVD war coming on.
8259460	8265460	I'll wait for one VR technology to emerge as the standard on PC and buy that one.
8265460	8267620	The games might be worth it by them.
8267620	8274020	You know, Hitstun, I respect that opinion, but I just don't see that happening with Oculus
8274020	8276820	versus PlayStation VR.
8276820	8281220	Maybe with all the other stuff, but I really feel like the way Facebook is approaching
8281220	8281700	Oculus.
8281700	8284020	Okay, have you seen this on Facebook feeds yet?
8284660	8289220	That there's those 3D videos where you can move your phone around and you get the 3D,
8289220	8290820	like that's starting to show up on my feed.
8290820	8292420	Have you ever seen that come through on Facebook?
8292420	8292820	No.
8292820	8293700	Because I have.
8293700	8298420	And when I first saw that, I said, you know what this is?
8298420	8300980	This is the doorway into what's going to happen with Oculus.
8300980	8307780	So I kind of feel like Oculus is going to really have the support of events, you know,
8307780	8308580	concerts.
8308580	8310580	And not to say it's not going to have games.
8310580	8312020	But how do I take those photos?
8312020	8313540	Of course it's going to fucking have games.
8315700	8316900	However, they're doing it now.
8316900	8320740	They taped that Paul McCartney concert in the Cirque du Soleil thing I saw somehow.
8320740	8322660	I think there's specialized cameras that do it.
8322660	8325700	But anyway, I'm not saying that's the only thing Oculus is going to have, but that's
8325700	8327540	something that will differentiate it.
8327540	8331780	Whereas PlayStation VR, you know, being a dedicated gaming thing, it's going to have
8331780	8334100	a, one, it's going to have the baseline specs.
8334100	8337780	So you don't have to worry about, you know, will my computer run it or will it not be
8337780	8339140	good enough and all that stuff.
8339140	8344740	But also the whole fact, like when Shane was describing the games where you saw one thing
8344740	8348340	on VR and you saw another thing on the TV and that led to some co-op experiences, I
8348340	8350340	don't think that's something that's planned for Oculus.
8350900	8353540	So I do see some differences between them.
8354500	8360740	But to be fair, to hit Stunt's point, I do totally see the point where it's going to
8360740	8366660	be a very hard sell to convince somebody they need to spend $400 for an Oculus and who knows
8366660	8370180	$400 or whatever it ends up being for a PlayStation VR.
8370180	8374100	So by that nature, yes, there's probably going to be a little competition because most
8374100	8376900	people aren't going to be able to break it down the way I just did, where there are some
8376900	8377620	differences.
8377620	8379620	The average consumer, if that makes sense.
8379620	8380980	It's going to be VR is VR.
8381540	8384500	So with respect to that, I totally get your point hits done.
8385860	8386260	All right.
8387460	8392660	Let's go over to me coughing and then we'll go over to Google Plus and read some of the
8392660	8394180	answers over there.
8394180	8398660	Actually, Tigerclaw in chat over at live.vognetware.com says you mean the YouTube videos.
8398660	8402420	YouTube had that 360 Warcraft video and they had one for The Force Awakens recently.
8403460	8408820	Actually, maybe it's the same thing, but I swear it was on my Facebook feed and it wasn't
8408820	8409380	a YouTube.
8410180	8411220	It was A Force Awakens.
8411220	8412500	It was like a pod race or something.
8412500	8414500	You can actually like look around.
8414500	8420420	So I was like, I'm pretty sure that was something that's going to be coming for Oculus.
8420420	8423940	And by the way, chatters to the rescue.
8424900	8429300	Some folks in chat saying the song that I misplayed used to be what I would play when
8429300	8433940	I read tweets more regularly, which by the way, I never really eliminated tweets.
8433940	8437540	It's just that I still read them all the time.
8437540	8441380	I just don't necessarily do them all on the show just because we have all these other
8441380	8446100	segments like reading the answers on Google Plus, of which there's one from ActDeft who
8446100	8451540	says the moment they showed Rez in there and for PlayStation VR, they pretty much sold
8451540	8452180	it for me.
8452180	8452980	I need it.
8453860	8459460	And I'm sure when ActDeft heard Shane's review earlier tonight, that probably just cemented
8459460	8460500	it for what it's worth.
8461140	8461460	All right.
8461460	8461940	So there you go.
8461940	8464340	The FUGL question of the week.
8464340	8466740	Have you made any decision on PlayStation VR yet, Loki?
8467540	8469300	No, I have to see how much of it is.
8469300	8470900	Yeah, price is going to be a big deal.
8470900	8471940	And what games are for it.
8471940	8474580	I mean, I like Rez and everything, but I'm not buying it just for Rez.
8474580	8481220	And again, back to the whole HD DVD and Blu-ray war, even though I do definitely see the
8481220	8486420	differences in the two VR, I do feel like I have to choose which one I want.
8486420	8492020	I do feel like I'm going to end up getting one of them and I'm kind of leaning towards
8492020	8497300	PlayStation VR at the moment simply because I am more of a gamer.
8497300	8499140	But I do need to see what those games look like.
8500020	8502180	And I don't really want to...
8502180	8505300	I feel weird counting Oculus out because I don't think I should do that.
8505300	8507700	So we'll see what happens in the coming months.
8508340	8510100	2016 is going to be a very interesting year.
8510660	8511700	Very interesting year.
8511700	8513220	Let's get back to some news, Loki.
8513860	8514740	All right.
8514740	8517940	So Sony has revealed that they're going to be putting...
8517940	8521540	Hey, you were looking to play some PlayStation 2 titles on your PlayStation 4.
8521540	8523460	Well, hey, we've got those coming for you.
8524020	8526340	Although it's not exactly how you might think it would be.
8527380	8531700	Instead of being able to play your old games that you may have on disk or purchased as
8531700	8536100	PS2 classics on your PlayStation 3, you get to buy them again.
8537220	8540260	And they're going to be putting them out on PlayStation 4.
8540260	8543060	They're going to be adding some support for trophies.
8543780	8546740	Also, the games have been up-rendered to 1080p.
8547620	8552420	And they have share play, remote play, live broadcasts, activity feeds, all that fun stuff.
8553060	8557700	And second screen support for manuals on Vita or on the PlayStation app.
8558420	8565460	And they're going to be priced between at least the first ones that came out, $9.99 and $14.99.
8566900	8572020	I was really surprised this ended up being like a footnote at PlayStation's conference.
8572020	8572500	They didn't...
8572500	8575140	I think it's a terrible way to do it.
8575140	8576100	Yeah, you're not a fan?
8576100	8576740	Not a fan at all.
8576740	8578340	Even with three Grand Theft Auto games?
8578340	8580420	I don't even give a shit because you know why?
8580420	8582660	Because I'm not buying those games again.
8583460	8585380	I have Grand Theft Auto on disk.
8585380	8590100	And the fact that Microsoft is able to pull it off where they can play their games and everything.
8590660	8592100	Fuck, you can play...
8592100	8594180	I mean, I'm not talking necessarily PlayStation 2,
8594180	8596420	but like PlayStation 1 games, you can play those on a PSP.
8597780	8600100	Why the hell do we not have emulation to support this yet?
8600100	8601940	And why do I have to rebuy these stupid games?
8601940	8603540	I understand that they're adding the functionality.
8603540	8606180	Devil's advocate, they are adding some new things.
8606180	8606900	Okay, okay.
8607780	8609620	I don't need the fucking trophy support.
8609620	8611380	And let's put it this way.
8611380	8615940	I mean, the streaming and everything, that's just what you do on your system.
8615940	8618660	I don't see why that's something that needs to be added.
8618660	8620500	And they have streaming support on the Xbox.
8621140	8623060	So I don't get it.
8624100	8625700	Like, how about giving me the option?
8625700	8626580	How about, hey...
8626580	8629540	Well, of course it's not gonna give you the option because then you're gonna, you know,
8629540	8631060	just pick the ones you already have.
8631060	8634740	But like, I bought, you know, Twisted Mail Black already for like five bucks.
8634740	8638820	I've got that in my library, but I can't play it until I buy it again.
8638900	8641620	And let's be honest, I even watched like the videos that they had.
8641620	8644580	It doesn't look that much better up res to 1080p.
8645220	8647780	And maybe that's why ultimately this ended up being a footnote.
8647780	8651060	Because maybe this is something that was planned for a while,
8651060	8653220	but then when Microsoft came out with their thing,
8653220	8655620	maybe PlayStation is having to re-evaluate their strategy,
8655620	8658980	or they're just gonna stick to the whole, you know, we don't think people really want it.
8658980	8662580	So they're kind of putting out maybe whatever they finished and gotten the rights for.
8662580	8666820	But maybe this is just gonna be something that there's only ever a handful of them that show up.
8666820	8672020	I guess sales will dictate a large part of that, but I have to admit,
8672020	8676580	I mean, I'm not really super impressed with the launch lineup.
8677380	8678100	I mean, I get it.
8678100	8679700	Grand Theft Auto is obviously a huge-
8679700	8684580	Same dress is a great game, but like, I just, it doesn't, I'm sorry.
8684580	8689540	It's not, it, it doesn't, it shows its age.
8689540	8690340	Let's put it that way.
8690340	8693300	And upresing at the 1080p does not help.
8693300	8696020	Like, a perfect example would be Final Fantasy 7.
8696020	8699940	Okay, I bought Final Fantasy 7, the PC version for Steam.
8701300	8706580	And yeah, everything's upresed, but it looks like shit, you know, upresed.
8706580	8711300	It's not like, oh hey, you know, the models look better and everything, you know,
8711300	8714260	they redid it, kind of like, you know, those HD collections and stuff.
8715060	8716180	It looks like crap.
8716180	8717460	Like, and that's cool.
8717460	8720100	If you want to do like the HD remakes or whatever,
8720100	8724100	or HD-ified versions of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,
8724100	8727540	where it looks better, and hey, let's add some multiplayer into that,
8727540	8728580	would be nice.
8728580	8732820	Or hell, if you want to do like, you know, the Grand Theft Auto PSP games,
8732820	8735540	upres that a little bit and add the multiplayer,
8735540	8738580	because it did have multiplayer originally, just local multiplayer,
8738580	8741460	but make it, you know, available for everybody.
8742580	8743220	That would be cool.
8743220	8747860	I'd purchase those again, but I'm not going to buy Twisted Metal Black again
8748500	8749780	to play it on PlayStation 4.
8749780	8751060	I'll play it on PlayStation 3.
8751060	8754100	Fair enough.
8754100	8756820	I guess they do have to convince people to part with that sum of money.
8756820	8760500	I wonder if these games aren't going to end up being PlayStation Plus giveaways
8760500	8761220	in the near future.
8761220	8762180	Hey, that's cool.
8762180	8764740	I kind of feel like they're sandbagging for that.
8764740	8766820	If they want to do that, then that's fine.
8766820	8767700	I'll accept that.
8767700	8770260	I'll play Twisted Metal Black when it comes out free.
8770260	8773300	So maybe a positive note to end on there.
8773300	8773800	Who knows?
8774260	8774760	All right.
8775460	8779460	Hey, so VR is going to really rely on the games that come out for it, right?
8779460	8783540	So getting the third-party publishers on board, pretty important.
8783540	8786900	Or you have some problems, like maybe what the Wii U was going through
8786900	8790420	before it had, you know, a library of Nintendo-created games.
8790420	8792340	But some good news for VR.
8792340	8795540	It looks like EA is looking into this.
8796100	8800900	And that's because DICE has started hiring some engineers and creative folk
8800900	8804100	to bring VR support to the Frostbite engine,
8804820	8807060	which is, you know, EA's engine that they use for.
8807060	8809060	I think that's what's in Dragon Age Origins.
8809460	8813620	And what is going to be for Mass Effect Andromeda is the Mirror's Edge game.
8813620	8814900	Pretty much everything's Frostbite now.
8814900	8819300	When I think of what could go to VR, I think about Mirror's Edge.
8819300	8820180	But then again, that game might be too...
8820180	8821700	Battlefield, Battlefront.
8822660	8827140	I think I want to say that even their sports games are using Frostbite now.
8827140	8828740	Some of those games might be too fast.
8828740	8831060	Like Mirror's Edge might be like a barfy VR game.
8831060	8833220	You know, you'd have to tailor the experience, but you never know.
8834900	8839300	So anyway, technical director Johanna Anderson was asked about this.
8839700	8841940	Said it was a small and collaborative team.
8841940	8843780	So don't expect anything big yet.
8843780	8846180	But maybe this is them testing the waters.
8846180	8850340	Maybe get some pet projects out there after all, as Jamie was saying earlier.
8850340	8854260	Katamari Damacy kind of started as a project out of a school-related thing.
8854260	8856340	So there is that.
8856340	8860900	So anyhow, EA seems to be plotting something.
8860900	8863460	So we'll see what comes of that maybe at E3 this next year.
8864900	8865620	All right, Loki.
8866500	8867000	All right.
8867880	8870840	So apparently Capcom's decided, hey, you know what?
8870840	8873800	We're gonna go ahead and trademark Onomusha.
8873800	8875640	Maybe they're gonna be putting out another game.
8875640	8877720	Or doing like some sort of remaster.
8877720	8882360	Or maybe they're trademarking this so they can release this as a PlayStation 2 title.
8882360	8883640	I mean, I don't know at this point.
8883640	8886920	But all we know that they have trademarked it.
8886920	8887420	It's...
8888840	8889800	I don't know.
8889800	8892040	But I guess they were saying that also...
8892920	8897560	They have the Onomusha Soul, which is a browser game.
8897560	8902600	But they're saying that it was ported to the PlayStation platforms in Japan.
8902600	8904200	So hopefully it's not necessarily that.
8904200	8907560	But hey, that'd be kind of cool if they didn't do a new Onomusha game.
8909800	8913320	I'd like to know kind of what Capcom's up to outside of Street Fighter right now.
8913320	8916760	So that would be pretty cool if Onomusha is what they end up returning with.
8918200	8918760	We'll see.
8918760	8920040	Would you pick up a new Onomusha game?
8920040	8921160	Is that something you'd be interested in?
8922040	8923320	Never a series I got into.
8923320	8923820	Yeah?
8924680	8925180	Fair enough.
8926280	8928200	I don't know if this is a series that might interest you.
8928200	8933640	But you know, we're liking to remake a lot of old PlayStation 3 stuff for the new generation.
8933640	8936520	For PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and of course PC.
8936520	8941720	And it appears that Dead Island could be the next target for that sort of treatment.
8942360	8949160	There's a Dutch retailer that has apparently listed a redo version of Dead Island
8949160	8951720	for 39.99 euro.
8951720	8954280	That's about $40 our currency.
8955400	8957000	No release date or anything.
8957000	8962680	It's published though by Metro redo publisher Deep Silver.
8962680	8968040	So I mean it does kind of all add up that if Metro got one and this is a Deep Silver game too.
8968040	8969400	This could very well happen.
8970040	8974040	I wonder if it would be the first one and Riptide kind of together.
8974040	8976280	And I wonder if they'd fix some of the bugs.
8976280	8979000	Because when I played Dead Island Riptide it was pretty buggy.
8979080	8980600	So we'll see.
8981560	8983160	But that could be interesting.
8983160	8984600	Especially if the price is lower.
8984600	8990120	And again I'm theorizing it could be the first game and the second game.
8990120	8992200	But who knows it may just be the first game.
8992200	8993480	So we'll see.
8994360	8997960	It could look really good visually though if they get it with the 60 frames a second and all that stuff.
8999640	9003080	All right Brad from Pod Culture over at live.vognetwork.com says,
9003080	9006840	I love Dead Island and I'd kill for a Left 4 Dead remake.
9007480	9011800	You know I'd like to see Valve put out something with the number 3 in it.
9011800	9013480	Like Left 4 Dead 3.
9013480	9014840	Or Left 3 Dead for all I care.
9014840	9016840	I would like to see them put out something.
9016840	9019560	Yeah Valve's been so quiet.
9020120	9022040	There's Dota but that's...
9022040	9025000	That was huge but I'd like to see something new.
9026280	9026920	Yeah.
9026920	9027560	Just something.
9027560	9028760	What's going on Valve?
9029480	9031480	Gabe you never call you never write?
9032840	9033640	What's going on?
9034600	9037240	Unless they're planning like something like the orange box where they're just
9037240	9040040	going to drop a whole bunch of shit on us at once which could be...
9040760	9041160	I don't know.
9041880	9043000	It might be overload.
9043560	9044040	We'll see.
9045080	9046760	All right let's get into the mailbag.
9053880	9056840	Every week we invite your emails to our email address.
9056840	9059880	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
9059880	9065800	And usually DarkSakura dives in the mailbag and picks out her favorite emails but tonight
9065800	9066440	it's me.
9067240	9070440	DarkSakura's not here so I'm going to do the emails for you guys.
9070440	9072520	So let's get into it.
9073240	9077720	We have a few emails tonight so I'm going to try to get through these since we're already
9077720	9078920	running along here.
9078920	9083560	But let's get to our first email tonight which is from Sam Shepherd who says,
9083560	9084680	Hello OLR crew.
9084680	9085720	I love the show.
9085720	9088280	Are any of you looking forward to backward compatibility?
9088360	9093000	Would any of you have purchased the Xbox One and or the PlayStation 4 sooner if backwards
9093000	9095000	compatibility was available at launch?
9095000	9098840	What gets me is that in the beginning of this console generation back compatibility was
9098840	9100200	thought to be impossible.
9100200	9105320	Why do you think Microsoft and Sony are all of a sudden able to make back compatibility
9105320	9106840	happen with such ease?
9106840	9107480	Thank you.
9107480	9108680	Love Sam Shepherd.
9110440	9111160	Thank you for the email.
9112600	9113880	Well I don't think they have.
9113880	9115800	I mean they've had their basics.
9115800	9117080	Sony clearly hasn't.
9117080	9119000	Well actually I take that back.
9119000	9123240	I kind of think Sony's plan has always been this PlayStation Now thing.
9123240	9128760	I kind of think that's their thing but so it seems weird that they haven't seen me taking
9128760	9133560	off though it's not having that appeal that like Netflix has like I don't see that as
9133560	9137640	a service like oh my God I need to I'm gonna go on there and like just be blown away about
9137640	9141800	the amount of games that are on there and if they got PS2 and PS1 games in there too
9141800	9143320	which I thought they were supposed to do.
9144120	9149800	So I don't know Sony's Sony's sending a lot of mixed signals on backwards compatibility
9149800	9152360	right now and I think that's why a lot of us are confused.
9152360	9157720	So I don't know I'm not sure I'm understanding what the hell Sony is doing but I always thought
9157720	9161400	as far as the tech was concerned Sony was just going to solve that through the streaming
9161400	9167160	thing but the streaming thing you know where that really shines is SharePlay and that whole
9167160	9171880	thing I mean that that's great because of the streaming so it's kind of funny that I
9171880	9176360	use that way more than I probably would use PlayStation now so kind of interesting.
9177000	9182600	But as far as Xbox One that is interesting how that popped up later and you know your
9182600	9186440	question was why do you think they all of a sudden are able to make it happen with such
9186440	9191640	ease because they put effort into it because Microsoft got clobbered and they needed something
9191640	9195640	to really kind of differentiate themselves from PlayStation and you'll notice that when
9195640	9200360	they sell the backwards compatibility thing they're not afraid to take the dig that
9200360	9205480	oh well your existing Xbox 360 games are playable and you don't have to rebuy them
9205480	9208680	who does that you know that type of things that's where that's Microsoft's whole thing
9208680	9213400	and to their credit I mean good for them I mean seriously and and the other thing too
9213400	9218680	is that they're doing those X the their version of the PlayStation Plus free games or whatever
9218680	9223720	yeah in the games of gold and hey you own an Xbox One guess what those Xbox 360 games are
9223720	9229480	giving away free those work as well yeah so I have to say Microsoft kind of has a great
9229480	9235560	plan with that and something I really appreciate and if they had done this at launch it might have
9235560	9242040	swayed me on a Xbox One a lot sooner than I ended up getting one the only thing is that the library
9242040	9247400	does still feel really limited and I hope when they talk about expanding it I really hope they
9247400	9252520	aren't just blowing smoke up our ass because I feel like the Xbox 360 with the original Xbox
9252520	9257000	they expanded it like twice and then it was done a lot of these really big things and they promised
9257080	9262520	to like make you know really support it and get behind it game room thousands of games the
9262520	9270840	original backwards compatibility yeah you know Xbox that's why I still have caution this cautionist
9270840	9277080	optimism with that um here's the big thing though is that I think the guy running Xbox now
9278120	9284680	is way better and knows what he's doing way more than uh Don Mattrick did and sorry for the shade
9284680	9289240	but it's just it's obvious and I kind of think backwards compatibility didn't start
9289800	9296920	until the the changing of the guards at Microsoft and I think it was uh on an agenda that it wasn't
9296920	9302440	on before and I think that I mean because when did Microsoft start making better decisions when
9302440	9308920	Don Mattrick was gone and I I you know I kind of feel bad kicking that guy but I mean it's just
9308920	9317400	that's the reality when he left things got better yeah so anyway there it is our long-winded answer
9317400	9323480	to your email but hey thanks for the email I appreciate that let's get to another email
9323480	9329960	tonight from uh Raginator uh hi everyone as per usual it's Raginator after listening to the last
9329960	9334840	show's podcast dated 1122 and having heard your responses to my last email I thought I should
9334840	9340040	follow up with responses and clarifications just a reminder thank you because it has been two weeks
9340040	9347080	my last email dealt with my eventual purchase of a gaming PC plus the idea for Loki regarding the
9347080	9353320	rocket-propelled asplosing weasels I like the idea about Newegg I'm gonna truncate this a little bit
9353320	9356920	because it's long I went through them once or twice before it didn't occur to me to look at
9356920	9361320	Newegg again while I agree wholeheartedly that building a PC would make sense from a financial
9361400	9365880	standpoint there's several issues regarding that namely aside from upgrading a PlayStation 3's
9365880	9371640	hard drive I have no knowledge direct or indirect pertaining to building PCs never built one before
9371640	9377960	nor watched anyone do it before I'm gonna interject real quick guess what you have a resource out
9377960	9382760	there where you can watch anyone do almost anything and it's called YouTube and I have
9382760	9387400	learned how to do some crazy shit on YouTube you can learn how to bake things sometimes by
9387400	9393640	drunk people you can learn how to fix weed whackers and lawn mowers you can learn how to
9393640	9399960	fix the I've used it to learn because my car's windshield wiper blade has this weird lock thing
9399960	9404840	on it like in my old car was super easy to change the blades and on this one it's a lot harder and
9404840	9410440	YouTube showed me how to do it so just the thought rage nator if you're able to do it from where
9410440	9415320	you're accessing internet now YouTube some tutorials and yes you can watch somebody build
9415320	9421960	it and it's I mean it's it seems daunting but it's not too difficult I mean it's really there's
9421960	9427080	not a lot of moving parts there mm-hmm it's just kind of plugging some stuff together that's it
9427080	9431320	don't break anything and he goes on to talk about his comfort level and he doesn't have a background
9431320	9436760	in it and so forth and he figures by being he'd be better buying off building a pre-built PC
9436760	9441160	and over time easing his way into that area by learning a little over time and you know what I
9441160	9444600	think I said this two weeks ago and I say it again there's no shame in doing that if that's
9444600	9447800	what you got to do you got to make the decision that's best for you and if you got to get a pre-built
9447800	9453480	PC it's going to work it'll be it'll meet your needs it might have a lot of adware and bullshit
9453480	9457800	on it but you'll figure out how to deactivate all that stuff it'll be fine Loki did mention
9457800	9462040	possibly getting a laptop at this point I want to shy away from that granted laptops are portable
9462040	9465800	but the thing is that from what I've seen and heard aside from RAM and internal hard drive
9465800	9470280	you really can't upgrade a laptop not only that but all the laptops I've previously seen had
9470280	9475160	integrated graphics I'd want something with a dedicated and beefy GPU and video card you can
9475160	9479720	get that you can get that with a laptop but I do feel like you make a valid point otherwise
9479720	9485160	so it's a fair thing to consider Rob did make a good point where I tend to play a lot of games
9485160	9489560	on Steam like Magic etc stuff that will fall under the umbrella of casual games that aren't resource
9489560	9493880	hogs the thing is although I do like games like that that's not all I'm interested in as it stands
9493880	9499080	there's games on my Steam library like Portal 2 that crash within seconds at most of my $400
9499080	9505480	laptop other games like Saints Row 4, Injustice and so on they run poorly so if I don't have
9505480	9510680	anyone to help me build a PC I want to build something that can play fairly beefy games so
9510680	9514520	well good luck to you Rage Nator I appreciate the follow-up and again I don't know how much access
9514520	9518600	to YouTube you have but that could help with the tutorial but at the same time if you end up having
9518600	9524760	to go with a PC in a box go for it but don't be afraid to ask questions you know don't buy the
9524760	9529800	first PC in a box or the one that matches descriptions ask questions and you know what
9529800	9536920	a question is that you should ask how easy is this to upgrade this machine myself and listen
9536920	9541400	carefully to the answer because you may get an answer that talks about how you can upgrade the
9541400	9547800	machine yourself but you may also get an answer that is well you can call and order a part and
9547800	9552760	you know and they try to lock you into and I would shy away from that if you're gonna have to buy
9552760	9558840	something from within the same ecosystem so just a food for thought I really think though with any
9558840	9563640	machine you really can upgrade the parts yourself it just might be kind of hard because I did have
9563640	9567560	a gateway I did buy a computer in a box once because I had a lot of the same reservations
9567560	9573080	you had and I remember replacing the video card it was a pain in the ass because it didn't really
9573080	9579640	fit in there right but we did it eventually I think we ended up burning not burning metal
9579640	9582120	bending metal metal in the process but we made it happen
9583960	9588840	uh SG100Matt in our chat says research research research you have to do research you could email
9588840	9593480	the show a dozen times but you won't know unless you research yourself fair enough I'm sure he's
9593480	9601240	doing some research already uh Martin emailing us tonight uh from uh Belgium Belgium he says
9601240	9604920	Martin the Belgian here although he's not actually in Belgium anymore he moved to the States a while
9604920	9608920	ago remember I think he said he's in Atlanta because I remember you saying why didn't you
9608920	9613480	go to Dragon Con uh Martin the Belgian here it seems like an eternity since you guys have been
9613480	9617880	on the air yeah that's not going to get any better I apologize but here we are listen to this show
9617880	9621800	half and half make it last uh starting to miss listening to you while you're at work hope you
9621800	9627080	guys had a great Thanksgiving I wanted to mention how excited I was at my first Black Friday video
9627080	9632840	game deal since I moved to the States I picked up Until Dawn for $20 at Best Buy that's a hell
9632840	9637160	of a deal and I didn't even have to trample or stab anyone to get it just ordered it online
9637160	9641560	very happy about this because I wanted to check this game out but not a full price
9641560	9647000	you guys kind of make fun of Best Buy sometimes and I agree that to some extent however for gamers
9647000	9651480	they have this membership card that is actually awesome and this doesn't ever get mentioned it's
9651480	9657480	$30 for a two-year membership and gives you 20% off all new games new as in not secondhand this
9657480	9663560	basically means all $60 games are by default $48 all the time over time this can save you a ton of
9663560	9667000	money I'm not affiliated with Best Buy in any way I just want to mention this as some people
9667000	9671400	might not know about this and video games are expensive you know it's really funny you bring
9671400	9677320	this up how do you think I got Xenoblade Chronicles X you know it's ironic too about all that too
9677320	9683080	having worked in the video game industry $48 is cost for most games yeah so they're selling it at
9683080	9689880	cost so or below cost so their profit is purely from coming from that card and anything else that
9689880	9693880	you get in Best Buy at the time interesting uh I want to say this though you know what's
9693880	9701080	interesting um I got Xenoblade Chronicles X but Shane gets the games for me and he'll get two
9701080	9706040	copies and he gets them for $48 and then I just give him cash you know because he knows I'm good
9706040	9710920	for it we probably should sign up for that I mean I just have I'm too lazy to go he's actually
9710920	9716840	yelled at me like why did you order that on Amazon because I can get it for you for 48 bucks so uh
9716840	9723320	yeah it's it's it is a pretty good program I must admit so um do you know of any other
9723320	9727320	good ways to save on console games there's steam sales of course but for consoles it's
9727320	9732200	a bit more difficult no that's actually I mean just keep an eye on for the sales like I just
9732200	9739960	purchased um Wolfenstein the new order for $10 they had it on sale during the their flash sales
9739960	9744200	that they do on the Playstation store and that's how I get a lot of my games I got like I just
9744200	9749640	wait you know I don't get stuff right away I got Battlefield 4 for $10 a while back I haven't
9749640	9754600	played very much of it but I still bought it you know and I kind of shop that way I just wait for
9754600	9759480	stuff to go on sale if you don't already have one get a Twitter account and follow gamers because
9759480	9763960	usually if there's a really good need to know about sale it gets tweeted about a million times
9764520	9768520	otherwise the internet is a great resource for all that stuff um I know a lot of people use that
9768520	9774520	cheap ass gamer site which has forums uh where somebody like posts target ads and Walmart ads
9774520	9778920	and all that stuff like every week um so I know that's a good way that's kind of like an all-in-one
9778920	9784920	type of resource so um but yeah if you don't have a Twitter account get one and follow uh gaming
9784920	9788920	accounts and uh probably that cheap ass gamer probably has a Twitter account and I imagine
9788920	9792920	they put the best stuff on there yes they do yeah so because I'm like I'm pretty sure I've seen
9792920	9798520	their retweets before so yeah there you go so uh internet research would be our suggestion
9799320	9803880	one more thing from Martin here another thing I recall Rob mentioning that Rob Roberts is his
9803880	9809480	radio name last show Rob Roberts is not his real name it's not I've been listening to you guys on
9809480	9815160	and off probably for about 10 years and never realized this mind blown well Martin then I'm
9815160	9822200	doing it right keep up the great show Martin again it's about separating the radio life from
9822200	9829640	the work life two separate lives all right uh we still have some more emails here we have a short
9829640	9835560	one here from Emily hi Emily thanks for the email who emails us tonight Rob asked last week about
9835560	9841480	our usernames and what they mean I have been using mere muse for at least 15 years it comes from an
9841480	9847000	episode of Batman the animated series in the episode a rich crazy man believes he is Thor
9847000	9850920	when Batman shows up he decides Batman is his brother Hades of the underworld
9850920	9855240	Thor's lawyer or accountant was in the room and he mumbles something talking to Hades away from
9855240	9861720	these mere muses the lady slams her briefcase shut and mumbles yep that's me just a muse I've
9861720	9867800	been using the name since that's me just a mere muse I like that story uh for a while when I was
9867800	9873960	younger and naive I was learning to read tarot cards I use seek 21 it is the last card of the
9874040	9881560	major arcana and it is known as the world so seek 21 meant seek the world oh that's pretty cool
9881560	9884680	I had some friends that were into that a long time ago the tarot card stuff so
9885320	9890120	that's really cool thank you for sharing the story and I saw a few more you uh post on the
9890120	9893960	Fugu question of the week so I appreciate that I did read all those and I always find those
9893960	9900760	stories really fascinating all right one more email from yyr so it's long but not as long as
9900760	9906680	he usually makes them and of course he's starting off hello lr starts off rob I've got a bone to
9906680	9911480	pick with you and the email's done I'm just kidding uh why do you gotta hate on toad and
9911480	9916440	super mario brothers too because he sucks uh toad is my go-to guy for almost every level because
9916440	9921400	he's the fastest and I don't have to wait an hour for him to pick stuff up a year if we're talking
9921400	9926280	about the princess toad is the man by the way if you haven't picked up captain toad for Wii U I
9926280	9930600	highly recommend it it's great but it's even better if you play it with someone else two heads
9930600	9934200	are better than one for some of the trickier puzzles I do have captain toad and captain toad
9934200	9940440	is a lot of fun uh but I do still want to say I have an irrational hatred for toadette uh that I
9940440	9945080	think has come up on this show before uh that probably dates back to mario kart double dash
9945080	9953160	um I just I really don't like toadette um but here's it's the jump thing he can't jump for crap
9953160	9957720	that's why I don't like toad and super mario brothers too Luigi he's the man he does his
9957800	9963160	little flappy legs he's like he does little kinky legs and he can fly and he practically
9963160	9968520	floats too if you you know what you're doing when you're playing luigi so I don't like toad
9968520	9975160	because even though he's tiny he doesn't float so there's there's my my opinion deal with it
9976120	9980840	uh oh he has some advice on reginator's new pc when the program world network was still a thing
9980840	9985960	and 2d x 20 was coming out it required a major hardware update as it was the first hd version
9985960	9990200	of 2d x I actually volunteered to build a computer for an arcade in queens new york
9990200	9994360	I'd never built one before but I also had realized how much easier the process had become over the
9994360	9999640	years it's now so easy even I can do it and I've been described by others as mechanically inept
9999640	10004520	which is accurate you're essentially snapping a motherboard in a case snapping a cpu and some ram
10004520	10009480	into it plugging in a power supply then installing a hard drive and a dvd or blu-ray drive as a
10009480	10015400	cinch see but you you did just name like four steps so it's all right I agree though it's a
10015400	10019720	lot easier than it used to be uh finally you have to drop in a video card and you're finished that
10019720	10024200	is literally everything you have to do youtube has tons of videos on all of this it's so funny
10024200	10028600	we thought the same thing there it was so easy that then I built another computer for myself
10028600	10033560	afterwards with a modest video card and intel cpu and I couldn't be happier I run bimani and steam
10033560	10038520	games on it and it costs less than 450 in total I would encourage anyone to try it even if you
10038520	10042760	are mechanically inept as I am but if you're absolutely against the idea I recommend buying
10042760	10049080	a general a decent general purpose computer making sure it has a full length PCI express
10049080	10055080	slot and then adding a video card of your choice lastly I want to announce that the multitasking
10055080	10060280	is through the first round of the selection process for the magfest indie video game showcase
10060280	10064440	oh I hope you get picked because I'll be at magfest uh for the second round I am required
10064520	10069400	to produce a demo and I've been warned that not all the judges may have xbox 360 controllers
10069400	10074840	so I've added keyboard controls does that sound interesting uh it should because I'm now thinking
10074840	10080040	about the possibility of a pc version if there's any listeners who would like to try out this demo
10080040	10089560	and offer feedback I invite them to email me at yyr at yyr games.com um where's my demo where's
10089560	10095800	the demo attached to this email you forgot somebody yyr me me me me me hope you all had
10095800	10099800	an awesome thanksgiving and that you didn't blow all your money in the sales that followed
10100520	10105000	that was from yyr thank you all for the emails we had some good emails tonight that's the one good
10105000	10109000	thing about taking a show off is that then we have a lot of emails to come back to I did work
10109000	10114440	on my game for about one minute this entire two weeks no seriously I've been trying I've been
10114440	10118520	seriously like just scolding myself listen why aren't you working on the game why don't you
10118520	10122760	work in the but I'm just like so brain dead I can't I can't do it and I really want to
10123320	10128040	I kind of work want to work on something else but I do want to get my game done and I'm
10129640	10136040	gonna try harder to work on it you can do it I believe in you I need to get something out this
10136040	10142760	year that's my goals to get it done something out this year even if it's absolute shit even if it's
10142760	10149480	on the 31st of December and it probably will be at midnight all right well uh let's get
10149480	10163000	what an appropriate while we're beating ourselves up let's get to the FUs of the week
10163000	10177640	um I don't know I guess fu for some of the players I'm playing with for ingress you know it's
10177640	10182600	not their fault their best intentions you know they're trying to block the other team but I
10182600	10186680	spent two hours driving to auburn to create a field to go from auburn to shingle springs
10187320	10192360	and one of our team members blocked me on the way back from auburn when I said I was on my way back
10192360	10196440	from auburn and that I was going to do this in specifically outlined it he's like I kind of
10196440	10204120	fucked you I'm like a little bit at least got to see auburn is pretty but scary the as fuck driving
10204120	10210440	on those roads when the rain's coming down and wind and leaves it's like uh but yeah I wasted
10210440	10216600	two hours you should have 88 what he did at least you got unique no but I did myself no here's the
10216600	10220440	thing though I didn't realize it until I got to shingle springs and I would have had to drive back
10220440	10224680	another 45 minutes to go with ada that and then drive and I had to pick up my son anyways and
10224680	10228600	it's just like okay well had I known he had blocked me I wouldn't have driven the shingle
10228600	10233720	springs I would have just gone picked up my son so we needed to communicate better as a team I think
10234280	10240200	it's fucking us all right uh let's see my fu of the week goes to the fact that I was sick a month
10240200	10246040	ago and I'm still coughing and also to the fact that I I banged myself up real good a week ago
10246040	10250120	you guys and uh that was that was a shitty experience to go through today is the first
10250120	10256040	day where my lip finally has no pain even like a really really really dull pain but it was bad
10256040	10260600	uh like my two front teeth slammed into my lip and like you could see the impressions
10260600	10266680	that the teeth made in my lip it was crazy so ew but you know you didn't buy a chunk out of
10266680	10271160	your tongue like my sister did actually yeah actually in some ways I was really lucky that
10271160	10275960	I didn't have a worse injury honestly so I was I was very fortunate in that regard
10276760	10281640	so uh william murder face and chat over at live.vog network.com says rob did you get falcon
10281640	10286600	punched uh it felt like it definitely felt like it a couple more stories for you guys then we're
10286600	10292120	going to open up the skype line at 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio I do
10292120	10297080	want to warn you guys though if nobody calls then we're going to close shop because it's already
10297080	10300680	nine o'clock but I do want to at least give time for a few of you to get through so get ready to
10300680	10306040	call uh if you want to call uh loki so um apparently
10308360	10316520	namco is teaming up with hooters to bring some gaming like barcades I guess to japan
10317080	10324680	and I guess they're going to open this um it's called gaming bar side b and it's uh coming in
10324680	10331800	I guess shibuya on december 18th it features all you can eat um and game for 30 minutes
10331800	10341400	for 1500 yen and then I guess you know I don't know I like the idea of uh
10342600	10348040	busy japanese women I mean that that's a plus um however though if it's anything like the
10348040	10353080	hooters over here their food is fucking terrible so but I do like video games so
10353640	10360200	two out of best two out of three I guess right so yes uh and you know people don't go to hooters
10360200	10365640	for the food so it'll be nice to be able to go to hooters for the game and let's just say you know
10365640	10369720	if it's in japan the food might be better because they probably serve different type of food there
10369720	10375240	and it's probably not as crap as the food that we have here because I've tried hooters several times
10376200	10380760	sometimes mostly out of desperation because it was just it happened to be the location nearby
10380760	10385320	we wanted food and I've tried three different things and every single time it's fucking sucked
10386120	10390040	and it's been awkward and like uncomfortable and the food has been fucking terrible
10391960	10396280	yeah again we don't I haven't been in a while I think the last time I went was with my friend
10396280	10400760	victoria and it was just more of a just tip for the laughs type of thing and I was like
10401400	10406120	this isn't this isn't very good food but but the the servers are all really nice
10406120	10408200	yeah the servers are nice and I mean
10410200	10413000	it's just like you should take your boys there for a family dinner
10413640	10416520	they wouldn't care yeah they're not gonna care is it just
10418520	10424360	maybe nelly will have fun who knows all right uh moving on one more story for you guys tonight and
10424360	10430200	this is uh this be getting a lot of people talking this week uh project m you guys know about this
10430200	10436840	this was a super smash brothers melee uh it was like a mod uh that I'm sorry sorry not
10436840	10443400	not melee it was for the Wii version super smash brothers brawl that was modded uh but some people
10443400	10448120	liked what was in melee in the gamecube that remains the popular one uh a lot for a lot of
10448120	10454200	people uh Wii U isn't necessarily the go-to one for everybody so some folks retooled the
10454200	10460200	Wii version super smash brothers brawl to have more of the features like the gamecube version
10460200	10465080	and then they actually were putting in some extra characters as well although I think they did have
10465080	10471560	some rules to try and avoid legal uh squabbles with Nintendo like uh they didn't have Nintendo
10471560	10477400	characters that weren't already in the smash series I think uh something like that uh so yeah
10477400	10482760	um here's the thing though they abruptly ended the project and they said it was not a legal
10482760	10487560	takedown by Nintendo but they said it's been an excruciating call to make but it's been made a
10487560	10493560	bit easier by our satisfaction with the previous and final release 3.6 we spent six years polishing
10493560	10498200	project m and rather than let it drag on through another several years of dwindling development and
10498200	10503320	change fatigue in the competitive circle we're going to consider our work complete they go on
10503320	10506760	to say we can't spill the beans just yet but know that we're looking towards a fresh start with
10506760	10511480	brand new designs rather than splitting our focus many of us want to dedicate ourselves to this new
10511480	10516360	venture fully in this way we hope to maintain the level of quality and professionalism you've come
10516360	10520840	to expect from us so there it is they're gonna make their own game or something I wonder if they
10520840	10525080	won't make their own game uh but the interesting thing about project m it shows up in tournaments
10525080	10531880	and stuff like not anything on the super but you see the cons it was of basically it was just a
10531880	10537800	modded save file that you could load on an unmodded system you can just pop in the sd card
10537800	10545400	and load up the stage and away you go yeah so uh some uh interesting comments in chat over at live.vog
10545400	10550440	network.com uh william murderface says rumor is that nintendo was planning on dropping a massive
10550440	10556200	lawsuit around the time of their next patch we'll see uh act f says project m the reason why we
10556200	10560920	can't have nice things tiger claw says the problem is the smash melee community is a bunch of elitists
10561560	10566840	um kaijuta says i'm sure brawl had game exploits that those noobs want to hold on to so they don't
10566840	10572600	update wow all right uh and william murderface says then again high level gaming and elitism
10572600	10577880	seem to go hand in hand far too often i will admit i've never played project m i thought it was
10577880	10583800	fascinating that it went on as long as it did without getting shut down by nintendo i find that
10583800	10590440	extremely fascinating um but you know people got to do what they got to do for their own reasons
10590440	10596120	uh last night my buddy ended his show after 14 years project m wants to pull the plug after
10596120	10600760	six years that's their prerogative and maybe they have a different idea on what they want to do from
10600760	10607160	here on out so all right that's going to do it for news stories tonight we are now going to open up
10607160	10613400	the skype line over at 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio which is already
10614040	10618440	lighting up dang we're getting to it let's get to the phones hi you're on orange launch radio
10618440	10624040	who's this hey there's like death hey act f how you doing uh really great really great right now
10624040	10630040	good good to hear from you what's up well when when are you saying uh sorry when when are we
10630040	10637960	starting the petition to get the uh the rest rest infinity uh suits oh my god those suits they were
10637960	10643720	wearing on stage that kind of looked like that's what tron run r looks like is those suits that
10643720	10650040	were on the stage it looked uh it looked amazing um so yeah that was that was such a surprise to
10650040	10654760	see tetsuya mizuguchi in one of those uh suits as well because i don't think we've heard a lot from
10654760	10664200	him i thought i could be wrong i thought i heard he parted ways with his former studio that made
10664200	10670120	all the stuff like luminous and and all those q entertainment i so yeah maybe not because
10670120	10674680	rez entertainment would still kind of be that right so i don't know so maybe they've worked
10674680	10679160	something out i don't know but it was it was really a delight to see him yeah i was i was
10679160	10684920	really surprised to see the uh see him at the end of the of the video wearing the suit and all that
10684920	10691480	stuff uh many people didn't recognize him at first but i admittedly knew who he was and i was pretty
10691480	10697320	excited watching all the video i was i was like oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god
10697320	10707160	oh my god uh i i really really wasn't that sold on playstation br but seen uh rest infinity
10707960	10714680	yeah i'm sold on it uh i'm pretty much getting it at one point at least but yeah and probably
10714680	10718920	hearing shane talk so enthusiastically about it probably only uh heightened that a little bit
10718920	10724280	i'm sure well and the other thing too i was sorry to interject um but like they showed off that ace
10724280	10730680	combat game which looked pretty awesome but that made me think i want a vr ridge racer game come on
10730680	10736920	me too actually i was thinking about the same thing where's my ridge racer br like seriously
10736920	10740920	now were you the one that had like a relative that was super into ace combat you were tweeting about
10740920	10746760	that that they were very yeah yeah yeah my brother uh who's uh sitting right next to me playing
10746760	10753640	destiny uh yeah he was pretty excited to see uh ace combat 7 especially with br too that series
10753640	10757720	has been dormant a while wasn't the last release on xbox 360 if i'm not mistaken it's been a little
10757720	10764200	while yeah well i think the last release was ace combat 6 or either one of the psp ones but yeah
10765080	10771320	but i think it was uh really oh yeah sorry no no he's correcting me right now assault
10771320	10776760	horizon was the last one oh right right right i was just thinking of the ones in the numbered
10776760	10783560	series but yeah yeah yeah okay yeah yeah that was released on pc and also 3ds also got it
10784040	10787320	well yeah that's exciting i mean i know they didn't show any gameplay from it but at least
10787320	10791400	it shows that you've got big studios because you know namco bandai is a pretty big developer
10791400	10795720	you know that are embracing the vr thing and then of course ubisoft showed that interesting vr thing
10795720	10800680	with the birds and all that um so and now we're hearing that ea might be kind of putting their
10800680	10804680	foot in the pool to see if if the temperature is good for them so uh be interesting to see what
10804680	10812600	comes that because yeah vr is going to really need the big triple a experiences that necessitate the
10812600	10821400	peripheral you know just kind of like the the we sold its concept on we sports uh playstation vr
10821400	10825720	needs its we sports and i'm not saying it literally needs a sports title but it needs a title like
10825720	10832200	that to really get people to buy in yeah hopefully it will get one uh it looks it's looking pretty
10832200	10839800	good i i like i said i wasn't that sold about though uh sorry though i there wasn't really
10839800	10846680	like a game to oh i i need to get playstation vr because of that for me right now it's pretty
10846680	10854680	much rest but hey my brother wants uh is combat by uh seven and there's other games like shane
10854680	10862840	talked about uh tonight that that sound really great there the at least uh he made it sound like
10862840	10869240	really great game so at least fun so yeah there's there's a lot to uh look forward to
10869240	10875480	uh on playstation vr and nakolas on all on all vr stuff that's pretty helpful too where like when
10875480	10880440	in the family it's like okay you guys can make an investment for your whole household because
10880440	10884840	you know that your brother will be into ace combat and you'll be into res and there's kind of like
10884840	10889000	that whole something for everyone so that diversity uh in the titles that you put out
10889000	10894760	there is very important as well yeah pretty much yeah awesome well anything else you want

11015880	11020840	we didn't really dig into a whole lot of the uh details about the news out of that i think
11020840	11025480	everything's kind of come up another conversation tonight but uh what did what do you i know you
11025480	11028840	didn't really watch the awards but what did you think about the whole thing itself do you think
11028840	11032680	a third year will be necessary do you think it'll continue i think they should do it i mean i didn't
11032680	11039960	think it was a bad show i mean it was fine i mean i didn't i really kind of skimmed it i watched the
11039960	11044520	trailer so that's really kind of what i wanted to see is the new game trailers um so i you know
11044520	11049800	checked out far cry primal it looks different not a game i'm gonna pick up but it looks interesting
11049800	11055000	i know a lot of people are kind of excited about that because it's a little bit of a different
11055000	11063960	take on far cry um so the batman telltale game looks pretty oh yeah that does that sounds awesome
11063960	11069160	um i don't know i mean there's a lot of stuff to be excited for i just hope a lot of the stuff
11069160	11073240	that's being announced isn't going to be delayed and and here's the thing i'm kind of noticing too
11073240	11078280	is like there's a lot of stuff that's coming out for 2016 like i don't realize that it's coming out
11078280	11083160	like maybe it's because i'm not like working in the industry anymore but like i just saw the a
11083160	11090600	release date for uh fire what was it fire watch or like um i think it's called fire watch that
11090600	11096520	is kind of like a stylistic indie game or something like that it's you know for the first
11096520	11103720	person and it looked interesting and then you know what next year they'll start delaying it all to
11103800	11109800	2017 and we'll be having this year's crackdown i do like crackdown i'm not gonna buy an xbox
11109800	11117400	one for just crackdown but it'll help it yeah yeah if it's good if it's good i i mean i i've
11117960	11124920	i'd still play it even if it's bad uh i want new saints row game i mean i i kind of didn't care
