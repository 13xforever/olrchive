00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, we interview Rick of Tippy Goat Games, makers of the Super Sports Smash Up title, Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
We're back to get caught up on the last two weeks of gaming news, GamerX, your comments, and more.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
And it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, tonight with episode number 624 of our show, December the 20th of 2015.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
Our last show before the big, big holiday, right here in the midst of the holiday season.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
So happy holidays to all of you guys out there, and to my co-hosts here in studio.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E.

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
And joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Hi.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Hello, how are you Jamie Summers?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Alright.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Alright.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Just, things happen.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Did we have a fun adventure last week?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
We did.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
We did.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.000
We had a great fun adventure, and my feet are still arguing at me for those boots, but otherwise it was a great adventure.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
Your cosplay looked great at the show, and I know that there's pictures of you around on the interwebs.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm on Unicorn Booty, which I laugh without to no end.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
It's a pretty hilarious website name, isn't it?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
It is.

01:31.000 --> 01:36.000
There is actually, they have like one of the, you know like those standees you see as you're walking into like big events?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
You know, you always see like the big wall with all the company logos, right?

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
So there was one outside of GamerX for that company, and it looked like a unicorn that was about to like kick your ass.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
And I was like, I wanted to take a picture underneath it, like it was about to kick me in the face, but I didn't, I don't know.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
I didn't want to hold up traffic so I could have my awkward photo, so it didn't end up happening.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
Sorry. Well, they were stopping people to take pictures in front of that.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
That's good.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Like I was going to look, and I feel bad because now I can't make my brain think of his name.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Uh-huh.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Josh? John? The Templar guy.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Mmm.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Who was Kayden.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
I don't recall his name, but he looked great if he's out there listening.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Well, they got us together in front of the Unicorn Booty thing.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.000
And now my, I'm so mad at myself because like, I can't think of like hardly anyone's name today.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
That's okay.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
It's okay, but I saw Star Wars and life is good.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Alright, fair enough.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Uh, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Hi.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
How are you doing, Loki?

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Um, I enjoyed half that burger and then I'm not enjoying the other half of that burger.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Is your microphone on, Loki? Because I don't know if we're picking you up for some reason.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
I am completely on.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Oh, you're just quiet tonight for some reason.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
I am not completely quiet.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Alright, there you go.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
You have levels problems.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
We're having audio problems left and right in the studio tonight and I'll get into that in a minute.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I guess I'll just have to talk louder.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
No, you're good. You're perfectly fine now.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I don't know, I don't know what the hell's going on.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
For some reason, you're not looping back through the internal speakers like I'm used to, but you're picking up on the register so I know the audience can hear you.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Okay.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Oh my god.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
If it's not one thing breaking in studio, it's another. I'll get to that in a minute.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
But anyway, Loki, how has your couple weeks been?

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
You weren't able to go to the show, I know, but how was your week off?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Um, I don't remember what I did.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
I think I played Fallout, maybe. Or maybe Ingress. Probably Ingress.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Probably a lot of Ingress.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
I think a little bit of Ingress and then I stayed home for some of that.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
You know, I was reading an article which didn't make our show roll tonight, but it was about Pokémon GO.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And there's some more information because there was an interview out there with Pokémon GO.

03:32.000 --> 03:41.000
And I guess part of why the Pokémon company wanted to team up with Niantic, who are the makers of Ingress, to make Pokémon GO is that

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
the head of the Pokémon company is actually a high level Ingress player.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
And the president of Niantic was like, he's a higher level player than I am.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
So that kind of made me chuckle.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
But from what I understand, Ingress is really big in Japan.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
I don't know if that's true or just kind of something through the grapevine, but it kind of tells you why Pokémon GO.

04:02.000 --> 04:13.000
I do think that is going to be quite the mobile game next year because it's going to be a mobile game very unlike the typical, I'm going to use my quotey fingers, mobile game.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Like it's not going to be Candy Crush.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
I'll try it, I guess. I don't like Pokémon, though, so we'll see.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Maybe this will be it.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Eh.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
This will be the first hit. I don't know.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Anyhow, we also want to welcome the ever-present fourth guest on our show, the chat room.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
Hello to our chat room. We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Live.vognetwork.com is where you can find our chat room.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
And of course we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:42.000 --> 04:49.000
We have folks in chat there saying, like, Dungeon Buster says, punch those audio problems with the dark side.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.000
I almost, I was like this close to going to see Star Wars before the show.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
But I had to cook, like, three things for my wife, and by that time I was like, I'm not going to make it there on time.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
I'm going to miss the new Deadpool preview, and that's going to make me sad, so I decided not to.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Plus, I would have gotten here late.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
It's all good. It's fine. I'm hoping to get out during the week at some point. We'll see.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
SS2 and Hunter Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying nothing can silence Loki.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
You know what? The systems in here have been trying tonight.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
So real quick recap. First off, I want to say a big welcome to those of you.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
We talked to a lot of people at GX3 or GamerX that stopped by the table.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
So if there's any new listeners out there listening to OLR tonight who might have stopped by and said hi to us over at our table,

05:39.000 --> 05:46.000
which could include, by the way, I had a conversation with podcasting with Trixie Mattel from RuPaul's Drag Race Season 7.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
You missed that, Jamie, when Trixie came by the table.

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
But turns out Trixie listens to podcasts on her flights back and forth to different shows.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
So shout out to Trixie if you're out there listening.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Hashtag justice for Trixie or whatever it was.

06:02.000 --> 06:09.000
Anyway, so all that aside, we talked to a lot of people there at the expo, drag queens and non-drag queens.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
Actually, a lot of non-drag queens.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
And just talked about podcasting and everything that we have on the network with our variety of shows

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
and how we have shows about like Star Trek and World of Warcraft and movies and TVs.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And so I hope we got a few listeners from that.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lawns Radio, welcome.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
We've been running, oh, golly, nonstop since 2002.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
We started as an Internet radio program dedicated to dance dance revolution and music based video games

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
and kind of grew from that into all things video gaming because, of course, we were just fans of video games first.

06:44.000 --> 06:51.000
It just so happens we were playing at the time a lot of Parappa the Rappa and bust a groove depending on what country you were in.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
So we were talking about that for a while and then we did games.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So we like to be very interactive. We call ourselves a show where every gamer has a voice.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
And we invite you guys to pull up a chair with us at our dinner table.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
There's one thing we used to do when we played Dance Dance Revolution is after we played some DDR,

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
we would go to the cafe right across the street and sit down and talk some smack about video games.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
So that's what we do here.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
And order fried food because, you know, nothing better than after working out for a while to eat some fried fruits to offset it.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
We just burned off all those calories playing DDR. Let's have some mozzarella sticks.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
Let's do it right now.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
So, yeah, that's we've kind of kept that tradition going now for going into next year.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
Our 14th year is next year.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Every time I say the number, I die a little inside.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
All right.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
We're entering high school.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
We love it. We love you guys. We love doing this.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
And we're going to do it for a long time.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
Although the computer tonight really didn't want it to happen.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
I come into the studio after a two week break.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
And again, we've been a little bit, admittedly, we've been spotty the past couple months.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.000
I can't stand it because I got sick.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
Then we had Thanksgiving, but I fell, had that fall and I would have been able to show anyway.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
And then we had GX, which admittedly was an awesome reason to miss the show.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I don't apologize for that.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
But I don't like that we miss so many shows back to back.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
We like to be here every single week.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
But tonight, I come in the studio, computer won't power on.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
I'm like, what the hell?

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
So I figured it must have tripped the breaker at some point.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I'd like hold in the power button for a second, finally figured it out, got it working.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
I'm like, phew.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
Then it looks like Alan unplugged the internet at some point, which is fine.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
That happens.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
Sometimes you got to clean the hall.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
So the cord's got to go or whatever.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
And then so finally figured that out.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
But the cord, it's like one of those things where the cord, we have this super long cord.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
It's like a hundred foot cord that runs from the computer all the way to the router.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Like one of those that I have it at home.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
It's ethernet through power.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
You just plug it in.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah, that would be cool.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
And you guys might be thinking, why don't you just use Wi-Fi?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Because it's internet radio and we're streaming constantly.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
We really have to have a wired connection for that.

09:00.000 --> 09:04.000
Even if your Comcast is anything like my Comcast, it's fucking sucked.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Exactly.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Like I'm just like, it's seriously getting worse every day.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And I'm not sure how that's possible.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
So finally figured out the net thing.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
I just had to bend the cord just right at like the 30 degree angle that'll make it get the signal.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
Okay, so then finally, you know, I had a moment of weakness and I clicked yes when Skype said,

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
do you want to upgrade Skype?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And now it won't work.

09:27.000 --> 09:35.000
I try to bring it up and it says, sorry, we can't find the internet while I'm running IRC and Google and everything else in the background.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
It's like, sorry, can't find the internet.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
So I'm like, all right, well, there's plenty of websites out there where I can download the old version.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
So download old version Skype 5.0 and still won't work.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
So trying to install Skype messed my settings.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
So I'm going to have to look into that this week.

09:51.000 --> 09:58.000
So we have this whole rig set up in studio where I've got my iPhone plugged into our mixing board.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
So we can hopefully take some calls later in the show.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
But so we can definitely tonight bring you an interview.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
I'm very excited. We're going to have a guest on the show tonight.

10:07.000 --> 10:14.000
One of the cool things about going to an expo like GX got to talk to a lot of indie developers that were there showing their stuff.

10:15.000 --> 10:23.000
And one of the games that we saw actually made that transition from early access to a fully fledged release game on Steam this week.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
So we're excited. We're going to have Rick on the show tonight from Tipping Goat Games.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Love that name.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
Going to talk to us tonight about Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.

10:32.000 --> 10:41.000
And this is a game that kind of takes a lot of 8-bit retro sports games and it's like a giant Katamari ball that rolls them all up.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
And it's one game that incorporates all these elements.

10:44.000 --> 10:50.000
So we're going to have Rick on in about 15 minutes to tell us a little more about how that game works.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
And I think he's shown this game at some of the Penny Arcade Expos and some other places.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
So I know some of our listeners are actually well aware of this game that weren't even at GX.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
So you may not know though that it's actually out now on Steam.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
If you want to try it out for yourself, you can check that out.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Just use that old search box in Steam and you will be happily on your way.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
Rick will be joining us live and you can ask your questions about the game.

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
In fact, I see SSJ100matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
I'm hyped about this game.

11:17.000 --> 11:25.000
And yeah, if you want to ask Rick some questions, we will be fielding questions from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

11:25.000 --> 11:30.000
But first, we need to recap what happened while we were gone.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
We missed a week of show.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
So I think we need to do last week's news set to Holik.

11:38.000 --> 11:46.000
So while we were gone last week for GX, Minecraft finally launched on the Wii U.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
But if you were looking forward to that Wii U gamepad support,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
so you could do inventory management and stuff on Minecraft Wii U,

11:53.000 --> 12:00.000
I'm sorry, but you can do off-screen play like you can do in every Wii U game.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
So there you go.

12:02.000 --> 12:09.000
Also, Mercedes-Benz and Nintendo teamed up for a Super Mario Maker costume.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
And it's actually in the game now and you can actually play us a little race car in Super Mario Maker.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
And I know there was some more news on Mario Maker this week we'll get into a little bit later.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
And also, a new patent supposedly serviced for the Nintendo NX last week.

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
A weird controller that actually had a video or an image screen built into the controller.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
I don't know, it looked a little weird to me, but I guess it's the way they could change the controller

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
and how it looks on the fly.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
You mean like a touchpad where they can have signed buttons to random slots?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
That sounds fucking terrible.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
Yeah, I...

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
It's like, jeez, you know what I really wish I had in my console gaming experience

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
is that wonderful usability of not having buttons on a touchpad or mobile device.

12:54.000 --> 12:58.000
I have real problems with this if the buttons are fake.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
Because it doesn't work well for mobile gaming unless that is the way the game is meant to be controlled

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
is with swiping and dragging.

13:07.000 --> 13:12.000
Like for some games it works fine, but when you try to take, like if you were to take Super Mario Brothers

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
and just put it on iPhone or Android, it would be horrible.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
Sonic is that way on the phone, right? And it stinks.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
I'm sorry, I love Sonic, but it stinks on mobile devices.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
Because tangible controls are different than touch button controls.

13:25.000 --> 13:34.000
So now, if the whole thing with NX is that the controller is a TV, but it has tangible buttons kind of inside it,

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
like you know what I mean, like the TV is built around those controls,

13:37.000 --> 13:40.000
then I think that's kind of weird as hell, but...

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
I think it's stupid.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
We'll try it.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
And the reason why I think it's stupid is because my hand is on the controller,

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
I can't see the image under my hand.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
So I don't...

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
See the point.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
Depending on the design of the controller, like okay, I think about a controller like the Nintendo 64 controller.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.000
That thing was a fat controller, or the original Xbox controller, Jesus.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
That thing was a fat controller.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
I don't want to hold a fucking LCD screen in my hand like that, you know.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
But see, maybe I'm weird, but I like the Wii U gamepad controller.

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
It doesn't bother me the way it bothers everybody else.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
I like it until I play Minecraft with it, and I fucking hate it.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
I seriously, like, it made me realize how much I hate that controller.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
Well anyway, now keep in mind, it's a patent.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
People like to jump to conclusions with this stuff.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
We won't really know anything until E3 next year, but it's very interesting nonetheless.

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
So those are some of the big stories from the week that we were gone.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
Anything else we want to talk about with GX?

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Dark Sakura, how was your GX experience?

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
I mean, I know you did the costume and had your picture taken a lot.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
You're a Grey Warden from Dragon Age, and very well received.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
I know they had a contest.

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
Sadly, no trophies for Dark Sakura, but you had some stiff competition,

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
and I think you were just doing it for fun, right?

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Well, I wanted to win something.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
Winning's nice. Winning's nice.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I had a really good time.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
I only bonked a few people with my staff.

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
It broke a lot, and I did repairs three nights in a row, it seemed.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
It's a miracle that we got this.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
By the way, she had this full-length staff with this intricate skull thing on the top of it,

15:24.000 --> 15:30.000
and then a metal... well, it wasn't actually a metal blade, but an illusion of a metal blade at the end.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
Somehow fit that thing in my car with five people in my little Civic.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
I think the whole thing ended up being something like six and a half feet long.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
So definitely another foot and a half taller than me.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
But we got it to fit in the car, and I carried it around the whole convention

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
and walked in boots that I really should have had better insults for.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
But it was a really good time.

15:55.000 --> 16:04.000
I didn't really want to get back into the costume after dinner to go back to the cosplay dance.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
I heard there was drama, so I'm kind of glad I didn't go.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
Drama in the form of...

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
Oh, yeah. I don't want to linger on the negative, but somebody had way too much to drink,

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
and I think it was more than just liquor, that's all I'm going to say,

16:20.000 --> 16:25.000
and basically the ambulance was called on him and had to get taken out of the place,

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
and it kind of shut the thing down early.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
But you know what? For those not involved, it was handled well.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
The guy got the medical attention he needed.

16:35.000 --> 16:40.000
He was fine because he was on the gurney making motions and things, so I know he's fine,

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
but it didn't really ruin the party, if that makes sense.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.000
He added it early, but it didn't ruin the spirit or anything, so for what it's worth.

16:49.000 --> 16:58.000
Well, at any rate, I would say that I'm not the same type of congoer I used to be,

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
but I had a really good time cosplaying.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
I really miss it because it's been a while since I've done any kind of serious cosplay.

17:05.000 --> 17:13.000
Victoria did a great job with the costume itself, and all the props were mine, but...

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
Did you get to participate or see any panels or get to play games?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I didn't go to any panels but our own.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Yeah? How'd the Podcast Cross Zone panel go for you?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
It was really, really cool.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
It was good that we just kept moving around and got to make some good points

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
and talk with people in the crowd. It was great.

17:31.000 --> 17:39.000
I did play fake scrabble in costume against a templar to see who could spell better,

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
as in, haha spell, lol.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
We've actually got pictures up on Twitter, so I can find them and link them in the chat room.

17:48.000 --> 17:55.000
I was really tired, though, at the end of every day.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I mean, that kind of goes without saying.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah, cons can be really draining.

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
Yeah, but I'm hoping to break the costume back out for a day of sac anime if all goes to plan.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.000
Excellent.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
And other than that, yeah.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Great.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
How's your turn?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.000
Yeah, I...

18:13.000 --> 18:18.000
Oh, and I played the sports ball game, which is what I'm naming it in my head because the name's kind of long.

18:19.000 --> 18:28.000
And I played that goggle game, not the Oculus-type game, with the Samsung headset.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
I was just about to ask this because they were demoing a game on Oculus,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
and I apologize so much to these creators because I forget the names of the games in the moment.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
But there was one on the Oculus, and there was one using the Gear VR.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
And you played the Gear VR one, right?

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
I did because it can be adjusted to near-sighted.

18:43.000 --> 18:51.000
And you know what's funny is that I was actually speaking an email with the creators, and I think I CC'd you on my reply.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
I don't know if you got it.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.000
Yeah, I probably did, but trying to organize stuff for a few weeks out.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
Well, yeah, but I'm trying...

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
Yeah, I've got the email right here so I can actually get the name.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
It was...

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Oh, yeah, it was Bizarre VR.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
Oh, okay.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
That was it.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I knew it had something to do with Bizarre, but I wanted to make sure.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.000
But yeah, it was pretty fun, and there were great people.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
Her name was Teresa working there, which I would love to have them on the show too.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Have her on the show.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
We'll make it happen. We will.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Yeah.

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
But at any rate, those were the big things that I played.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
I tried a few other things, but those were really my two.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
I gotta back up though for a minute when you talk about VR,

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
because you have openly talked on the show about that a lot of first-person games will make you very motion sick,

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
and you don't like to play things like Skyrim in first person,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
because that can really kind of mess with you.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
And it happens.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
After playing Fast Racing Neo this week, which I'll talk about later,

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
I can totally see how that happens to people.

19:53.000 --> 19:57.000
So I can imagine there might have been some hesitation to get into VR,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
but how did that go for you, all things considered?

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
I wonder if part of it was because I wasn't wearing my glasses.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
But I seem to do just fine.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
After a little while, I got a headache, which is about normal.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
It got a little queasy, like with some of the turns,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
but it was really smooth for the most part,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
and there is a big part of me that's wondering if it's because of my glasses.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Interesting.

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
The fact that I was pretty much using unfiltered glasses.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
I'm going to break down a little science here.

20:27.000 --> 20:34.000
Glasses will refract light so that your eyeballs will see it at the right magnificence.

20:34.000 --> 20:40.000
Instead of having the focal point be in a place other than where your eyes are set to look at.

20:40.000 --> 20:48.000
So in this case, it was actually being projected to me at what was fine for my eyes.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
And I think that something in that might have made it to where I didn't get as motion sick,

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
because I didn't get the same kind of weird eye strain that I get with monitors and things too.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
It just wasn't there.

21:01.000 --> 21:07.000
I suppose this is a question worth asking. What was the game? What was the experience in there?

21:07.000 --> 21:13.000
You basically float around on a flying carpet, and you look around for missing things in each level.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
And you can find coins.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
Oh, so when you say Bazaar, it's like Aladdin's...

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
B-A-Z-A-A-R.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
Not like Bazaar, Love Triangle, which is what came to my mind.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Bazaar, not Bizzar.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Does it play New Order?

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
No, but the music's really good in it.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
I liked it. She was talking about the composer.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
Oh, cool.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
But yeah, the music was really good.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
Basically, you go through these different floating levels.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
Well, you're on the carpet, but you're over a canal.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
And then you have to look for the different pieces.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And it's funny, if you look up, you can see the sky.

21:48.000 --> 21:52.000
And you've got constellations that match the different things that you're looking for.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
So you get all the pieces for that, and then you unlock the next level.

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
And you've got a shop that you can pick up extra Turkish Delight and other things.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
I'm wondering if there's going to be more stuff added, like enemies and things, as you go.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
Well, I'm sure a lot of these games were in early development.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
But it was very pink.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
But it was a pretty good game.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
It was a pretty good game. I was very pleased with it.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
I had a lot of fun playing it.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
I probably could have kept going, if not for a little bit of a headache.

22:25.000 --> 22:32.000
Just the one thing that actually really helped me stay centered is keeping my hand on the table.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Because my feet were rooted, right?

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
But keeping my hand on the table kind of connected me back.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
Yeah, it kind of didn't let you go all in.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
It kept you grounded, literally, like a lightning rod or something.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I would say more that it kept me oriented.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
Okay.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
So that I knew which way I was facing.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
And if I couldn't find the table with my hand, I knew that I was facing away from the table.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Because it would have been behind me.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
Okay.

23:02.000 --> 23:11.000
So it really was like my anchor, in this case, kept me focused on where my directions were and where I was facing.

23:11.000 --> 23:19.000
So that I knew at any given point that if I had to take that thing off and run, for example, I know I'd be going in the right direction.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I'd know which way to turn.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.000
Which is, it's actually always been a thing for me, is always knowing where my exit routes are.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.000
So Jamie survived her first Gear VR experience and didn't get sick or anything.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Didn't have a panic attack.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.000
Had some ideas on how to make that experience work for you.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.000
That's great.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
It was a cute game and I really had a good time.

23:38.000 --> 23:49.000
I'd like to see, actually, Dan and I were talking about this today, where we were talking about how they have those VR sets and would love to see something like that for iOS.

23:49.000 --> 23:55.000
Having something like that would definitely open doors for more gamers.

23:55.000 --> 24:04.000
And honestly enough, I could see things like that really working well with Google Maps, for example, how you have that walk view.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Imagine having virtual tours and whatnot.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Or say people, here's a business idea.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
Virtual house tours if you're buying a model home.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
And if you say, oh, well, I like this, but I want a counter here.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
Or you look at the thing and navigate the menu.

24:21.000 --> 24:26.000
You know how people will move to a city they haven't even been to yet because of a job or something?

24:26.000 --> 24:30.000
And they have to like get an apartment kind of like unseen?

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Like a VR experience could really bring that to you.

24:33.000 --> 24:43.000
I mean, it's interesting that we're having this conversation because, you know, you go back a few months ago to one of the big stories with VR that Facebook bought Oculus, right?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
And people are like, why does Facebook want to get into gaming?

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
And it's like, yo, there's way more to Oculus than just gaming.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
And there's a great example, although I feel like I should patent pending.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
That's my business because I could make some money on that.

24:55.000 --> 24:59.000
There's also people who, well, like for me being nearsighted, that's one thing.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
I could take off my glasses and see just fine in the game.

25:02.000 --> 25:12.000
And if you have people with, say, who have to have like things magnified for them, you have that adjustable thing on the goggle.

25:12.000 --> 25:24.000
And, you know, it can help people who may have difficulty seeing in general or, you know, something that can change brightness and everything for people with dim vision, stuff like that, improve contrast.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
You know, it could be possible that you even have like another camera on the other side.

25:29.000 --> 25:35.000
I mean, there's all kinds of ideas for application of things like that.

25:35.000 --> 25:43.000
But for the most part, you know, despite, you know, we could speculate all night about, you know, what type of things we could see come out of that type of technology.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
But in the end, I mean, I have no problem with games.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
We can do some games too over there.

25:50.000 --> 25:56.000
S21 Hunter Matt noting in the chat over at live.vognetwork.com, all three OLR hosts have dove into the Rift now.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Yes, that is, well, technically you didn't do the Rift.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
I didn't do the Rift because I couldn't wear my glasses with the Oculus Rift.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.000
But, you know, we've all had the VR headset experience, modern.

26:05.000 --> 26:18.000
Is there something else that occurred to me? Do you remember E3 a while back where they had the sphere that you touch it and it gives you like almost topographical feedback where it would develop texture?

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Yes.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.000
Could you imagine something like that with the Oculus?

26:22.000 --> 26:29.000
You know, that was a rumor for, believe it or not, that's been a rumor for Nintendo's DS at one point that it would have something like that.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
And it was a rumor for iPhones at one point.

26:32.000 --> 26:39.000
And I think iPhones did the reverse of that with the force push that they have in the, I'm talking like it's Star Wars, but you know what I mean?

26:39.000 --> 26:42.000
Like the force feedback thing they have in the new iPhones.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
3D touch.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Yeah, that's it. 3D touch.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
However, it has done kind of the reverse in the form of the haptic feedback on the Apple Watch.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.000
Ah, gotcha.

26:52.000 --> 27:02.000
Basically it's, for me, my haptic feedback is, you got a text message and turn bitch for my directions. Or get off your ass and stand up.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
Loki, were you trying to add something here a minute ago to the VR discussion? I'm sorry.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
No.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
I thought I saw you pick up your mic. All right.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Well, he could have picked up his mic because he wanted to.

27:10.000 --> 27:19.000
Ah, maybe. Who knows? Quickly, quickly before we get to our guests tonight, I know there was some other stuff in the exhibit hall too, a lot of crafters that kind of make their own things.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Yeah, I was hanging out with the artists like the entire time. It was great.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Yeah, some really talented people in there.

27:23.000 --> 27:29.000
Made some good friends there. Um, actually did like a little fake, uh, menorah lighting with one of them. It was great.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
And you know, and basically I watched her booth so she could get a beer.

27:34.000 --> 27:47.000
They were giving the beers out. Because yeah, they gave us beer and it was great. Um, thank you Intel for beer. Um, I actually hung out with a few people from Intel just talking chop for a while.

27:47.000 --> 27:56.000
They had a really interesting booth where they had walls where you could basically write down and it was these questions like, what do you want to see in gaming in a few years?

27:56.000 --> 28:10.000
And what do you, you know, these very, especially considering the audience that GX targets, which is this very diverse audience that sometimes feels like in that Xbox Live culture where a lot of nasty things are flinged around that maybe they don't fit in.

28:10.000 --> 28:15.000
It was very interesting to see kind of a lot of what was written on the wall. I thought that was a very neat idea.

28:15.000 --> 28:25.000
But I will say this, I don't know how you feel about this dark soccer, but I would say, and I just want to say footnote, I don't want this to read as like a huge negative or anything because I love gamer X. I love GX.

28:25.000 --> 28:37.000
I financially supported this expo in a big way this year. But I found that in the expo hall, I was a little taken aback by how you had some big exhibitors there that didn't really bring games.

28:37.000 --> 28:48.000
Like you have Blizzard, you have Blizzard that was there with Jobs or whatever. Intel had their walls, but that was cool. And they gave away cookies. So I'm not going to, but the rock band area was fun.

28:48.000 --> 28:59.000
The rock band did it right. But I thought it was so weird that Blizzard had this big presence and it was like, they were, they had a job seeker there and it was like, no, no Overwatch, no World of Warcraft.

28:59.000 --> 29:07.000
I actually did talk with the ladies there for a while. And they were both, yeah, like, yeah, the whole company's buckling down for stuff right now.

29:07.000 --> 29:21.000
Yeah. And Overwatch has been down for maintenance too. So maybe that, that came into play too. But I just, I was kind of surprised, especially coming off of last year where you had Gearbox was there showing Borderlands, the pre-sequel or whatever it was.

29:21.000 --> 29:36.000
That was the first time that was playable was at the last GX. Not that I'm saying I expect cutting edge stuff out of the expo. I was just surprised that the expo hall itself only had the indie games, which is great because I found a lot of good stuff there.

29:36.000 --> 29:45.000
But it didn't have any corporate games considering all that corporate support that went into it. I'm just, I was a little surprised by that compared to last year.

29:45.000 --> 29:55.000
But again, I don't want that to read like a negative because I do think the con is doing some good things. And I kind of think everybody involved realizes that. I don't think I'm the first person to say that.

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
And so I kind of think that's already on their radar for what can we do next year to put, put the bigger game in GamerX.

30:02.000 --> 30:11.000
The only reason I wish we'd been able to stay for the closing ceremonies and feedback was to please beg for the cosplay contest to go back to the Saturday night instead of Sunday.

30:11.000 --> 30:21.000
I have a feeling the only reason it was on Sunday was because the talent that hosted it. That was the day they were in town. I have a weird feeling. But then again, they were there Saturday night because they came by the table Saturday night. So I don't know.

30:21.000 --> 30:28.000
And that's just a lot of, especially since like us, we checked out of our hotel.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

30:29.000 --> 30:40.000
And when you are dealing with that much crap, you know, props and your costume and needing help because Alan had to help me change into parts of my costume.

30:40.000 --> 30:46.000
You need to have access to your hotel room for that kind of stuff. So.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
But other than that, I mean, everything was really smooth. The cosplay contest in general was run a lot more smoothly than it was last year.

30:53.000 --> 31:02.000
Yeah. And I thought, I did, I did want to say the space, you know, it was a big transition for them to go from San Francisco to San Jose. I love the new space.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
It worked so much.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
It worked so much better. So much more room to move around. The convention center was great.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
It felt more con like.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Yes.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Than.

31:11.000 --> 31:20.000
Although I kind of felt like they probably could have sold more tickets. I mean, from what I heard, it was close to a sellout, but it didn't look like, I kind of feel like they could have packed more people in there if they wanted to.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
I think it'll get bigger. I don't know if it's going to be Fauna Mae big for a while, but.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
No, no, I know.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
It's going to get bigger.

31:26.000 --> 31:32.000
Yeah. And again, there were so many great things come out of it. So much networking that I did. Like, I'm not, I had a great time and just the festivities.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
I just made a lot of friends.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
Yeah.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.000
Yeah.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
It was just hanging with cool people.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Yeah.

31:37.000 --> 31:46.000
One of the cool people we met at the convention, uh, down had the booth, like right near us. And we were looking at that game going, what is that? That looks kind of like, is that dodge ball?

31:46.000 --> 31:53.000
What is that? That guy's playing over there. And, uh, turns out, uh, it's a game called super slam dunk touchdown.

31:53.000 --> 32:02.000
And it's like a bunch of eight bit sports games all rolled into one. And, uh, we played roller derby character is the best. We played it.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.000
We had a lot of fun with it. And I was like, Oh, we got to get you on the show. When, when does it come out?

32:06.000 --> 32:15.000
And he said this week I was like, Oh, well shoot. So we're going to get them on the line right now. We're going to, uh, give Rick a call and Rick is with tipping goat games.

32:15.000 --> 32:22.000
And he's going to talk to us tonight about this game, super slam dunk touchdown. And I think we have them on the line. Rick, are you there?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
Yes. Hello. Thanks for having me.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Hey, no problem, Rick. Thanks so much for being here.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
My pleasure.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
How was, uh, how was GX for you? Did you have a good time at the show?

32:30.000 --> 32:37.000
I had a great time. It was, uh, I've done a lot of expos and so they've ranged from nightmarish to, uh, just a pleasant time.

32:37.000 --> 32:42.000
And that was on the positive end of the spectrum. So I'm positive, uh, about that show. It was a good show.

32:42.000 --> 32:49.000
Now. I didn't realize this about you when we were playing the game and, and there at the expo, but that GX was kind of in your backyard.

32:49.000 --> 32:52.000
It was local to you, right? So that, that must've made it very convenient.

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
Oh yeah. It was super easy. Just parked, carried my stuff in. I was done.

32:56.000 --> 33:05.000
I know that was, that was the great thing about us having a table that didn't involve computers or any of that stuff, because it's like we could just kind of carry it all in one setting. It was great.

33:05.000 --> 33:13.000
Um, so tell us a little bit about a super slam dunk touchdown for those of our listeners out there who weren't at GX, which is unfortunately most people.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
Uh, tell us a little bit about the game and what it looks like and what it's like.

33:17.000 --> 33:32.000
Uh, sure. It's a local multiplayer irreverent all sports mashup. Uh, so as you mentioned 8-bit, uh, games, it's sort of inspired by 8 and 16-bit era games that didn't take themselves terribly seriously, the sports games of that era.

33:32.000 --> 33:45.000
Uh, so you mentioned Super Dodge Ball, which is a, a lot of people make that comparison as well. Um, so it looks, it looks retro. It's, it's got 8, 16-bit sort of graphics, but it's actually driven by 3D physics. So there's kind of nuance to how the balls move and everything.

33:45.000 --> 33:53.000
Hmm. How did you, uh, how did you get inspired to do a game like this? Where did it, where did it come from when you, when you put pen to paper and said, this is the game I want to make?

33:53.000 --> 34:05.000
This game has been burning a hole in my brain for about, about six years now. I finally have been able to release it, but, uh, yeah, about six years ago, I was like, I really want to make an all sports crazy mashup game.

34:05.000 --> 34:19.000
And it probably comes from just growing up in an era of local multiplayer. That was the only kind of multiplayer back then. And, uh, I, I feel like social gaming to me is people hanging out together playing a game. And, uh, so I wanted to make something like that.

34:19.000 --> 34:41.000
Uh, and, uh, again, if you want to ask Rick a question about Super Slam Dunk Touchdown, you can over at live.vognetwork.com in our chat room over there. Um, so I noticed, uh, you talking a lot about local multiplayer and, uh, I noticed when you came to the show, you brought like four separate controllers. You had everything. You were really stressing that this is, this is a party game, right?

34:41.000 --> 34:49.000
So if I were to ask about, well, what about online? What, what, what's your thoughts on that? I mean, online, just not in the cards free? That's not what you want this to be?

34:49.000 --> 34:53.000
Well, first off, there was six controllers. We do up to six players locally on Windows.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Oh, my bad. My bad. I forgot how to count.

34:56.000 --> 35:06.000
Well, if I wanted to take maybe, I don't know, three to six months and really try to make it online, I probably could do that. But that's not really the heart and soul of what this game is about.

35:06.000 --> 35:15.000
And, uh, it's really about yelling at your teammates and, uh, you know, having a good time together. So I think having people in front of the TV is a better experience for this title.

35:15.000 --> 35:25.000
Um, that said, if I had, you know, unlimited funding, I'd love to pay somebody to add an online component, but we're a very, very small studio, uh, with a total employee count of one.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.000
I was about to say, is it just you that's doing all this?

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
Uh, well, I contract out the art, uh, as money comes in, but yeah, it's just me.

35:34.000 --> 35:41.000
Got it. Wow. That's still very impressive for such a small studio of one basically to have created something like this. So props to you.

35:41.000 --> 35:49.000
This must be, how are you feeling this week with the big release and the whole kind of making that transition from early access to a full release? How are you feeling?

35:49.000 --> 36:03.000
I have to, I'll be honest. I kind of feel like a college senior, just sort of sliding the paper under the door at 11 59. You know, I just, just get it out there. I'm going to go lay down.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
It's been, it's been a long, long year and a half since I've been working on this and I'm looking forward to the break.

36:08.000 --> 36:18.000
What are some of the reactions you see when you see people playing your game at expos? Because again, you are bringing this full, you, you, you bring this game to cons the way it's meant to be played.

36:18.000 --> 36:28.000
And so you're able to get, you know, sometimes, sometimes I can't get five people over to my house to play a video game. I mean, if I have, you know, liquor maybe, but at a con, it's very easy to get that together.

36:28.000 --> 36:35.000
So you must see all sorts of, of great reactions. What do you, what do you, what do you kind of see from the people to play your game at cons?

36:35.000 --> 36:45.000
Well, there's several stages. First, it's like confusion because they're not sure what it is they're looking at. And then their brain tries to tell them what they're looking at, but they still don't really believe it.

36:45.000 --> 36:53.000
So they have to come over and then they see what it is and that it's real and then they want to play. And then they find out it's six players and you know, there's a critical mass problem at these conventions.

36:53.000 --> 37:00.000
If I get one or two people playing, it's pretty easy to get six, but if it's empty, it's a little harder.

37:00.000 --> 37:14.000
What, now for those that don't know, what is the object of the game? Because they, you might look at it and you see, okay, I've got this soccer goal and it's got a basketball hoop on it. And then there's like that, that touchdown tee. What, what, what is the object? Yeah, goal pose.

37:14.000 --> 37:34.000
Just in plain, simple terms, you're taking your sports players, a whole team of sports players, and you're trying to maneuver the ball or puck or whatever it is through one of the goal areas, which could be a lower net, it could be a basketball style hoop, or it could be the uprights, the football, American football style field goal pose.

37:34.000 --> 37:51.000
So there's different ways to score and then all the different players are kind of playing their own way. So baseball players hitting pop flies, the hockey players hitting slap shots, the soccer players kicking, the American football players tossing spirals. And so you mix all that together and it becomes a crazy 3D physics team based sports game.

37:52.000 --> 38:15.000
Now, I noticed that it wasn't really just the sports players and the sports balls themselves that were all coming together. But as I was playing, I was playing the game earlier today to, you know, prepare for this. And I noticed that there was a lot of just other, for lack of a better term, crazy shit that would happen while you're playing the game. Like the marching band would just start running right through the middle of the game doing their thing.

38:16.000 --> 38:35.000
And then I think my derby girl got three shots in a row. So of course, as what happens in hockey when you get three shots in a row, hats start flying all over the arena. And just all this crazy stuff starts happening. Where did you come up with all these ideas and what made you think like, oh, I just want to get it crazier with all this stuff?

38:35.000 --> 38:58.000
Well, it's just things that pop up in your brain when you think sports. And, you know, these are things. Hat trick, that's a thing. You know, if you ask somebody who doesn't know anything about sports, they'll just name some terms. And so it's sort of just, you know, the marching band shows up. Doesn't show up in the middle of the match, but it's more fun that way. So it's kind of just putting as much sports in as small a tight a space as we can and just seeing what happens.

38:58.000 --> 39:08.000
Now, am I crazy? Or did I see a streaker? Because I swear to God, the other team all of a sudden had a player running around the back of the goalpost who was just naked. Like, is that thing?

39:08.000 --> 39:23.000
That's a thing. We just released an update. He used to kind of just drop from the ceiling, but now he's hiding in the crowd. So if you look in the crowd as you're playing and you see a shady guy with the trench coat on, watch out because he might jump into the arena and try to steal the ball.

39:23.000 --> 39:32.000
That cracked me up because, I mean, the art is done so tastefully that you're not going to see anything that's going to make this game get an AO rating, right?

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Fortunately, we're dealing with subpixels there.

39:34.000 --> 39:44.000
Yeah, exactly, right. So you can't really see anything, but it's just kind of like, because I kind of did a double take. I'm like, first off, who is that guy? And second off, does he have no clothes on? What is he doing?

39:44.000 --> 39:49.000
But I didn't even realize that he had jumped in from the crowd just because there's so much other stuff going on.

39:50.000 --> 40:03.000
Oh, that's new. That's new. So I'm posting updates. We've done our first post-release update. There's going to be a season mode expansion next year, so I'm continuously trying to improve the game and making it better for a hopeful, eventual console release.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.000
Oh, nice. What consoles are you looking at?

40:06.000 --> 40:10.000
I'm under tight lips right now. I can't say much.

40:10.000 --> 40:22.000
All right, fair enough. You come back when you can tell us. So what else was I going to say? There are some modes in the game. There's what? There's two modes in the game now? There's the challenge mode and kind of the quick play mode, right?

40:22.000 --> 40:26.000
Yep, you can also battle the ending credits if you want to do that.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
I somehow missed that. You can battle the credits?

40:29.000 --> 40:35.000
Yes, and there's a shot practice mode too, which I encourage everybody to try that just to get the feel for the game before the AI starts beating you up.

40:35.000 --> 40:45.000
But yeah, you battle the credits. Do you remember Altered Beast on the Sega Genesis did that? You beat the game and then the credits would come down and they'd start knocking you out. So that sort of stuck with me and I was like, let's get our revenge. Let's beat up the credits.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
So the credits is made of balls and you can throw them at each other.

40:48.000 --> 40:55.000
That kind of happens in Super Smash Brothers as well with the credit roll, but it's a little different, but I love that.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
And yeah, DarkTetsuya making that same comparison in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com.

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
Going to some other questions from our chat room over at live.vognetware.com, SSJ100Matt says,

41:05.000 --> 41:18.000
So I see a lot of sources of inspiration in the game like Blades of Steel, Double Dribble, Tecmo Super Bowl, Super Dodge Ball, Nintendo World Cup, Hit the Ice, NHL 94, NBA Jam. Am I missing anything?

41:18.000 --> 41:25.000
Oh sure, yeah. You've got Speedball was one. Is NES Ice Hockey in that list?

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
Nope, NES Ice Hockey was not in the list.

41:27.000 --> 41:37.000
There was one, Pigskin, I forget the year, it was like 320 AD or something like that, but it was like a medieval Pigskin game where you have pits that you can fall in and a bunch of guys beating each other up.

41:37.000 --> 41:44.000
So that whole era, I guess they couldn't do a realistic sports game very well, so they said, oh well, let's just make it fun. And that's kind of what this game's about.

41:45.000 --> 42:01.000
I probably told you this when I was playing the game for the first time, I'm not really a sports ball kind of guy. I enjoy going to a hockey game and occasionally a basketball game, but I'm horrible at playing the real thing and I don't get as into it as a lot of other people my age do.

42:01.000 --> 42:18.000
So when games were NBA Jam or Tecmo Bowl, when it was very arcade-y in the element of it, that's when I loved sports games the most. And I'm assuming you must find the same thing to be similar or true as well to have been inspired to make a game like this, right?

42:18.000 --> 42:33.000
Absolutely. Yeah, those games were fun. Anyone can pick them up, so this game has three buttons and an analog stick, so anybody can pick this up. There's a lot to learn, there's a lot you can learn about the different players and everything, but at its heart it's a very accessible experience, which I think it should be.

42:33.000 --> 42:47.000
And you and I were having a conversation about how newer sports games like the Madden's of the world and so forth are oftentimes, I think you called them simulations, and I thought that was a really good kind of comparison. Does this game get anything from newer sports titles?

42:47.000 --> 43:10.000
I'll be honest, the newest sports title that I'm able to play would be some iteration of Virtuit Tennis, which is kind of similar. You had analog stick and a few buttons. I tried to play a modern soccer game that there was a demo for on PlayStation, and you literally had to juggle the ball with the stick. You couldn't just move the guy, you had to actually try to keep the ball from getting away from you, and I'm like, this is way too much.

43:11.000 --> 43:19.000
You know what I'll tell you is one of the best sports games to come out in years and years besides, of course, Super Slam Dunk Touchdown. I'll tell you, it's Rocket League.

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
Oh yes, yes. I have not had a chance to play that, I'm afraid it's going to suck me in.

43:24.000 --> 43:32.000
Yeah, I wouldn't doubt you're going to play it and then all of a sudden a car is going to show up in Super Slam Dunk Touchdown somewhere, I'll tell you.

43:32.000 --> 43:45.000
But that's kind of the same thing where it's like a sports game. Well, it's not really a sport, but it kind of is. It's just fun and silly and easily accessible. Because everybody knows how to drive a video game car. It's accelerate and brake. Very, very easy.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.000
Brake?

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
Yeah, who uses the brake? Who uses that?

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
That's what the walls are for.

43:52.000 --> 44:07.000
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, a sports game with very simple controls that doesn't require you to do complicated button combinations would be more fun to play. And I noticed that is kind of part of your game, right? It's like two or three buttons tops, right?

44:07.000 --> 44:19.000
Yeah, one of them's passed, so you're hardly using that unless your teammate has the ball or you want to send it over there. There's a shoot button, that's the main button. And then there's a turbo boost, so that's pretty much like NBA Jam in terms of number of buttons.

44:19.000 --> 44:30.000
And then I noticed that, I guess the shoot button would also double as the fight button. And if you can get enough people in the fight, it'll turn into this cartoon cloud that starts flying all over the arena, right?

44:30.000 --> 44:50.000
Yeah, and that was actually a product of user feedback. So I used to do playtest parties early on to get local multiplayer feedback, and the chaos of the game was a little too much for people. So that rowdy cloud, as I call it, sucks people in. If they're getting too violent, let's put them in one place and they can mash their buttons and let the guy who's not in that fight try to shoot and win the game.

44:50.000 --> 45:18.000
I've noticed that your game has gone through some changes with graphics, too, because I saw some screenshots and I think some material you've done for PAX, and the slam dunk sequence looked very different than it does now. Before it was kind of, I don't want to say it was plain, but it was a little plainer. But now it looks like you got the full audience. It looks like that double dribble thing we all remember from when we were kids, which had to be an influence, I'm sure, right?

45:18.000 --> 45:36.000
Yeah, I definitely wanted to do that, but I wanted to make it interactive. And the old art, which has been kind of the bane of my existence this year, has been slowly getting replaced. And the art that you might be referring to, the early art, I actually drew that over Christmas right after my artist decided to pursue other projects.

45:36.000 --> 45:48.000
So that has been programmer art that has been in the game for a long time, and I'm so happy to have replaced that with the really nice looking, as you said, inspired by double dribble dunk sequences.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
How many changes did your game go through in development?

45:53.000 --> 46:20.000
It went through a lot of evolutions. If you go back and look at the very early videos, you can tell it's just a super primitive version of what it is now. The main things were with player feedback and just letting people know what was going on. So there's an aiming cursor, you can tell which direction you're pointing while you're aiming, which is helpful. There's a pass cursor that shows up when you're being passed to, so little things like that that just kind of clue people in. The player selection screen went through about three or four different durations to get where it is now.

46:21.000 --> 46:26.000
Now, this game was on early access for a little while. How long were you on early access until the release this week?

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
It was about three months, I think.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
And did you get feedback through that process as well? How did that work?

46:32.000 --> 46:40.000
That was great, because it was pulling teeth sometimes after my same friends had played the game, and they were like, okay, let's play a different game. We've been playing this all summer.

46:40.000 --> 46:46.000
But when it goes into early access, suddenly all these people are playing and they're on the Steam forums, and it's like, okay, cool.

46:46.000 --> 46:54.000
Now I've got feedback from fresh players, they're seeing it with fresh eyes, I'm getting good reactions, honest reactions.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
And you kind of have to, as a developer, take everything everybody says very seriously.

46:58.000 --> 47:05.000
Because if there's a problem, if they're not playing the game what you think is correctly, then you're not communicating it correctly to them.

47:05.000 --> 47:11.000
So it's been very useful. So thanks to everybody on the Steam forums, and please do jump on there if you've got any feedback.

47:11.000 --> 47:16.000
I bet a lot of us sometimes take that for granted, especially if we're developing.

47:16.000 --> 47:29.000
And not that everybody listening to this show necessarily develops full-on games, but something like Super Mario Maker I think has really opened it up so that some people can kind of experience what that process is like a little bit.

47:29.000 --> 47:37.000
And I know I'm fascinated when I watch people play a level that I made in Mario Maker on YouTube or Twitch or something.

47:37.000 --> 47:42.000
And it's like, that is not how I intended people to get past that part of the game.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
Or that is not how you're supposed to do that part, but they did it.

47:46.000 --> 47:54.000
And that's got to be even exponentially the case when you're making a full-fledged game as opposed to a level in Mario.

47:55.000 --> 48:00.000
Well that's the joy of it, because you see things for the first time because somebody will be playing it in a way that you've never played it before.

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
And sometimes that leads to bugs, but other times it leads to just really hilarious stuff.

48:04.000 --> 48:13.000
One of the things that happened during a convention, there was a fight and the ball got knocked just because of the 3D physics so high that it went off the screen for like a good 3 or 4 seconds.

48:13.000 --> 48:16.000
And I thought, okay, that's interesting, that's new.

48:16.000 --> 48:22.000
So I actually put a ceiling on the game now, and if it goes up that high you can actually knock a light loose, it'll fall down and land on the field.

48:22.000 --> 48:27.000
So it's just by observing how people play the game we can add to it and make it more fun.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.000
Awesome. Let me get to one more question here from our chat room.

48:30.000 --> 48:37.000
S2100Matt asking, you were able to get this done in a year and a half, which is an impressive feat considering how polished the game looks.

48:37.000 --> 48:43.000
How much of your time was taken up with development versus work versus real life stuff? Did you even sleep?

48:44.000 --> 48:54.000
I did sleep, but that's about all I did. I actually quit my job in May of 2014 to work on this game and have been working non-stop ever since then.

48:54.000 --> 48:59.000
And I mentioned the crisis over Christmas last year, that basically, that crisis didn't stop until launch.

48:59.000 --> 49:05.000
So it's been a lot of work, it's been a lot of fun, it's been up and down in all directions.

49:05.000 --> 49:12.000
Well congratulations on the launch of the game. And again, radio can only go so far as to what this game really looks like.

49:12.000 --> 49:18.000
I do encourage you guys to go check it out. On the Steam store, super slam dunk touchdown.

49:18.000 --> 49:25.000
Rick, any other websites or social media for our listeners to see more about this game?

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
Sure, you can check out our Facebook page, you can follow me on Twitter, Tipping Goat.

49:30.000 --> 49:37.000
And we also have a webpage at tippinggoat.com. I'm also very active on the Steam forums and there is a subreddit at SSDTouchdown.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
So whatever your network of choice.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
Very cool. And I'm hoping to get a YouTube done of some play this week.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
I wanted to do that today and then all the computer stuff started happening here in studio.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
So I'm going to try to get that on my YouTube channel a little later this week, so that'll be something as well.

49:52.000 --> 49:59.000
And yeah, I do definitely encourage people to at least give the game a look and I think it's going to kind of get you right in that feel.

49:59.000 --> 50:07.000
Where Blades of Steel and Double Dribble and NBA Jam and those games back when sports games were arcadey and fun.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
I think it's going to get you in that same spot. So congrats to you, Rick.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
Thank you.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Alright, best of luck with the game and thanks for being on OLR tonight.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.000
Thanks for having me.

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Alright, take care. Bye bye.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
You too.

50:17.000 --> 50:23.000
Alright, that was Rick with Tipping Goat Games and the game there Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
Dark Soccer, I know you got to play that as well at the Con and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
I had a good time.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.000
Yeah.

50:30.000 --> 50:31.000
I had a really good time.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
Although, I don't know why I just kept blanking on the name over and over, but it's still funny.

50:36.000 --> 50:40.000
Well, it is kind of all these different sports terms all together.

50:40.000 --> 50:43.000
The goal is to sport harder than the other people.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
I think it seems like it can be set up kind of very similar to iDarb where they have...

50:48.000 --> 50:55.000
Maybe even if he doesn't do internet play over the internet, like multiplayer, he can do maybe some sort of Twitch support or something like that.

50:55.000 --> 51:01.000
With all the iDarb crap where he can put keywords in and silly shit happens.

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
Oh yeah, maybe some of that audience stuff, like the streakers and all that stuff. That might be kind of fun.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.000
Like maybe some of that stuff.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.000
Throw some power ups, like t-shirt cannons or something like that. That would be pretty awesome.

51:11.000 --> 51:18.000
Or maybe, and I don't know how difficult this is, I mean we spout them off like they're no problem at all, but we have to remember he's only a team of one.

51:18.000 --> 51:24.000
And I forgot to ask him about this, but there's some really silly advertisements that you see in the background.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
Try Food.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Yeah, Try Food was one of them.

51:27.000 --> 51:32.000
And I was like, I think I will try eating at some point. There's just some silly stuff there.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
I should do that.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
Yeah, I should try food someday. I might be good.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Alright, well again, best of luck to him.

51:39.000 --> 51:50.000
It was a lot of fun to play and I hope he's able to get the money back for the time invested and he can look at making whatever game he wants to do next.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Maybe some more retro inspired stuff there.

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
So again, that's super slam dunk touchdown.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
Look at that, Dungeon Buster in chat giving a link there to our listeners if they want to check that out on the Steam store.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
I believe it's $14.99. That's how much that is.

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
Alright, we're going to get into news and talk about what else has been going on in the video game world this week.

52:08.000 --> 52:14.000
But I do want to take a chance to go around and ask what types of video games have you been playing this week?

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
We always like to talk about how was your gaming week.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.000
So outside of the con, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

52:20.000 --> 52:35.000
It was very TurboGrafx oriented with some Adventure Island, Monster Boy, Bonk.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
We had Bonk. We had Magical Chase. A lot of Magical Chase.

52:39.000 --> 52:45.000
Some Proteus Da. Twinbee.

52:45.000 --> 52:53.000
I didn't play any Dragon Age. And I played some Animal Crossing, the Happy Cam Designer.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
That was for the most part quite the retro-tastic week. What brought that on?

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
Getting our Turbo EverDrive.

52:59.000 --> 53:09.000
That works. Alright. I have a feeling that will come back to us a little later when we get into the classic game of the week. We'll see.

53:09.000 --> 53:12.000
Meanwhile, let's go over to Loki. How was your gaming week?

53:12.000 --> 53:22.000
Well, I played quite a bit actually. I played lots of Fallout 4. So I'm like, gosh. I don't even know how many hours into the game.

53:22.000 --> 53:31.000
I think it's counting in days now. So I'm at least two days in. I'd say maybe 60 hours or so. I don't remember yet.

53:31.000 --> 53:37.000
So I'm pretty far. Still really enjoying that. It's kind of fun just to wander around. I'm enjoying it like Skyrim.

53:37.000 --> 53:46.000
And cheating in it like Skyrim. Exploiting every possible console glitch hack I could possibly do and I'm enjoying that while I can.

53:46.000 --> 53:53.000
I do want to play through it again. Actually, once I'm done with this one. Someone came up with the idea of doing a faction-less one.

53:53.000 --> 54:00.000
So instead of joining one of the factions you just fucking kill everybody and be an asshole to everybody. I'm like, yes! I will do that.

54:00.000 --> 54:05.000
That is what I want to do next time. So that's what I'm going to do.

54:05.000 --> 54:13.000
Just Cause 3. Tried playing that a little bit. But it's a fucking mess. And it's really disappointing because I really want to play that game.

54:13.000 --> 54:21.000
But I cannot handle trying to play one of the challenges to unlock stuff in the game and having a three minute load time in between every time I retry that.

54:21.000 --> 54:25.000
Fuck that. I am not playing that game until that's fixed.

54:25.000 --> 54:36.000
I also played Minecraft on the Wii U. Cause my son wanted Minecraft on the Wii U cause he wanted to play on the screen.

54:36.000 --> 54:45.000
And so I did that and I downloaded it and played with the controller. I fucking hate the Wii U controller with that game.

54:46.000 --> 54:52.000
The button placement stuff is very awkward. I don't like how the buttons are below the analog stick.

54:52.000 --> 54:59.000
PlayStation and Xbox controls work a lot better for me. But that is just frustrating. I don't even want to play it.

54:59.000 --> 55:10.000
And the text is so small on that screen. You would think like, hmm, we have this on the second screen. Maybe we should make the menus and UI fucking readable.

55:10.000 --> 55:16.000
Nope. Let's make it fucking, just shrink it down. Make it super microscopic so you can't fucking read anything.

55:16.000 --> 55:25.000
I'm really disappointed at what a lazy port cash in Minecraft Wii U is. I mean, for all the potential that's there with the touch screen.

55:25.000 --> 55:31.000
I just, I really feel like this is a whole, well, it's either A, well, we gotta shut the Nintendo fans up.

55:31.000 --> 55:37.000
Or B, well, we gotta make money from the Nintendo fans by just, you know, copy pasting.

55:37.000 --> 55:42.000
You know, I really wish they had done more with what the Wii U was intended for.

55:42.000 --> 55:49.000
I mean, shit, they're making tons of money from me. I bought it on pretty much every console, so I don't know why.

55:49.000 --> 55:55.000
But, yeah, my son wants to play it. He enjoys it. That's fine. But I find the controls frustrating and I'll play it on any other system.

55:55.000 --> 56:01.000
I just don't want to play it on that one. Especially since it's missing features that are on the other systems. No, no thanks.

56:01.000 --> 56:13.000
But I bought it, so I guess you win. And then I bought Earth Defense Force 4.1. I wasn't gonna technically buy that, but Eric wanted to play and then he bailed out.

56:13.000 --> 56:21.000
So I spent the money on it for no reason, but I did. But it's fine. I'm sure we'll hook up another day.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
But I played through it a little bit and it's really hard. I tried like, well, I'm gonna bump it up with a hard one.

56:26.000 --> 56:36.000
And it's like, this is really frustrating. And it's frustrating in the fact that they've changed how some of the ants and stuff attack you, so now they can shake you around and you're supposed to be able to shoot them while they're doing that.

56:36.000 --> 56:46.000
And it's fucking annoying. It's just like, I don't know. It's kind of cheap, I guess, in that sense. But, whatever. That's the type of game it is. It's supposed to be frustratingly hard.

56:46.000 --> 56:57.000
And, yeah. So, I'll probably play more of that after I get done with Fallout. Because I was like, I can play more of the Earth Defense Force, or I can play more Fallout. Someone play more Fallout.

56:57.000 --> 57:06.000
And then, of course, I played tons of Ingress. I drove up the fucking Placerville and, like, rescue today to make a field from there to Auburn for no fucking reason.

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
Other than, I was like, oh, maybe I'll get some more points.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Uniques. You got uniques.

57:11.000 --> 57:17.000
I had, like, two. Because I didn't really actually, you know, hack anything because I was under, like, a time constraint.

57:17.000 --> 57:25.000
I need to get your schedule so we can go out some time together. Because you can do so much more in that game when you even have just one other person. You can do better stuff.

57:26.000 --> 57:32.000
But, like, my schedule's gonna change after the first of the year, so then I'm not gonna have the weekdays anymore. Because they used to have Thursdays to play.

57:32.000 --> 57:45.000
And now, nope. That's not gonna happen. So, I may have, no, I'm not gonna, depends on what my schedule is, you know, where I'm trying to shift, trade shifts, and I may not have any time in the morning anymore.

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
Oh, boy. Alright.

57:47.000 --> 57:51.000
It'll be, like, weekends, maybe. Or if I take a day off. I don't know.

57:51.000 --> 57:56.000
Well, real life is more important than silly portal bandits, so it's fine.

57:56.000 --> 58:04.000
Yeah, I'm probably not gonna do any more of the fielding stuff. I just, like, a few weeks ago I went to Auburn, because I was meant to, like, field that day.

58:04.000 --> 58:16.000
And then, like, I drove, like, two hours round trip to do that. And by the time I got back here to actually link it up, someone had fucking, on our own side, had fucking thrown some blocking links. I'm like, are you fucking serious?

58:16.000 --> 58:17.000
But they didn't know. They didn't know.

58:17.000 --> 58:36.000
Well, no, they, it's because I couldn't text them, because I'm driving on a fucking road that's twisty as fuck, and, like, in the rain, with no cell coverage. Like, well, he didn't say anything. I'm like, yeah, because I'm fucking driving. I can't text on the phone while I'm driving to tell you, with no cell signal. So, whatever, it's fine. I wasn't mad, and it was just, like, it's just something that happens.

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
More like your luck.

58:37.000 --> 58:45.000
It's like, yeah, my luck. I wasted all this time. You know, drove all the way back here. It's like, oh, fuck, I can't do anything. Well, that was that, so.

58:45.000 --> 58:54.000
Alright. I can't wait. You guys, I really feel like, because of this Ingress thing, I feel like Loki is gonna play Pokemon Go.

58:54.000 --> 59:01.000
I'll try. So, anyways, I've been doing Christmas shopping, so I have your gifts.

59:01.000 --> 59:02.000
Oh, my gosh.

59:02.000 --> 59:09.000
So, you guys can choose or fight over which one, and I don't know if you have these yet, so I can never know, because you buy all these figures and stuff.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
Oh, my God.

59:10.000 --> 59:27.000
Anyways, so I got both the Sam Flynn and the Korra Disney Infinity figures. I didn't know, they look pretty awesome, and I've been buying Disney Infinity stuff, because I'm buying my son the game, Disney Infinity 2.0.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
So, you guys can decide which one you want.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
Wow, that's awesome. I'm fine, whichever one you want to take.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
I think I'd really like Korra.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
You want Korra? That's fine. I'll take Flynn.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.000
Thank you.

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
Hey, thank you, Loki. I'm gonna take that out of the box.

59:41.000 --> 59:44.000
I was looking at Amiibos, and I'm like, does he have that one?

59:44.000 --> 59:47.000
Yes, I have them all. It's sick.

59:47.000 --> 59:52.000
You know what, though, guys? I don't know if I should talk about this on air. I might get in trouble, but we'll see.

59:52.000 --> 59:59.000
Shane told me he's gonna stop collecting Amiibo. I think he finally got broken, like the Amiibo thing kind of broke him.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Because I ordered the Shovel Knight Amiibo on Best Buy this week, and I was like, Shane, you didn't tell me that it was up for sale. I heard about it from somebody else.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And I was like, are you gonna go get it? He's not feeling the Amiibo thing anymore, and I'm like, are you okay, buddy?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I bought a disturbing amount of Disney Infinity figures this week.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
But they were on clearance.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
They were on clearance, yes. And they're used.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.000
So I bought the game, which was on clearance, because it's last year's game.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And then I bought the figures, because they're on sale this week.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And even, like, I bought an Olaf for my other son, and that's Disney 3.0. You can't actually use it in the game, but I'm gonna download 3.0 so that they play.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:50.000
But the other figures were, like, five bucks new, or they had, you know, GameStop had, like, buy two used and get three free.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I'm like, I cleared out, like, their whole section. They're hard to get anymore.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
So I'm like, well, fuck, if I'm gonna buy this, I'm gonna buy the characters while I can still get them.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And fucking trying to find that Spider-Man set, just forget it. It's impossible to find. After, like, a year.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Alright, looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, I think that lit up the chatroom more than anything else.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Me saying the Shane is out of the Amiibo thing.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Act F saying, what? It's 2100, Matt. I don't believe it.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000
The what meme saying, did Shane finally accept a job for Sony PR?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000
That, that, that I would believe for everything else.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And SJ100Matt says, are you sure he was tired, wasn't tired and just needed a nap?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000
That could also be true. I don't know.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Okay, so my gaming week. I actually, I played a whole lot this past week.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Not just on Steam, obviously I played some Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I played another game, and I want to have these guys on the show when their game is a little closer to full release.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
The game is called Black Ice, and it was kind of like Tron meets Diablo.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
And I was like, I am into both of those things. Tell me more about your game.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
And I liked that one a lot, so I was playing that on Steam.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
And actually, you know who's been playing that even more than me is Alan.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Alan's really into that, so we'll talk about that game a little later on.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I'm hoping to have them on the show.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
But then I got home and I played some other stuff.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I want to talk quickly about a game I talked about two weeks ago.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Two weeks ago on the show I talked about Xenoblade Chronicles X.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And although I don't think I was too negative on the game, I did give some feedback that was a little bit like, this really bothers me.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
And I did spend some more time with the game to see if I could get over some of that stuff.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:39.000
And for the most part, yeah, I think I did get over a little bit of a hump that I think kind of happens in the story, kind of between Chapter 3 and 4.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:45.000
And I was able to progress a little more in the story, and I feel a little better about where I'm headed in the game now.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:57.000
It still doesn't completely change the fact that I do think there's a big disconnect between the manual is there, so you have to read the manual on the Wii U gamepad.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:04.000
But the game has some tutorials in it, but if you're not able to read the manual as well...

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
I don't know, there's some kind of disconnect there in how the game really paces itself in the beginning.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
And that still kind of bothers me and I think will turn some people off.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:21.000
But if you can stick with it and get over that hurdle, I mean, the game is really good looking, there's a lot of great music in the game.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000
The battle system is fun, even if people never shut up, they keep yelling at each other, but I kind of like that ambience.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
It's a little different than other RPG games I played.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
So I am enjoying myself with Xenoblade Chronicles X, and I thought that was an important little follow-up point.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:43.000
So even though I do think the game has its flaws, and I know there's going to be Nintendo defenders and Xenoblade defenders that are going to say I'm wrong, and that's fine.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000
But I really do think that there's some roadblocks in that game that prevent it from being a great game.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Because at the end of the day, I still think a lot of the voice acting and the scripting is very...

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
It's a little generic, a little blah.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I hear the story gets better and better, but I'm not going to be totally convinced.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I don't think that it was written for a reading game and it's being acted and not very well.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
But outside of that, I mean, what RPG games on the Wii U are there?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
There's not a lot, a lot, a lot of games. There's a few, but not a lot.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And Xenoblade is really good, and if you are a Wii U owner, I think it is worth having if you're into JRPGs at all.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Just be warned, you got to read through that manual, and you might hit these parts where you're like,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:36.000
am I even on the right fucking path? If you feel like that, just try something else and you'll get there.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Also on the Wii U this week, I played a game that was released on the eShop that I'm kind of surprised I didn't play sooner,

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
the day it came out, but it's called Fast Racing Neo.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
And this is the game that a lot of people are saying,

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:59.000
well, this is what happens when Nintendo doesn't put out F-Zero, is that the indie studio made their own version of F-Zero.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
And so I checked out the game, and I got to say, it's pretty sweet.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
It's more Wipeout than F-Zero to me.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Yeah, that's what it looked like to me, more Wipeout.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.000
But that's not a bad thing at all. It's fast, and it's racing.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:20.000
So in fact, it's so fast that when I was playing, and it's really smooth, like it does run at that 60 frames a second,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I did notice when I was going really fast on some complex tracks that the track kind of popped in in the distance.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
You kind of see the pop in.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
But that was extremely infrequent, all things considered.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000
But I think that's how they made it happen at 60 frames a second.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
But I got to say, it was so fast and so smooth that even I was getting a little bit of that, whoa, I got to stop.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:43.000
I'm almost getting a little queasy playing this on my big TV.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
It's almost a bit much.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:56.000
But they kind of put an interesting twist on the formula where there's almost like an Ikaruga thing where you have to flip the color of your engine to match the color of the boosters if you want to boost.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:03.000
There's orange boost and blue boost, and you have to flip the colors back and forth to match the boost in order to actually go faster.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
And I thought that kind of put a neat little spin on it.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
So I think the music's good.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I think the tracks are pretty varied for an indie game, and at least the beginning ones I've played are pretty well designed.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
However, it's pretty difficult.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:23.000
It's not exactly like the first time I played.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
The lowest difficulty is not a gimme.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Like, you play Mario Kart on 50cc, you're going to win.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
No problem, right?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Unless you're maybe like a kid or like, you know, a gamer who really doesn't play very often.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Like, you're going to win 50cc Mario Kart.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
You're not going to win Fast Racing Neo your first time through.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
If you do, props to you.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
You're really good.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
But that's okay.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I'm okay with the game.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
I'm not like saying, oh, it's too hard.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It just took me by surprise a little bit, so I'm going to warn you all out there.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
It is a more difficult game.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000
But the second time I played through, I did place first in the circuit, and I was able to move on.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
So I'm totally okay with a game kind of requiring a little bit of effort for progression.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
The only thing that kind of bothers me about the game,

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:14.000
I don't like the default controls, is that, like, you know, they do the little ZL and ZR are kind of like the super left turner.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Like, they drift your car left and right like it didn't have zero.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
But then the R button is the boost.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And the L button flips between the orange and blue, but you can also use X to do that.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
And it's like my fingers on the L and R's are never hitting the right button.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And so suddenly I'll boost when I think I'm going to be drifting to the right.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Or worse yet, I'll drift to the right when I think I'm going to boost.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And like I'm having a hard time kind of like training my fingers to do that.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
And I didn't see a way to remap those buttons at all.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:48.000
I could have missed it, but I really wish it would let me remap some of that to a configuration that works for me.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:54.000
I did notice the menu system in the game is really basic.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
A lot of the shell around the game itself is really basic.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
But that's, I mean, that's okay.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
I mean, you know, the important part is, is it a fast racing game?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000
And yes, it is. But I just, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't have that polish you would expect out of an F-Zero game, right?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Like F-Zero GX was extremely polished from start to finish.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And most Nintendo games are, right?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
This one's a little rough in the edges, but when you're actually racing, it's a lot of fun.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And I'll give it that.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
So, look in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Dark Ted Sousa says, I saw some video of fast racing Neo.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Yeah, I did get sort of a wipeout vibe from it, but it still looked blazing fast.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
It definitely seems to have a little bit of an F-Zero vibe to it, too.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
There's still definitely a F-Zero vibe to it.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Like, I swear to God, one of the opponent's names, it's not Captain Falcon, but it's like Fapton Calkin or something.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Like, it's really similar.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
It's kind of surprising.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Like General Hawk.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Wait, that's actually, I think, G.I. Joe.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
So.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Anyway.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
And I got to give this important update.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Shane actually joined the chat room and said, what terrible lie was said?

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And so the chatters basically filled him in on what I'd been saying.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
And Shane said, yeah, it's hell trying to hunt for both Amiibo and Power Rangers toys.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
So I had to pick one.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
So.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
But what about my needs?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
What about the Amiibo I need?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
See, Shane was always, like he was keeping me in the loop on the Amiibo.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Shane was my dealer.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I know Shane was my dealer.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And now he's just, you can't just quit.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Alright.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
So anyway.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
There you go.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
That was pretty much my gaming week.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I think that's all I really have to say for my gaming week was those games.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Housekeeping, and then we'll get into news tonight.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Just for housekeeping real quick, I know we've missed a lot of shows recently.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000
The good news is, no more missed shows unless something really bad happens.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
We will be here weekly, at least through the end of February.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
But I will be gone for a Sunday in the end of February.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Maybe we can tape in advance that week.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Because I'll only be gone like Thursday, Friday, so maybe we can tape on a Wednesday or something.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
This is way out in February, so we don't have to worry about it now.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
I'm going to Disneyland next month.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Are you really?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Yeah.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Lucky.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.000
I told you.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
Oh yeah, that's right, because you're going to the farewell before they bulldoze.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I'm going to meet.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Yeah, before they bulldoze a lot of the frontier stuff for Star Wars Land.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
And I wouldn't have even known about that actually being the weekend if not for Victoria,

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
so I'm going to be like, I'll be there.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Yeah.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
It's going to be interesting.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Because I deserve it.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
You do deserve it.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
I'm kind of jealous you're going to Disneyland, but that's okay because a month later,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I won't be here at the end of February, so we won't be live at the end of February.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
This is a ways off.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I'm going to MAGFest.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I booked my flight.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I know I've talked about it on the show for some time, but I'm officially 100% going.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
I booked my flight.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I'm staying with some podcasting buddies.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000
And I'm going to be spending Thursday through Monday out in the D.C. area.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
It's not technically in D.C., but it's the D.C. area.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
I'm flying into the Rainier Airport.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
You'll have a good time.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I'm very excited about it because I had a good time at Rockage out here on the West Coast.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And Gabe, who is from the Sac-I-GDA, he works with MAGFest because he's from Jersey.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
So I've got to talk to him and see what his plans are.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Yeah, it's going to be my first MAGFest.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000
I'm really excited about it.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
So I hope to see you guys there.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000
VOG, OLR, we're not doing anything in official capacity.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I kind of signed up too late.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
I forgot the panel submissions were going to close.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
I kind of forgot to get on that bandwagon.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
So we're not really doing anything in an official capacity, but I will be there.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000
And if you're there, we'll plan an unofficial meetup somewhere.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Meet me by the Tron machine at 3 p.m. or something.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
We'll figure something out.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
We'll tweet on our Twitter account, at OLR.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
All right, that's all I can think of for housekeeping.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Otherwise, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
And Google, google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Let's get into what happened this week in gaming news, starting with Loki.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
There was a lot for late December, can I just say.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
There was a lot of news this week.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
It was crazy.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.000
So let's get to it.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
So apparently Hideo Kojima came off of his vacation.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:06.000
And wasted no time to make the announcement that Kojima Productions is going to be coming back.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000
And they're going to be partnering with Sony for the first title.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
So that's pretty amazing, actually.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Like literally right after signing the deal for that.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And it's going to be like a new franchise or a new IP.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
It's not going to be based off of Metal Gear or Silent Hill.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
But it should be something great.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:35.000
And apparently as part of that, I think Sony is going to be fronting some money to help kick start that company.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So that's kind of cool.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Now that they've gone indie though, of course, what's going to happen to Metal Gear?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Well, apparently Konami is looking for staff for a new Metal Gear game.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Now there's been this post scene I guess that they have seeking people experienced that want to sign up to make a new game.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Although it could be, I think this was left over, it might have been from Phantom Pains.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
But I mean it's still up and so they're still seeking staff for a new Metal Gear title.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
So I don't know.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
You have to wonder if they aren't just going to take the Metal Gear IP and do something kind of different with it.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Like a pachinko machine.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000
No, maybe experimenting with the online stuff or I don't know.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I don't know.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:30.000
I mean like I'm surprised if they are actually still considering doing console games for this.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
I mean after all the bridges that they burned I'm just surprised that they're like,

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Hey, we're going to come back.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
They didn't just burn the bridges, they detonated them.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Like is anyone going to give a shit that they came back?

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.000
It's like, you know, unless there's something really cool to show, I mean I just think no one's going to give a shit.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Yeah, Konami's going to have to work real hard to get me to give a shit about whatever's in store for Metal Gear.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
So that being said, let's talk about Kojima and the Sony thing.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
So what do y'all think?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I think it's exciting. I can't wait to see what he's got.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.000
It's a very logical pairing, especially after the very good reception of P.T.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:14.000
But can we talk about how bad I want P.T. to be the thing that he's working on with Sony?

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.000
It could be. Maybe he's going to work on something that's not Silent Hills but is Silent Hills.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.000
But like a scary...

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And yeah, I realize he can't even really use P.T. because technically Konami paid for that development.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
So any of the characters, any of the stuff he did...

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
But there wasn't really anything in it, I mean...

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Yeah, but I don't know. So he can't actually make P.T., but he can make something that's inspired-ish, you know what I mean?

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I guess I just want Kojima to make a scary game, and I kind of want Guillermo del Toro to be involved as well.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.000
So, I mean, yes, he can't make Silent Hills, duh. That's done. But I would be very interested in whatever it is he's making.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
He's making, yeah, a new franchise.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Silent Hill hasn't really been with Silent Hill for a long time anyway, so...

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I'm kind of okay with that being done with a new franchise. We'll love it just as much.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Interesting theory from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000
ActDeft says, I'm calling it, Kojima will make a Playstation VR game.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Could that be what they are going to put him on?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Make it, oh god, can you imagine a scary game in VR?

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.000
I might shit my pants for real, good lord.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
I don't know, DartSakura? What do you think of all this?

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I hope not.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I hope not. I mean, honestly, I hate speculating on stuff like that because, first of all, we knew he was going to be getting right back into thing after, you know, his contract date was up.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Because I knew it wasn't a vacation, it was a separation, a complete separation.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
And having him pairing up with Sony, like, right away.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Oh, Sony took him out on a nice date.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Sony played some romance, Sony played some Adele, to some candlelit music, and steak, and Sony sexed him somehow.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:01.000
This wasn't a love hotel, this was a full on host date.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
It was fucking like, hey, hey, listen.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000
This was Kojima breaking up and going right onto the hookup app to find the next best thing.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
And Sony's like, me, me, me, me, me.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Listen, I know your pimp was treating you bad before, but come on.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Well, I'll buy you nice things, you know, you can make whatever you want.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.000
You got freedom.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Alan Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Sony and Kojima's date was like that Instagram series.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
He got money.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Have you ever seen that? It's funny.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:40.000
At any rate, the only thing I can expect is great things.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.000
So when's Konami going to announce that he's actually left the company? Is he still going to be on vacation?

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Is it going to be a weekend at Bernie's situation where it's like, no, he's still working.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
See, look, look at all the work he's doing. He's right there.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:17:03.000
I kind of think when your ex-husband announces they just got married, that kind of insinuates that there was a divorce that happened at some point.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
I don't think Konami needs to make a statement.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I think at this point for Konami to make a statement is just for the Internet's amusement, which Konami is probably not amused that the rest of us are amused, but they really only have themselves to blame at how they've conducted themselves.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Like I said, Konami is a PR nightmare right now. I would hate to be in their PR department and none of them had anything to do with it.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
And Lord knows, they're probably yelling.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000
What needs to happen at Konami, the CEO needs to be dethroned.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:37.000
This is such a fucking mess at this point. The CEO needs to be switched and that's the only way.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
This is like when Microsoft needed to lose their CEO.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Honestly, for everything that Microsoft went through last year or two years ago, it's nothing compared to what Konami is going through.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
And Don Mattrick lost his job over it.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:56.000
I mean, they'll say it was parted on mutual terms.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
He lost his job over it.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
AlanAlchemy, Sony, what do you want to watch?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
I got Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, Amazon Prime, Kojima, LOL, whose password do you have?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Sony, I pay for it all, Kojima.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
He got money!

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:27.000
SSG100Matt says, we'll see if people flip off Konami with their wallet when the new Metal Gear Solid game comes out.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I certainly hope they do.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Well, you know, how would you feel?

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Now, I'm going to be like the most ultimate tinfoil hat right now, but just humor me for a minute here.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Let's say I get my wish and the management is shaken up severely at Konami.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Severe management shakeup.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:51.000
And Konami decides to bring in an outside person that's worked on another big game series to do Metal Gear.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Would you have faith at that point?

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Would you be willing to forgive Konami if Konami basically fired the people that needed to be fired and put in some fresh blood from other places?

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Would you give Metal Gear Solid a chance at that point?

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
No, because they aren't bringing out a new Dance Dance Revolution game.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Oh, come on.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
I just don't care.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Whatmeme says, those people working on new Metal Gear had nothing to do with the nasty split. Don't punish them.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Shane in our chat says, how can Konami fire itself?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000
But this stuff happens all the time. Shareholders revolt and demand to the board that it changes.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Well, let's put it this way. Let's just see how their Patinko business works.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I hope it's as good as they think it is.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
That's all I'm saying.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:46.000
It's just like betting everything on mobile. I really hope that you don't think that you're going to have the next Angry Birds.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Because I'm sorry, whatever game you put out on there is probably not going to be that big.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:57.000
But they might have Metal Gear tap puzzle surprise thing. I don't know. Who knows?

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
It'll be terrible.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Chibi Metal Gear, where you drag Solid Snake in a cardboard box through mazes of whimsical obstacles.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
It's Metal Gear Solid Racing!

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
It's just Snake in a cardboard box.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Exactly. It's like a cardboard box derby car.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
It's like that Boy Scouts event where people build their little cars.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Soap box derby.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000
That's it.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Metal Gear Solid soap box derby.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Sg100Matt, I'll leave it on this. Sg100Matt in chat says,

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I want them to come out on stage, bow their heads, and say,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
Hey, we were dicks. Sorry, but we'll change.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Well, I don't know about that.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Still won't care.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
Yeah, we'll see.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Hey, let's move on though to some other news that happened this past week.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Including your Xbox One got enriched with more backwards compatibility.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Microsoft making good on their word to add more backwards compatibility each month

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
for the second month in a row.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
So hopefully this trend will continue into January and February.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
But some new games available on the Xbox One are

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Xbox 360 titles like Braid, Deus Ex Human Revolution, Fable 3, Halo Reach,

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000
Hydro Thunder, that's I think a favorite of Dark Soccer's,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Ms. Pac-Man, Pagle, Portal Still Alive, that was the standalone Portal thing on 360,

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Splunky, Splosion Man, and Doritos Crash Course.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:33.000
For those of you that were fans of Doritos and their saturation of the gaming market.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
But yeah, all those games are available now on the Xbox One.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
By the way, Hydro Thunder is really Dan's thing.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Oh, I thought you were into that too.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I mean, I was for a hot minute, but Dan was like,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
he'll still like when he finds a Hydro Thunder machine, he'll be like,

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Tidal Blade! Damn the torpedoes!

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.000
What was the game that was like the spiritual successor?

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
H2 Overdrive.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
That's it, H2 Overdrive.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
He likes that one too.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
That game's fun too.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Yeah.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Anyway, all right, so yeah, turn on your Xbox One and check your games library

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
because you never know what you might have bought on 360.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I think that Doritos game was free, so I think a lot of people have that.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
But yeah, I logged in.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
I was like, oh, hey, I've got like five new games available.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000
I didn't even realize I bought all this shit.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I knew it would pay off someday.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
That's me looking at my Steam library.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Right.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Anyhow.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:31.000
So here's a little bit of interesting speculation is that

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
there's been this ongoing question, is Rare Replay coming to Wii U?

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
We finally have an answer.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.000
At least Microsoft hasn't said like a definite no.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
They just said that they hadn't had any information.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:52.000
But Rare spoke up and said it is exclusive to Xbox One.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
We have the answer.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Now people can shut up.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
That is, I mean, I don't know.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
It seems a little bit obvious to me that that would be the case,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
that it's exclusive to Xbox.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
But maybe people were hoping that a Nintendo release on Wii U

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:08.000
would then maybe sub out some of the 360 titles for stuff like

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Donkey Kong Country.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I'm assuming that was the fan wank that started all that.

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
They'd like to think so.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000
But I mean, a good number, though, of those games were on Nintendo consoles before.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
That's some of the coolest stuff in the pack, like playing Cobra Triangle again.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
It was half like this is awesome and half actually it's not that awesome.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
It was just more awesome when I was a kid.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000
But now it's like, sorry, Nintendo players who want to recapture those nostalgia,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
time to bust out your carts and blow out some dust.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
That's how you're going to get it on a Nintendo system.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.000
But I understand Microsoft kind of wanting to keep those Xbox One exclusives

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000
where they can.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:51.000
But at the same time, again, Microsoft working with Nintendo products,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
not unheard of.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
I mean, obviously, Minecraft this week, right?

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
That's a Microsoft thing now.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
And then Viva Pinata was on the 3DS.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
So Microsoft will do it if, you know.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Microsoft will play nice with the other team.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Sure.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I mean, we've got Office on Mac.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
I mean, why not?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Yeah.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I mean, the question is, can they make money?

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yes.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
And that's all that matters is the money.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
He got money.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Yes.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Capitalistic paradise here, huh?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
There's Brad in our chat room.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
MS got money.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Oh, my ticket is getting all wrinkled.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.000
What?

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000
My ticket.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Oh, your movie ticket?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000
Are you one of those people who saves movie tickets?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I have movie tickets for years.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000
When I moved out here, I had a bundle of movie tickets from, like, 1989.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
I don't.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And I moved out here in 98.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Wow.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
No, I don't save movie tickets.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
I do.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
Because memories.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.000
And they go like, haha, sat through that.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000
I knew a person that saved, tangent time, but sorry about it.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000
I knew a person that saved every ticket from when they saw the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000
That's cool.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And they had, like, a binder of, like, 150 tickets from just week after week after week

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000
of seeing Rocky Horror.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000
That's cool.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Yeah.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I did think that was kind of cool, but I was like, dang, like.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.000
So you got a binder full of printed paper, but memories.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Binder full of women.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Yes, binders full of women.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Binder full of transsexual Transylvanians.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Who knew that that four-year-old joke would work well on the show tonight?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Let's travel around the world and check our binders full of release dates.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
How about binders full of sluts and assholes?

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
I don't think you're going to find those in the release dates.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
In fact, I think those binders are going to be pretty empty this week leading into Christmas,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000
but let's ask, are there any releases coming out in the U.S. this week?

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Loki.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Yeah, there's a Tales of Legend game that's coming out on PlayStation 3 and the Vita.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000
And that's it?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Yeah. I mean, it's the week of Christmas, so.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Yeah.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Yeah. And that's it.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
You get only one Exceed RPG this week, and that's it.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
If your game's not out by now, it's not for the holiday season, I guess.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
On the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Now, Christmas is a little different in Japan.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
You can get a cake, but it's not really quite the same thing it is here.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
I want a Christmas cake. I just want cake.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
You know, we usually try to find the restaurant on Christmas.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
We'll do our little.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Yeah, we haven't decided what to do this year.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
We'll have to figure that out, but maybe we should have cake.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
But you know what the crappy thing is?

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
What?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
I have to work the next day, so I can't stay out late.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Aww.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
So.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
We have to get creative, because we are doing our thing with Alan's family, so I don't know.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Why don't we do this? How about Sunday before the show instead?

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000
Maybe.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000
We'll do Gay Jumis on Sunday.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Will there be cake?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
We can have cake.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Right. It better not be a lie.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Or, and places will be open.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000
That's true.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000
So, we can just put it off.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
We could do cheesecake.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
We could do cheesecake.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Last year we got cheated out of our holiday.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
You know I love cheesecake.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Why don't we do Cheesecake Factory?

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
I even will play Five Nights at Freddy's for cheesecake.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Let's do Cheesecake Factory for Gay Jumis.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Alright, that works.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Okay.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Alright.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
Wattmeme in chat says, there were some digital releases this week.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Just curious, why does no LR announce digital releases?

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000
That's a good question.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000
It's too hard to keep track of all those.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
We sometimes will pick that up too in the rapid fire news.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:23.000
We try to sort of, I think for some reason Dark Soccer's has the digital mixed in when she does the UK.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000
But otherwise, Loki and I look at retail stuff so it's a little tricky sometimes.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
It's too hard to remember everything that's coming out anyways.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I basically, I'll go ahead and just say, I basically use Eurogamer as my source and they mix in the UK stuff.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000
I mean until someone can buy me a better UK release thing because game hasn't been super reliable.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.000
Right.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Okay.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000
Well, let's go to Japan and check out some releases over in Japan.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000
On the PlayStation 4, Assault Suit Lanos is out this week on December the 23rd.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000
God Eater Offshot Twin Pack Volume 3 is also coming out on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Going to the PlayStation 3, TV Anime Idolmaster Cinderella G4U Pack Volume 7.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Your guess is as good as mine as to what the fuck that is.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
It's an Idolmaster expansion pack of some sort.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
This is definitely the week to put something like that out.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Volume 7.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
If you can believe it. Good lord.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
On the Wii U this week, there is a new game.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Geni Ibunroku £FE is out this week.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
And I think that's actually, the emphasis is on FE in the title.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000
So I think this must be based on some, oh is it Fire Emblem?

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Is this the Fire Emblem crossover game?

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
That must be what this is.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
I think this is the Fire Emblem crossover game.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000
That they've been waiting for is finally out on the Wii U this week.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.000
You know Rob.

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Why didn't they just call it Fire Emblem? Then I know what it is.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000
You know what Rob?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
It could be that given this is so modern, that could be hashtag FE.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Yeah, maybe that's what it looks like at first is hashtag FE.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
But I'm like, eh, I think so.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Unless they really like iron.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Yeah.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:04.000
You know, because FE, Varus, iron.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Well I'm sure some people will be importing that one on the Wii U

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.000
because I know Fire Emblem has their fans.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Going to the PlayStation Vita, Getsui no Kusaro,

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Sakuran Paranoia comes out this week,

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000
as well as Mobile Suit Gundam, Extreme vs. Force,

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
and Storm Lover V comes out on the Vita in Japan this week

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
because Vita in Japan is still a thing.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
And on the Nintendo 3DS this week, I think this is kind of awesome,

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Sega 3D Fukoku Archives 1 and 2 Double Pack.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.000
This is a collection of all those Sega 3D games they've released,

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
at least in Japan.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Get this, Power Drift, Space Harrier, Sonic, Fantasy Zone, Outrun,

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Fantasy Zone 2, Bare Knuckle, Galaxy Force 2, Shinobi,

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Echo the Dolphin, Thunder Blade.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
I mean, that's not even all of them.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
So that's a heck of a collection.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
That actually reminds me of something that I learned over the week

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
because it's another game I forgot to mention.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Fantasy Zone for PC Engine is kind of crappy.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
At least the music is.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Aw, sorry to hear that. Sorry to hear that.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Let's see, Gameguru clarifying the title there.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
It is, of course, Shin Megami Tensei Crossfire Emblem.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000
That's right, that's what they're calling it here.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.000
And Gameguru says the pound is supposed to be a musical sharp symbol.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
So it's sharp-F-E.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
I knew that that's what it meant in music,

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
but the last time I think I've heard something like that

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
in regards to a video game was...

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.000
What was the role-playing game that had all the music...

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000
Internal Sonata.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Internal Sonata, that was it.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000
That's a really underrated game, I think.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
History needs to remember that game a little better.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000
That was a really good RPG.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
There's so much musical innuendo in that game.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Yeah, it fell a little flat, didn't it?

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Dark Sakura will be sacked after tonight's episode.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
I'd like to apologize to all the listeners

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
that had to deal with that punishment just then.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Am I in trouble?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
You are in big trouble.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
You just got moved to Santa's naughty list.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Alright, let's go to the UK release dates.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I'll just play myself a little sad song on my piano.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
It's not really my forte, though.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
I hate her so much, you guys.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Allow me to break out a little more fortissimo

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
and I'll do my part now.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I've been here for seven years.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
The medication doesn't work.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I know, it fell on its base.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Shut up and read the release dates.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Gee, Rob.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
That was also a music joke, too.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
The chatters are yelling, stop.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
She must be stopped.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Well, better a stop than a repeat, right?

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
We could just do that.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Read release dates.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I will end you.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
There's one.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
One.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
In my magnum opus of puns.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
December 30th is story of seasons for 3DS.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Finny.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Just a couple more quick stories for you guys

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
and we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
Loki.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Another Smash Direct this week.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Isn't this the last one they're doing?

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Last one ever.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
The way they end it with, of course,

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
adding Bayonetta.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Bayonetta is going to be joining the Smash Bros. roster in the game.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Allow me to join what?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
What?

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
What?

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
What?

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
What?

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
What?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
What?

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
What?

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
And allow me to join what Twitter said

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
in response to this this week.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Yes!

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Because that was basically my entire

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Twitter feed during that conference.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
It was just one great, big

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
yes!

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
I'm super happy they put her original outfit.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
I'm sure you're looking forward to the eventual amiibo that will be coming out.

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
Oh, yeah. The Bayonetta amiibo is almost better news

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
than Bayonetta being in the game, to be honest.

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
But yeah, I'm with Dark Soccer.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
I like the fact that they have both the Bayonetta 1 and 2 outfits in it.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I want, though,

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
the amiibo to be the original Bayonetta

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
as well, because I really do not like

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
her second game look.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
We'll see.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I would pick up the game if it was discounted,

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
but it's not.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Also, they're adding

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Corrin from Fire Emblem as well.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
And so that's going to be, they have

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
like, how many people from Fire Emblem

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
now in this game? I mean, seriously.

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I don't even know her.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
I've never played Fire Emblem.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
There were a lot of people that were like,

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
really? More Fire Emblem?

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
But at the same time, I'm kind of like,

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
I'm of two mindsets. I mean, there's a part

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
of me that's like, okay, yeah, maybe I would have

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
liked to see somebody a little more well-known,

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
but at the same time, if Corrin

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
is a solid character that they believe

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
in, I mean, shouldn't she be allowed a chance

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
to shine? It is a fighting game.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
It makes sense that you have sword wielders

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
in it. And there's a shit ton

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
of Pokemon and Mario characters, so

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
what's another Fire Emblem character, especially

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
with Japan? But they've got like

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
six. Cloud,

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Final Fantasy, Bayonetta,

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
like, they couldn't

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
have said, instead of, okay, let's put a, like,

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
the 15th Fire Emblem character in there.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
They could have, like, said, how about we do

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
whatever? It seems like 15.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Um, they could have

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
just like, hey, let's put, like, Birdo

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
in there or something, or say, hey, how about a

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
character from fucking Super Mario Brothers 2?

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Anybody.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
At this point, I'm wondering why they don't do a Fire Emblem

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
fighting game. The chatroom is correcting

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
me on something. Corrin, like several

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
of the other Fire Emblem characters, can be

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
either male or female. I'm using

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
female pronouns, because that's how it was presented

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
in the video, if I'm not mistaken. So,

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
that's what kind of associ- I know it's both. Yes, I know

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
that's what I'm saying. It's both. No, no, no. In the video that I saw,

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
um, Corrin started off male and was kept

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
being referred to as Big Brother, Big Brother, Big Brother.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Oh. Now Big Brother's

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Big Sister, and that's even better!

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
I laughed so much.

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
So, just, just so y'all

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
can stop writing the emails. I, uh, they,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
it was the same thing that Robin does, where you can be

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
boy or girl. That's cool, but, once again,

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
you know, I'd rather, like,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
some more obscure characters.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Hey, let's put Captain Rainbow in there, or

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
fucking, like, you know,

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
anybody from Super Mario Brothers 2.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
Here's the thing. If that had

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
been the note they ended on, then I think

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
a lot of us would be like, oh,

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
okay, cool.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
But, the fact that they said, okay, here's

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Corrin, and then here's fucking Bayonetta,

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
like, it's like, oh, okay, cool, cool.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
Yeah, I'm in, I'm in. Like, you know,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Corrin's just kind of like, oh, it's just like a little bit,

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
it's a cherry on top, but Bayonetta, hmm.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
That's gonna be a lot of fun.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
Bayonetta is luscious.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
No, I can't freaking wait.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
I didn't download Cloud yet, though. I was,

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
I was so busy playing Xenoblade

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
and even Mario Maker, I didn't even talk about it during my gaming week,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
but I was catching up on all the Mario Maker

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
event stages, because I have to get all those

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
new costumes, right? Like the badge arcade bunny

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
and all that stuff. I'm sure, I think we'll talk about that later.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
I haven't gotten that one yet. They only had a few,

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
I didn't have that latest update when I checked

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
it last, so I only got the car

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
and,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
I forget, I don't,

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
I got the cat thing from

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Monster Hunter and

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
I'm almost positive

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
you have a story on it after the break, so it'll probably jog

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
your memory. No, no, I saw that.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
I'm just saying, I didn't play those levels,

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
the new ones, so I must have

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
done it before they put those up.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
But,

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
yeah, you know, the developers,

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
they made a solid game. If Corrin is the

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
character they believe in and want to have in the game, they

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
are more than welcome to do it. Cool.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
I want there to be a

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Pokemon game that plays like Smash.

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Uh, Pokken, well, it doesn't

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
really play like Smash, I guess, but you kind of

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
have a fighting Pokemon game coming at

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Pokken Tournament.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Maybe not what you had in mind.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
Also, Mii costumes, right?

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Because I know some people are getting excited about

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
some of those. They're going to have the Mii costumes

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
they had, um,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
I was kind of disappointed that they didn't put any

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Mario RPG stuff like actual characters,

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
but they have got, um, I want to say the

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Geno costume. Yeah. Um, they

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
had also, you know, stuff from

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
you could do, uh,

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
was it a chocobo?

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
And then they also had, like, uh, the Sonic

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
characters, like Knuckles, Tails,

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
um,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
so that looked pretty cool. And then they have the Mii

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
costumes now. Bionic armor

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
from Brawler, or for the Brawler,

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
let's see, um, Gil from

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
the Tower of Druaga.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
And, let's

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
see, Ashley from WarioWare, right?

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
Ashley from WarioWare.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
And, uh, Takamura from

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Nazo, no,

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
I don't even know what the fuck the series was.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
I'm not even going to bother. Sorry, you tried.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
But Geno, though, seriously, Geno would have been awesome.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
Yeah, I gotta say, I think the one thing

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
I was seeing about the

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Corrin thing is that people were like,

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
couldn't we have gotten Geno instead of Corrin?

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Do you remember Nazo, what do you mean, Nazo no

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
It means it's a mysterious girlfriend.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Wow, that cleared it up.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Well,

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
look, uh, um,

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
here's, here's the other thing, you

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
kind of talk about Super Mario RPG.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Uh, a couple years ago, I would have said

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
no way, no how, you're never getting a sequel to that game.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Square and Nintendo are not going to be back in bed together.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
But, now that we've got

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Cloud for Smash Brothers,

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Geno shows up as a costume,

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
rumors gaining steam that

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Square is somehow heavily involved with NX.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Y'all,

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
I'm just saying, could you imagine,

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
could you, tinfoil hat time.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
This is Rob's dream.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
E3 2016.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Nintendo NX.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
It's fucking coming.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Reggie Fils-Aime is out on stage,

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
he punches a kid in the face, he's like,

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
this is going to be so fucking rad.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
And then, he says, and guess what title

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
we're launching with?

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Mario RPG 2.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
I mean,

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
there's, there's not

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
enough Kleenex in the world

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
to scoop up all the you know what

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
that would be out there if that were

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
to be the big announcement at

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
NX. I'm just saying.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
You know, that sounds like a great idea.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
In my head, it's fabulous.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
It's fabulous, and then they're like, and here's

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
the controller. Oh, it's a fucking mobile

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
touch screen with no fucking buttons!

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Because we don't fucking get it.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
And then we'd be like,

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
damn you! No!

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
I am not purchasing that.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
So, Nintendo,

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
so in your dream, Loki. No, seriously,

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
like, I watched, like,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
just on a TV show, like, I'm having this

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
dream, and I'm so pleasantly asleep,

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
and then Loki comes in and ruins my dream.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Well, no, it's like, you get the game

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
you've always wanted, and then they fuck it up!

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
They, yeah, because, well, seriously though,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I watched, like, I watched one of those Did You Know

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Gaming things, and they were talking about the Wii U and stuff,

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
and, like, we've heard the story before

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
about, like, when they were talking about the online and everything,

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
and how, oh, hey, we've never,

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
we have no fucking experience with what the Playstation

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Network and Xbox Live are, or how

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
to create an infrastructure, and just

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
boggles my mind that

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
with the launch of the Wii U, they

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
didn't fucking know anything about that

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
shit. And I mean, even now,

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
it's a little bit better, but that kind of

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
scares me, what we're going into with

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
NX. Like, you would think, okay, they

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
should really have a handle on how to run

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
the, you know, the structure of everything.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
I mean, they just started doing DLC, what,

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
like, a year or two ago?

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
I mean, I'm just like,

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
I hope it's good. I hope

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
it's good, but I'm worried that they

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
don't get it, and it's

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
gonna be fucked up somehow.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Alright, sst200maddenchat says,

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
I dream of having Twitch stream of Loki's

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
live reaction of the NX announcement.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
This is why they invented Periscope.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Are they announcing it this year? Because I'm seriously thinking about taking

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
off time for E3 this year.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I think 2016, I think

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
E3 will be the big announcement. I think

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
there's so much hype

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
going into this, I can't see how they don't

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
announce it at the next E3. We'll see.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Let's see, also

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
actdeft trying to sell

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Dark Sakura on Pokken,

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
saying Pokken isn't like

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Smash, but it's like Tekken.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
And Dark Sakura loves Tekken.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
So... I don't know if I'm feeling

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
it with, uh,

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
Pokken, though. Alright.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And Dark Tetsuya says, I just want a date and title

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
on Zelda games. Ah, Zelda U. Man,

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
who saw, um,

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
Akuma, um, in

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
the new Tekken? Oh, yeah.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Oh my god. I was like...

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
That was random. I know.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
It's random, but it's like,

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
what the fuck did happen to Tekken

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Cross Street Fighter? I mean, it's like, hey, you have

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Street Fighter in there now. Maybe.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Where's the rest of it? Maybe that's it.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
I just kind of gurgled a little bit.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
You know what it is? It's fucking Tekken 7

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
with the Tekken Cross Street Fighter

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
DLC.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Be careful what you wish for.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
That is, I don't know, I'm gonna

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
upgrade that from tinfoil hat to, like,

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
paper mache hat, because that is

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
a lot more realistic, I think, that

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
concept. Just saying.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Anyhow, uh, let's move

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
on. Let's talk about, uh,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
one big thing that's been developing the past couple weeks

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
is Sony releasing more

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
PlayStation 2 games on the PlayStation 4.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Did you know that Parappa 2

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
came out in the week that, uh, we've been off?

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
No, it was just this past week, actually.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Parappa the Rapa 2 is now available on PlayStation 4.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
That's kind of cool. Um, well, anyway,

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
uh, Sony's been doing a campaign on

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Twitter where you can use the hashtag

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
PS2PS4.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Get it? Because PS2...

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
It's like the play on the number 2.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
They're not putting PlayStation games on the PlayStation 4.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
That doesn't make any sense.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Shut up.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Alright, anyway, so, uh, using that hashtag,

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
uh, they are, uh, Dave

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Thatch with Sony is tracking

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
what the popular suggestions are to figure out

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
what games should be brought over

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
to the PS4 yet. Uh,

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
some of the games that, uh, have been noticed

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
have been, I guess, trending a little bit.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Tekken, SOCOM, Fatal

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Frame, Timesplitters,

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Simpsons Hit and Run, God Hand,

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Persona 3, Dragon Quest,

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
and Kingdom Hearts. Now, Timesplitters

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
2 would be good. Let's please do

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Timesplitters 2. I can't believe that Final Fantasy

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
12 would not be on

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
that list, because... Well, Final Fantasy 12

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
already got an HD remake that's already,

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
well, no, actually it didn't. I was like, it did,

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
because I've been asleep there, because I don't think it has.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Are they doing that? Uh, no.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Everything's been quiet on Final Fantasy 12.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Um, the game I want,

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
most of all, Katamari Damacy.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
We just talked about it. It was a classic game of the week

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
a couple weeks ago. You know what I want? That's the one I want.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
I want the games that I fucking purchased

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
already to be fucking available, is what

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I want. I want that shit to fucking

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
just work without having me buy that

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
shit again.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
Oh, Loki, you're asking for

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
too much. Apparently.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Alright, let's go to the classic game

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
of the week. We're gonna take a walk down

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
memory lane to a time...

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
The games did not have DLC.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
There was not a separate DLC

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
adventure. There was no patch.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
It was just, this is the game you get.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Take it or leave it.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
In fact, this is the game that our system comes

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
with, right, Darsakra?

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Sort of. Not necessarily.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Not at the beginning. Alright.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Let's get to it. What is the classic game of the week,

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Darsakra? The classic game of the week is

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Bonk's Adventure. Yay.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
It was run by Red

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Company and Atlas.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
It came out in 1989 in Japan

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
and 1990 in North America

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
for the TurboGrafx-16.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Now, as we all know,

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
the TurboGrafx-16 in Japan was

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
called the PC Engine.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
When this game came out in Japan, it was

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
called PC Genjin

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
because it sounded like

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
PC Engine, sort of.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
And it has come out,

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
it was re-released

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
in the US in 1992 on

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
the Gates of Thunder 4

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
in one game CD-ROM,

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
and actually another

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
pretty good

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
TurboGrafx game.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
It had ports for the NES, Game Boy,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
and Amiga and different

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
other systems under some different

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
titles like FC Genjin,

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
GB Genjin, and VC Genjin.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
And it was

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
out on Virtual Console and

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
on PlayStation Store.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
There's even a mobile version in Japan

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
for phones.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Basically, your main character is Bonk,

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
who has a very, very big head.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
And unbelievably,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
his head's bigger

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
than the orange on a toothpick kid's head

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
from So I Married an Axe Murderer.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
That's pretty big.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
So he's a bald cave boy

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
who basically

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
fights dinosaurs and other different

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
prehistoric-type enemies

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
with his head.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
His unbreakable, invincible

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
head. He basically has Luke Cage

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
for a head, except

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
without being that awesome.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
So he has to rescue Princess Zaa,

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
who is a pink

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
playasaur-type

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
dinosaur lady, from King

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
to Jewel, who is a Tyrannosaurus

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
style. In the arcade

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
version, Bonk also has

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
a female version of himself

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
that you can play as.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
So anyway, Bonk basically hits things

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
with his head.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Bonk's health, he starts off with

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
three hearts, and they can be

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
depleted as he takes damage,

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
and he has three extra lives.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
But he can restore

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
his life by eating fruits and vegetables.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
See what they did to their kids?

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
He can also get

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
pieces of meat as power-ups.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
They give him different special abilities and make him stronger.

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
So he gets his normal self

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
for the first stage. The second stage,

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
he can stun enemies by pounding on the

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
ground. And the third stage, he becomes temporarily

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
invulnerable. He gets

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
his big meat and small meat.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
So he's an equal meat eater.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
So when the third stage of meat power

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
wears off, he goes back to the second

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
stage, and then he goes back to regular Bonk.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
He also can get different

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
power-ups that will refill his health,

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
or a large red heart that

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
restores all of his health.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
There's also blue heart power-ups that

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
will increase his heart health by

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
one heart.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
So the game, I mean,

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
it...

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
The other thing about naming it PC Genjin

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
is that Genjin is also Japanese

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
for caveman. So...

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
It works in two different ways.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
It's a fun pun, guys.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Um...

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
It was

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
meant to be called a From Right PC Kid.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Um...

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
But they never called it

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
the PC Engine in the US.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
So, um,

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
and I doubt they could have called it, like,

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
Turbo Boy or something.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
So they called it

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Bonk's Adventure. Um...

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
The game has always been, um,

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
Bonk's Adventure here in the US.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Um, in 2003, Hudson did

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
a 3D remake of Bonk's Adventure

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
in the Hudson Selection games

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
that came out only in Japan on PlayStation 2

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
and GameCube.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Um, but yeah, Bonk

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
was basically, like, the big

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
character used to

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
advertise, um,

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
the TurboGrafx-16 in the US

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
around the mid-90s.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Um, and I do believe that

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
yeah, Bonk was used as a launch title

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
for a while, wasn't it?

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
I want to say it was,

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
because I think my buddy had a TurboGrafx-16

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
and I think he had this game

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
and I feel like he got them together.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
And I don't know if that was just, you know, Santa brought them both, but...

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
I want to say that when the TurboGrafx

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
came out, it was Keith Courage

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
or, um...

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
Might have been Keith Courage, was actually the packing game.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
But then this, I think it's like one of those things

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
kind of like Sega and Sonic.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
Like, once Sonic really took off, they started packing that in.

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Well, but keep in mind, I think that one of the

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
other big ones that kind of was used for

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
advertising was Air Zonk.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
Remember? Yeah, yeah, I do.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
Um, which, uh,

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
I mean, all really, you know, decent games.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Um, so Husband was

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
uh, Husband, why am I saying Husband?

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Because Dam was playing this too.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Um, Hudson

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
um, was also working

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
on a reboot to

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
uh, call it Bonk, Brink of Extinction

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
for WiiWare and PSN,

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
but when, uh,

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Hudson closed, uh,

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
it went into limbo, um...

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
And who bought Hudson,

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
boys and girls? Who bought Hudson?

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
Who's done nothing with this?

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Konami! Correct!

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
I just

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
was, I couldn't even bring

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
myself to... Their name is forbidden from

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
my lips.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Unless it's old, old Konami.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Yes. Old Konami.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
Sigh.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
Um, so anyway, um,

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
it, uh,

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
was supposed to be getting

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
a Wii U Virtual Console release.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
This was announced on October 19th

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
this year, but

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
no one

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
said anything?

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
But the rating

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
out there was supposed to, um, also

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
indicate, uh, PS3 and PSP.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
So, that it was

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
uh, supposed to be the TurboGrafx version.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
Which is the better version.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
You know. But that's it.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Bonk's adventure. Here it is.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
It is on the regular Wii Virtual Console.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
I have it there. It is. Because the folks in chat are talking

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
about like, well, how do I play this game?

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Somebody said, I didn't ever own a console that this was on.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
But I'm pretty sure it's on the regular

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Wii Virtual Console, which remember, you can boot

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
your Wii U into Wii mode to get that

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
game. I mean, it's kind of a pain, but you can do it.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I will tell you this. If you can get your hands on the

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
TurboGrafx, finding a copy

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
of Bonk is not difficult.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
It's not a rare game.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Um, it's just, you know, the problem

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
is finding, as they called them in the U.S.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
TurboChips, or the HuCards

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
for the PC Engine, um,

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
the

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
uh, um, you know, you can

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
get ROMs for some of

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
these things. Um, there is

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
I think a licensed, I think

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
it's a licensed emulator, don't quote me, but

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
Magic Engine, which has been out for

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
a while. Um, and it's

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
got like full arcade card support and everything

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
and will play HuCard

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
um, uh, TurboChip

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
games, any of them. You just like,

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
though for the, the Duo games,

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
you actually have to have the, the disc

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
to play. But you know,

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
which, as you have to say, we,

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
we got our Turbo EverDrive. And the one

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
thing that has actually kind of made me sad is

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
that we had heard a rumor

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
that it was going to let you do arcade

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
card stuff so that we can

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
play some of our arcade card, um,

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Duo games. Like, um,

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
what is the one we have?

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Uh, one of the Fatal Fury games I know we have for

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
uh,

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
the arcade card CD. And I think our other one is Strider.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
Um, for PC

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Engine, uh, uh,

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
arcade card games. And

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
it doesn't work for that. So if that's what you're

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
looking for, it's not going to work.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
So we're kind of back to

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
trying to find a U.S.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
compatible version of the arcade card

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
or the Duo add-on for

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
the core graphics. Gotcha.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Alright. Oh well. Well there

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
it is. Your classic game of the week

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Bonks Adventure. A

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
very, very classic Turbo graphics

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
title or PC Engine, depending on what country

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
you are in. On that note, we are

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
going to take a quick break. Uh, take

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
a moment here to stretch and refill

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
our drinks here in the OLR studio. And

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
so forth. When we come back though, there's

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
plenty more Orange Laundry to come, including

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
rapid fire news.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
The Fookle Question of the Week, which is about

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
sports ball, in honor of our guest

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
this week. And we're going to get to the mailbag,

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
the FUs of the Week, and

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
hopefully your calls, although with

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
the Skype rig tonight, I don't know

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
how well that's going to work. So we're going to try

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
though. All we come back with more

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
of Orange Lounge Radio right after

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
this.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Welcome

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
back everybody to Orange Lounge

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Radio. Live tonight on December

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
20th of 2015, with

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
episode number 624

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
of our show already

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
in progress in the middle here

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
of the holiday season. Get into full gear.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I know a lot of folks celebrating

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Christmas in the next week, so Merry Christmas

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
to those that celebrate. Um, next

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
week will be the last show of 2015

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
if you can believe it. And I'm sure

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
we'll be taking a look back on the year in gaming.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Maybe looking back at some of our favorites

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
of the year and some things that weren't

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
so great in the past year. We will be running

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
over all of that next week on episode

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
625. A nice kind of

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
round number. A multiple

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
of 25, I suppose, to end the

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
year on. So that'll all be next week

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
on the show. But let's get back into the news from

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
this week with some rapid fire

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
news. Loki. Hey, there's

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
a new game from the people that made

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Flappy Bird. It's called

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Swingcopters 2. The people?

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
The person. Whatever. The one

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
dude. The people that play the game.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Who did not like being famous. That made it popular to

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
get him to make another one.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
People. Anyways, so

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
um, Don Nguyen, he

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
went ahead and made a new game. It was a sequel to

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
one of his previous games, Swingcopters.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
And now it's out and you can play

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
it. Yay. It's free still

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
and ad supported. Yeah.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
Alright. And this

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
is like, seriously,

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
I'm surprised I'm actually seeing

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
his company name. And

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I guess not surprised that it's coming to the

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
Wii U. But apparently Napster,

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
that's right, the previous

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
file sharing

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
music site that turned

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
legit is now

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
going to be coming to the Wii U as

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
a free app on December 17th.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
And it also has

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
a 30 day trial.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
And then you can, I

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
guess there's different promotions. If you want

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
to subscribe for three months, you can get

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
pay a dollar. Otherwise

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
it's $9.99 a month.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
No thanks.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
But I'll be coming to the Wii U

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
if you want to check that out.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
And last but not least,

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Mario Maker is getting some updates.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
So there's going to be some

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
three elements added in a new

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
free update. These include

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
being able to

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
have an alternate for the

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
spike wheel. And so instead of the grinder,

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
you can actually turn it into a

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
bumper. It kind of looks like a donut

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
or like an inflatable inner tube

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
or something. Like a pinball bumper type of thing.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Yeah, basically something that you bump off of.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Also they've got

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
doors that are activated, warp doors

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
that are activated by a P-switch. And you

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
can do that by shaking the door.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
Oh, like ghost houses. I didn't realize

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
that was missing. I guess that's...

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
I was just going to say, I can't wait for that

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
level that's nothing but like Mario

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
getting bumped around from start to finish.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
That's just going to be like the bounce house

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
or something. Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Because you know that level's coming.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
And then the Koopa Clown Car is getting a

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
version that shoots fire. And you can

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
shoot like fireballs and then I guess

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
you can charge shot and destroy

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
blocks with it or something. Cool! More fire!

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Yes, so that'll be coming

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
December 22nd.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
And also with that, they're

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
going to have a bookmark system that allows

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
players to save levels from the web

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
portal for later.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
That's kind of cool. Still don't know why

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
they have a web portal to find levels

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
instead of it having been built into the

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
game like Little Big Planet. Once again,

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
I just don't think they get it. I guess they're trying

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
to work around it with what they got, but yeah

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
I hear ya. I don't disagree.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Along with that, of course, some new costumes

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
you'll be able to play as

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
including Badge Arcade Bunny.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
They're going to have Mr. Saturn

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
and...

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Master Belch

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
are going to be available.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
They are there, actually. They're already in the game.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
Awesome, so check it out. Play the 8-bit

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
games or 8-bit levels to

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
unlock them. And then also there is

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
another costume that's not part of this but

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
actually leaked out already. And this

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
is from a Mario Maker level

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
that is on the shop right

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
now that someone hacked

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
and somehow got this costume

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
in there. And it's actually

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
the Skypop Plane from Super Mario

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
Land. Oh wow, that's obscure.

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Yeah, so you'll be able to

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
play that soon

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
because apparently they already

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
have the level out there

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
to download. Wow.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
That's cool.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
And I'm loving that all these

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
updates are free. Yes.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Thank you. Thank you, Nintendo.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
It's something you've been doing very well

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
this year, so thank you.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Another game that's done very well for

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Nintendo this year is Splatoon, which by the way

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
did you know there was a Splatfest this weekend? Totally

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
missed it. Just so many other games going on.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
But yeah, there was a Splatfest. Who won?

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Act F? Who won

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
the Splatfest thing? Because I probably

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
would have used reverse logic

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
and gone Team Nice, assuming

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
everybody else would go Team Naughty.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
But maybe, I don't know who that is. Oh, Naughty 1.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
See, and I would have been fucked over again.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Alright.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Anyhow,

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
so Splatoon, it's

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
been a huge success since launching in

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
May. It has sold over

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
2.42 million copies

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
worldwide, and

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
it's done very well in Japan.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
Apparently Nintendo announced this week

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
1 million of those copies sold in

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Japan, so congratulations. That's great.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Especially because Nintendo took a big risk

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
on a new franchise, but a lot of

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
people really love Splatoon, and

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
it's been doing very well for them, so

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
I'm sure we have not seen

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
the last of it. Also, to celebrate

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
this milestone, Nintendo is

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
going to hold a Squid Sisters

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
concert. Splatoon

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Squid Sisters Live 2016

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
will take place

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
at a convention center in Chiba City

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
on January 30th, so

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
yes, it's only for Japan, but

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Splatoon kind of has a fun little

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
like surf rock soundtrack that goes

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
with it, so I bet that'll be a lot of fun to see

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
played live, so

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
I'm very curious to see what that

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
turns out as. Maybe they'll,

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
a lot of times these concerts get CDs

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
made of them too, so I wonder if they won't end up doing

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
a CD of the live concert

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
later on. We'll see. But that's Splatoon.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Earlier in the show, I

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
brought up Fast Racing Neo,

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
and there is an update already planned for

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
Fast Racing Neo from a tweet

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
from Shin'en Games that actually

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
created the game. They have announced that there is

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
an update scheduled for January that will

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
include a track mini-map

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
that is not in the game right now, and I didn't mention

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
this when I was talking about the game earlier. The Wii U

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
gamepad, what's it used for?

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
Off-screen play, and that's it.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
It's not used for anything else. So maybe the track

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
mini-map will be on the gamepad, who knows.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Online tags, I have not

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
played the game online yet, so I guess you

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
can't see people's tags online, but that will be

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
fixed in January. And then they say

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
stability improvements and the good old-fashioned

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
various fixes.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
But that's nice to see that Fast Racing

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Neo is getting that support, and

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
from what I'm hearing, doing very well in the online

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
store. It was the number one online game

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
in the past week, so props to those

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
folks. Gee, I guess people

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
wanted an F-Zero-like game on the Wii U

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
after all. Who knew?

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Hey, look, even a story

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
about Pokken Tournament, maybe just

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
trying to get Dark Soccer's attention, begging for it

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
here, it's going to launch alongside

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000
a special Wii U controller

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
in Japan. When the Wii U

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
version comes out on March 18th,

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
there's going to be a Wii U bundle that has a

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
digital copy of the game. There's going to be a wired

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
controller that comes with it as well, but

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
it's more, like, it looks different. It's

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
kind of like a longer controller

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
that, I guess,

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
looks more like the arcade version.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
But anyway, it's going to be available,

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
and it will also be compatible with

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
the Wii U GamePad, the Wii U

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Pro Controller, and the Wii

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Classic Controller

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
Pro. So, please look forward

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
to that. Dark Soccer.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Well,

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
we have some news about Nobby Nobby

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Boy. Girl has

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
finally reached Boy.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Girl and Boy have met up again.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
They are now completely

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
joined and happy.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
So, Girl reached Pluto

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
and then has looped around

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
and started making her way back to Earth.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
And it took

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
six years

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
of people playing

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Nobby Nobby Boy.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
Is that all?

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
That's all.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
But how many times did Boy

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
eat, or,

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
Nobby Nobby Boy eat his own butt?

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:10.000
That's a valid question, Dark Soccer.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
I played Nobby Nobby Boy

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
on my phone for, like, ages.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I mean, you used to see,

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
I kept posting on Facebook,

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
that I would give Boy and Girl

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
all the love that I could.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Do you know that that's what

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
Dan and I call each other?

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Even before the game came out.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Like, when I give him

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
cards, it's

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
to Boy from Girl.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
Aww.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
You know what?

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
They made treatments for Hairballs, Rob.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
So, the Final Fantasy 7

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
remake group, they're getting some help

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
from the Kingdom Hearts team, too.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
So, they are

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
going to be doing

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
a lot more development

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
in it, too, where you can actually fully

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
explore Midgar.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
So, the multi-part

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
thing isn't going to affect

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
your ability to go around the game.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
You get more attention on

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Biggs Wedge and Jesse.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
And, uh,

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
a lot more neat stuff on them.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
And they're trying to bring back the voice cast

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
from Advent Children.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Nice. Also,

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Cloud's hallucinations are supposed to be more meaningful.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I wonder if he's going to mention Xenogears.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Like he did

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
in the original. Anything is possible.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Um,

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
and then, uh,

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
sort of a last but not least,

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Kurt Schilling, we know him, right?

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Baseball guy?

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
38 Studios founder? Yes.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
Well, um, he's like, I'm not going to say

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
anything else about this. I'm done.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
So, unless they subpoena him,

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
that's it.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
Then, uh, he says,

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
I have not been served anything by anyone.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
There is not a person on this planet

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
with even a smidgen of knowledge

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
about the law who would say anything, but

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
we all know he shouldn't testify

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
while there is a bogus and incredibly wasteful

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
civil suit still hanging around.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
So,

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
and honestly enough, I mean,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
I don't know if it was

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
exactly all his fault, but I think he's just

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
done. I would be done too.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
I have a feeling he's kind of done with

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
games for a long while.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Which was sad, because the guy himself,

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
as he is, had a real passion

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
for it. He did really love games.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
And got way burnt by the whole thing, so.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Yeah.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
So, sad face. I guess that's too bad.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Alright, well, uh,

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
but also I want to read this comment from our chatroom over at

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
live.vognetwork.com.

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
Sj100matt commenting on Kurt Schilling saying,

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
he's put his foot in his mouth too much lately. He's about

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
to lose his job at ESPN. Ouch.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
And, uh, Bobby Blackwolf

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
talking about Kingdom Hearts saying,

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
Kingdom Hearts team needs to work on Kingdom Hearts

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
and not Final Fantasy. Uh,

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
yeah, I think there's a lot of people that kind of feel

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
that way. My assumption is that Kingdom Hearts

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
might be at a point in development

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
where some people can be shifted.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
Like, you know how some things are done

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
early on in the process and that maybe

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Final Fantasy VII Remake needs help with that part.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
I don't know. We'll see.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
No. So, hopefully

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
that's it. I can't see that they're actually

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
taking resources from Kingdom Hearts. I mean,

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
it's not like when they had to fix

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Final Fantasy XIV and things got

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
really quiet at Square for a while

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
before the Final Fantasy

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
XIV Realm Reborn came out.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I don't think it's like that, but we'll see.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Alright, let's go to the FUGL

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
question of the week.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
Every week we go to our Facebook

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
and our Google Plus communities.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
We ask a question

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:38.000
and we get some answers.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
And this week we wanted to ask about

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
sports ball. Because, you know,

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
we did have Rick from

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Tipping Goat Games who was here earlier

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
and we wanted to talk about

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
sports games. So our question this week

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
is, do you prefer

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
the simplicity of a

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
retro style sports game

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
or do you prefer the complexity

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
of the modern style sports

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
games? Why did you answer

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
the way you did? So let's get to

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
some of the answers over on Facebook.

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Retertainment saying, the NBA

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
street games were pretty dope until they

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
started adding in the overly complicated

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
game breakers that required

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
four or five simultaneous button

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
presses to pull off. So I'm going

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
with simplicity. Tiger

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
Claw says, I prefer sports games with

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
simplistic control. Games like

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
NBA Jam is more fun for casual

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
players since you don't have complicated

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
controls. One button is passing

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
the other for shooting. Any sports games

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
that everyone can play makes for

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
a good party game.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Andy R said, I don't play many sports games

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
but the ones I have were the retro simple ones.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
So I guess those.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Hitstun says, I like old arcade

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
style sports games more. Not because

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
they're simple but because they're fast.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Modern sports games are

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
accurate even to the boring parts.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Games like RBA Baseball, NBA

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Jam, and NFL Blitz have

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
better pacing than real life sports

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
and that makes them better games.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
SSG100Matt says, to answer your question

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
yes. To tell you the truth

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
I have a place in my heart for both

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
complex and retro or simplistic

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
style sports games. I love

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
playing, managing with real world characters.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
The professional athletes themselves

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
and learning different strategies and skills

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
to compete against certain defenses and offenses.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
I also love playing the really simple

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
and sometimes over the top sports games

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
that are scaled down to the essence of why

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
people enjoy sports.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Scoring, hitting, dunking, shooting, throwing

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
passing, kicking, punching, etc.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
Dartetsuya says, the

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
realistic or simulation style

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
stats stuff doesn't appeal to me

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
as much as the fast paced arcade style

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
sports game. Blitz, NBA Jam

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
and so on. I suppose

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
it's that I'm more a casual sports

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
fan than a hardcore one.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
And lastly on Facebook, Jim Sally

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
our buddy Jim Sally

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
with his train says, when I play

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
sports games I want the controls to be as

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
simple as punching my buddy in the arm

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
while he's sitting next to me.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
If you want to play some complex hockey, buy a hockey

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
stick and a cooper ball and start

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
playing for real. Best thing is the

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
3D graphics in real life are

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
almost as good as the new Xbox.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
But I like the way

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
that's phrased, only almost.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
And going to Google Plus

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
we have no answers on

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Google Plus this week. Now

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
look, I know we all joke about Google Plus

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
being dead, but usually there's a few

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
of you that are loyal over on Google Plus, so

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
I don't know what's going on. I've used Google Plus

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
more now than... Yeah, ever since

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Ingress started, right?

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
I technically haven't posted anything

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
on Google Plus, let's be clear.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
The hangouts. The hangouts, yes.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
So yeah, there you go.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Nothing on Google Plus this week, so

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
there you go. Alright.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
So we're going to get back into some

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
news. But Dark Soccer,

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
you're on your way out, right? You had to take off a little early?

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Yeah, I told the hubby a little bit later

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
than this, but he says he's here now.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
So I guess

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
I'm out.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Because I didn't drive here

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
today. Dan dropped me off. We went to

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
see Star Wars today. So

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
yeah, he dropped

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
me off because also my tires

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
are a little bit unsafe.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Just a little bit. I mean, I don't think

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
it would have really been too bad for me to drive

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
on, but at the same time, it was

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
we were just going to be careful, so

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
especially with the rain. So I guess

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
I'm gone. Alright, okay, well that's okay.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Did you want to tell us really quick that story you had

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
coming up here? We'll do things a little out of order.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I just closed everything. Alright.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
Sorry. I got it. Alright,

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Logie's got it. And

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
some folks in chat are saying,

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Dan on the show, Dan on the show, they got places

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
to be. Sadly, they're on their way out.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
But

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
thank you for being here tonight Dark Soccer

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
and we'll see you next week.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Have a good holiday week. We will do

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Cheesecake. Oh my god, stop it computer.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Your computer's

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
giving you a little taste of what the show computer

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
was giving me earlier. Alright.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Alright, well Logie and I will hold down the fort here

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
with our remaining news stories. So let's get to it.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Logie. So this is kind of cool.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
So you know that whole

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Retron console that was supposed to be

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
coming out, the one that was going to be based off

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
of like cartridges and it would

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
play like 18 or 8 to

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
32-bit style games. The Retro

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Magazine people were doing it, right? Yeah, yeah.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
That console. So anyways, now

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
they've got support. Now it's no longer

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
going to be the Retron video game system,

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
but it's now, they've been

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
backed by ColecoVision.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
You remember Coleco?

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Shit, that's like, that was like my first game

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
system back in the 80s. You know, they haven't been around forever.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
But now they have a brand new system

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
coming out called the

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
ColecoVision, or the

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Coleco Chameleon.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
A quick thought on your way out there.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
I'm sorry, I'm putting on my shoes right now.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
I actually still have my

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
ColecoVision from when I was a kid.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
And another ColecoVision. I wonder if it'll

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
have old school Coleco games built in.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
It makes sense because those Flashback consoles. We finally get the

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
expansion module number 3.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
I almost bought the

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Coleco Flashback today. They have them on

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
they're closing them out out of

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Target. Or

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
Walmart actually. They're closing them

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
out there. And I really want the

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Atari one for some reason. They've got that in the

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
Intellivision one.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
But anyways, yeah.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
So that's pretty cool. And then of course

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
this is supposed to be launching in 2016.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I'm

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
curious to see how well it does.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
I'm kind of skeptical

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
because

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Well, I mean when they first announced

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
this I was like, I think it's

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
really awesome what they're doing. I think it's

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
extremely niche and I'm not sure how

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
they're going to make money on it. But

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
now that they have the backing of Coleco

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
I kind of feel like that's going to maybe put it in more

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
stores and it's going to make it more visible.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
So I kind of think it has a way better

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
shot now than maybe. I mean and again

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
I don't mean to poo-poo it and say

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
it's never going to succeed. But I just

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
feel like it was a really steep climb and this is

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
going to really help give them that visibility

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
that it needs. The controller looks interesting because it looks

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
like a Wii U

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
gamepad. Like the Wii U Pro

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
gamepad. Not the

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
screen or anything.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
It's identical

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
to one of those gamepads.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
And then the middle portion

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
it's basically the

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Super NES controller.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
I just think it's going to be weird when we see

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
games out there. Like the retro-tastic

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
games and it's like going to be coming out

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
soon on Playstation 4, Xbox One

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
and Coleco.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
What?

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
I hope so as well but like I just

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
don't know because like now if you want

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
those retro games you can still get them on other platforms.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
It's not like this is the only way to

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
get that fixed. Yeah they're going to have to have some

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
exclusives or it's going to

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
yeah I get that. Like I don't need the

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
no I'm not going to buy a console for

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
Shovel Knight when Shovel Knight's out on like a

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
billion platforms right now. Yeah no I hear it.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
I hear it. Like several

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
platforms.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Alright well I'm very curious

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
to see how that progresses. Again I think that's really

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
good news for that and it's going to bump it a little

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
bit out of something that otherwise would have been extremely

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
niche. Well let's

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
move on and talk about another Wii U

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
game this week. There's a lot of Wii U stuff in the news

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
this week. Did you know that a new Wii U

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
game actually came out this week?

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
This last Friday called Devil's Third.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
I actually think it wasn't, I think that was the Friday

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
before where we're at now.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Yeah it was Itagaki's game.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
That's right. Itagaki had put this game together for Wii U

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
and I remember it kind of like... It was supposed to be a

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
THQ game and then like that's...

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
kind of disappeared but now it's out.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
Well apparently the game is

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
really hard to find.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Apparently Best Buy

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
had no copies in stock in an entire

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
district and GameStop

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
very few copies. GameStop

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
apparently told this reporter

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
that there was only

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
420 copies of the game

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
for sale in the entire

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
country. What?

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Is that like only for the dot

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
com? Or is that like each store

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
got one copy of the game?

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
And that's not even each store.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
That's like big stores got one copy

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
of the game. That's crazy. Is that a pre-order?

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
I know right? I hear the game wasn't very good

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
but I mean that's

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
I guess that's fine. It makes sense

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
that there's only that many physical copies.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
It is available digitally

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
so that's not a big deal. But people are

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
snatching the shit up like it's a fucking collector's

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
item. Yeah. And it's turning around

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
and showing up on eBay right? It's a fucking

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
it's a pretty shitty game

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
so I don't know. Yeah.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
I guess everyone wants to make a buck.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
William Murderface in chat says apparently

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
it's really bad. Dungeon Buster

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
saying the Europeans got it months ago and

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
pretty much panned it. What meme

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
is asking is it a full $60 game?

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Unfortunately the answer is yes. 50. I think.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Or 50. 50 dollars.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Brad from Pod Culture in Act Deft mentioning

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
the 420 there. 420

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
blaze it! Which actually

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
you know as much as you kind of joke

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
sometimes people put news stories

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
out there that are intentionally false

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
to see how far they'll travel.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
420 that is an odd coincidence

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
of a number to put in a story so

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
maybe a little bit of salt with that but

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
I think it really

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
is fact to say the game is fucking

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
hard to find. Whether it was 420

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
or 600 or 12

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
it's not an easy game to find.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
To be fair it is plausible

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
because the reason for that is they manufactured

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
those discs in lots of 30

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
and so 420

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
is divisible by 30 so

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Oh look at you bringing science into this!

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
I mean there's that.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
I had no idea they did it in lots of 30.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Yeah it's cases of 30

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
for like disc games usually

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
so Wii U

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Okay. Well I learned something today.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
24 for PlayStation

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
because the discs

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
are different. I don't know why

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
it's only 24 but usually 24

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
for like PlayStation 3

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
I think now when everything is on Blu-ray it's all 30

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
but most of the time

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
it's 30. DungeonBuster

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
saying Loki laying down the industry knowledge

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
yeah I got to admit I'm pretty impressed.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
But then again 420 could also be

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
completely made up so I mean

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
it's plausible. It's not a lot

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
and I kind of would wonder

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
what the minimum runs are on those things because

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
normally they have to sell

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
so many in order to make it worthwhile

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
and usually

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
they have to run more than I think

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
420 copies. Yeah unless

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Nintendo just straight up took a loss on this

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
but the game is available in the digital

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
store right? You can get it on

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
the store if you really want to pay the full money.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
I just think I don't remember what their minimums are because

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
I just know from like

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
you know like

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
there was a 3DS title that someone had made

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
or DS title that was like some

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
simulation game and they independently

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
had it printed and it was like

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
they had to make like 8000 copies or something of it

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
like some ridiculous amount

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
so if you have to make 8000 copies of that

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
you know you probably

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
have to make more than 420 copies

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
I have a feeling

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
I have a feeling someone's already written it off as a loss

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Well I'm just saying because like why even

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
make a physical disc if you're going to only print

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
that many copies you would think that they would

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
make at least a few thousand

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
I don't know. Maybe they have to for like tax

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
reasons or something crazy I mean

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
admittedly I'm talking out my ass a little bit

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
but it would make sense.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Or they just

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
they had trouble getting it through customs

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
damn those customs

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
It's just

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
it's terrible. Hey that's

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
a pretty smart move though. Hey let's

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
make only these make copies and make it crazy

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
that people want it and

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
have to get it and now

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
they're selling all those

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
copies. I don't know.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Whatever. Alright. Well let's move on with some

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
more stories. What else you got for us?

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Alright. Actually I think

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
that would be you.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
With the Devil's Third Story? I just did that.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Oh that's right. Oh we're talking about

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Jamie. Sorry about that.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Okay so

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
there's apparently

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
this is kind of interesting so

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Good Game Studios they're

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
accused of busting

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
a union that was being

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
created by

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
their former employees

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
and so

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
I guess allegedly they were

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
let's see here

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
20 employees were involved

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
with establishing a workers

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
council and then

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
the company laid off

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
that council earlier

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
this year and so they

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
kind of were brought up against allegations

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
and

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
I don't know it's they're denying

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
that they did anything wrong but it's kind

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
of like that's kind of weird that you would lay

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
all those people off after they did

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
this. Well there's a lot of people talking about

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
how difficult and demanding

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
the industry can be sometimes. I mean you really

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
have to love video games because

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
especially during you know some real

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
crunch periods you know people

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
work these crazy long days

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
and I'm sure you all have heard of this

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
you know coming out of the EA and some of the stuff here. Now

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
this studio if I'm not mistaken they're in Germany

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
so I mean now it has

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
that complexity of you know I know

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
what the laws are like here in America but I don't know what it's like in Germany.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
It's hard to say is it because of the union that they

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
were laid off or is it because of the

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
development cycle that they were laid off? Yeah.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Yeah and who knows so there's a lot of those questions

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
to answer but I think I think it definitely goes to show

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
that there's some people that get so

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
frustrated maybe with some of the

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
the because sometimes

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
these crimes and I'm saying sometimes

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
sometimes these crunch periods are a result

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
of bad decisions right

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
bad decision is made up top and that

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
trickles down and everybody else has to pay for it

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
right. Yeah. So that's why sometimes these

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
these unions and things are are being

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
formed is to kind of like I guess make

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
those higher up a little more accountable

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
for the decisions they make and the trickle that

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
that could have but again you

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
throw the international complexity into it I'm not

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
really sure how that all works out but

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
very interesting.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Alright. Do you want to talk about

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Minecraft as well before we get to

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Sure. So Minecraft got a

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
console update and they're saying it's the

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
biggest one yet. Brings the game up to version

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
1.88 and

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
adds a bunch of new things new biomes

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
including Mesa, Mega, Tiaga

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Roofed Forest, Birch Forest

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
Savannah, Extreme Hills

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
plus Deep Ocean

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
and Snowless

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Tyga and

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
see there's new mobs including the endermite

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
guardian, elder guardian

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
rabbits and chicken jockeys

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
like

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I seriously

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I was looking through my son's

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
book he has a Minecraft book that talks about like

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
some of the enemies and I'm like I don't know who the fuck

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
these characters are like this wasn't

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
when I was playing so

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
go back to the PC version

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
other things, new blocks

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
including granite, packed ice, red

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
sandstone, diorite

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
prismarine

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
also you can catch treasure while fishing

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
the buttons can be placed

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
on top of or on the tops and bottoms

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
of blocks

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
skeletons flee from wolves

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
and spiders no longer see through solid blocks

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
and that's coming to PlayStation

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Xbox players

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
no Wii U update yet

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
of course

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
alright well

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
I guess I'll have to jump back in

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
I have the PlayStation version

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
of Minecraft so I'll check that out

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
we should do that again cause I like kinda

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I keep talking to my son about like how we used to play

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
on the server and stuff and it

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
you know it's a lot more funny when you have more people playing

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
it is, it is

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
do you have it on PlayStation 4? we could just do a little

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
I do have it on PlayStation 4

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
I have it on PlayStation 4

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
and on Wii U

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
and Xbox 360

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
and Windows 10

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
my phone on

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
my iPod

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
yeah pretty much everywhere

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
oh and I thought I was bad at buying the same game

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
multiple places

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
your Minecraft collection puts my

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Mass Effect 3 collection to shame

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
alright well Valve

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
a lot of people rumbling about

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
the upcoming Steam sale right

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
seems like it's inevitable we got a winter sale coming

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
pretty soon and you know a lot

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
of people usually praise Steam and all that they

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
do but interesting

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Steam's taken a few hits this year

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
and another one on its way is that Valve

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
is being sued in the country of

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
France not here in the States

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
but still we like to cover news everywhere

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
and that is they're being sued

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
in France by and I'm gonna horribly

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
mispronounce this name I'm sorry it's

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
UFC K

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
I have no idea how to

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
pronounce that I'm sorry because I do not speak

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
French but that is a French Consumer

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Association that's what you need to know it's French

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Consumer Association and they put

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
out a new letter and said that the

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Steam subscriber agreement contains

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
clauses which are detrimental

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
to consumer interests

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
apparently

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
it all comes down to the fact that users

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
cannot resell their digital

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
games and that's something that French

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
law allows for and we've talked about this

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
on the show before is that whole controversy

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
about being able to sell a

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
digital game and what's interesting is that

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
the Steam storefront is kind

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
of set up for that right like because you

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
can put games in your inventory

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
but the used thing

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
you can't really do it you can do it with a new

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
game that you haven't installed and played yet but you can't

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
really do it with a used game and I guess the

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
French Association taking

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
some issue with that also

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
though it isn't just limited to that

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
some other things cited is that Valve does

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
not assume responsibility

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
in cases where accounts get hacked

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
and users personal information gets

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
stolen and

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
that is also can be said

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
for how the company claims ownership

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
of any user created

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
content that is uploaded to Steam

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
now apparently

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Valve they use Luxembourg's

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
consumer law in all countries

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
it operates in so that way

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
they don't take into account each countries different

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
rules but it should be noted

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
that Valve was already sued once

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
in a German court by a German

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
consumer group a couple years ago

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
probably when some of these stories first came up

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
about the whole used games digital stuff

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Valve actually won that case

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
but that was in 2014 and this

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
is another country so

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
we'll see what happens with that

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
that could really change things

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
if folks are able to resell

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
their digital games I mean

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
all of a sudden your library man

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
people are going to be unloading games in their library

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
for like 25 cents a pop

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
I mean

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
it's going to be very interesting

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
I don't know

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
I've always hesitated buying

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
digital games I mean

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
it's one thing on Steam when they

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
unload games for you know

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
99 cents or like

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
$3.99 for a little game

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
it makes it very easy to buy that digitally

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
because whatever equity you feel like

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
you'd have in that game would be literally dollars and cents

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
but it's a little harder sometimes

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
to spend $60

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
on a game you're not sure about

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
digitally because you know you're going to get

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
stuck with that game if you don't really like

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
it but if you have it on disc you can at least

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
resell it your game has some equity it has some

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
value in it it'll be very interesting to see

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
how that could really change the market

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
I worry for

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
smaller indie developers that really

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
rely on Steam that might

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
not have the best effect

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
yeah it's going to be kind of hard to do that

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
yeah so I kind of worry for them

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
but I definitely get people's

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
frustration with the AAA side of things

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
like what was it Batman

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Arkham Knight right

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
was a shit show on Steam

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
and you know they kind of had to eat a lot

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
of crap for it and they were charging what $60

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
for that right so if people wanted to get

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
rid of that there's a part of me

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
that kind of thinks they should well Steam

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
did enact that whole

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
refund thing I think to

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
try to account for some of that but I don't know

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
I feel a little differently when it comes to a

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
big big Warner Brothers $60 game

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
like that and then like you know

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
for example's sake the game we were talking about

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
earlier tonight Super Slam Dunk Touchdown

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
you know I don't know if I feel like

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
you know we heard it's one guy

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
that's doing most of this I mean you get some

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
contract help and so forth that I would kind of

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
feel bad if maybe the value of his game

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
gets undercut by this

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
all of a sudden emerging used game

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
market right yeah so

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
it'll be really interesting to see how this

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
plays out I don't know so

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
alright but I'm not a lawyer

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
so I don't know at the end of the day

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
we're going to get to the mailbag you guys it's time

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
to open up the mailbag where you guys

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
participate with us every week

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
over at participate

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000

participate at orange lounge

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
radio dot com

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
I'm logging into the mailbag now because usually

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Dark Soccer will dive into the mailbag

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
and read some mail for you guys but

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
as you all heard a minute ago she had to leave

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
early so it's just me

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
tonight so I'm going to get to the emails

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
we have three of them tonight starting off

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
with this one this is from Robert M

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
who says

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
here's two quick questions and a longer

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:39.000
hopefully cool thing from Halloween

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:41.000
yes the email is from this week

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:43.000
first I don't know if the comic story line

02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:45.000
will affect Captain America Civil War

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
and the MCU Marvel

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Cinematic Universe but if Falcon

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:51.000
takes over the role of Captain from Rogers

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.000
will he be Captain Fal

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
no that's a dumb question actually

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:57.000
can Captain America fly now or did that not

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
happen in Ultimate Marvel

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000
I do not follow

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
comics at all I

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
hate to say it by the way I really

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
want a comic show on VOG Network I'm just putting it out

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
there I've been wanting one for years so if you

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
know a long running show that's interested in joining

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
up with some of us I would

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
love that because this is where I would ask them

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
help because I have no idea

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
John picks up a lot of that slack

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
so does Brad from Pod Culture but

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
I would love some comic experts in here

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Loki do you follow any of that stuff

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
no

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Brad from Pod Culture

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
is filling in a little bit here saying Falcon became

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Captain and flies so that's

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
how that works and I do know from what I

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
remember in the new movie trailer you do see

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
Falcon in it so who knows where the Marvel Cinematic

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Universe will go with that anyhow

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
second have any

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
of you including Bobby gotten to

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
see the Gear VR yet sorry if

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
that was already discussed well funny enough

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
Jamie talked about her experiences earlier in the

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
show Bobby owns one

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I know that because he's the one that showed

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
the Gear VR to me and so yeah

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
I've used Gear VR funny

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
enough I didn't play any games in Gear VR

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
the stuff I saw was like experiences

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
I saw like a Cirque du Soleil thing

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
and like a Paul McCartney concert and I know

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
I've talked about this on the show before you'll

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
want to go back to February

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
of this year when I was at PAX East

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
that was the

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
week I got to play the Gear VR

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Loki did you end up getting one of these?

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
I haven't bought one though because it's

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
$100 and I don't use my

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Oculus well I didn't use my

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Oculus because it runs like shit on my laptop

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
which is fine because it's not meant to

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
run on my laptop

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
I haven't had the money to

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
build a new computer yet to run the Oculus

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
and then of course I'll probably just buy the actual

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
retail one but my phone's nice

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
and should be able to run well it does

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
run the Gear VR stuff so I just

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
maybe eventually

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
I don't know I have to see

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
what they have on it and like maybe if I

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
develop stuff for it that's a

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
ways away so I'm holding out

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
right now

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
and let's see going

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
to the last little bit of the

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
email here from Robert M and

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
finally I thought I'd share two months

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
after slapping this together

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
I built a nearly two foot

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
tall figure for Halloween using

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Lego's Hero Factory or

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Bionicle building system

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
I figured I wanted to try building a large scale

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
character since I would certainly

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
give it a cartoon animal design

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
and I was sure the holo

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
disproportionate robotic thing would

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
invite the obvious comparisons I just went

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
ahead and ran with it building for my

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
parts bins in maybe two hours total

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
in the end my brother didn't let me bring it to his

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
house for his party fearing his three year old

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
would tear it apart I considered building the

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
white one for that reason it doesn't look

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
that much like the in game model but it's effective

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
for what it is and it actually stands

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
up by itself although it's too top heavy

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
for say a running pose

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
now Robert M doesn't name what it is

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
here in the email but he attached some pictures

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
and you can actually see it's one of the

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
characters from Five Nights at Freddy's I believe this is

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Foxy this is the guy that's behind the curtain

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
there it's definitely yeah it's definitely the red Foxy

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
character there it looks like an

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
like a

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
cyborg version of that and the

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
way the eye hangs out is really

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
creepy and yeah I would not want to see that in Five

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Nights at Freddy's or really probably real

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
life so well done if you were going

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
for scary so

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
anyhow Robert M

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
signs the email and then concludes saying

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
PS do you have the public photo

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
pool for OLR active

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
no Robert we actually took that down on the old

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
website a few years ago it was being abused

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
and we didn't have a way to really effectively

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
screen the photos that were going

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
through there and it wasn't really

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
emails like this are so few

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
and far between that unfortunately it wasn't really enhancing

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
the experience I think Twitter

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
kind of took over now people just share their

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
stuff on Twitter and we can kind of retweet

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
and so forth so unfortunately the photo archive

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
kind of kind of met its maker there

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
but the old

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
website in general is really in need

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
of a boost and Jason and I

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
have talked about that we really need to draw Dekeman

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
into that too and see what we can come up

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
with in the new year but we are

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
it's kind of tricky where I'm at because

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
at the same time I really want to make sure VOG

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
has a lot of stuff and obviously

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
we could always use more content for VOG so

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
a lot of my focus kind of goes over there

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
so Orangeloungeradio.com kind of becomes

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
that's the place where the podcast

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
is hosted and it works

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
so don't upgrade the Skype version

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:19.000
over there so it doesn't break so

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
anyhow

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:23.000
there it is that's our email

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
tonight from Robert M let's go to the next email

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:27.000
here from Raginator

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:29.000
who's been emailing us an awful lot because as you know

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:31.000
he can't participate live with the show

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:33.000
if you've been following his emails

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.000
so let's get on to the

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
next and DarkTitsu is saying I know

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
Dekeman's got a lot of family stuff going on so there's

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
that oh yeah obviously and that stuff comes from

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
please I don't I don't make

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
money doing OLR so I can't pay people

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
so yeah I am beggars

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
can't be choosers I can only take help when

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
people are able to help but I appreciate all help

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
moving

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
on to Raginator's email hi everyone it's

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Raginator again as per usual I'm writing

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
in I have two topics for you the first is short

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
but the second is a little long so I apologize

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
for those that haven't noticed yet Humble Bundle

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
is having a Neo Geo bundle going

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
on thank you for reminding me I do have to get

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
it by the time OLR airs and this

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
email is read there'll be about a day and a half to two days

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
left to jump on it but nonetheless I want to

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
pass along the info all in all

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
there's 25 or so games in the bundle which

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
a few of them can be redeemed on Steam

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
the rest are DRM free there's a few

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
noteworthy games in there amongst them are Samurai

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Showdown 2 and 5, Art of Fighting

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
2, 2 or 3 King of Fighter games

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
and Metal Slug

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
1 through 3 and X

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
in my opinion it's a good deal

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
even for the Samurai Showdown games

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
alone seeing as they're not on Steam

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
so yes that is a

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
good FYI because we missed

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
last week's show and a chance to bring that up

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
but it's just running in an emulator you're buying ROMs

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
basically you are buying ROMs but at least

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
you're doing it legally right and some of it's on

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Steam so you have all that built

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
in or whatever is there achievements or

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
no? Not in the ROMs

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
obviously but there's

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
looks like the ones on Steam would be

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Metal Slug 1 and 3

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
and then they also have the King

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
of Fighters 98 Ultimate

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Match Final Edition

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
and...

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Is Fatal Fury Special in there?

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
That's one of my very favorites Metal Slug X and the King

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Fatal Fury Special you said?

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Yeah that's my

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
favorite

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
Fatal Fury Special is one of the

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
DRM free ones

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Alright

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
Act Deft in our chat room

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
talking about there's some controversy there

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
about the ROMs and the emulator that .EMU

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
uses for the games he says he might call in about that

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
later I am behind

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
on this news if that

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
all must come up while I was out of town so I'm very curious

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
to hear what's going on there I did hear

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
it didn't come up on tonight's show but I did hear something

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
and maybe somebody in chat or

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Loki even maybe you know about this

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
remember a couple weeks ago we were talking about the whole

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Bubsy coming back in the 1 and 2

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
Yeah that's basically S.N.E.X

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Oh my god yeah I heard that

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
was basically an emulator

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
and those ROMs and that the people putting it

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
up there weren't even authorized to do it right?

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
I thought I heard that?

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
They said they got the permission but

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
I don't know if that's legitimate

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
Oh man

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
that's crazy and see that's

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
another thing Steam's taken some real

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
hits left and right this year because that would be

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
another thing that's going to make them look silly

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
Like I said I watch a lot of Jim Sterling

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
and stuff and

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
he reviews a lot of really shitty

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
or doesn't review but plays

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
a lot of really shitty Steam games

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
and there's some though that are fucking

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
ridiculous to have copyrighted shit

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
in them that fucking just get through the Greenlight

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
process and get put up there as legit games

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
like they have Gabe Newell's simulator

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
and it's like it's an absolute

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
shit game

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
and there's it's just

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
people just send this

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
stuff through and it's just cluttering up the

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
fucking Steam store

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Very curious

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
about that now just I

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
heard that somewhere I don't know that to be true

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
so I just want to put that out there

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
and in fact I just did a news search and I'm not seeing

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
anything about it but I swear to god I heard something out

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
there this week about that whole thing so

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
the Bubsy thing was not

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
as not as

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
A plus so I just allegedly

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
covering my own ass there

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
Alright let's get to Rage Nator's second topic here

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Only kinda sorta tangently

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
gaming related alright I guess we'll allow it

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Hoping for your input nonetheless

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
See I'm the oldest of four siblings

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
and my sister two years my junior

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
along with my one brother four years my junior

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
for the past two months have repeatedly offered

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
to loan me some money to get me a new PC

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
I refuse for two reasons

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
One being that when they do something out of the

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
kindness of their hearts strings are always attached

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
this time being no different

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
Secondly my sister isn't in a position to loan

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
or give out money due to her own finances

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
living in a very expensive area of Alberta

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
Canada owing way more on her mortgage

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
I feel like this is personal stuff I don't want to read on

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
air I told her

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
specifically that her kids need to come first

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
and at least with the strings attached

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
aspect they told me if they were going to loan me the

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
money I was to get the computer that

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
they wanted me to have a low end Dell

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
that I wouldn't run all my games

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
and I'd be stuck with a PC I couldn't use

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
and a debt that I'd have to repay

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
My brother seemed to have dropped the subject albeit

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
in a huff a month ago but my sister apparently

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
didn't and tried to be slick

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
She told me on 12-9 that she sent me via

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
UPS a $200 Target card

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
to be used on a computer and that I needed to be

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
home the next day to accept it

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
That despite the fact I asked her not to do it

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
plus I already had plans that day

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
due to doctors appointments I couldn't be home

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
all day waiting on UPS

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Anyway I was forced to reschedule my appointment

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
then when UPS did show up I refused delivery

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
Of course 20 minutes later my sister calls me

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
in a huff and we had a massive argument

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
We're not talking. What's your points

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
regarding this?

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Wow this is this is

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
the OLR therapy moment here

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
You guys need to sit down and have a nice

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
long talk about this. I think that's

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
very nice that your family wants to do

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
that and I think you should acknowledge it

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
at such and say I think it's very nice that

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
you want to do this but

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
I really want to be able to do this on my own terms

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
and build the system that I want to do

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
so thank you but

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
no thank you and I think that has to be that

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
and if for whatever reason they can't hear

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
that then I would kind of wonder

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
why they can't

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
respect your wishes that you want to go

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
through that process of saving the money

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
that you want to do and build the

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
system that you want. Now granted

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
there's three sides to every story

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
your side, their side, and the truth

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
so I'm only able

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
to really say this based on what I'm reading in this

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
email

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
I would just say you're not really

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
under any obligation to accept

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
a gift but at the same time

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
you should probably acknowledge that

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
hey somebody wants to do something nice

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
for me and that's a good thing but this whole

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
thing about the whole I bought you

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
a card and you need to be at home

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
and all that stuff that's

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
a little weird but the fact that you refuse delivery

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
you could have accepted the card and

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
then taken her the card and said you know I

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
appreciate this but I'm going to give it back to you

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
it might have been a little easier way to do

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
it without starting a whole

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
fight there

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
but anyway

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
would you care to

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
suggest anything to that Loki

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
I did not realize we were going to be

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
playing therapy on OLR in that email

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
but that's alright

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
I hope you guys can work it out, it's the holidays

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
it's the freaking holidays

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
hug it out

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
alright

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
one more email here

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
from YYR

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
Hello

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
OLR

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
feverishly working on diagrams for my

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
provisional patent application

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
if that sounds boring it's because it is

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
ugh I'm fascinated that you're going

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
through your patent application I would like

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
to hear more about that process someday

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
seated to my right however is Amy

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
and she is not bored because she is playing Ori

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
in the Blind Forest I don't know how I missed

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
this game when it came out months back but I took a

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
gamble on it grabbing it for $10 on the Black Friday

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
sale knowing absolutely nothing about it

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
fast forward a bit and I can honestly

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
say it's a game I feel I have a responsibility

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
to recommend to almost everyone specifically

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
if you like Metroidvania style games at

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
all and have an Xbox One you need

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
to buy this the controls are perfect

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
the gameplay is just as addictive as it is

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
in the best games in that genre and the graphics

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
well as far as games with 2D

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
gameplay and 3D graphics go I've never seen one

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
so beautiful the music is fantastic

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
too and some of the power ups are really

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
inventive and fun to use it's not a super

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
long game so it won't take you away from your other

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
bigger games for more than a few days

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
the chance is high that it will go on sale again

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
when the big Xbox sale begins in a few days

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
very possibly to the $10 I got

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
it for but quite honestly I'd pay the

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
full $20 for it

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
it is that good and if you buy

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
it over the next few days it will be on your

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
best game of the year list Rob

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
I'm looking at you and possibly winking

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
um surprise YYR I

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
actually bought that game already I bought it in

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
a sale I don't think it was Black Friday sale but they

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
did some other random sale it was either

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
at the end of summer or um

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
beginning of fall I don't remember there was maybe

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Labor Day sale or something and uh

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
Codeman was telling me what a great game that was and I

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
heard it was Metroidvania so I actually checked it out

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
and I did really enjoy it admittedly

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
I did not spend enough time with it because

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
you know it kind of fell in that

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
avalanche of games that's coming out in the

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
fall but um I do want to go back

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
and spend some more time with it because I

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
also agree it's a real gorgeous game

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
and you know I love me some Metroidvania

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
uh the game

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
really ramps up in difficulty fast though from what

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
I remember like I remember I was like playing in the beginning

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
I'm like oh this is easy this is easy and then like

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
just kidding so

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
um yeah there is that

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
but yeah I've already checked that out YYR

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
but uh I'm sure the listeners still appreciate

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
uh a little uh plug

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
and so forth uh have you checked that out Loki

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
the Ori and the Blind Forest? Um

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
no I have not you'll have to keep an

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
eye out for that on the Steam sale because I

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
I agree with YYR it's almost certain to show up

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
on Steam sale or Xbox One

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
or one of those so

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
alright uh and uh

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
lastly hope you guys and all the listeners

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
have a Supra Ultra

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Hyper Mega Merry Christmas

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Championship Edition Turbo 3

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
Happy Holidays

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
YYR or Aaron

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
thank you so much YYR really appreciate

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
that and you know what I did get by the way your message

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
about the um multitasking

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
trade ships with other employees but

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
I'm waiting for their

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
managers to approve it

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
one is getting back to me yay or nay

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
I hate it when like if they're not gonna

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
approve something just say listen we're not gonna

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
approve it or you know listen

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
they've decided not to go with your

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
ship trade

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
just let me know either way

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
you know don't leave me in limbo

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
alright

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
um my FU of the week uh

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
things have been going pretty well I uh

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
I've had a pretty good weekend there's not a lot I can

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
give an FU to um I would say

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
um

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
um oh FU to the computer problems

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
I've been having tonight FU to Skype

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
FU to Skype

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
fucking breaking my computer with the

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
updates and I really don't know how I'm gonna fix

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
it I'm gonna have to do some type of like

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
deep clean where I go in and remove every single

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Skype file I don't even really know how to

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
do that but that's time

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
this week I didn't want to have to spend and now I'm gonna

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
but I'm doing it for you guys

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
so we can make sure we continue the calls here on

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
OLR cause having a listener

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
interaction here on OLR is very important

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
and I would never say FU to that so

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
I will work to fix Skype

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
even if that means updating the computer

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
because honestly the show computer hasn't been

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
upgraded since when did I throw the

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
DevaFit that was when I was living with John

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
that was a while ago that was um

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
the DevaFit was in the garage

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
that would have had to have been what 2009

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
2009?

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
so this no

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
I'm losing

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
track in my head I want to say it was maybe like

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
2009 when that happened maybe a little earlier

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
even like 2008

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
so getting old I know right

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
I can't remember years well no I said the

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
computer's getting old even those power supplies

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
don't last that long yeah so it might be

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
time to sub out a few parts

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
maybe the power supply for sure

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
and I don't know maybe try to put some more RAM or even

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
another chip in there and just see

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
if I can boost it to where it can run

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Windows 7 or something and some of the more

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
modern stuff but you know

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
more RAM I am I am such

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
the type that's like I don't want to fix

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
what's not broken

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
but now it's breaking so it never works correctly

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
just like stupid Unity and fucking

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
Windows 8 and now Windows 10

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
doesn't it's like for no reason it just

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
stops working no one has the answer to why

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
this isn't working it's just eh fuck

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
it Unity 5 no not gonna

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
work yeah uh TigerCon

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
chat says I remember the time OLR's computer

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
went down after the video card died that's

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
when this computer came in because and that was you

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
guys and I gotta say that is one of

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
I I I I

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
rendered speechless quite often on this show

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
I must say by the generosity of the

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
listeners and so far cause you know we don't we don't ask for

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
money or anything like that but you guys

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
banded together and bought fucking

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
computer parts and so this computer

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
we're using is a listener donated computer

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
so there's also a tiny

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
part of me there's a tiny part of me that wants to make it

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
last as long as possible but

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
I'm in a much better place finance not that I'm like

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
rolling in money but I'm in a better place

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
I'm certainly not but I'm in a better place financially now

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
than I was six years ago so

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
if I have to kick down a little bit of money to

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
buy a new chip or some RAM or a new power supply

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
or whatever I don't mind we'll we'll make

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
it work so alright

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
uh anyhow

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
let's uh let's move on we got a few more

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
stories for you guys then we're gonna try

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
to open up the Skype line but I'm gonna warn you guys

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
it's gonna be a little wonky tonight so we'll do our

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
best uh try to at least get some calls in here

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
so let's get to Loki

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
so now they've added one on one

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
rival battles for Guitar Hero

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
TV that's of course part

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
of Guitar Hero Live

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
and um I guess you'll

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
be able to once you've hit

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
level 10 you'll be put

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
against other similarly skilled

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
uh players on one on one

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
battles and they

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
said that twice during every

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
30 minute slot on Guitar Hero

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
TV channel um

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
you'll find another player I guess

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
and then the winner of the challenge will

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
receive an extra uh

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
100 XP

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
I don't get this game anymore

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
I still need to

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
get it I keep saying I'm gonna get it

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
and then I uh I don't so

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
I need to pick that up cause uh

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
um it was a lot of fun to play

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
in the demo and so forth and I have to

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
admit I was not expecting that out of Guitar Hero

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
so uh I didn't drop all the money for it day

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
one but uh uh

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
I want to check this out so

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
too many games and not

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
enough time that's right isn't that isn't

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
that it and you know we all have to hold down

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
day jobs so we don't get to

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
I don't have time to play

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
games unfortunately

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
well I end up staying up till one in the

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
morning every day to play games

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
and get my nice

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
five hours of sleep we

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
try though we do the best we can cause we love games

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
although for some stupid

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
reason I can make tons of time for fucking ingress

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
which is retarded

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
ingress is a game it's just a different

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
type of game it's a social game

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
it's a chore

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
it's like a farm

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
I went to an ingress party that had nothing to do with

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
playing the game I was just hanging out with some of the people this week

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
oh I don't know who any of the people are I mean I've

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
met them I gotta meet introduce some more of them

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
just some really fun people to play

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
alright uh

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
anyhow let's move on one more story for you guys

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
also about music games and this one is about

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Rock Band 4 which I finally

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
imported my Rock Band 3 songs over the weekend

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
so I have that to look forward to

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
playing all those games but one

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
thing I'm not gonna get to do is play them online

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
cause Harmonics said this week

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
we're not sure yet where online multiplayer

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
fits in our roadmap

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
now Harmonics is saying that online multiplayer

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
is very much on the table for Rock Band 4

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
but they don't know exactly

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
where that fits in

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
on the Harmonics blog David Sussman

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
said online multiplayer is

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
a part of a much bigger conversation

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
we know it's at the top of a lot of people's want list

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
online play with Rock Band is a big deal

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
given the amount of different combinations of player

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
4 potential instruments, different difficulties

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
song affinities between players and so forth

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
there's a ton of testing necessary

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
as well as technical back end to work through

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
in order to provide a fun stable experience

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
for any future development

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
especially features that have existed in our legacy

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Rock Band games

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
we want to be able to improve and refine wherever

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
possible in the case of online

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
play we have a lot of critical feedback

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
on the Rock Band 3 design that we'd love to be able

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
to address. Adding this functionality

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
is very much on the table but we're not sure

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
yet where it fits in our roadmap

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
part of our process includes taking

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
your advice into consideration

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
before it can deliver a feature as complex

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
as online multiplayer we would like

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
to better understand what you want

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
and find to be important

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
blah blah blah we're gonna send out a survey

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
about online play shortly blah blah blah

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
fill it out

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
now dark to see you in chat saying I don't get there

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
hold up I mean didn't the previous games have online

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
multi maybe I'm wrong I've really only

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
played a little bit of 3 offline

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
2 and 3 both had it

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
and I think that's why a lot of people

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
are confused because it's adding

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
into that whole perception that Rock Band

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
4 was a step backwards for the game

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
I just don't

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
let's just call it what it is

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
it was fucking rushed out

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
seriously it shouldn't be

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
it's on our table of stuff that we're gonna

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
add into the game

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
that's just features

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
it should've been fucking if it's not done

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
it's not done don't release the game

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
don't just put it out there because oh we need to

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
get those sales in

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
but here's the double edged sword

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
with that I think Harmonix is in a

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
tricky position especially because you know

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
let's not forget Rock Band 3

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
had that EA money and it had that MTV

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
money so I think in a way

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
Harmonix had to get the game

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
out there to fund the game they really

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
wanted to make I realize

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
that's not what you want to hear

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
nobody wants to hear that

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
but that's what's happening

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
you know it's just like

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
you know with Kinect and stuff

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
well Kinect's gonna do all these fantastic

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
things except it can't

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
but Kinect 2.0 will

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
but it can't

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
but Kinect 3.0

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
it's like no I'm not gonna buy that

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
alright

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
we are to the point of this show where we're gonna open

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
up the Skype line over at 1877

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
game OLR or actually

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
I don't think the toll free number is working right now

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
I think I enabled something

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
that now because I can't log in on the desktop

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
I can't undo that so

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
I am just gonna give out our regular Skype

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
which is Orange Lounge Radio all one word

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
on Skype I'm gonna warn you guys

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
we're doing this a little differently tonight so I don't know how this

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
is gonna go but

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
fuck it we'll do it live so if you wanna

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
give us a call go ahead Orange Lounge Radio all one

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
word on Skype the Skype line is open

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
now

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
if you do have general questions of course you can always

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
yell those out in chat if you don't want to actually call in

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
you can always give us the questions in the chat

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
room I would usually use tweets

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
to fill time but my phone

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
is now dedicated to the Skype line

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
tonight which we are getting a

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
call coming in on the Skype line so I'm gonna try

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
and get to it right now

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
Legend of Zaku here

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
Hey Zaku how you doing?

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
Yeah it's been a long

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
yeah it's been like ages I know I've been

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
sacking off on this OLR thing

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
Well welcome back we missed you

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
what's on your mind?

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Nothing much other than

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
well in about a minute my

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
birthday's coming up Well happy birthday

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
you're a holiday baby

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
Yeah that too

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
and you know essentially

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
right now

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
kind of in the midst of trying to

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
switch over on FSX to the Steam

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
edition which is gonna be fun

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
and hopefully they'll get me

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
onto Windows 10 Other than that

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
it's like I guess going on that

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
whole Rock Band multiplayer thing

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
I guess you know

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
you're right

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
at some point

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Harmonix wants to avoid

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
something known as Scope Creep

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
where because it's like

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
because of the actual

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
requirements

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
and the fact that they need to hit a hard deadline

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
they have to

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
forgo certain features

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
even if they were standard

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
and I guess

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
the fact that they have to

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
position themselves as trying to contrast

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
against Guitar Hero Live which

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
for all intents and purposes I hear didn't

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
do as great as Rock Band 4

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
And you know

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
what's interesting about that whole thing is

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
I bet the history of the franchise

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
really played into that because

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
I have to be brutally honest

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
as unfair and

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
as it might sound of me

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
I kind of judged Guitar Hero Live

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
based on the prior Guitar Hero

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
games and I probably

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
shouldn't have done that

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
I think as they

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
were released

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
I can't believe I'm going to say this

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
I kind of think Guitar Hero was the better game out of the box

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
and I kind of

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
made a mistake choosing Rock Band 4

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
based on all these other promises

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
I don't know

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
it's weird

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
it's a really weird situation for me but the reality is

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
there's only so many

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
fucking plastic instruments I'm willing to have

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
and Guitar Hero

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
took a huge risk

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
changing not only where the

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
instruments can't really be used

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
but they really changed the formula with the whole

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
six buttons I mean you couldn't even

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
use the old ones if you wanted to

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
so unfortunately

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
the risk isn't paying

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
off and I almost feel bad because

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
that's twice now

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
that developer's kind of gotten screwed

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
for problems that aren't really theirs

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
because that was the developer of DJ Hero

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
horrifically underrated

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
game and now they've got Guitar Hero

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
Live which also is kind of underrated

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
and I feel bad, I'm part of the problem

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Right

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
and I guess in Harmonic's case to their

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
benefit by focusing

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
more on getting the install

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
based compatibility

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
at the expense

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
of online multiplayer

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
bringing it back to

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
the core mechanics of

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
actually having to go to someone's

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
place to play Rock Band, bring back that

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
experience I guess that was more important to them

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
and you know

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
as I said this is a stepping stone

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
provided that they make enough

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
money that they could probably just

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
add, they could probably patch this in

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
a later update. Remember

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
you gotta keep in mind that Harmonic's

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
for all intents and purposes

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
would most likely release one

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
version of that

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
Rock Band franchise for that

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
platform's entire

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
lifespan meaning that

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
because you could actually patch in features

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
it shouldn't you know

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
adding online multiplayer

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
isn't like world ending in that sense

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
because remember they see it

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
as a platform and not necessarily a release

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Right and you know

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
I'm trying to be fair to Harmonic's

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
and you know I think I kind of said what I said about

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
the fact that you know they're in a different position now

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
than they were a couple of years ago but

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
the reality is niceness

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
and understanding only goes so far

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
when you're asking for $100 of my money

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
true but

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
at the same token

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
it could have been worse like Guitar Hero

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Live you had like

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
almost zero

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000
songs from the original

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000
the previous releases carrying over

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000
like you're talking about people who spent

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
upwards of at least a thousand bucks

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
on Rock Band DLC alone

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
in almost a decade

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
that it's been ever since the first

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:45.000
release so that's a hell of

02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:47.000
a longevity in terms of DLC

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
literally carrying from one generation

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
to another

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Well at least Guitar Hero is doing something a little

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
different with the whole streaming thing

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
but I get your point I mean I understand that

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
you know Guitar Hero and maybe that's part

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
of the reason Guitar Hero also took

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
a hit in sales is that they didn't promise

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
that backwards compatibility

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
so to speak that Rock Band did

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
and I think that's one reason a lot of people were jazzed

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
about Rock Band and that would completely

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
explain why Harmonic's

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
had to cut certain features out because

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
obviously making the hard

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
deadlines a lot more important

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
but I think this is important

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
Harmonic still has not

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
fully met that promise

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
it took them a month to do it

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
for Rock Band 3 we still

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
do not have original Rock Band, Rock Band 2

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
Rock Band Lego there's still a lot of stuff

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
missing and I don't think that's

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
okay I don't think that was okay

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
for them to misrepresent

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
that there's really

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
no nice way for me to put it I feel it was really

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
misrepresented when they announced it

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
is that they're gonna bring all that

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
stuff out but not day one

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
well as I said this is

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
welcome to the world of

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
licensing where now the lawyers

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
have to play have to basically negotiate

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
they're basically

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
negotiating with the music industry

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
well negotiate it before you announce it

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
true yeah you usually don't

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
announce it until the ink is dry

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
but you know now they're pretty much

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
caught right there you know

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
they're exposed in that

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
if for some reason certain

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Rock Band tracks unless they've

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
specifically stated that certain tracks

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
may not make it

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
make it over to Rock Band 4

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
as a disclaimer they're pretty much

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
caught in the sense that

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
you know there were the only thing they

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
have is their word and if their word doesn't

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
deliver on the you know

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
thousand plus dollars worth of DLC

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
certain Rock Band

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
you know last gen Rock Band owners have

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
then yeah you know

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
it would suck to spend all

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
that money and

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
all of it getting left

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
behind as a result because harmonics

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
basically you know

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
they basically jumped the

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
gun a bit too early in terms of

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
trying to handle that transition

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
but that pretty much could break

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
the entire music

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
rhythm genre for consoles

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
in general

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
unfortunately I think

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
I mean you're right and that's

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
the really sad thing especially having been

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
fans of music games for so long is that if

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
both these games tank there's

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
not gonna be rhythm games for a good

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
well I shouldn't say that

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
there will be rhythm games and it's gonna be

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
indie and that's gonna be awesome

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
but the day of the plastic instruments is dead

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
yeah and this is where

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
like an arcade would you know

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
Japan probably being the last bastion

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
of rhythm gaming or

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
that area around the Pacific Rim

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
but yeah you're right

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
well unless but

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
I mean for those that follow

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
Kyle Ward on Facebook

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
something's up so

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
we'll have to get in touch with him later

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
to get more insight on that I don't know

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
I don't want to comment on somebody's Facebook

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
but I think all that stuff is public

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
so it's not like it's not out there but

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
very interesting stuff I heard

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
I know he went to Japan

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
past couple of weeks

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
you know Grant that was in Peru just like

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
following him there's a video we're seeing

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
if you haven't seen it yet where

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
he's definitely dancing on an 8 arrow

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
mat you've never seen it before

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
oh wait I think I get it

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
now I think I may have saw that in my feed

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
an 8 arrow oh Jesus

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
so anyway that means he's probably

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
unless he worked on something

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
with Konami that would have to explain

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
his meetings out there who knows

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
who knows anyway I don't wanna

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
I gotta watch how far I go down that

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
we'll let him on the show when he wants to talk about that

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
but anyway Zaku

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
we'll let you go for now

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
alright take care buddy thanks for calling

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
since we

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
have to have this whole little rig

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
here with my iPhone and all that stuff

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
1877

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Game OLR or username on Skype

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Orange Lounge Radio if you wanna give us a call

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
and I don't know why I gave out that

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
800 number cause

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
welp it doesn't work tonight

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000

hey this is Akdeaf

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
hey Akdeaf buddy what's on your mind tonight

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
well like I taste

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
with Reginator's email

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
oh okay

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
yeah I'm gonna talk about the

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
Neo Geo

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
Humble Bundle oh yes

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
you were commenting in chat about the whole controversy

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
around the emulators what's going on

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
yeah basically

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
nobody knows because

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
it kind of was

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
it did get

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
some coverage

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
but it wasn't like really big

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
but basically

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
on the day

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
that Humble got released

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
a friend of mine

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
a really close friend of mine called

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
FoxHack on Twitter

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
found some really interesting details

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
about the

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
where they got the

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
ROMs for the games

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
so basically

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
those ROMs came from

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
torrents

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
pirates torrents of those games

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
and you can find

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
them on the code they have

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
and also

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
a really big issue that

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
also came from

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
that is that the emulator

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
at first

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
was thought that it was

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
like an illegal

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
one at least for

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
for in this case

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
.emu to use

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
so

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
basically

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
after a day

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
the day after it happened

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
basically .emu came out and

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
replied to my friend

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
here that

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
the emulator was

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
gotten or was acquired by

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
GameTap

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
I think

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
and they have a legal use of it

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
but

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
some other details

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
appeared on this

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
I'm gonna

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
pretty much quote something

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
I have on the

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
sorry on the website

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
I have here

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
some thread basically on

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
name world

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
so if I'm following correctly

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
just to make sure because there's a lot of moving parts here

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
if I'm understanding this correctly

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
the pirated ROMs

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
Neo Geo grabbed them

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
and ended up turning around and selling them

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
which I have to admit

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
is kind of some funny irony

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
and honestly it's kind of like one of those

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
well I don't

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
this is gonna sound crazy

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
I don't see the problem in that

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
turnabouts fair play

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
this is not necessarily the problem

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
that they got the ROM from

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
an illegal torrent

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
it's more the

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
hold on

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
because Act F is gonna have a hard time

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
hold on Act F

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
they're gonna sue themselves what

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
seriously it's like

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
there's no way that whoever illegally put those up there

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
is gonna have any recourse

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
those are our files

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
but I think this is where you're going Act F

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
the problem is the emulator

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
because the emulator technically is nothing

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
that's not technically illegal

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:13.000
I know a lot of people use them for illegal purposes

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
but yeah if you include the

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
emulator you didn't pay for that

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
well that's not irony

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
somebody did program that

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
for homebrew stuff

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
and who knows what

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
that's a little bit of a different territory

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
than the ROMs themselves

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
yeah basically the ROMs are not the problem here

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
it's more like

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
they're pretty much lazy

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
and .emu has a really bad history

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
on laziness

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
doing ports and stuff

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
but that's not the issue here

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000
the issue here is the emulator

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000
and I'm gonna post

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
a post here on this thread that I linked on

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:51.000
on the chat

03:02:51.000 --> 03:02:53.000
the problem is Nebula

03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:55.000
uses the main

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:57.000
FM cores, Nebula being the emulator

03:02:57.000 --> 03:02:59.000
they use

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000
which even to this day we haven't got Jarek

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
a person who programmed

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
the emulator

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
to relicense for commercial use

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
it's one of the biggest sticking blocks

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000
for relicense efforts

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
so unless Alsemi

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
another programmer there

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
specifically rewrote them

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
for this then it can simply

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
it can be legal

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000
there's other main codes

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
in Nebula too so it's not really clear cut

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
as they make out

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000
Nebula definitely uses main FM cores

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
and some of the main bits

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
I don't recall

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
so it probably wasn't legal for GameTap

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
to use it and it's likely

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
not for .emu

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000
either unless they replaced

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
all of it

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
so a reply from that says

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000
from Alsemi himself

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
one of the programmers

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
I can hardly remember who wrote them

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000
it was many years ago

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
but GameTap had their own FM

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000
68K

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
and C80 cores

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
that they plugged into Street Nebula

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
core and integrated them

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
in their platform

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
I just provided the code

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
and I was able to redistribute

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
only the code

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
written by me, Alsemi

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
and assistance on

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
how to plug the other cores

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
into their frontend

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
so to try and simplify

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
this for listeners who might have a hard time

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
following all this drama

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
especially with all these internal names of emulators

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
and so forth

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
I get the sense what's happening is that MAME

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
which of course is the multi arcade machine

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
emulator, very popular

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
multi arcade machine emulator

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
if I'm not mistaken it's open source

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
part of open source is that the source goes out there

03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:43.000
but you don't have the right to resell it

03:04:43.000 --> 03:04:45.000
am I correct?

03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000
basically

03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000
and so essentially if you're taking these MAME pieces

03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000
and putting it in your Neo Geo

03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:53.000
emulator that I guess is being used

03:04:53.000 --> 03:04:55.000
on the Steam platform

03:04:55.000 --> 03:04:57.000
they're essentially selling MAME

03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.000
and I'm really oversimplifying it

03:04:59.000 --> 03:05:01.000
but they're essentially selling those MAME parts which is illegal

03:05:01.000 --> 03:05:03.000
correct?

03:05:03.000 --> 03:05:05.000
so that's kind of it

03:05:05.000 --> 03:05:07.000
although if GameTap

03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:09.000
in this case, sorry, DotEmu

03:05:09.000 --> 03:05:11.000
says they got those licenses

03:05:11.000 --> 03:05:13.000
from GameTap

03:05:13.000 --> 03:05:15.000
which they acquired them legally

03:05:15.000 --> 03:05:17.000
so there's not a big

03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:19.000
problem here but

03:05:19.000 --> 03:05:21.000
it's kind of shady because

03:05:21.000 --> 03:05:23.000
they didn't

03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:25.000
came through at first with this

03:05:25.000 --> 03:05:27.000
and it's still

03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:29.000
not clear where they got

03:05:29.000 --> 03:05:31.000
at least in this case GameTap

03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.000
how they got the code

03:05:33.000 --> 03:05:35.000
or at least how they

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:37.000
they were selling those

03:05:37.000 --> 03:05:39.000
ROMs

03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.000
and enablers

03:05:41.000 --> 03:05:43.000
well realistically I mean I could see it

03:05:43.000 --> 03:05:45.000
one of two ways I could see that they just put the MAME

03:05:45.000 --> 03:05:47.000
code in there because they were probably like fuck it

03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.000
it's our game we'll do what we want

03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:51.000
and I realize that's not what you're supposed to do

03:05:51.000 --> 03:05:53.000
that could be

03:05:53.000 --> 03:05:55.000
but I could also see that they could have contacted

03:05:55.000 --> 03:05:57.000
GameTap to get that code because

03:05:57.000 --> 03:05:59.000
I mean GameTap is

03:05:59.000 --> 03:06:01.000
it's not with Turner anymore

03:06:01.000 --> 03:06:03.000
they sold that years ago to an overseas company

03:06:03.000 --> 03:06:05.000
they probably were able to get

03:06:05.000 --> 03:06:07.000
they probably emailed somebody at GameTap

03:06:07.000 --> 03:06:09.000
yo do you still have this code could we pay you like

03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:11.000
pennies for this code and

03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:13.000
GameTap was like oh yeah sure we don't have anything else

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:15.000
going on I mean

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:17.000
they could probably got

03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.000
that GameTap code for pennies

03:06:19.000 --> 03:06:21.000
I mean so

03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:23.000
but I

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:25.000
don't know but this guy here

03:06:25.000 --> 03:06:27.000
does say that he

03:06:27.000 --> 03:06:29.000
gave the code written by him and assistance

03:06:29.000 --> 03:06:31.000
on the other course so I don't know maybe they were able to get

03:06:31.000 --> 03:06:33.000
the GameTap stuff but we don't know

03:06:33.000 --> 03:06:35.000
and I don't think they're gonna exactly

03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:37.000
be saying it I guess

03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.000
we should be happy

03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:41.000
I don't know to try and put a positive spin

03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:43.000
on this even though I don't know there is one

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:45.000
it is being sold on Humble Bundle

03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:47.000
which a lot of that goes to charity anyway

03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:49.000
so yeah

03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:51.000
that's something that a lot of people did

03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:53.000
when they heard the story

03:06:53.000 --> 03:06:55.000
break and when they

03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:57.000
read my friend's Twitter

03:06:57.000 --> 03:06:59.000
most people

03:06:59.000 --> 03:07:01.000
they did want the game

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000
so they

03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:05.000
they gave all the money to charity

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:07.000
so at least something good came of it

03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:09.000
so yeah

03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:11.000
at least there's that but very

03:07:11.000 --> 03:07:13.000
interesting I had no idea that that was

03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:15.000
the drama but essentially it is that the

03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:17.000
mame is basically being resold

03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:19.000
potentially

03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.000
and I can see where that's

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.000
ruffling a lot of feathers

03:07:23.000 --> 03:07:25.000
thank you for the insight ActDeaf I'll make sure that the money

03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:27.000
goes to charity when I pick it up

03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:29.000
sure alright

03:07:29.000 --> 03:07:31.000
well take care of my friend I'm gonna let you go so we can try to squeeze in

03:07:31.000 --> 03:07:33.000
one more call ok?

03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:35.000
hey thanks for coming on take care

03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:37.000
alright there it is

03:07:37.000 --> 03:07:39.000
one more call there

03:07:39.000 --> 03:07:41.000
and we're gonna try to open it up for one more call

03:07:41.000 --> 03:07:43.000
to squeeze in 1877 Game

03:07:43.000 --> 03:07:45.000
OLR or a username on Skype

03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:47.000
Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us

03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:49.000
a call I don't know why I keep giving out the phone number because I just said

03:07:49.000 --> 03:07:51.000
it didn't work but when you say one

03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:53.000
thing for hundreds and hundreds of episodes it's pretty

03:07:53.000 --> 03:07:55.000
hard to get it out of your vocabulary

03:07:55.000 --> 03:07:57.000
Loki any last minute

03:07:57.000 --> 03:07:59.000
things you're pulling up there while we're waiting for one more

03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:01.000
call potentially here?

03:08:01.000 --> 03:08:03.000
just the HTC Vive has gotten some

03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000
sort of improvements and because

03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:07.000
of that I want to say that it was

03:08:07.000 --> 03:08:09.000
going to be pushed from

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:11.000
to April 2016

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:13.000
as far as

03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:15.000
the release date and they're going to be showing offset

03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:17.000
improvements at CES

03:08:17.000 --> 03:08:19.000
interesting

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:21.000
alright

03:08:21.000 --> 03:08:23.000
one last shout out for calls

03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:25.000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype

03:08:25.000 --> 03:08:27.000
it looks like it's working that's the good news

03:08:27.000 --> 03:08:29.000
the only downside is I'm getting some of the Skype noises

03:08:29.000 --> 03:08:31.000
there as I have to unmute and mute

03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:33.000
the cell phone feed

03:08:33.000 --> 03:08:35.000
from the

03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.000
mixing board but that also means

03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000
I can play stuff from my iPhone

03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:41.000
right there into the mixing board

03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:43.000
that's kind of fun do you want to play some Flappy Bird?

03:08:43.000 --> 03:08:45.000
have some Flappy Bird sounds?

03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:47.000
want to do Ingress?

03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:49.000
well I'm dumping my keys out of my

03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:51.000
capsules because I had to put

03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:53.000
them all in there when I was doing that fielding

03:08:53.000 --> 03:08:55.000
which by the way it made checkpoints so that's good

03:08:55.000 --> 03:08:57.000
hey congrats that's great did you go up on the leaderboards?

03:08:57.000 --> 03:08:59.000
31 nice

03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:01.000
make 100 slots available so I can give you some gear

03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:03.000
when the show's over oh I've got tons

03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:05.000
hook you up!

03:09:05.000 --> 03:09:07.000
let's see

03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000
I guess that's it

03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000
we're not getting any other calls so I guess

03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:13.000
we're well after 9 o'clock anyway so I think

03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.000
I'll go ahead and close up the Skype line

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:17.000
there and thank you guys who

03:09:17.000 --> 03:09:19.000
did get in and if you didn't get in you

03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:21.000

03:09:23.000 --> 03:09:25.000
is the place to send us an email I'm very sorry

03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:27.000
I didn't get to the tweets tonight but my phone was being

03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.000
taken up for something else so I'll

03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:31.000
try to get to those next week

03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:33.000
but that's going to do it for another

03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:35.000
episode of Orange Lounge Radio

03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:37.000
we're back weekly we will be

03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:39.000
here on Sunday I think many shows you

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:41.000
listen to will be having

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000
the week off and they probably deserve it

03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:45.000
but since we already have taken several weeks off

03:09:45.000 --> 03:09:47.000
we're going to be here next week and

03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:49.000
the week after right on into

03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.000
2016 and the 14th

03:09:51.000 --> 03:09:53.000

Radio starting high school

03:09:55.000 --> 03:09:57.000

03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:59.000
that is going to be our 2016

03:09:59.000 --> 03:10:01.000
here at Orange Lounge Radio

03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000
maybe our voices will start changing

03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:05.000
we'll get a little deeper

03:10:05.000 --> 03:10:07.000

03:10:29.000 --> 03:10:31.000
long way and we appreciate them all

03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:33.000
that's going to do it

03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:35.000

hardworking indie developers as we

03:10:53.000 --> 03:10:55.000
get into 2016 I met a lot of great ones

03:10:55.000 --> 03:10:57.000
at GX and I hope to meet more at

03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000
MAGFest and whatever shows I show

03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:01.000
up at in 2016

03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:04.000
Dark

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000
Sakura had to leave early tonight but

03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:08.000
I'm sure if she had a final

03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:10.000
thought she'd say something like reject

03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:12.000
false icons we'll leave it at that but

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.000
Loki how about you what's your final

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:16.000
thought tonight as we head on out for the night

03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.000
at least it's a short week

03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:20.000
it is

03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:22.000
I was going to try to get my game

03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:24.000
done this year but I don't think it's going to happen

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:26.000
you only got a week and a half left

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:28.000
I've been trying to work on it but I've just

03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:30.000
been mentally exhausted so

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:32.000
I actually have been working out

03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:34.000
very slowly like maybe a

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:36.000
minute or two at a time

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.000
because like I literally come home brain

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:40.000
dead and between calls I don't have

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:42.000
enough time to like shift focus

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:44.000
like that so it's been a

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:46.000
rough year in some ways I mean I was going through

03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:48.000
a lot personally especially in the first half of

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:50.000
the year like you guys know how long

03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:52.000
some things were taken to get done and

03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:54.000
a lot of that I kind of blame on some of my personal

03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:56.000
life circumstance and that's getting better but

03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:58.000
you know I stay pretty

03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:00.000
busy with work and so forth so a lot of that

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000
like I wanted to do more streaming and more video

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:04.000
production but it's just kind of slack this year

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:06.000
I'm really hoping to kick that into gear next year

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:08.000
so we'll see what happens

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:10.000
so anyhow

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:12.000
my final thought tonight is

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:14.000
thank you for spending your

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:16.000
holidays here with us at Orange Laundry radio

03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:18.000
and I am so appreciative of the time

03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:20.000
that you spend to take to listen to our show

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:22.000
and it was great to meet some of you over

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:24.000
at GX and I hope to meet many more of you

03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:26.000
as 2016 moves on

03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:28.000
have a great holiday

03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:30.000

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:32.000

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.000
just try to work it out

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:38.000
if you can for the holidays

03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:40.000
that's what the holidays are really all about

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:42.000
that and so much candy

03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:44.000
that you go into a coma

03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:46.000
enjoy the steam sale and the Xbox

03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:48.000
sale and the Playstation sale they're coming

03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:50.000

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:52.000
week but enjoy it happy gaming

03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:54.000
