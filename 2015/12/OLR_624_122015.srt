Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, we interview Rick of Tippy Goat Games, makers of the Super Sports Smash Up title, Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're back to get caught up on the last two weeks of gaming news, GamerX, your comments, and more.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, tonight with episode number 624 of our show, December the 20th of 2015.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Our last show before the big, big holiday, right here in the midst of the holiday season.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So happy holidays to all of you guys out there, and to my co-hosts here in studio.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And joining me as always, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hi.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello, how are you Jamie Summers?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Alright.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Alright.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Just, things happen.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Did we have a fun adventure last week?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We did.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We did.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We had a great fun adventure, and my feet are still arguing at me for those boots, but otherwise it was a great adventure.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Your cosplay looked great at the show, and I know that there's pictures of you around on the interwebs.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm on Unicorn Booty, which I laugh without to no end.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's a pretty hilarious website name, isn't it?

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It is.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There is actually, they have like one of the, you know like those standees you see as you're walking into like big events?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You know, you always see like the big wall with all the company logos, right?

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So there was one outside of GamerX for that company, and it looked like a unicorn that was about to like kick your ass.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And I was like, I wanted to take a picture underneath it, like it was about to kick me in the face, but I didn't, I don't know.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I didn't want to hold up traffic so I could have my awkward photo, so it didn't end up happening.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sorry. Well, they were stopping people to take pictures in front of that.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's good.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Like I was going to look, and I feel bad because now I can't make my brain think of his name.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Uh-huh.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Josh? John? The Templar guy.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mmm.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Who was Kayden.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't recall his name, but he looked great if he's out there listening.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well, they got us together in front of the Unicorn Booty thing.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And now my, I'm so mad at myself because like, I can't think of like hardly anyone's name today.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's okay.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's okay, but I saw Star Wars and life is good.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Alright, fair enough.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Uh, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hi.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How are you doing, Loki?

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Um, I enjoyed half that burger and then I'm not enjoying the other half of that burger.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is your microphone on, Loki? Because I don't know if we're picking you up for some reason.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I am completely on.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, you're just quiet tonight for some reason.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I am not completely quiet.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Alright, there you go.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You have levels problems.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We're having audio problems left and right in the studio tonight and I'll get into that in a minute.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I guess I'll just have to talk louder.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No, you're good. You're perfectly fine now.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't know, I don't know what the hell's going on.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
For some reason, you're not looping back through the internal speakers like I'm used to, but you're picking up on the register so I know the audience can hear you.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh my god.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If it's not one thing breaking in studio, it's another. I'll get to that in a minute.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But anyway, Loki, how has your couple weeks been?

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You weren't able to go to the show, I know, but how was your week off?

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Um, I don't remember what I did.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think I played Fallout, maybe. Or maybe Ingress. Probably Ingress.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Probably a lot of Ingress.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think a little bit of Ingress and then I stayed home for some of that.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You know, I was reading an article which didn't make our show roll tonight, but it was about Pokémon GO.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And there's some more information because there was an interview out there with Pokémon GO.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And I guess part of why the Pokémon company wanted to team up with Niantic, who are the makers of Ingress, to make Pokémon GO is that

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
the head of the Pokémon company is actually a high level Ingress player.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And the president of Niantic was like, he's a higher level player than I am.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So that kind of made me chuckle.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But from what I understand, Ingress is really big in Japan.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't know if that's true or just kind of something through the grapevine, but it kind of tells you why Pokémon GO.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I do think that is going to be quite the mobile game next year because it's going to be a mobile game very unlike the typical, I'm going to use my quotey fingers, mobile game.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Like it's not going to be Candy Crush.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll try it, I guess. I don't like Pokémon, though, so we'll see.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Maybe this will be it.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Eh.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This will be the first hit. I don't know.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Anyhow, we also want to welcome the ever-present fourth guest on our show, the chat room.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hello to our chat room. We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Live.vognetwork.com is where you can find our chat room.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And of course we do tape live Sunday nights at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We have folks in chat there saying, like, Dungeon Buster says, punch those audio problems with the dark side.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I almost, I was like this close to going to see Star Wars before the show.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But I had to cook, like, three things for my wife, and by that time I was like, I'm not going to make it there on time.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm going to miss the new Deadpool preview, and that's going to make me sad, so I decided not to.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Plus, I would have gotten here late.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's all good. It's fine. I'm hoping to get out during the week at some point. We'll see.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
SS2 and Hunter Matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying nothing can silence Loki.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You know what? The systems in here have been trying tonight.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So real quick recap. First off, I want to say a big welcome to those of you.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We talked to a lot of people at GX3 or GamerX that stopped by the table.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So if there's any new listeners out there listening to OLR tonight who might have stopped by and said hi to us over at our table,

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
which could include, by the way, I had a conversation with podcasting with Trixie Mattel from RuPaul's Drag Race Season 7.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You missed that, Jamie, when Trixie came by the table.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But turns out Trixie listens to podcasts on her flights back and forth to different shows.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So shout out to Trixie if you're out there listening.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hashtag justice for Trixie or whatever it was.

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Anyway, so all that aside, we talked to a lot of people there at the expo, drag queens and non-drag queens.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Actually, a lot of non-drag queens.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And just talked about podcasting and everything that we have on the network with our variety of shows

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and how we have shows about like Star Trek and World of Warcraft and movies and TVs.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And so I hope we got a few listeners from that.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So if this is your first time listening to Orange Lawns Radio, welcome.

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We've been running, oh, golly, nonstop since 2002.

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We started as an Internet radio program dedicated to dance dance revolution and music based video games

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and kind of grew from that into all things video gaming because, of course, we were just fans of video games first.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It just so happens we were playing at the time a lot of Parappa the Rappa and bust a groove depending on what country you were in.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So we were talking about that for a while and then we did games.

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So we like to be very interactive. We call ourselves a show where every gamer has a voice.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And we invite you guys to pull up a chair with us at our dinner table.

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There's one thing we used to do when we played Dance Dance Revolution is after we played some DDR,

116
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
we would go to the cafe right across the street and sit down and talk some smack about video games.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So that's what we do here.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And order fried food because, you know, nothing better than after working out for a while to eat some fried fruits to offset it.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We just burned off all those calories playing DDR. Let's have some mozzarella sticks.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let's do it right now.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So, yeah, that's we've kind of kept that tradition going now for going into next year.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Our 14th year is next year.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Every time I say the number, I die a little inside.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
All right.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We're entering high school.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We love it. We love you guys. We love doing this.

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And we're going to do it for a long time.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Although the computer tonight really didn't want it to happen.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I come into the studio after a two week break.

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And again, we've been a little bit, admittedly, we've been spotty the past couple months.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't stand it because I got sick.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Then we had Thanksgiving, but I fell, had that fall and I would have been able to show anyway.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
And then we had GX, which admittedly was an awesome reason to miss the show.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't apologize for that.

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But I don't like that we miss so many shows back to back.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We like to be here every single week.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But tonight, I come in the studio, computer won't power on.

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm like, what the hell?

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So I figured it must have tripped the breaker at some point.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'd like hold in the power button for a second, finally figured it out, got it working.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm like, phew.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Then it looks like Alan unplugged the internet at some point, which is fine.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That happens.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Sometimes you got to clean the hall.

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So the cord's got to go or whatever.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And then so finally figured that out.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But the cord, it's like one of those things where the cord, we have this super long cord.

148
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's like a hundred foot cord that runs from the computer all the way to the router.

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Like one of those that I have it at home.

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's ethernet through power.

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You just plug it in.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, that would be cool.

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And you guys might be thinking, why don't you just use Wi-Fi?

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Because it's internet radio and we're streaming constantly.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We really have to have a wired connection for that.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Even if your Comcast is anything like my Comcast, it's fucking sucked.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Exactly.

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Like I'm just like, it's seriously getting worse every day.

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And I'm not sure how that's possible.

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So finally figured out the net thing.

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I just had to bend the cord just right at like the 30 degree angle that'll make it get the signal.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay, so then finally, you know, I had a moment of weakness and I clicked yes when Skype said,

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
do you want to upgrade Skype?

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And now it won't work.

165
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I try to bring it up and it says, sorry, we can't find the internet while I'm running IRC and Google and everything else in the background.

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's like, sorry, can't find the internet.

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So I'm like, all right, well, there's plenty of websites out there where I can download the old version.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So download old version Skype 5.0 and still won't work.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So trying to install Skype messed my settings.

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So I'm going to have to look into that this week.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So we have this whole rig set up in studio where I've got my iPhone plugged into our mixing board.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So we can hopefully take some calls later in the show.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But so we can definitely tonight bring you an interview.

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm very excited. We're going to have a guest on the show tonight.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
One of the cool things about going to an expo like GX got to talk to a lot of indie developers that were there showing their stuff.

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And one of the games that we saw actually made that transition from early access to a fully fledged release game on Steam this week.

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So we're excited. We're going to have Rick on the show tonight from Tipping Goat Games.

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Love that name.

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Going to talk to us tonight about Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And this is a game that kind of takes a lot of 8-bit retro sports games and it's like a giant Katamari ball that rolls them all up.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
And it's one game that incorporates all these elements.

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So we're going to have Rick on in about 15 minutes to tell us a little more about how that game works.

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And I think he's shown this game at some of the Penny Arcade Expos and some other places.

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So I know some of our listeners are actually well aware of this game that weren't even at GX.

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So you may not know though that it's actually out now on Steam.

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If you want to try it out for yourself, you can check that out.

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Just use that old search box in Steam and you will be happily on your way.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Rick will be joining us live and you can ask your questions about the game.

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
In fact, I see SSJ100matt in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm hyped about this game.

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And yeah, if you want to ask Rick some questions, we will be fielding questions from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But first, we need to recap what happened while we were gone.

193
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We missed a week of show.

194
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So I think we need to do last week's news set to Holik.

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So while we were gone last week for GX, Minecraft finally launched on the Wii U.

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But if you were looking forward to that Wii U gamepad support,

197
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
so you could do inventory management and stuff on Minecraft Wii U,

198
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm sorry, but you can do off-screen play like you can do in every Wii U game.

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So there you go.

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Also, Mercedes-Benz and Nintendo teamed up for a Super Mario Maker costume.

201
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And it's actually in the game now and you can actually play us a little race car in Super Mario Maker.

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And I know there was some more news on Mario Maker this week we'll get into a little bit later.

203
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
And also, a new patent supposedly serviced for the Nintendo NX last week.

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
A weird controller that actually had a video or an image screen built into the controller.

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't know, it looked a little weird to me, but I guess it's the way they could change the controller

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and how it looks on the fly.

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You mean like a touchpad where they can have signed buttons to random slots?

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That sounds fucking terrible.

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, I...

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's like, jeez, you know what I really wish I had in my console gaming experience

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
is that wonderful usability of not having buttons on a touchpad or mobile device.

212
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I have real problems with this if the buttons are fake.

213
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Because it doesn't work well for mobile gaming unless that is the way the game is meant to be controlled

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
is with swiping and dragging.

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Like for some games it works fine, but when you try to take, like if you were to take Super Mario Brothers

216
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and just put it on iPhone or Android, it would be horrible.

217
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Sonic is that way on the phone, right? And it stinks.

218
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry, I love Sonic, but it stinks on mobile devices.

219
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Because tangible controls are different than touch button controls.

220
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So now, if the whole thing with NX is that the controller is a TV, but it has tangible buttons kind of inside it,

221
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
like you know what I mean, like the TV is built around those controls,

222
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
then I think that's kind of weird as hell, but...

223
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I think it's stupid.

224
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We'll try it.

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And the reason why I think it's stupid is because my hand is on the controller,

226
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't see the image under my hand.

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So I don't...

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
See the point.

229
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Depending on the design of the controller, like okay, I think about a controller like the Nintendo 64 controller.

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That thing was a fat controller, or the original Xbox controller, Jesus.

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That thing was a fat controller.

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't want to hold a fucking LCD screen in my hand like that, you know.

233
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But see, maybe I'm weird, but I like the Wii U gamepad controller.

234
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It doesn't bother me the way it bothers everybody else.

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I like it until I play Minecraft with it, and I fucking hate it.

236
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I seriously, like, it made me realize how much I hate that controller.

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Well anyway, now keep in mind, it's a patent.

238
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.

239
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
People like to jump to conclusions with this stuff.

240
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
We won't really know anything until E3 next year, but it's very interesting nonetheless.

241
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
So those are some of the big stories from the week that we were gone.

242
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Anything else we want to talk about with GX?

243
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Dark Sakura, how was your GX experience?

244
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I mean, I know you did the costume and had your picture taken a lot.

245
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're a Grey Warden from Dragon Age, and very well received.

246
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I know they had a contest.

247
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Sadly, no trophies for Dark Sakura, but you had some stiff competition,

248
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
and I think you were just doing it for fun, right?

249
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Well, I wanted to win something.

250
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Winning's nice. Winning's nice.

251
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I had a really good time.

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I only bonked a few people with my staff.

253
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It broke a lot, and I did repairs three nights in a row, it seemed.

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's a miracle that we got this.

255
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
By the way, she had this full-length staff with this intricate skull thing on the top of it,

256
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and then a metal... well, it wasn't actually a metal blade, but an illusion of a metal blade at the end.

257
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Somehow fit that thing in my car with five people in my little Civic.

258
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I think the whole thing ended up being something like six and a half feet long.

259
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So definitely another foot and a half taller than me.

260
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But we got it to fit in the car, and I carried it around the whole convention

261
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and walked in boots that I really should have had better insults for.

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But it was a really good time.

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I didn't really want to get back into the costume after dinner to go back to the cosplay dance.

264
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I heard there was drama, so I'm kind of glad I didn't go.

265
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Drama in the form of...

266
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh, yeah. I don't want to linger on the negative, but somebody had way too much to drink,

267
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and I think it was more than just liquor, that's all I'm going to say,

268
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and basically the ambulance was called on him and had to get taken out of the place,

269
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and it kind of shut the thing down early.

270
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But you know what? For those not involved, it was handled well.

271
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The guy got the medical attention he needed.

272
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
He was fine because he was on the gurney making motions and things, so I know he's fine,

273
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
but it didn't really ruin the party, if that makes sense.

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
He added it early, but it didn't ruin the spirit or anything, so for what it's worth.

275
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Well, at any rate, I would say that I'm not the same type of congoer I used to be,

276
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
but I had a really good time cosplaying.

277
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I really miss it because it's been a while since I've done any kind of serious cosplay.

278
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Victoria did a great job with the costume itself, and all the props were mine, but...

279
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Did you get to participate or see any panels or get to play games?

280
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I didn't go to any panels but our own.

281
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yeah? How'd the Podcast Cross Zone panel go for you?

282
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It was really, really cool.

283
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It was good that we just kept moving around and got to make some good points

284
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
and talk with people in the crowd. It was great.

285
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I did play fake scrabble in costume against a templar to see who could spell better,

286
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
as in, haha spell, lol.

287
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We've actually got pictures up on Twitter, so I can find them and link them in the chat room.

288
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I was really tired, though, at the end of every day.

289
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I mean, that kind of goes without saying.

290
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, cons can be really draining.

291
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah, but I'm hoping to break the costume back out for a day of sac anime if all goes to plan.

292
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Excellent.

293
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And other than that, yeah.

294
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Great.

295
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
How's your turn?

296
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, I...

297
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, and I played the sports ball game, which is what I'm naming it in my head because the name's kind of long.

298
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I played that goggle game, not the Oculus-type game, with the Samsung headset.

299
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I was just about to ask this because they were demoing a game on Oculus,

300
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
and I apologize so much to these creators because I forget the names of the games in the moment.

301
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But there was one on the Oculus, and there was one using the Gear VR.

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
And you played the Gear VR one, right?

303
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I did because it can be adjusted to near-sighted.

304
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And you know what's funny is that I was actually speaking an email with the creators, and I think I CC'd you on my reply.

305
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't know if you got it.

306
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yeah, I probably did, but trying to organize stuff for a few weeks out.

307
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Well, yeah, but I'm trying...

308
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yeah, I've got the email right here so I can actually get the name.

309
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It was...

310
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, yeah, it was Bizarre VR.

311
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh, okay.

312
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That was it.

313
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I knew it had something to do with Bizarre, but I wanted to make sure.

314
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But yeah, it was pretty fun, and there were great people.

315
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Her name was Teresa working there, which I would love to have them on the show too.

316
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Have her on the show.

317
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We'll make it happen. We will.

318
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yeah.

319
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But at any rate, those were the big things that I played.

320
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I tried a few other things, but those were really my two.

321
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I gotta back up though for a minute when you talk about VR,

322
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
because you have openly talked on the show about that a lot of first-person games will make you very motion sick,

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
and you don't like to play things like Skyrim in first person,

324
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
because that can really kind of mess with you.

325
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And it happens.

326
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
After playing Fast Racing Neo this week, which I'll talk about later,

327
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I can totally see how that happens to people.

328
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
So I can imagine there might have been some hesitation to get into VR,

329
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
but how did that go for you, all things considered?

330
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I wonder if part of it was because I wasn't wearing my glasses.

331
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But I seem to do just fine.

332
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
After a little while, I got a headache, which is about normal.

333
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It got a little queasy, like with some of the turns,

334
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
but it was really smooth for the most part,

335
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and there is a big part of me that's wondering if it's because of my glasses.

336
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Interesting.

337
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The fact that I was pretty much using unfiltered glasses.

338
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm going to break down a little science here.

339
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Glasses will refract light so that your eyeballs will see it at the right magnificence.

340
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Instead of having the focal point be in a place other than where your eyes are set to look at.

341
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So in this case, it was actually being projected to me at what was fine for my eyes.

342
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And I think that something in that might have made it to where I didn't get as motion sick,

343
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
because I didn't get the same kind of weird eye strain that I get with monitors and things too.

344
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It just wasn't there.

345
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I suppose this is a question worth asking. What was the game? What was the experience in there?

346
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You basically float around on a flying carpet, and you look around for missing things in each level.

347
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And you can find coins.

348
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, so when you say Bazaar, it's like Aladdin's...

349
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
B-A-Z-A-A-R.

350
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Not like Bazaar, Love Triangle, which is what came to my mind.

351
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Bazaar, not Bizzar.

352
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Does it play New Order?

353
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
No, but the music's really good in it.

354
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I liked it. She was talking about the composer.

355
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Oh, cool.

356
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
But yeah, the music was really good.

357
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Basically, you go through these different floating levels.

358
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Well, you're on the carpet, but you're over a canal.

359
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And then you have to look for the different pieces.

360
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And it's funny, if you look up, you can see the sky.

361
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And you've got constellations that match the different things that you're looking for.

362
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
So you get all the pieces for that, and then you unlock the next level.

363
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And you've got a shop that you can pick up extra Turkish Delight and other things.

364
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm wondering if there's going to be more stuff added, like enemies and things, as you go.

365
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Well, I'm sure a lot of these games were in early development.

366
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But it was very pink.

367
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But it was a pretty good game.

368
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It was a pretty good game. I was very pleased with it.

369
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I had a lot of fun playing it.

370
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I probably could have kept going, if not for a little bit of a headache.

371
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Just the one thing that actually really helped me stay centered is keeping my hand on the table.

372
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Because my feet were rooted, right?

373
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But keeping my hand on the table kind of connected me back.

374
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah, it kind of didn't let you go all in.

375
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It kept you grounded, literally, like a lightning rod or something.

376
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I would say more that it kept me oriented.

377
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Okay.

378
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So that I knew which way I was facing.

379
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And if I couldn't find the table with my hand, I knew that I was facing away from the table.

380
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Because it would have been behind me.

381
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Okay.

382
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So it really was like my anchor, in this case, kept me focused on where my directions were and where I was facing.

383
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So that I knew at any given point that if I had to take that thing off and run, for example, I know I'd be going in the right direction.

384
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'd know which way to turn.

385
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Which is, it's actually always been a thing for me, is always knowing where my exit routes are.

386
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So Jamie survived her first Gear VR experience and didn't get sick or anything.

387
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Didn't have a panic attack.

388
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Had some ideas on how to make that experience work for you.

389
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That's great.

390
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It was a cute game and I really had a good time.

391
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'd like to see, actually, Dan and I were talking about this today, where we were talking about how they have those VR sets and would love to see something like that for iOS.

392
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Having something like that would definitely open doors for more gamers.

393
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:04,000
And honestly enough, I could see things like that really working well with Google Maps, for example, how you have that walk view.

394
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Imagine having virtual tours and whatnot.

395
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Or say people, here's a business idea.

396
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Virtual house tours if you're buying a model home.

397
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah.

398
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And if you say, oh, well, I like this, but I want a counter here.

399
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Or you look at the thing and navigate the menu.

400
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You know how people will move to a city they haven't even been to yet because of a job or something?

401
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And they have to like get an apartment kind of like unseen?

402
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Like a VR experience could really bring that to you.

403
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I mean, it's interesting that we're having this conversation because, you know, you go back a few months ago to one of the big stories with VR that Facebook bought Oculus, right?

404
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And people are like, why does Facebook want to get into gaming?

405
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And it's like, yo, there's way more to Oculus than just gaming.

406
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
And there's a great example, although I feel like I should patent pending.

407
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That's my business because I could make some money on that.

408
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
There's also people who, well, like for me being nearsighted, that's one thing.

409
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I could take off my glasses and see just fine in the game.

410
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And if you have people with, say, who have to have like things magnified for them, you have that adjustable thing on the goggle.

411
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And, you know, it can help people who may have difficulty seeing in general or, you know, something that can change brightness and everything for people with dim vision, stuff like that, improve contrast.

412
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You know, it could be possible that you even have like another camera on the other side.

413
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I mean, there's all kinds of ideas for application of things like that.

414
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:43,000
But for the most part, you know, despite, you know, we could speculate all night about, you know, what type of things we could see come out of that type of technology.

415
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But in the end, I mean, I have no problem with games.

416
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
We can do some games too over there.

417
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,000
S21 Hunter Matt noting in the chat over at live.vognetwork.com, all three OLR hosts have dove into the Rift now.

418
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes, that is, well, technically you didn't do the Rift.

419
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I didn't do the Rift because I couldn't wear my glasses with the Oculus Rift.

420
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
But, you know, we've all had the VR headset experience, modern.

421
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Is there something else that occurred to me? Do you remember E3 a while back where they had the sphere that you touch it and it gives you like almost topographical feedback where it would develop texture?

422
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Yes.

423
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Could you imagine something like that with the Oculus?

424
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You know, that was a rumor for, believe it or not, that's been a rumor for Nintendo's DS at one point that it would have something like that.

425
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And it was a rumor for iPhones at one point.

426
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,000
And I think iPhones did the reverse of that with the force push that they have in the, I'm talking like it's Star Wars, but you know what I mean?

427
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Like the force feedback thing they have in the new iPhones.

428
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
3D touch.

429
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Yeah, that's it. 3D touch.

430
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
However, it has done kind of the reverse in the form of the haptic feedback on the Apple Watch.

431
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Ah, gotcha.

432
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Basically it's, for me, my haptic feedback is, you got a text message and turn bitch for my directions. Or get off your ass and stand up.

433
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Loki, were you trying to add something here a minute ago to the VR discussion? I'm sorry.

434
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
No.

435
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I thought I saw you pick up your mic. All right.

436
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Well, he could have picked up his mic because he wanted to.

437
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Ah, maybe. Who knows? Quickly, quickly before we get to our guests tonight, I know there was some other stuff in the exhibit hall too, a lot of crafters that kind of make their own things.

438
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, I was hanging out with the artists like the entire time. It was great.

439
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah, some really talented people in there.

440
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Made some good friends there. Um, actually did like a little fake, uh, menorah lighting with one of them. It was great.

441
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And you know, and basically I watched her booth so she could get a beer.

442
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:47,000
They were giving the beers out. Because yeah, they gave us beer and it was great. Um, thank you Intel for beer. Um, I actually hung out with a few people from Intel just talking chop for a while.

443
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:56,000
They had a really interesting booth where they had walls where you could basically write down and it was these questions like, what do you want to see in gaming in a few years?

444
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:10,000
And what do you, you know, these very, especially considering the audience that GX targets, which is this very diverse audience that sometimes feels like in that Xbox Live culture where a lot of nasty things are flinged around that maybe they don't fit in.

445
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It was very interesting to see kind of a lot of what was written on the wall. I thought that was a very neat idea.

446
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But I will say this, I don't know how you feel about this dark soccer, but I would say, and I just want to say footnote, I don't want this to read as like a huge negative or anything because I love gamer X. I love GX.

447
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I financially supported this expo in a big way this year. But I found that in the expo hall, I was a little taken aback by how you had some big exhibitors there that didn't really bring games.

448
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Like you have Blizzard, you have Blizzard that was there with Jobs or whatever. Intel had their walls, but that was cool. And they gave away cookies. So I'm not going to, but the rock band area was fun.

449
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:59,000
The rock band did it right. But I thought it was so weird that Blizzard had this big presence and it was like, they were, they had a job seeker there and it was like, no, no Overwatch, no World of Warcraft.

450
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I actually did talk with the ladies there for a while. And they were both, yeah, like, yeah, the whole company's buckling down for stuff right now.

451
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah. And Overwatch has been down for maintenance too. So maybe that, that came into play too. But I just, I was kind of surprised, especially coming off of last year where you had Gearbox was there showing Borderlands, the pre-sequel or whatever it was.

452
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:36,000
That was the first time that was playable was at the last GX. Not that I'm saying I expect cutting edge stuff out of the expo. I was just surprised that the expo hall itself only had the indie games, which is great because I found a lot of good stuff there.

453
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But it didn't have any corporate games considering all that corporate support that went into it. I'm just, I was a little surprised by that compared to last year.

454
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:55,000
But again, I don't want that to read like a negative because I do think the con is doing some good things. And I kind of think everybody involved realizes that. I don't think I'm the first person to say that.

455
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And so I kind of think that's already on their radar for what can we do next year to put, put the bigger game in GamerX.

456
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:11,000
The only reason I wish we'd been able to stay for the closing ceremonies and feedback was to please beg for the cosplay contest to go back to the Saturday night instead of Sunday.

457
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I have a feeling the only reason it was on Sunday was because the talent that hosted it. That was the day they were in town. I have a weird feeling. But then again, they were there Saturday night because they came by the table Saturday night. So I don't know.

458
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And that's just a lot of, especially since like us, we checked out of our hotel.

459
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And when you are dealing with that much crap, you know, props and your costume and needing help because Alan had to help me change into parts of my costume.

461
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,000
You need to have access to your hotel room for that kind of stuff. So.

462
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
But other than that, I mean, everything was really smooth. The cosplay contest in general was run a lot more smoothly than it was last year.

463
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Yeah. And I thought, I did, I did want to say the space, you know, it was a big transition for them to go from San Francisco to San Jose. I love the new space.

464
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
It worked so much.

465
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It worked so much better. So much more room to move around. The convention center was great.

466
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It felt more con like.

467
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Yes.

468
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Than.

469
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Although I kind of felt like they probably could have sold more tickets. I mean, from what I heard, it was close to a sellout, but it didn't look like, I kind of feel like they could have packed more people in there if they wanted to.

470
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I think it'll get bigger. I don't know if it's going to be Fauna Mae big for a while, but.

471
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
No, no, I know.

472
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
It's going to get bigger.

473
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Yeah. And again, there were so many great things come out of it. So much networking that I did. Like, I'm not, I had a great time and just the festivities.

474
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I just made a lot of friends.

475
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah.

476
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Yeah.

477
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
It was just hanging with cool people.

478
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Yeah.

479
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:46,000
One of the cool people we met at the convention, uh, down had the booth, like right near us. And we were looking at that game going, what is that? That looks kind of like, is that dodge ball?

480
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What is that? That guy's playing over there. And, uh, turns out, uh, it's a game called super slam dunk touchdown.

481
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And it's like a bunch of eight bit sports games all rolled into one. And, uh, we played roller derby character is the best. We played it.

482
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
We had a lot of fun with it. And I was like, Oh, we got to get you on the show. When, when does it come out?

483
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:15,000
And he said this week I was like, Oh, well shoot. So we're going to get them on the line right now. We're going to, uh, give Rick a call and Rick is with tipping goat games.

484
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And he's going to talk to us tonight about this game, super slam dunk touchdown. And I think we have them on the line. Rick, are you there?

485
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Yes. Hello. Thanks for having me.

486
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Hey, no problem, Rick. Thanks so much for being here.

487
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
My pleasure.

488
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
How was, uh, how was GX for you? Did you have a good time at the show?

489
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I had a great time. It was, uh, I've done a lot of expos and so they've ranged from nightmarish to, uh, just a pleasant time.

490
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And that was on the positive end of the spectrum. So I'm positive, uh, about that show. It was a good show.

491
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Now. I didn't realize this about you when we were playing the game and, and there at the expo, but that GX was kind of in your backyard.

492
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It was local to you, right? So that, that must've made it very convenient.

493
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh yeah. It was super easy. Just parked, carried my stuff in. I was done.

494
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I know that was, that was the great thing about us having a table that didn't involve computers or any of that stuff, because it's like we could just kind of carry it all in one setting. It was great.

495
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Um, so tell us a little bit about a super slam dunk touchdown for those of our listeners out there who weren't at GX, which is unfortunately most people.

496
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Uh, tell us a little bit about the game and what it looks like and what it's like.

497
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Uh, sure. It's a local multiplayer irreverent all sports mashup. Uh, so as you mentioned 8-bit, uh, games, it's sort of inspired by 8 and 16-bit era games that didn't take themselves terribly seriously, the sports games of that era.

498
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Uh, so you mentioned Super Dodge Ball, which is a, a lot of people make that comparison as well. Um, so it looks, it looks retro. It's, it's got 8, 16-bit sort of graphics, but it's actually driven by 3D physics. So there's kind of nuance to how the balls move and everything.

499
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Hmm. How did you, uh, how did you get inspired to do a game like this? Where did it, where did it come from when you, when you put pen to paper and said, this is the game I want to make?

500
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:05,000
This game has been burning a hole in my brain for about, about six years now. I finally have been able to release it, but, uh, yeah, about six years ago, I was like, I really want to make an all sports crazy mashup game.

501
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And it probably comes from just growing up in an era of local multiplayer. That was the only kind of multiplayer back then. And, uh, I, I feel like social gaming to me is people hanging out together playing a game. And, uh, so I wanted to make something like that.

502
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Uh, and, uh, again, if you want to ask Rick a question about Super Slam Dunk Touchdown, you can over at live.vognetwork.com in our chat room over there. Um, so I noticed, uh, you talking a lot about local multiplayer and, uh, I noticed when you came to the show, you brought like four separate controllers. You had everything. You were really stressing that this is, this is a party game, right?

503
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:49,000
So if I were to ask about, well, what about online? What, what, what's your thoughts on that? I mean, online, just not in the cards free? That's not what you want this to be?

504
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Well, first off, there was six controllers. We do up to six players locally on Windows.

505
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh, my bad. My bad. I forgot how to count.

506
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Well, if I wanted to take maybe, I don't know, three to six months and really try to make it online, I probably could do that. But that's not really the heart and soul of what this game is about.

507
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And, uh, it's really about yelling at your teammates and, uh, you know, having a good time together. So I think having people in front of the TV is a better experience for this title.

508
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Um, that said, if I had, you know, unlimited funding, I'd love to pay somebody to add an online component, but we're a very, very small studio, uh, with a total employee count of one.

509
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I was about to say, is it just you that's doing all this?

510
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Uh, well, I contract out the art, uh, as money comes in, but yeah, it's just me.

511
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Got it. Wow. That's still very impressive for such a small studio of one basically to have created something like this. So props to you.

512
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,000
This must be, how are you feeling this week with the big release and the whole kind of making that transition from early access to a full release? How are you feeling?

513
00:35:49,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I have to, I'll be honest. I kind of feel like a college senior, just sort of sliding the paper under the door at 11 59. You know, I just, just get it out there. I'm going to go lay down.

514
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's been, it's been a long, long year and a half since I've been working on this and I'm looking forward to the break.

515
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:18,000
What are some of the reactions you see when you see people playing your game at expos? Because again, you are bringing this full, you, you, you bring this game to cons the way it's meant to be played.

516
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And so you're able to get, you know, sometimes, sometimes I can't get five people over to my house to play a video game. I mean, if I have, you know, liquor maybe, but at a con, it's very easy to get that together.

517
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,000
So you must see all sorts of, of great reactions. What do you, what do you, what do you kind of see from the people to play your game at cons?

518
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Well, there's several stages. First, it's like confusion because they're not sure what it is they're looking at. And then their brain tries to tell them what they're looking at, but they still don't really believe it.

519
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So they have to come over and then they see what it is and that it's real and then they want to play. And then they find out it's six players and you know, there's a critical mass problem at these conventions.

520
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
If I get one or two people playing, it's pretty easy to get six, but if it's empty, it's a little harder.

521
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:14,000
What, now for those that don't know, what is the object of the game? Because they, you might look at it and you see, okay, I've got this soccer goal and it's got a basketball hoop on it. And then there's like that, that touchdown tee. What, what, what is the object? Yeah, goal pose.

522
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Just in plain, simple terms, you're taking your sports players, a whole team of sports players, and you're trying to maneuver the ball or puck or whatever it is through one of the goal areas, which could be a lower net, it could be a basketball style hoop, or it could be the uprights, the football, American football style field goal pose.

523
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So there's different ways to score and then all the different players are kind of playing their own way. So baseball players hitting pop flies, the hockey players hitting slap shots, the soccer players kicking, the American football players tossing spirals. And so you mix all that together and it becomes a crazy 3D physics team based sports game.

524
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Now, I noticed that it wasn't really just the sports players and the sports balls themselves that were all coming together. But as I was playing, I was playing the game earlier today to, you know, prepare for this. And I noticed that there was a lot of just other, for lack of a better term, crazy shit that would happen while you're playing the game. Like the marching band would just start running right through the middle of the game doing their thing.

525
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And then I think my derby girl got three shots in a row. So of course, as what happens in hockey when you get three shots in a row, hats start flying all over the arena. And just all this crazy stuff starts happening. Where did you come up with all these ideas and what made you think like, oh, I just want to get it crazier with all this stuff?

526
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Well, it's just things that pop up in your brain when you think sports. And, you know, these are things. Hat trick, that's a thing. You know, if you ask somebody who doesn't know anything about sports, they'll just name some terms. And so it's sort of just, you know, the marching band shows up. Doesn't show up in the middle of the match, but it's more fun that way. So it's kind of just putting as much sports in as small a tight a space as we can and just seeing what happens.

527
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Now, am I crazy? Or did I see a streaker? Because I swear to God, the other team all of a sudden had a player running around the back of the goalpost who was just naked. Like, is that thing?

528
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:23,000
That's a thing. We just released an update. He used to kind of just drop from the ceiling, but now he's hiding in the crowd. So if you look in the crowd as you're playing and you see a shady guy with the trench coat on, watch out because he might jump into the arena and try to steal the ball.

529
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That cracked me up because, I mean, the art is done so tastefully that you're not going to see anything that's going to make this game get an AO rating, right?

530
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Fortunately, we're dealing with subpixels there.

531
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah, exactly, right. So you can't really see anything, but it's just kind of like, because I kind of did a double take. I'm like, first off, who is that guy? And second off, does he have no clothes on? What is he doing?

532
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
But I didn't even realize that he had jumped in from the crowd just because there's so much other stuff going on.

533
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh, that's new. That's new. So I'm posting updates. We've done our first post-release update. There's going to be a season mode expansion next year, so I'm continuously trying to improve the game and making it better for a hopeful, eventual console release.

534
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh, nice. What consoles are you looking at?

535
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm under tight lips right now. I can't say much.

536
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:22,000
All right, fair enough. You come back when you can tell us. So what else was I going to say? There are some modes in the game. There's what? There's two modes in the game now? There's the challenge mode and kind of the quick play mode, right?

537
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Yep, you can also battle the ending credits if you want to do that.

538
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I somehow missed that. You can battle the credits?

539
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Yes, and there's a shot practice mode too, which I encourage everybody to try that just to get the feel for the game before the AI starts beating you up.

540
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:45,000
But yeah, you battle the credits. Do you remember Altered Beast on the Sega Genesis did that? You beat the game and then the credits would come down and they'd start knocking you out. So that sort of stuck with me and I was like, let's get our revenge. Let's beat up the credits.

541
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
So the credits is made of balls and you can throw them at each other.

542
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That kind of happens in Super Smash Brothers as well with the credit roll, but it's a little different, but I love that.

543
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And yeah, DarkTetsuya making that same comparison in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com.

544
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Going to some other questions from our chat room over at live.vognetware.com, SSJ100Matt says,

545
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:18,000
So I see a lot of sources of inspiration in the game like Blades of Steel, Double Dribble, Tecmo Super Bowl, Super Dodge Ball, Nintendo World Cup, Hit the Ice, NHL 94, NBA Jam. Am I missing anything?

546
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Oh sure, yeah. You've got Speedball was one. Is NES Ice Hockey in that list?

547
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Nope, NES Ice Hockey was not in the list.

548
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:37,000
There was one, Pigskin, I forget the year, it was like 320 AD or something like that, but it was like a medieval Pigskin game where you have pits that you can fall in and a bunch of guys beating each other up.

549
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So that whole era, I guess they couldn't do a realistic sports game very well, so they said, oh well, let's just make it fun. And that's kind of what this game's about.

550
00:41:45,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I probably told you this when I was playing the game for the first time, I'm not really a sports ball kind of guy. I enjoy going to a hockey game and occasionally a basketball game, but I'm horrible at playing the real thing and I don't get as into it as a lot of other people my age do.

551
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So when games were NBA Jam or Tecmo Bowl, when it was very arcade-y in the element of it, that's when I loved sports games the most. And I'm assuming you must find the same thing to be similar or true as well to have been inspired to make a game like this, right?

552
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Absolutely. Yeah, those games were fun. Anyone can pick them up, so this game has three buttons and an analog stick, so anybody can pick this up. There's a lot to learn, there's a lot you can learn about the different players and everything, but at its heart it's a very accessible experience, which I think it should be.

553
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And you and I were having a conversation about how newer sports games like the Madden's of the world and so forth are oftentimes, I think you called them simulations, and I thought that was a really good kind of comparison. Does this game get anything from newer sports titles?

554
00:42:47,000 --> 00:43:10,000
I'll be honest, the newest sports title that I'm able to play would be some iteration of Virtuit Tennis, which is kind of similar. You had analog stick and a few buttons. I tried to play a modern soccer game that there was a demo for on PlayStation, and you literally had to juggle the ball with the stick. You couldn't just move the guy, you had to actually try to keep the ball from getting away from you, and I'm like, this is way too much.

555
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:19,000
You know what I'll tell you is one of the best sports games to come out in years and years besides, of course, Super Slam Dunk Touchdown. I'll tell you, it's Rocket League.

556
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Oh yes, yes. I have not had a chance to play that, I'm afraid it's going to suck me in.

557
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah, I wouldn't doubt you're going to play it and then all of a sudden a car is going to show up in Super Slam Dunk Touchdown somewhere, I'll tell you.

558
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:45,000
But that's kind of the same thing where it's like a sports game. Well, it's not really a sport, but it kind of is. It's just fun and silly and easily accessible. Because everybody knows how to drive a video game car. It's accelerate and brake. Very, very easy.

559
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Brake?

560
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Yeah, who uses the brake? Who uses that?

561
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
That's what the walls are for.

562
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw says, a sports game with very simple controls that doesn't require you to do complicated button combinations would be more fun to play. And I noticed that is kind of part of your game, right? It's like two or three buttons tops, right?

563
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah, one of them's passed, so you're hardly using that unless your teammate has the ball or you want to send it over there. There's a shoot button, that's the main button. And then there's a turbo boost, so that's pretty much like NBA Jam in terms of number of buttons.

564
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:30,000
And then I noticed that, I guess the shoot button would also double as the fight button. And if you can get enough people in the fight, it'll turn into this cartoon cloud that starts flying all over the arena, right?

565
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah, and that was actually a product of user feedback. So I used to do playtest parties early on to get local multiplayer feedback, and the chaos of the game was a little too much for people. So that rowdy cloud, as I call it, sucks people in. If they're getting too violent, let's put them in one place and they can mash their buttons and let the guy who's not in that fight try to shoot and win the game.

566
00:44:50,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I've noticed that your game has gone through some changes with graphics, too, because I saw some screenshots and I think some material you've done for PAX, and the slam dunk sequence looked very different than it does now. Before it was kind of, I don't want to say it was plain, but it was a little plainer. But now it looks like you got the full audience. It looks like that double dribble thing we all remember from when we were kids, which had to be an influence, I'm sure, right?

567
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah, I definitely wanted to do that, but I wanted to make it interactive. And the old art, which has been kind of the bane of my existence this year, has been slowly getting replaced. And the art that you might be referring to, the early art, I actually drew that over Christmas right after my artist decided to pursue other projects.

568
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So that has been programmer art that has been in the game for a long time, and I'm so happy to have replaced that with the really nice looking, as you said, inspired by double dribble dunk sequences.

569
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
How many changes did your game go through in development?

570
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:20,000
It went through a lot of evolutions. If you go back and look at the very early videos, you can tell it's just a super primitive version of what it is now. The main things were with player feedback and just letting people know what was going on. So there's an aiming cursor, you can tell which direction you're pointing while you're aiming, which is helpful. There's a pass cursor that shows up when you're being passed to, so little things like that that just kind of clue people in. The player selection screen went through about three or four different durations to get where it is now.

571
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Now, this game was on early access for a little while. How long were you on early access until the release this week?

572
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
It was about three months, I think.

573
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And did you get feedback through that process as well? How did that work?

574
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,000
That was great, because it was pulling teeth sometimes after my same friends had played the game, and they were like, okay, let's play a different game. We've been playing this all summer.

575
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,000
But when it goes into early access, suddenly all these people are playing and they're on the Steam forums, and it's like, okay, cool.

576
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Now I've got feedback from fresh players, they're seeing it with fresh eyes, I'm getting good reactions, honest reactions.

577
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
And you kind of have to, as a developer, take everything everybody says very seriously.

578
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Because if there's a problem, if they're not playing the game what you think is correctly, then you're not communicating it correctly to them.

579
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
So it's been very useful. So thanks to everybody on the Steam forums, and please do jump on there if you've got any feedback.

580
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I bet a lot of us sometimes take that for granted, especially if we're developing.

581
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:29,000
And not that everybody listening to this show necessarily develops full-on games, but something like Super Mario Maker I think has really opened it up so that some people can kind of experience what that process is like a little bit.

582
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And I know I'm fascinated when I watch people play a level that I made in Mario Maker on YouTube or Twitch or something.

583
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:42,000
And it's like, that is not how I intended people to get past that part of the game.

584
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Or that is not how you're supposed to do that part, but they did it.

585
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:54,000
And that's got to be even exponentially the case when you're making a full-fledged game as opposed to a level in Mario.

586
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Well that's the joy of it, because you see things for the first time because somebody will be playing it in a way that you've never played it before.

587
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
And sometimes that leads to bugs, but other times it leads to just really hilarious stuff.

588
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:13,000
One of the things that happened during a convention, there was a fight and the ball got knocked just because of the 3D physics so high that it went off the screen for like a good 3 or 4 seconds.

589
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And I thought, okay, that's interesting, that's new.

590
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,000
So I actually put a ceiling on the game now, and if it goes up that high you can actually knock a light loose, it'll fall down and land on the field.

591
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So it's just by observing how people play the game we can add to it and make it more fun.

592
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Awesome. Let me get to one more question here from our chat room.

593
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,000
S2100Matt asking, you were able to get this done in a year and a half, which is an impressive feat considering how polished the game looks.

594
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,000
How much of your time was taken up with development versus work versus real life stuff? Did you even sleep?

595
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I did sleep, but that's about all I did. I actually quit my job in May of 2014 to work on this game and have been working non-stop ever since then.

596
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And I mentioned the crisis over Christmas last year, that basically, that crisis didn't stop until launch.

597
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,000
So it's been a lot of work, it's been a lot of fun, it's been up and down in all directions.

598
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Well congratulations on the launch of the game. And again, radio can only go so far as to what this game really looks like.

599
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
I do encourage you guys to go check it out. On the Steam store, super slam dunk touchdown.

600
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Rick, any other websites or social media for our listeners to see more about this game?

601
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Sure, you can check out our Facebook page, you can follow me on Twitter, Tipping Goat.

602
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And we also have a webpage at tippinggoat.com. I'm also very active on the Steam forums and there is a subreddit at SSDTouchdown.

603
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
So whatever your network of choice.

604
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Very cool. And I'm hoping to get a YouTube done of some play this week.

605
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I wanted to do that today and then all the computer stuff started happening here in studio.

606
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
So I'm going to try to get that on my YouTube channel a little later this week, so that'll be something as well.

607
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,000
And yeah, I do definitely encourage people to at least give the game a look and I think it's going to kind of get you right in that feel.

608
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Where Blades of Steel and Double Dribble and NBA Jam and those games back when sports games were arcadey and fun.

609
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I think it's going to get you in that same spot. So congrats to you, Rick.

610
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Thank you.

611
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Alright, best of luck with the game and thanks for being on OLR tonight.

612
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Thanks for having me.

613
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Alright, take care. Bye bye.

614
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You too.

615
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Alright, that was Rick with Tipping Goat Games and the game there Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.

616
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Dark Soccer, I know you got to play that as well at the Con and I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

617
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I had a good time.

618
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah.

619
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I had a really good time.

620
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Although, I don't know why I just kept blanking on the name over and over, but it's still funny.

621
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Well, it is kind of all these different sports terms all together.

622
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
The goal is to sport harder than the other people.

623
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
I think it seems like it can be set up kind of very similar to iDarb where they have...

624
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Maybe even if he doesn't do internet play over the internet, like multiplayer, he can do maybe some sort of Twitch support or something like that.

625
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:01,000
With all the iDarb crap where he can put keywords in and silly shit happens.

626
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Oh yeah, maybe some of that audience stuff, like the streakers and all that stuff. That might be kind of fun.

627
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Like maybe some of that stuff.

628
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Throw some power ups, like t-shirt cannons or something like that. That would be pretty awesome.

629
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Or maybe, and I don't know how difficult this is, I mean we spout them off like they're no problem at all, but we have to remember he's only a team of one.

630
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And I forgot to ask him about this, but there's some really silly advertisements that you see in the background.

631
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Try Food.

632
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Yeah, Try Food was one of them.

633
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And I was like, I think I will try eating at some point. There's just some silly stuff there.

634
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I should do that.

635
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Yeah, I should try food someday. I might be good.

636
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Alright, well again, best of luck to him.

637
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It was a lot of fun to play and I hope he's able to get the money back for the time invested and he can look at making whatever game he wants to do next.

638
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Maybe some more retro inspired stuff there.

639
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So again, that's super slam dunk touchdown.

640
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Look at that, Dungeon Buster in chat giving a link there to our listeners if they want to check that out on the Steam store.

641
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
I believe it's $14.99. That's how much that is.

642
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Alright, we're going to get into news and talk about what else has been going on in the video game world this week.

643
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,000
But I do want to take a chance to go around and ask what types of video games have you been playing this week?

644
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
We always like to talk about how was your gaming week.

645
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So outside of the con, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

646
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:35,000
It was very TurboGrafx oriented with some Adventure Island, Monster Boy, Bonk.

647
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
We had Bonk. We had Magical Chase. A lot of Magical Chase.

648
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Some Proteus Da. Twinbee.

649
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I didn't play any Dragon Age. And I played some Animal Crossing, the Happy Cam Designer.

650
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
That was for the most part quite the retro-tastic week. What brought that on?

651
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Getting our Turbo EverDrive.

652
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:09,000
That works. Alright. I have a feeling that will come back to us a little later when we get into the classic game of the week. We'll see.

653
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Meanwhile, let's go over to Loki. How was your gaming week?

654
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Well, I played quite a bit actually. I played lots of Fallout 4. So I'm like, gosh. I don't even know how many hours into the game.

655
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I think it's counting in days now. So I'm at least two days in. I'd say maybe 60 hours or so. I don't remember yet.

656
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,000
So I'm pretty far. Still really enjoying that. It's kind of fun just to wander around. I'm enjoying it like Skyrim.

657
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And cheating in it like Skyrim. Exploiting every possible console glitch hack I could possibly do and I'm enjoying that while I can.

658
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I do want to play through it again. Actually, once I'm done with this one. Someone came up with the idea of doing a faction-less one.

659
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,000
So instead of joining one of the factions you just fucking kill everybody and be an asshole to everybody. I'm like, yes! I will do that.

660
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
That is what I want to do next time. So that's what I'm going to do.

661
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Just Cause 3. Tried playing that a little bit. But it's a fucking mess. And it's really disappointing because I really want to play that game.

662
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:21,000
But I cannot handle trying to play one of the challenges to unlock stuff in the game and having a three minute load time in between every time I retry that.

663
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Fuck that. I am not playing that game until that's fixed.

664
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:36,000
I also played Minecraft on the Wii U. Cause my son wanted Minecraft on the Wii U cause he wanted to play on the screen.

665
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And so I did that and I downloaded it and played with the controller. I fucking hate the Wii U controller with that game.

666
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,000
The button placement stuff is very awkward. I don't like how the buttons are below the analog stick.

667
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:59,000
PlayStation and Xbox controls work a lot better for me. But that is just frustrating. I don't even want to play it.

668
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:10,000
And the text is so small on that screen. You would think like, hmm, we have this on the second screen. Maybe we should make the menus and UI fucking readable.

669
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Nope. Let's make it fucking, just shrink it down. Make it super microscopic so you can't fucking read anything.

670
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm really disappointed at what a lazy port cash in Minecraft Wii U is. I mean, for all the potential that's there with the touch screen.

671
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I just, I really feel like this is a whole, well, it's either A, well, we gotta shut the Nintendo fans up.

672
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Or B, well, we gotta make money from the Nintendo fans by just, you know, copy pasting.

673
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
You know, I really wish they had done more with what the Wii U was intended for.

674
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I mean, shit, they're making tons of money from me. I bought it on pretty much every console, so I don't know why.

675
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
But, yeah, my son wants to play it. He enjoys it. That's fine. But I find the controls frustrating and I'll play it on any other system.

676
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
I just don't want to play it on that one. Especially since it's missing features that are on the other systems. No, no thanks.

677
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:13,000
But I bought it, so I guess you win. And then I bought Earth Defense Force 4.1. I wasn't gonna technically buy that, but Eric wanted to play and then he bailed out.

678
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:21,000
So I spent the money on it for no reason, but I did. But it's fine. I'm sure we'll hook up another day.

679
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,000
But I played through it a little bit and it's really hard. I tried like, well, I'm gonna bump it up with a hard one.

680
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And it's like, this is really frustrating. And it's frustrating in the fact that they've changed how some of the ants and stuff attack you, so now they can shake you around and you're supposed to be able to shoot them while they're doing that.

681
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:46,000
And it's fucking annoying. It's just like, I don't know. It's kind of cheap, I guess, in that sense. But, whatever. That's the type of game it is. It's supposed to be frustratingly hard.

682
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And, yeah. So, I'll probably play more of that after I get done with Fallout. Because I was like, I can play more of the Earth Defense Force, or I can play more Fallout. Someone play more Fallout.

683
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:06,000
And then, of course, I played tons of Ingress. I drove up the fucking Placerville and, like, rescue today to make a field from there to Auburn for no fucking reason.

684
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Other than, I was like, oh, maybe I'll get some more points.

685
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Uniques. You got uniques.

686
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I had, like, two. Because I didn't really actually, you know, hack anything because I was under, like, a time constraint.

687
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I need to get your schedule so we can go out some time together. Because you can do so much more in that game when you even have just one other person. You can do better stuff.

688
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But, like, my schedule's gonna change after the first of the year, so then I'm not gonna have the weekdays anymore. Because they used to have Thursdays to play.

689
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And now, nope. That's not gonna happen. So, I may have, no, I'm not gonna, depends on what my schedule is, you know, where I'm trying to shift, trade shifts, and I may not have any time in the morning anymore.

690
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Oh, boy. Alright.

691
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
It'll be, like, weekends, maybe. Or if I take a day off. I don't know.

692
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Well, real life is more important than silly portal bandits, so it's fine.

693
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Yeah, I'm probably not gonna do any more of the fielding stuff. I just, like, a few weeks ago I went to Auburn, because I was meant to, like, field that day.

694
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And then, like, I drove, like, two hours round trip to do that. And by the time I got back here to actually link it up, someone had fucking, on our own side, had fucking thrown some blocking links. I'm like, are you fucking serious?

695
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
But they didn't know. They didn't know.

696
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Well, no, they, it's because I couldn't text them, because I'm driving on a fucking road that's twisty as fuck, and, like, in the rain, with no cell coverage. Like, well, he didn't say anything. I'm like, yeah, because I'm fucking driving. I can't text on the phone while I'm driving to tell you, with no cell signal. So, whatever, it's fine. I wasn't mad, and it was just, like, it's just something that happens.

697
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
More like your luck.

698
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It's like, yeah, my luck. I wasted all this time. You know, drove all the way back here. It's like, oh, fuck, I can't do anything. Well, that was that, so.

699
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Alright. I can't wait. You guys, I really feel like, because of this Ingress thing, I feel like Loki is gonna play Pokemon Go.

700
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I'll try. So, anyways, I've been doing Christmas shopping, so I have your gifts.

701
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Oh, my gosh.

702
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:09,000
So, you guys can choose or fight over which one, and I don't know if you have these yet, so I can never know, because you buy all these figures and stuff.

703
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh, my God.

704
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Anyways, so I got both the Sam Flynn and the Korra Disney Infinity figures. I didn't know, they look pretty awesome, and I've been buying Disney Infinity stuff, because I'm buying my son the game, Disney Infinity 2.0.

705
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
So, you guys can decide which one you want.

706
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Wow, that's awesome. I'm fine, whichever one you want to take.

707
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I think I'd really like Korra.

708
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
You want Korra? That's fine. I'll take Flynn.

709
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Thank you.

710
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Hey, thank you, Loki. I'm gonna take that out of the box.

711
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I was looking at Amiibos, and I'm like, does he have that one?

712
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yes, I have them all. It's sick.

713
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You know what, though, guys? I don't know if I should talk about this on air. I might get in trouble, but we'll see.

714
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Shane told me he's gonna stop collecting Amiibo. I think he finally got broken, like the Amiibo thing kind of broke him.

715
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Because I ordered the Shovel Knight Amiibo on Best Buy this week, and I was like, Shane, you didn't tell me that it was up for sale. I heard about it from somebody else.

716
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
And I was like, are you gonna go get it? He's not feeling the Amiibo thing anymore, and I'm like, are you okay, buddy?

717
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I bought a disturbing amount of Disney Infinity figures this week.

718
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But they were on clearance.

719
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
They were on clearance, yes. And they're used.

720
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,000
So I bought the game, which was on clearance, because it's last year's game.

721
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And then I bought the figures, because they're on sale this week.

722
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And even, like, I bought an Olaf for my other son, and that's Disney 3.0. You can't actually use it in the game, but I'm gonna download 3.0 so that they play.

723
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:50,000
But the other figures were, like, five bucks new, or they had, you know, GameStop had, like, buy two used and get three free.

724
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I'm like, I cleared out, like, their whole section. They're hard to get anymore.

725
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
So I'm like, well, fuck, if I'm gonna buy this, I'm gonna buy the characters while I can still get them.

726
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And fucking trying to find that Spider-Man set, just forget it. It's impossible to find. After, like, a year.

727
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Alright, looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetware.com, I think that lit up the chatroom more than anything else.

728
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Me saying the Shane is out of the Amiibo thing.

729
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Act F saying, what? It's 2100, Matt. I don't believe it.

730
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
The what meme saying, did Shane finally accept a job for Sony PR?

731
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That, that, that I would believe for everything else.

732
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And SJ100Matt says, are you sure he was tired, wasn't tired and just needed a nap?

733
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
That could also be true. I don't know.

734
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Okay, so my gaming week. I actually, I played a whole lot this past week.

735
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Not just on Steam, obviously I played some Super Slam Dunk Touchdown.

736
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I played another game, and I want to have these guys on the show when their game is a little closer to full release.

737
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
The game is called Black Ice, and it was kind of like Tron meets Diablo.

738
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And I was like, I am into both of those things. Tell me more about your game.

739
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And I liked that one a lot, so I was playing that on Steam.

740
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
And actually, you know who's been playing that even more than me is Alan.

741
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Alan's really into that, so we'll talk about that game a little later on.

742
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I'm hoping to have them on the show.

743
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
But then I got home and I played some other stuff.

744
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I want to talk quickly about a game I talked about two weeks ago.

745
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Two weeks ago on the show I talked about Xenoblade Chronicles X.

746
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And although I don't think I was too negative on the game, I did give some feedback that was a little bit like, this really bothers me.

747
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And I did spend some more time with the game to see if I could get over some of that stuff.

748
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:39,000
And for the most part, yeah, I think I did get over a little bit of a hump that I think kind of happens in the story, kind of between Chapter 3 and 4.

749
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:45,000
And I was able to progress a little more in the story, and I feel a little better about where I'm headed in the game now.

750
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:57,000
It still doesn't completely change the fact that I do think there's a big disconnect between the manual is there, so you have to read the manual on the Wii U gamepad.

751
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:04,000
But the game has some tutorials in it, but if you're not able to read the manual as well...

752
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I don't know, there's some kind of disconnect there in how the game really paces itself in the beginning.

753
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And that still kind of bothers me and I think will turn some people off.

754
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:21,000
But if you can stick with it and get over that hurdle, I mean, the game is really good looking, there's a lot of great music in the game.

755
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,000
The battle system is fun, even if people never shut up, they keep yelling at each other, but I kind of like that ambience.

756
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
It's a little different than other RPG games I played.

757
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
So I am enjoying myself with Xenoblade Chronicles X, and I thought that was an important little follow-up point.

758
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:43,000
So even though I do think the game has its flaws, and I know there's going to be Nintendo defenders and Xenoblade defenders that are going to say I'm wrong, and that's fine.

759
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:49,000
But I really do think that there's some roadblocks in that game that prevent it from being a great game.

760
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Because at the end of the day, I still think a lot of the voice acting and the scripting is very...

761
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
It's a little generic, a little blah.

762
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I hear the story gets better and better, but I'm not going to be totally convinced.

763
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I don't think that it was written for a reading game and it's being acted and not very well.

764
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
But outside of that, I mean, what RPG games on the Wii U are there?

765
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
There's not a lot, a lot, a lot of games. There's a few, but not a lot.

766
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And Xenoblade is really good, and if you are a Wii U owner, I think it is worth having if you're into JRPGs at all.

767
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Just be warned, you got to read through that manual, and you might hit these parts where you're like,

768
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:36,000
am I even on the right fucking path? If you feel like that, just try something else and you'll get there.

769
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Also on the Wii U this week, I played a game that was released on the eShop that I'm kind of surprised I didn't play sooner,

770
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
the day it came out, but it's called Fast Racing Neo.

771
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
And this is the game that a lot of people are saying,

772
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:59,000
well, this is what happens when Nintendo doesn't put out F-Zero, is that the indie studio made their own version of F-Zero.

773
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And so I checked out the game, and I got to say, it's pretty sweet.

774
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
It's more Wipeout than F-Zero to me.

775
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yeah, that's what it looked like to me, more Wipeout.

776
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,000
But that's not a bad thing at all. It's fast, and it's racing.

777
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:20,000
So in fact, it's so fast that when I was playing, and it's really smooth, like it does run at that 60 frames a second,

778
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I did notice when I was going really fast on some complex tracks that the track kind of popped in in the distance.

779
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
You kind of see the pop in.

780
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:31,000
But that was extremely infrequent, all things considered.

781
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
But I think that's how they made it happen at 60 frames a second.

782
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
But I got to say, it was so fast and so smooth that even I was getting a little bit of that, whoa, I got to stop.

783
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I'm almost getting a little queasy playing this on my big TV.

784
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
It's almost a bit much.

785
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But they kind of put an interesting twist on the formula where there's almost like an Ikaruga thing where you have to flip the color of your engine to match the color of the boosters if you want to boost.

786
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:03,000
There's orange boost and blue boost, and you have to flip the colors back and forth to match the boost in order to actually go faster.

787
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
And I thought that kind of put a neat little spin on it.

788
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
So I think the music's good.

789
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:16,000
I think the tracks are pretty varied for an indie game, and at least the beginning ones I've played are pretty well designed.

790
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
However, it's pretty difficult.

791
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,000
It's not exactly like the first time I played.

792
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
The lowest difficulty is not a gimme.

793
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Like, you play Mario Kart on 50cc, you're going to win.

794
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
No problem, right?

795
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Unless you're maybe like a kid or like, you know, a gamer who really doesn't play very often.

796
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Like, you're going to win 50cc Mario Kart.

797
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
You're not going to win Fast Racing Neo your first time through.

798
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,000
If you do, props to you.

799
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
You're really good.

800
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
But that's okay.

801
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
I'm okay with the game.

802
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I'm not like saying, oh, it's too hard.

803
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
It just took me by surprise a little bit, so I'm going to warn you all out there.

804
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
It is a more difficult game.

805
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:57,000
But the second time I played through, I did place first in the circuit, and I was able to move on.

806
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
So I'm totally okay with a game kind of requiring a little bit of effort for progression.

807
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
The only thing that kind of bothers me about the game,

808
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I don't like the default controls, is that, like, you know, they do the little ZL and ZR are kind of like the super left turner.

809
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Like, they drift your car left and right like it didn't have zero.

810
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
But then the R button is the boost.

811
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And the L button flips between the orange and blue, but you can also use X to do that.

812
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
And it's like my fingers on the L and R's are never hitting the right button.

813
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
And so suddenly I'll boost when I think I'm going to be drifting to the right.

814
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Or worse yet, I'll drift to the right when I think I'm going to boost.

815
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
And like I'm having a hard time kind of like training my fingers to do that.

816
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
And I didn't see a way to remap those buttons at all.

817
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:48,000
I could have missed it, but I really wish it would let me remap some of that to a configuration that works for me.

818
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:54,000
I did notice the menu system in the game is really basic.

819
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
A lot of the shell around the game itself is really basic.

820
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
But that's, I mean, that's okay.

821
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I mean, you know, the important part is, is it a fast racing game?

822
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
And yes, it is. But I just, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't have that polish you would expect out of an F-Zero game, right?

823
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Like F-Zero GX was extremely polished from start to finish.

824
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
And most Nintendo games are, right?

825
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
This one's a little rough in the edges, but when you're actually racing, it's a lot of fun.

826
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And I'll give it that.

827
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
So, look in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

828
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Dark Ted Sousa says, I saw some video of fast racing Neo.

829
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Yeah, I did get sort of a wipeout vibe from it, but it still looked blazing fast.

830
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
It definitely seems to have a little bit of an F-Zero vibe to it, too.

831
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
There's still definitely a F-Zero vibe to it.

832
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Like, I swear to God, one of the opponent's names, it's not Captain Falcon, but it's like Fapton Calkin or something.

833
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Like, it's really similar.

834
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
It's kind of surprising.

835
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Like General Hawk.

836
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Wait, that's actually, I think, G.I. Joe.

837
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So.

838
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Anyway.

839
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And I got to give this important update.

840
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Shane actually joined the chat room and said, what terrible lie was said?

841
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
And so the chatters basically filled him in on what I'd been saying.

842
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
And Shane said, yeah, it's hell trying to hunt for both Amiibo and Power Rangers toys.

843
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
So I had to pick one.

844
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
So.

845
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
But what about my needs?

846
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
What about the Amiibo I need?

847
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
See, Shane was always, like he was keeping me in the loop on the Amiibo.

848
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Shane was my dealer.

849
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I know Shane was my dealer.

850
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
And now he's just, you can't just quit.

851
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Alright.

852
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
So anyway.

853
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
There you go.

854
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
That was pretty much my gaming week.

855
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I think that's all I really have to say for my gaming week was those games.

856
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Housekeeping, and then we'll get into news tonight.

857
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Just for housekeeping real quick, I know we've missed a lot of shows recently.

858
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,000
The good news is, no more missed shows unless something really bad happens.

859
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
We will be here weekly, at least through the end of February.

860
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
But I will be gone for a Sunday in the end of February.

861
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Maybe we can tape in advance that week.

862
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Because I'll only be gone like Thursday, Friday, so maybe we can tape on a Wednesday or something.

863
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
This is way out in February, so we don't have to worry about it now.

864
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,000
I'm going to Disneyland next month.

865
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Are you really?

866
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Yeah.

867
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Lucky.

868
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I told you.

869
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Oh yeah, that's right, because you're going to the farewell before they bulldoze.

870
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I'm going to meet.

871
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Yeah, before they bulldoze a lot of the frontier stuff for Star Wars Land.

872
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
And I wouldn't have even known about that actually being the weekend if not for Victoria,

873
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
so I'm going to be like, I'll be there.

874
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah.

875
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
It's going to be interesting.

876
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Because I deserve it.

877
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
You do deserve it.

878
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I'm kind of jealous you're going to Disneyland, but that's okay because a month later,

879
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I won't be here at the end of February, so we won't be live at the end of February.

880
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
This is a ways off.

881
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I'm going to MAGFest.

882
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I booked my flight.

883
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I know I've talked about it on the show for some time, but I'm officially 100% going.

884
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I booked my flight.

885
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I'm staying with some podcasting buddies.

886
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
And I'm going to be spending Thursday through Monday out in the D.C. area.

887
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
It's not technically in D.C., but it's the D.C. area.

888
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I'm flying into the Rainier Airport.

889
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
You'll have a good time.

890
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I'm very excited about it because I had a good time at Rockage out here on the West Coast.

891
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And Gabe, who is from the Sac-I-GDA, he works with MAGFest because he's from Jersey.

892
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,000
So I've got to talk to him and see what his plans are.

893
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Yeah, it's going to be my first MAGFest.

894
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I'm really excited about it.

895
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
So I hope to see you guys there.

896
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
VOG, OLR, we're not doing anything in official capacity.

897
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I kind of signed up too late.

898
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
I forgot the panel submissions were going to close.

899
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I kind of forgot to get on that bandwagon.

900
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
So we're not really doing anything in an official capacity, but I will be there.

901
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
And if you're there, we'll plan an unofficial meetup somewhere.

902
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Meet me by the Tron machine at 3 p.m. or something.

903
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
We'll figure something out.

904
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
We'll tweet on our Twitter account, at OLR.

905
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
All right, that's all I can think of for housekeeping.

906
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Otherwise, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR.

907
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio.

908
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
And Google, google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

909
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Let's get into what happened this week in gaming news, starting with Loki.

910
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
There was a lot for late December, can I just say.

911
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
There was a lot of news this week.

912
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
It was crazy.

913
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
So let's get to it.

914
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
So apparently Hideo Kojima came off of his vacation.

915
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And wasted no time to make the announcement that Kojima Productions is going to be coming back.

916
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
And they're going to be partnering with Sony for the first title.

917
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
So that's pretty amazing, actually.

918
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Like literally right after signing the deal for that.

919
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And it's going to be like a new franchise or a new IP.

920
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
It's not going to be based off of Metal Gear or Silent Hill.

921
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
But it should be something great.

922
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:35,000
And apparently as part of that, I think Sony is going to be fronting some money to help kick start that company.

923
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So that's kind of cool.

924
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Now that they've gone indie though, of course, what's going to happen to Metal Gear?

925
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Well, apparently Konami is looking for staff for a new Metal Gear game.

926
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Now there's been this post scene I guess that they have seeking people experienced that want to sign up to make a new game.

927
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Although it could be, I think this was left over, it might have been from Phantom Pains.

928
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,000
But I mean it's still up and so they're still seeking staff for a new Metal Gear title.

929
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
So I don't know.

930
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
You have to wonder if they aren't just going to take the Metal Gear IP and do something kind of different with it.

931
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Like a pachinko machine.

932
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:22,000
No, maybe experimenting with the online stuff or I don't know.

933
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I don't know.

934
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I mean like I'm surprised if they are actually still considering doing console games for this.

935
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I mean after all the bridges that they burned I'm just surprised that they're like,

936
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Hey, we're going to come back.

937
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
They didn't just burn the bridges, they detonated them.

938
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Like is anyone going to give a shit that they came back?

939
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:49,000
It's like, you know, unless there's something really cool to show, I mean I just think no one's going to give a shit.

940
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Yeah, Konami's going to have to work real hard to get me to give a shit about whatever's in store for Metal Gear.

941
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
So that being said, let's talk about Kojima and the Sony thing.

942
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,000
So what do y'all think?

943
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I think it's exciting. I can't wait to see what he's got.

944
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:09,000
It's a very logical pairing, especially after the very good reception of P.T.

945
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:14,000
But can we talk about how bad I want P.T. to be the thing that he's working on with Sony?

946
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
It could be. Maybe he's going to work on something that's not Silent Hills but is Silent Hills.

947
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
But like a scary...

948
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And yeah, I realize he can't even really use P.T. because technically Konami paid for that development.

949
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
So any of the characters, any of the stuff he did...

950
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
But there wasn't really anything in it, I mean...

951
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Yeah, but I don't know. So he can't actually make P.T., but he can make something that's inspired-ish, you know what I mean?

952
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I guess I just want Kojima to make a scary game, and I kind of want Guillermo del Toro to be involved as well.

953
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:49,000
So, I mean, yes, he can't make Silent Hills, duh. That's done. But I would be very interested in whatever it is he's making.

954
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
He's making, yeah, a new franchise.

955
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Silent Hill hasn't really been with Silent Hill for a long time anyway, so...

956
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I'm kind of okay with that being done with a new franchise. We'll love it just as much.

957
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Interesting theory from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

958
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:09,000
ActDeft says, I'm calling it, Kojima will make a Playstation VR game.

959
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Could that be what they are going to put him on?

960
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Make it, oh god, can you imagine a scary game in VR?

961
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I might shit my pants for real, good lord.

962
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I don't know, DartSakura? What do you think of all this?

963
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I hope not.

964
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I hope not. I mean, honestly, I hate speculating on stuff like that because, first of all, we knew he was going to be getting right back into thing after, you know, his contract date was up.

965
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Because I knew it wasn't a vacation, it was a separation, a complete separation.

966
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
And having him pairing up with Sony, like, right away.

967
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Oh, Sony took him out on a nice date.

968
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Sony played some romance, Sony played some Adele, to some candlelit music, and steak, and Sony sexed him somehow.

969
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
This wasn't a love hotel, this was a full on host date.

970
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
It was fucking like, hey, hey, listen.

971
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,000
This was Kojima breaking up and going right onto the hookup app to find the next best thing.

972
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
And Sony's like, me, me, me, me, me.

973
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Listen, I know your pimp was treating you bad before, but come on.

974
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Well, I'll buy you nice things, you know, you can make whatever you want.

975
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
You got freedom.

976
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Alan Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Sony and Kojima's date was like that Instagram series.

977
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
He got money.

978
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Have you ever seen that? It's funny.

979
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,000
At any rate, the only thing I can expect is great things.

980
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
So when's Konami going to announce that he's actually left the company? Is he still going to be on vacation?

981
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Is it going to be a weekend at Bernie's situation where it's like, no, he's still working.

982
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
See, look, look at all the work he's doing. He's right there.

983
01:16:51,000 --> 01:17:03,000
I kind of think when your ex-husband announces they just got married, that kind of insinuates that there was a divorce that happened at some point.

984
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I don't think Konami needs to make a statement.

985
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I think at this point for Konami to make a statement is just for the Internet's amusement, which Konami is probably not amused that the rest of us are amused, but they really only have themselves to blame at how they've conducted themselves.

986
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Like I said, Konami is a PR nightmare right now. I would hate to be in their PR department and none of them had anything to do with it.

987
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
And Lord knows, they're probably yelling.

988
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
What needs to happen at Konami, the CEO needs to be dethroned.

989
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:37,000
This is such a fucking mess at this point. The CEO needs to be switched and that's the only way.

990
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
This is like when Microsoft needed to lose their CEO.

991
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Honestly, for everything that Microsoft went through last year or two years ago, it's nothing compared to what Konami is going through.

992
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
And Don Mattrick lost his job over it.

993
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I mean, they'll say it was parted on mutual terms.

994
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
He lost his job over it.

995
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

996
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
AlanAlchemy, Sony, what do you want to watch?

997
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:15,000
I got Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, Amazon Prime, Kojima, LOL, whose password do you have?

998
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Sony, I pay for it all, Kojima.

999
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
He got money!

1000
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:27,000
SSG100Matt says, we'll see if people flip off Konami with their wallet when the new Metal Gear Solid game comes out.

1001
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I certainly hope they do.

1002
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Well, you know, how would you feel?

1003
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Now, I'm going to be like the most ultimate tinfoil hat right now, but just humor me for a minute here.

1004
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Let's say I get my wish and the management is shaken up severely at Konami.

1005
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Severe management shakeup.

1006
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:51,000
And Konami decides to bring in an outside person that's worked on another big game series to do Metal Gear.

1007
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Would you have faith at that point?

1008
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Would you be willing to forgive Konami if Konami basically fired the people that needed to be fired and put in some fresh blood from other places?

1009
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Would you give Metal Gear Solid a chance at that point?

1010
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
No, because they aren't bringing out a new Dance Dance Revolution game.

1011
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Oh, come on.

1012
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
I just don't care.

1013
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Whatmeme says, those people working on new Metal Gear had nothing to do with the nasty split. Don't punish them.

1014
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Shane in our chat says, how can Konami fire itself?

1015
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:30,000
But this stuff happens all the time. Shareholders revolt and demand to the board that it changes.

1016
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Well, let's put it this way. Let's just see how their Patinko business works.

1017
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I hope it's as good as they think it is.

1018
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
That's all I'm saying.

1019
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:46,000
It's just like betting everything on mobile. I really hope that you don't think that you're going to have the next Angry Birds.

1020
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Because I'm sorry, whatever game you put out on there is probably not going to be that big.

1021
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:57,000
But they might have Metal Gear tap puzzle surprise thing. I don't know. Who knows?

1022
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
It'll be terrible.

1023
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Chibi Metal Gear, where you drag Solid Snake in a cardboard box through mazes of whimsical obstacles.

1024
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
It's Metal Gear Solid Racing!

1025
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
It's just Snake in a cardboard box.

1026
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Exactly. It's like a cardboard box derby car.

1027
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
It's like that Boy Scouts event where people build their little cars.

1028
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Soap box derby.

1029
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
That's it.

1030
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Metal Gear Solid soap box derby.

1031
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Sg100Matt, I'll leave it on this. Sg100Matt in chat says,

1032
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I want them to come out on stage, bow their heads, and say,

1033
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Hey, we were dicks. Sorry, but we'll change.

1034
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Well, I don't know about that.

1035
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Still won't care.

1036
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Yeah, we'll see.

1037
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Hey, let's move on though to some other news that happened this past week.

1038
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Including your Xbox One got enriched with more backwards compatibility.

1039
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Microsoft making good on their word to add more backwards compatibility each month

1040
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
for the second month in a row.

1041
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
So hopefully this trend will continue into January and February.

1042
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
But some new games available on the Xbox One are

1043
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Xbox 360 titles like Braid, Deus Ex Human Revolution, Fable 3, Halo Reach,

1044
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,000
Hydro Thunder, that's I think a favorite of Dark Soccer's,

1045
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Ms. Pac-Man, Pagle, Portal Still Alive, that was the standalone Portal thing on 360,

1046
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Splunky, Splosion Man, and Doritos Crash Course.

1047
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:33,000
For those of you that were fans of Doritos and their saturation of the gaming market.

1048
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
But yeah, all those games are available now on the Xbox One.

1049
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So that's pretty cool.

1050
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
By the way, Hydro Thunder is really Dan's thing.

1051
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Oh, I thought you were into that too.

1052
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
I mean, I was for a hot minute, but Dan was like,

1053
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:50,000
he'll still like when he finds a Hydro Thunder machine, he'll be like,

1054
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Tidal Blade! Damn the torpedoes!

1055
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
What was the game that was like the spiritual successor?

1056
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
H2 Overdrive.

1057
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
That's it, H2 Overdrive.

1058
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
He likes that one too.

1059
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
That game's fun too.

1060
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Yeah.

1061
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Anyway, all right, so yeah, turn on your Xbox One and check your games library

1062
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
because you never know what you might have bought on 360.

1063
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,000
I think that Doritos game was free, so I think a lot of people have that.

1064
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
But yeah, I logged in.

1065
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I was like, oh, hey, I've got like five new games available.

1066
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I didn't even realize I bought all this shit.

1067
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I knew it would pay off someday.

1068
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,000
That's me looking at my Steam library.

1069
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Right.

1070
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Anyhow.

1071
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:31,000
So here's a little bit of interesting speculation is that

1072
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
there's been this ongoing question, is Rare Replay coming to Wii U?

1073
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
We finally have an answer.

1074
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:43,000
At least Microsoft hasn't said like a definite no.

1075
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,000
They just said that they hadn't had any information.

1076
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:52,000
But Rare spoke up and said it is exclusive to Xbox One.

1077
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,000
We have the answer.

1078
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Now people can shut up.

1079
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
That is, I mean, I don't know.

1080
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
It seems a little bit obvious to me that that would be the case,

1081
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
that it's exclusive to Xbox.

1082
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
But maybe people were hoping that a Nintendo release on Wii U

1083
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
would then maybe sub out some of the 360 titles for stuff like

1084
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Donkey Kong Country.

1085
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
I'm assuming that was the fan wank that started all that.

1086
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
They'd like to think so.

1087
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
But I mean, a good number, though, of those games were on Nintendo consoles before.

1088
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
That's some of the coolest stuff in the pack, like playing Cobra Triangle again.

1089
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
It was half like this is awesome and half actually it's not that awesome.

1090
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
It was just more awesome when I was a kid.

1091
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:35,000
But now it's like, sorry, Nintendo players who want to recapture those nostalgia,

1092
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
time to bust out your carts and blow out some dust.

1093
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
That's how you're going to get it on a Nintendo system.

1094
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
But I understand Microsoft kind of wanting to keep those Xbox One exclusives

1095
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
where they can.

1096
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:51,000
But at the same time, again, Microsoft working with Nintendo products,

1097
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
not unheard of.

1098
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I mean, obviously, Minecraft this week, right?

1099
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
That's a Microsoft thing now.

1100
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And then Viva Pinata was on the 3DS.

1101
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
So Microsoft will do it if, you know.

1102
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Microsoft will play nice with the other team.

1103
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Sure.

1104
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I mean, we've got Office on Mac.

1105
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
I mean, why not?

1106
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Yeah.

1107
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I mean, the question is, can they make money?

1108
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Yes.

1109
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
And that's all that matters is the money.

1110
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
He got money.

1111
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Yes.

1112
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Capitalistic paradise here, huh?

1113
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
There's Brad in our chat room.

1114
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
MS got money.

1115
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Oh, my ticket is getting all wrinkled.

1116
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,000
What?

1117
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,000
My ticket.

1118
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Oh, your movie ticket?

1119
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Are you one of those people who saves movie tickets?

1120
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I have movie tickets for years.

1121
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:34,000
When I moved out here, I had a bundle of movie tickets from, like, 1989.

1122
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I don't.

1123
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
And I moved out here in 98.

1124
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Wow.

1125
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
No, I don't save movie tickets.

1126
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
I do.

1127
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Because memories.

1128
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And they go like, haha, sat through that.

1129
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I knew a person that saved, tangent time, but sorry about it.

1130
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I knew a person that saved every ticket from when they saw the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

1131
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
That's cool.

1132
01:24:53,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And they had, like, a binder of, like, 150 tickets from just week after week after week

1133
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
of seeing Rocky Horror.

1134
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,000
That's cool.

1135
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Yeah.

1136
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I did think that was kind of cool, but I was like, dang, like.

1137
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,000
So you got a binder full of printed paper, but memories.

1138
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Binder full of women.

1139
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Yes, binders full of women.

1140
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Binder full of transsexual Transylvanians.

1141
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Who knew that that four-year-old joke would work well on the show tonight?

1142
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Let's travel around the world and check our binders full of release dates.

1143
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
How about binders full of sluts and assholes?

1144
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
I don't think you're going to find those in the release dates.

1145
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
In fact, I think those binders are going to be pretty empty this week leading into Christmas,

1146
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
but let's ask, are there any releases coming out in the U.S. this week?

1147
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Loki.

1148
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Yeah, there's a Tales of Legend game that's coming out on PlayStation 3 and the Vita.

1149
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
And that's it?

1150
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Yeah. I mean, it's the week of Christmas, so.

1151
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Yeah.

1152
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Yeah. And that's it.

1153
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:00,000
You get only one Exceed RPG this week, and that's it.

1154
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
If your game's not out by now, it's not for the holiday season, I guess.

1155
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,000
On the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.

1156
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Now, Christmas is a little different in Japan.

1157
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:13,000
You can get a cake, but it's not really quite the same thing it is here.

1158
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I want a Christmas cake. I just want cake.

1159
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,000
You know, we usually try to find the restaurant on Christmas.

1160
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
We'll do our little.

1161
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Yeah, we haven't decided what to do this year.

1162
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
We'll have to figure that out, but maybe we should have cake.

1163
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
But you know what the crappy thing is?

1164
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
What?

1165
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I have to work the next day, so I can't stay out late.

1166
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Aww.

1167
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
So.

1168
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
We have to get creative, because we are doing our thing with Alan's family, so I don't know.

1169
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Why don't we do this? How about Sunday before the show instead?

1170
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Maybe.

1171
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
We'll do Gay Jumis on Sunday.

1172
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Will there be cake?

1173
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
We can have cake.

1174
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Right. It better not be a lie.

1175
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Or, and places will be open.

1176
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
That's true.

1177
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:48,000
So, we can just put it off.

1178
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
We could do cheesecake.

1179
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,000
We could do cheesecake.

1180
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Last year we got cheated out of our holiday.

1181
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
You know I love cheesecake.

1182
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Why don't we do Cheesecake Factory?

1183
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I even will play Five Nights at Freddy's for cheesecake.

1184
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Let's do Cheesecake Factory for Gay Jumis.

1185
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Alright, that works.

1186
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Okay.

1187
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Alright.

1188
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Wattmeme in chat says, there were some digital releases this week.

1189
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Just curious, why does no LR announce digital releases?

1190
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,000
That's a good question.

1191
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
It's too hard to keep track of all those.

1192
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
We sometimes will pick that up too in the rapid fire news.

1193
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:23,000
We try to sort of, I think for some reason Dark Soccer's has the digital mixed in when she does the UK.

1194
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,000
But otherwise, Loki and I look at retail stuff so it's a little tricky sometimes.

1195
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
It's too hard to remember everything that's coming out anyways.

1196
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:38,000
I basically, I'll go ahead and just say, I basically use Eurogamer as my source and they mix in the UK stuff.

1197
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I mean until someone can buy me a better UK release thing because game hasn't been super reliable.

1198
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Right.

1199
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Okay.

1200
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Well, let's go to Japan and check out some releases over in Japan.

1201
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:52,000
On the PlayStation 4, Assault Suit Lanos is out this week on December the 23rd.

1202
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:57,000
God Eater Offshot Twin Pack Volume 3 is also coming out on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1203
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Going to the PlayStation 3, TV Anime Idolmaster Cinderella G4U Pack Volume 7.

1204
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Your guess is as good as mine as to what the fuck that is.

1205
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:14,000
It's an Idolmaster expansion pack of some sort.

1206
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
This is definitely the week to put something like that out.

1207
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Volume 7.

1208
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
If you can believe it. Good lord.

1209
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
On the Wii U this week, there is a new game.

1210
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Geni Ibunroku £FE is out this week.

1211
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And I think that's actually, the emphasis is on FE in the title.

1212
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,000
So I think this must be based on some, oh is it Fire Emblem?

1213
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Is this the Fire Emblem crossover game?

1214
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
That must be what this is.

1215
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I think this is the Fire Emblem crossover game.

1216
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
That they've been waiting for is finally out on the Wii U this week.

1217
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
You know Rob.

1218
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Why didn't they just call it Fire Emblem? Then I know what it is.

1219
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:48,000
You know what Rob?

1220
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
It could be that given this is so modern, that could be hashtag FE.

1221
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Yeah, maybe that's what it looks like at first is hashtag FE.

1222
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
But I'm like, eh, I think so.

1223
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Unless they really like iron.

1224
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Yeah.

1225
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:04,000
You know, because FE, Varus, iron.

1226
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Well I'm sure some people will be importing that one on the Wii U

1227
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:09,000
because I know Fire Emblem has their fans.

1228
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Going to the PlayStation Vita, Getsui no Kusaro,

1229
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Sakuran Paranoia comes out this week,

1230
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,000
as well as Mobile Suit Gundam, Extreme vs. Force,

1231
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
and Storm Lover V comes out on the Vita in Japan this week

1232
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
because Vita in Japan is still a thing.

1233
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And on the Nintendo 3DS this week, I think this is kind of awesome,

1234
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Sega 3D Fukoku Archives 1 and 2 Double Pack.

1235
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
This is a collection of all those Sega 3D games they've released,

1236
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
at least in Japan.

1237
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Get this, Power Drift, Space Harrier, Sonic, Fantasy Zone, Outrun,

1238
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Fantasy Zone 2, Bare Knuckle, Galaxy Force 2, Shinobi,

1239
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Echo the Dolphin, Thunder Blade.

1240
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
I mean, that's not even all of them.

1241
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
So that's a heck of a collection.

1242
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
That actually reminds me of something that I learned over the week

1243
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
because it's another game I forgot to mention.

1244
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Fantasy Zone for PC Engine is kind of crappy.

1245
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
At least the music is.

1246
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Aw, sorry to hear that. Sorry to hear that.

1247
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Let's see, Gameguru clarifying the title there.

1248
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
It is, of course, Shin Megami Tensei Crossfire Emblem.

1249
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
That's right, that's what they're calling it here.

1250
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
And Gameguru says the pound is supposed to be a musical sharp symbol.

1251
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
So it's sharp-F-E.

1252
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I knew that that's what it meant in music,

1253
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
but the last time I think I've heard something like that

1254
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
in regards to a video game was...

1255
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
What was the role-playing game that had all the music...

1256
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Internal Sonata.

1257
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Internal Sonata, that was it.

1258
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:36,000
That's a really underrated game, I think.

1259
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
History needs to remember that game a little better.

1260
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
That was a really good RPG.

1261
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
There's so much musical innuendo in that game.

1262
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Yeah, it fell a little flat, didn't it?

1263
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Well, that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Lounge Radio.

1264
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Dark Sakura will be sacked after tonight's episode.

1265
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I'd like to apologize to all the listeners

1266
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
that had to deal with that punishment just then.

1267
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Am I in trouble?

1268
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
You are in big trouble.

1269
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
You just got moved to Santa's naughty list.

1270
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Alright, let's go to the UK release dates.

1271
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I'll just play myself a little sad song on my piano.

1272
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
It's not really my forte, though.

1273
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
I hate her so much, you guys.

1274
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Allow me to break out a little more fortissimo

1275
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
and I'll do my part now.

1276
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
I've been here for seven years.

1277
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
The medication doesn't work.

1278
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I know, it fell on its base.

1279
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Shut up and read the release dates.

1280
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Gee, Rob.

1281
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
That was also a music joke, too.

1282
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
The chatters are yelling, stop.

1283
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
She must be stopped.

1284
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
Well, better a stop than a repeat, right?

1285
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
We could just do that.

1286
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Read release dates.

1287
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I will end you.

1288
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
There's one.

1289
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
One.

1290
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
In my magnum opus of puns.

1291
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
December 30th is story of seasons for 3DS.

1292
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Finny.

1293
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Just a couple more quick stories for you guys

1294
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
and we're going to get to the classic game of the week.

1295
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Loki.

1296
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Another Smash Direct this week.

1297
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Isn't this the last one they're doing?

1298
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Last one ever.

1299
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
The way they end it with, of course,

1300
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
adding Bayonetta.

1301
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Bayonetta is going to be joining the Smash Bros. roster in the game.

1302
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Allow me to join what?

1303
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
What?

1304
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
What?

1305
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
What?

1306
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
What?

1307
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
What?

1308
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
What?

1309
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
What?

1310
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
And allow me to join what Twitter said

1311
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
in response to this this week.

1312
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Yes!

1313
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Because that was basically my entire

1314
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Twitter feed during that conference.

1315
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
It was just one great, big

1316
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
yes!

1317
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
I'm super happy they put her original outfit.

1318
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
I'm sure you're looking forward to the eventual amiibo that will be coming out.

1319
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Oh, yeah. The Bayonetta amiibo is almost better news

1320
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
than Bayonetta being in the game, to be honest.

1321
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
But yeah, I'm with Dark Soccer.

1322
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I like the fact that they have both the Bayonetta 1 and 2 outfits in it.

1323
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
I want, though,

1324
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
the amiibo to be the original Bayonetta

1325
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
as well, because I really do not like

1326
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
her second game look.

1327
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
We'll see.

1328
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I would pick up the game if it was discounted,

1329
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
but it's not.

1330
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Also, they're adding

1331
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Corrin from Fire Emblem as well.

1332
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
And so that's going to be, they have

1333
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
like, how many people from Fire Emblem

1334
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
now in this game? I mean, seriously.

1335
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I don't even know her.

1336
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
I've never played Fire Emblem.

1337
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
There were a lot of people that were like,

1338
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
really? More Fire Emblem?

1339
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
But at the same time, I'm kind of like,

1340
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I'm of two mindsets. I mean, there's a part

1341
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
of me that's like, okay, yeah, maybe I would have

1342
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
liked to see somebody a little more well-known,

1343
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
but at the same time, if Corrin

1344
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
is a solid character that they believe

1345
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
in, I mean, shouldn't she be allowed a chance

1346
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
to shine? It is a fighting game.

1347
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
It makes sense that you have sword wielders

1348
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
in it. And there's a shit ton

1349
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
of Pokemon and Mario characters, so

1350
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
what's another Fire Emblem character, especially

1351
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
with Japan? But they've got like

1352
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
six. Cloud,

1353
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Final Fantasy, Bayonetta,

1354
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
like, they couldn't

1355
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
have said, instead of, okay, let's put a, like,

1356
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
the 15th Fire Emblem character in there.

1357
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
They could have, like, said, how about we do

1358
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
whatever? It seems like 15.

1359
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Um, they could have

1360
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
just like, hey, let's put, like, Birdo

1361
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
in there or something, or say, hey, how about a

1362
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
character from fucking Super Mario Brothers 2?

1363
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Anybody.

1364
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
At this point, I'm wondering why they don't do a Fire Emblem

1365
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
fighting game. The chatroom is correcting

1366
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
me on something. Corrin, like several

1367
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
of the other Fire Emblem characters, can be

1368
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
either male or female. I'm using

1369
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
female pronouns, because that's how it was presented

1370
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
in the video, if I'm not mistaken. So,

1371
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
that's what kind of associ- I know it's both. Yes, I know

1372
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
that's what I'm saying. It's both. No, no, no. In the video that I saw,

1373
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
um, Corrin started off male and was kept

1374
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
being referred to as Big Brother, Big Brother, Big Brother.

1375
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Oh. Now Big Brother's

1376
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Big Sister, and that's even better!

1377
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I laughed so much.

1378
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
So, just, just so y'all

1379
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
can stop writing the emails. I, uh, they,

1380
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
it was the same thing that Robin does, where you can be

1381
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
boy or girl. That's cool, but, once again,

1382
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
you know, I'd rather, like,

1383
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
some more obscure characters.

1384
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Hey, let's put Captain Rainbow in there, or

1385
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
fucking, like, you know,

1386
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
anybody from Super Mario Brothers 2.

1387
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Here's the thing. If that had

1388
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
been the note they ended on, then I think

1389
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
a lot of us would be like, oh,

1390
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
okay, cool.

1391
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
But, the fact that they said, okay, here's

1392
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Corrin, and then here's fucking Bayonetta,

1393
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
like, it's like, oh, okay, cool, cool.

1394
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Yeah, I'm in, I'm in. Like, you know,

1395
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Corrin's just kind of like, oh, it's just like a little bit,

1396
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
it's a cherry on top, but Bayonetta, hmm.

1397
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
That's gonna be a lot of fun.

1398
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Bayonetta is luscious.

1399
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
No, I can't freaking wait.

1400
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
I didn't download Cloud yet, though. I was,

1401
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I was so busy playing Xenoblade

1402
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
and even Mario Maker, I didn't even talk about it during my gaming week,

1403
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
but I was catching up on all the Mario Maker

1404
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
event stages, because I have to get all those

1405
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
new costumes, right? Like the badge arcade bunny

1406
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
and all that stuff. I'm sure, I think we'll talk about that later.

1407
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I haven't gotten that one yet. They only had a few,

1408
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I didn't have that latest update when I checked

1409
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
it last, so I only got the car

1410
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
and,

1411
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
I forget, I don't,

1412
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I got the cat thing from

1413
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Monster Hunter and

1414
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I'm almost positive

1415
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
you have a story on it after the break, so it'll probably jog

1416
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
your memory. No, no, I saw that.

1417
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
I'm just saying, I didn't play those levels,

1418
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
the new ones, so I must have

1419
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
done it before they put those up.

1420
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
But,

1421
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
yeah, you know, the developers,

1422
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
they made a solid game. If Corrin is the

1423
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
character they believe in and want to have in the game, they

1424
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
are more than welcome to do it. Cool.

1425
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
I want there to be a

1426
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Pokemon game that plays like Smash.

1427
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Uh, Pokken, well, it doesn't

1428
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
really play like Smash, I guess, but you kind of

1429
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
have a fighting Pokemon game coming at

1430
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Pokken Tournament.

1431
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Maybe not what you had in mind.

1432
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Also, Mii costumes, right?

1433
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Because I know some people are getting excited about

1434
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
some of those. They're going to have the Mii costumes

1435
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
they had, um,

1436
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
I was kind of disappointed that they didn't put any

1437
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Mario RPG stuff like actual characters,

1438
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
but they have got, um, I want to say the

1439
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Geno costume. Yeah. Um, they

1440
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
had also, you know, stuff from

1441
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
you could do, uh,

1442
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
was it a chocobo?

1443
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
And then they also had, like, uh, the Sonic

1444
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
characters, like Knuckles, Tails,

1445
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
um,

1446
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
so that looked pretty cool. And then they have the Mii

1447
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
costumes now. Bionic armor

1448
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
from Brawler, or for the Brawler,

1449
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
let's see, um, Gil from

1450
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
the Tower of Druaga.

1451
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
And, let's

1452
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
see, Ashley from WarioWare, right?

1453
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Ashley from WarioWare.

1454
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
And, uh, Takamura from

1455
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Nazo, no,

1456
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I don't even know what the fuck the series was.

1457
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
I'm not even going to bother. Sorry, you tried.

1458
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
But Geno, though, seriously, Geno would have been awesome.

1459
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Yeah, I gotta say, I think the one thing

1460
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I was seeing about the

1461
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Corrin thing is that people were like,

1462
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
couldn't we have gotten Geno instead of Corrin?

1463
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Do you remember Nazo, what do you mean, Nazo no

1464
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Yeah, I don't know what that is.

1465
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
It means it's a mysterious girlfriend.

1466
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Wow, that cleared it up.

1467
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Well,

1468
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
look, uh, um,

1469
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
here's, here's the other thing, you

1470
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
kind of talk about Super Mario RPG.

1471
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Uh, a couple years ago, I would have said

1472
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
no way, no how, you're never getting a sequel to that game.

1473
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Square and Nintendo are not going to be back in bed together.

1474
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
But, now that we've got

1475
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Cloud for Smash Brothers,

1476
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Geno shows up as a costume,

1477
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
rumors gaining steam that

1478
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Square is somehow heavily involved with NX.

1479
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Y'all,

1480
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I'm just saying, could you imagine,

1481
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
could you, tinfoil hat time.

1482
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
This is Rob's dream.

1483
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
E3 2016.

1484
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Nintendo NX.

1485
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
It's fucking coming.

1486
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Reggie Fils-Aime is out on stage,

1487
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
he punches a kid in the face, he's like,

1488
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
this is going to be so fucking rad.

1489
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
And then, he says, and guess what title

1490
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
we're launching with?

1491
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Mario RPG 2.

1492
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
I mean,

1493
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
there's, there's not

1494
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
enough Kleenex in the world

1495
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
to scoop up all the you know what

1496
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
that would be out there if that were

1497
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
to be the big announcement at

1498
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
NX. I'm just saying.

1499
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
You know, that sounds like a great idea.

1500
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
In my head, it's fabulous.

1501
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
It's fabulous, and then they're like, and here's

1502
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
the controller. Oh, it's a fucking mobile

1503
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
touch screen with no fucking buttons!

1504
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Because we don't fucking get it.

1505
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
And then we'd be like,

1506
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
damn you! No!

1507
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I am not purchasing that.

1508
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
So, Nintendo,

1509
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
so in your dream, Loki. No, seriously,

1510
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
like, I watched, like,

1511
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
just on a TV show, like, I'm having this

1512
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
dream, and I'm so pleasantly asleep,

1513
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
and then Loki comes in and ruins my dream.

1514
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Well, no, it's like, you get the game

1515
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
you've always wanted, and then they fuck it up!

1516
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
They, yeah, because, well, seriously though,

1517
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I watched, like, I watched one of those Did You Know

1518
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Gaming things, and they were talking about the Wii U and stuff,

1519
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
and, like, we've heard the story before

1520
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
about, like, when they were talking about the online and everything,

1521
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
and how, oh, hey, we've never,

1522
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
we have no fucking experience with what the Playstation

1523
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Network and Xbox Live are, or how

1524
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
to create an infrastructure, and just

1525
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
boggles my mind that

1526
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
with the launch of the Wii U, they

1527
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
didn't fucking know anything about that

1528
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
shit. And I mean, even now,

1529
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
it's a little bit better, but that kind of

1530
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
scares me, what we're going into with

1531
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
NX. Like, you would think, okay, they

1532
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
should really have a handle on how to run

1533
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
the, you know, the structure of everything.

1534
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
I mean, they just started doing DLC, what,

1535
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
like, a year or two ago?

1536
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I mean, I'm just like,

1537
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
I hope it's good. I hope

1538
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
it's good, but I'm worried that they

1539
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
don't get it, and it's

1540
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
gonna be fucked up somehow.

1541
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Alright, sst200maddenchat says,

1542
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I dream of having Twitch stream of Loki's

1543
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
live reaction of the NX announcement.

1544
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
This is why they invented Periscope.

1545
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Are they announcing it this year? Because I'm seriously thinking about taking

1546
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
off time for E3 this year.

1547
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I think 2016, I think

1548
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
E3 will be the big announcement. I think

1549
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
there's so much hype

1550
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
going into this, I can't see how they don't

1551
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
announce it at the next E3. We'll see.

1552
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Let's see, also

1553
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
actdeft trying to sell

1554
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Dark Sakura on Pokken,

1555
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
saying Pokken isn't like

1556
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Smash, but it's like Tekken.

1557
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
And Dark Sakura loves Tekken.

1558
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
So... I don't know if I'm feeling

1559
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
it with, uh,

1560
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Pokken, though. Alright.

1561
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And Dark Tetsuya says, I just want a date and title

1562
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
on Zelda games. Ah, Zelda U. Man,

1563
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
who saw, um,

1564
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Akuma, um, in

1565
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
the new Tekken? Oh, yeah.

1566
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Oh my god. I was like...

1567
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
That was random. I know.

1568
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
It's random, but it's like,

1569
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
what the fuck did happen to Tekken

1570
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Cross Street Fighter? I mean, it's like, hey, you have

1571
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Street Fighter in there now. Maybe.

1572
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Where's the rest of it? Maybe that's it.

1573
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I just kind of gurgled a little bit.

1574
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
You know what it is? It's fucking Tekken 7

1575
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
with the Tekken Cross Street Fighter

1576
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
DLC.

1577
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Be careful what you wish for.

1578
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
That is, I don't know, I'm gonna

1579
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
upgrade that from tinfoil hat to, like,

1580
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
paper mache hat, because that is

1581
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
a lot more realistic, I think, that

1582
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
concept. Just saying.

1583
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Anyhow, uh, let's move

1584
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
on. Let's talk about, uh,

1585
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
one big thing that's been developing the past couple weeks

1586
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
is Sony releasing more

1587
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
PlayStation 2 games on the PlayStation 4.

1588
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Did you know that Parappa 2

1589
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
came out in the week that, uh, we've been off?

1590
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
No, it was just this past week, actually.

1591
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Parappa the Rapa 2 is now available on PlayStation 4.

1592
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
That's kind of cool. Um, well, anyway,

1593
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
uh, Sony's been doing a campaign on

1594
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Twitter where you can use the hashtag

1595
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
PS2PS4.

1596
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Get it? Because PS2...

1597
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
It's like the play on the number 2.

1598
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
They're not putting PlayStation games on the PlayStation 4.

1599
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
That doesn't make any sense.

1600
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Shut up.

1601
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Alright, anyway, so, uh, using that hashtag,

1602
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
uh, they are, uh, Dave

1603
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Thatch with Sony is tracking

1604
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
what the popular suggestions are to figure out

1605
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
what games should be brought over

1606
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
to the PS4 yet. Uh,

1607
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
some of the games that, uh, have been noticed

1608
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
have been, I guess, trending a little bit.

1609
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Tekken, SOCOM, Fatal

1610
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Frame, Timesplitters,

1611
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Simpsons Hit and Run, God Hand,

1612
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Persona 3, Dragon Quest,

1613
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
and Kingdom Hearts. Now, Timesplitters

1614
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
2 would be good. Let's please do

1615
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Timesplitters 2. I can't believe that Final Fantasy

1616
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
12 would not be on

1617
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
that list, because... Well, Final Fantasy 12

1618
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
already got an HD remake that's already,

1619
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
well, no, actually it didn't. I was like, it did,

1620
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
because I've been asleep there, because I don't think it has.

1621
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Are they doing that? Uh, no.

1622
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Everything's been quiet on Final Fantasy 12.

1623
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Um, the game I want,

1624
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
most of all, Katamari Damacy.

1625
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
We just talked about it. It was a classic game of the week

1626
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
a couple weeks ago. You know what I want? That's the one I want.

1627
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I want the games that I fucking purchased

1628
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
already to be fucking available, is what

1629
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I want. I want that shit to fucking

1630
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
just work without having me buy that

1631
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
shit again.

1632
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Oh, Loki, you're asking for

1633
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
too much. Apparently.

1634
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Alright, let's go to the classic game

1635
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
of the week. We're gonna take a walk down

1636
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
memory lane to a time...

1637
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
The games did not have DLC.

1638
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
There was not a separate DLC

1639
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
adventure. There was no patch.

1640
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
It was just, this is the game you get.

1641
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Take it or leave it.

1642
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
In fact, this is the game that our system comes

1643
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
with, right, Darsakra?

1644
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Sort of. Not necessarily.

1645
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Not at the beginning. Alright.

1646
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Let's get to it. What is the classic game of the week,

1647
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Darsakra? The classic game of the week is

1648
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Bonk's Adventure. Yay.

1649
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
It was run by Red

1650
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Company and Atlas.

1651
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
It came out in 1989 in Japan

1652
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
and 1990 in North America

1653
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
for the TurboGrafx-16.

1654
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Now, as we all know,

1655
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
the TurboGrafx-16 in Japan was

1656
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
called the PC Engine.

1657
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
When this game came out in Japan, it was

1658
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
called PC Genjin

1659
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
because it sounded like

1660
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
PC Engine, sort of.

1661
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
And it has come out,

1662
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
it was re-released

1663
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
in the US in 1992 on

1664
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
the Gates of Thunder 4

1665
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
in one game CD-ROM,

1666
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
and actually another

1667
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
pretty good

1668
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
TurboGrafx game.

1669
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
It had ports for the NES, Game Boy,

1670
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
and Amiga and different

1671
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
other systems under some different

1672
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
titles like FC Genjin,

1673
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
GB Genjin, and VC Genjin.

1674
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
And it was

1675
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
out on Virtual Console and

1676
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
on PlayStation Store.

1677
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
There's even a mobile version in Japan

1678
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
for phones.

1679
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Basically, your main character is Bonk,

1680
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
who has a very, very big head.

1681
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
And unbelievably,

1682
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
his head's bigger

1683
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
than the orange on a toothpick kid's head

1684
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
from So I Married an Axe Murderer.

1685
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
That's pretty big.

1686
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
So he's a bald cave boy

1687
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
who basically

1688
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
fights dinosaurs and other different

1689
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
prehistoric-type enemies

1690
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
with his head.

1691
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
His unbreakable, invincible

1692
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
head. He basically has Luke Cage

1693
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
for a head, except

1694
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
without being that awesome.

1695
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
So he has to rescue Princess Zaa,

1696
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
who is a pink

1697
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
playasaur-type

1698
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
dinosaur lady, from King

1699
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
to Jewel, who is a Tyrannosaurus

1700
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
style. In the arcade

1701
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
version, Bonk also has

1702
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
a female version of himself

1703
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
that you can play as.

1704
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
So anyway, Bonk basically hits things

1705
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
with his head.

1706
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Bonk's health, he starts off with

1707
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
three hearts, and they can be

1708
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
depleted as he takes damage,

1709
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
and he has three extra lives.

1710
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
But he can restore

1711
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
his life by eating fruits and vegetables.

1712
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
See what they did to their kids?

1713
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
He can also get

1714
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
pieces of meat as power-ups.

1715
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
They give him different special abilities and make him stronger.

1716
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
So he gets his normal self

1717
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
for the first stage. The second stage,

1718
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
he can stun enemies by pounding on the

1719
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
ground. And the third stage, he becomes temporarily

1720
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
invulnerable. He gets

1721
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
his big meat and small meat.

1722
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
So he's an equal meat eater.

1723
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
So when the third stage of meat power

1724
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
wears off, he goes back to the second

1725
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
stage, and then he goes back to regular Bonk.

1726
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
He also can get different

1727
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
power-ups that will refill his health,

1728
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
or a large red heart that

1729
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
restores all of his health.

1730
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
There's also blue heart power-ups that

1731
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
will increase his heart health by

1732
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
one heart.

1733
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
So the game, I mean,

1734
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
it...

1735
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
The other thing about naming it PC Genjin

1736
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
is that Genjin is also Japanese

1737
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
for caveman. So...

1738
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
It works in two different ways.

1739
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
It's a fun pun, guys.

1740
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Um...

1741
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
It was

1742
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
meant to be called a From Right PC Kid.

1743
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Um...

1744
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
But they never called it

1745
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
the PC Engine in the US.

1746
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
So, um,

1747
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
and I doubt they could have called it, like,

1748
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Turbo Boy or something.

1749
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
So they called it

1750
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Bonk's Adventure. Um...

1751
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
The game has always been, um,

1752
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
Bonk's Adventure here in the US.

1753
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Um, in 2003, Hudson did

1754
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
a 3D remake of Bonk's Adventure

1755
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
in the Hudson Selection games

1756
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
that came out only in Japan on PlayStation 2

1757
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
and GameCube.

1758
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Um, but yeah, Bonk

1759
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
was basically, like, the big

1760
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
character used to

1761
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
advertise, um,

1762
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
the TurboGrafx-16 in the US

1763
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
around the mid-90s.

1764
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Um, and I do believe that

1765
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
yeah, Bonk was used as a launch title

1766
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
for a while, wasn't it?

1767
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
I want to say it was,

1768
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
because I think my buddy had a TurboGrafx-16

1769
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
and I think he had this game

1770
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
and I feel like he got them together.

1771
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And I don't know if that was just, you know, Santa brought them both, but...

1772
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
I want to say that when the TurboGrafx

1773
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
came out, it was Keith Courage

1774
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
or, um...

1775
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Might have been Keith Courage, was actually the packing game.

1776
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
But then this, I think it's like one of those things

1777
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
kind of like Sega and Sonic.

1778
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Like, once Sonic really took off, they started packing that in.

1779
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Well, but keep in mind, I think that one of the

1780
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
other big ones that kind of was used for

1781
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
advertising was Air Zonk.

1782
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Remember? Yeah, yeah, I do.

1783
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Um, which, uh,

1784
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
I mean, all really, you know, decent games.

1785
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Um, so Husband was

1786
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
uh, Husband, why am I saying Husband?

1787
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Because Dam was playing this too.

1788
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Um, Hudson

1789
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
um, was also working

1790
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
on a reboot to

1791
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
uh, call it Bonk, Brink of Extinction

1792
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
for WiiWare and PSN,

1793
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
but when, uh,

1794
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Hudson closed, uh,

1795
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
it went into limbo, um...

1796
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And who bought Hudson,

1797
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
boys and girls? Who bought Hudson?

1798
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Who's done nothing with this?

1799
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Konami! Correct!

1800
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
I just

1801
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
was, I couldn't even bring

1802
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
myself to... Their name is forbidden from

1803
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
my lips.

1804
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Unless it's old, old Konami.

1805
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Yes. Old Konami.

1806
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Sigh.

1807
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
Um, so anyway, um,

1808
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
it, uh,

1809
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
was supposed to be getting

1810
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
a Wii U Virtual Console release.

1811
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
This was announced on October 19th

1812
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
this year, but

1813
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
no one

1814
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
said anything?

1815
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
But the rating

1816
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
out there was supposed to, um, also

1817
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
indicate, uh, PS3 and PSP.

1818
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
So, that it was

1819
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
uh, supposed to be the TurboGrafx version.

1820
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Which is the better version.

1821
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
You know. But that's it.

1822
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Bonk's adventure. Here it is.

1823
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
It is on the regular Wii Virtual Console.

1824
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I have it there. It is. Because the folks in chat are talking

1825
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
about like, well, how do I play this game?

1826
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Somebody said, I didn't ever own a console that this was on.

1827
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
But I'm pretty sure it's on the regular

1828
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Wii Virtual Console, which remember, you can boot

1829
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
your Wii U into Wii mode to get that

1830
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
game. I mean, it's kind of a pain, but you can do it.

1831
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I will tell you this. If you can get your hands on the

1832
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
TurboGrafx, finding a copy

1833
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
of Bonk is not difficult.

1834
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
It's not a rare game.

1835
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Um, it's just, you know, the problem

1836
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
is finding, as they called them in the U.S.

1837
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
TurboChips, or the HuCards

1838
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
for the PC Engine, um,

1839
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
the

1840
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
uh, um, you know, you can

1841
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
get ROMs for some of

1842
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
these things. Um, there is

1843
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
I think a licensed, I think

1844
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
it's a licensed emulator, don't quote me, but

1845
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Magic Engine, which has been out for

1846
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
a while. Um, and it's

1847
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
got like full arcade card support and everything

1848
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
and will play HuCard

1849
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
um, uh, TurboChip

1850
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
games, any of them. You just like,

1851
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
though for the, the Duo games,

1852
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
you actually have to have the, the disc

1853
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
to play. But you know,

1854
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
which, as you have to say, we,

1855
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
we got our Turbo EverDrive. And the one

1856
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
thing that has actually kind of made me sad is

1857
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
that we had heard a rumor

1858
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
that it was going to let you do arcade

1859
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
card stuff so that we can

1860
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
play some of our arcade card, um,

1861
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Duo games. Like, um,

1862
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
what is the one we have?

1863
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Uh, one of the Fatal Fury games I know we have for

1864
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
uh,

1865
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
the arcade card CD. And I think our other one is Strider.

1866
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Um, for PC

1867
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Engine, uh, uh,

1868
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
arcade card games. And

1869
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
it doesn't work for that. So if that's what you're

1870
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
looking for, it's not going to work.

1871
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
So we're kind of back to

1872
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
trying to find a U.S.

1873
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
compatible version of the arcade card

1874
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
or the Duo add-on for

1875
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
the core graphics. Gotcha.

1876
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Alright. Oh well. Well there

1877
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
it is. Your classic game of the week

1878
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Bonks Adventure. A

1879
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
very, very classic Turbo graphics

1880
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
title or PC Engine, depending on what country

1881
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
you are in. On that note, we are

1882
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
going to take a quick break. Uh, take

1883
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
a moment here to stretch and refill

1884
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
our drinks here in the OLR studio. And

1885
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
so forth. When we come back though, there's

1886
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
plenty more Orange Laundry to come, including

1887
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
rapid fire news.

1888
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
The Fookle Question of the Week, which is about

1889
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
sports ball, in honor of our guest

1890
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
this week. And we're going to get to the mailbag,

1891
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
the FUs of the Week, and

1892
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
hopefully your calls, although with

1893
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
the Skype rig tonight, I don't know

1894
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
how well that's going to work. So we're going to try

1895
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
though. All we come back with more

1896
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
of Orange Lounge Radio right after

1897
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
this.

1898
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Welcome

1899
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
back everybody to Orange Lounge

1900
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Radio. Live tonight on December

1901
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
20th of 2015, with

1902
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
episode number 624

1903
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
of our show already

1904
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
in progress in the middle here

1905
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
of the holiday season. Get into full gear.

1906
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
I know a lot of folks celebrating

1907
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Christmas in the next week, so Merry Christmas

1908
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
to those that celebrate. Um, next

1909
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
week will be the last show of 2015

1910
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
if you can believe it. And I'm sure

1911
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
we'll be taking a look back on the year in gaming.

1912
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Maybe looking back at some of our favorites

1913
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
of the year and some things that weren't

1914
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
so great in the past year. We will be running

1915
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
over all of that next week on episode

1916
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
625. A nice kind of

1917
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
round number. A multiple

1918
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
of 25, I suppose, to end the

1919
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
year on. So that'll all be next week

1920
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
on the show. But let's get back into the news from

1921
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
this week with some rapid fire

1922
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
news. Loki. Hey, there's

1923
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
a new game from the people that made

1924
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Flappy Bird. It's called

1925
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Swingcopters 2. The people?

1926
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
The person. Whatever. The one

1927
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
dude. The people that play the game.

1928
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Who did not like being famous. That made it popular to

1929
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
get him to make another one.

1930
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
People. Anyways, so

1931
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
um, Don Nguyen, he

1932
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
went ahead and made a new game. It was a sequel to

1933
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
one of his previous games, Swingcopters.

1934
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
And now it's out and you can play

1935
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
it. Yay. It's free still

1936
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
and ad supported. Yeah.

1937
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Alright. And this

1938
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
is like, seriously,

1939
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
I'm surprised I'm actually seeing

1940
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
his company name. And

1941
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I guess not surprised that it's coming to the

1942
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Wii U. But apparently Napster,

1943
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
that's right, the previous

1944
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
file sharing

1945
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
music site that turned

1946
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
legit is now

1947
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
going to be coming to the Wii U as

1948
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
a free app on December 17th.

1949
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
And it also has

1950
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
a 30 day trial.

1951
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
And then you can, I

1952
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
guess there's different promotions. If you want

1953
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
to subscribe for three months, you can get

1954
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
pay a dollar. Otherwise

1955
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
it's $9.99 a month.

1956
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
No thanks.

1957
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
But I'll be coming to the Wii U

1958
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
if you want to check that out.

1959
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
And last but not least,

1960
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Mario Maker is getting some updates.

1961
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
So there's going to be some

1962
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
three elements added in a new

1963
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
free update. These include

1964
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
being able to

1965
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
have an alternate for the

1966
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
spike wheel. And so instead of the grinder,

1967
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
you can actually turn it into a

1968
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
bumper. It kind of looks like a donut

1969
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
or like an inflatable inner tube

1970
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
or something. Like a pinball bumper type of thing.

1971
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Yeah, basically something that you bump off of.

1972
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Also they've got

1973
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
doors that are activated, warp doors

1974
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
that are activated by a P-switch. And you

1975
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
can do that by shaking the door.

1976
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
Oh, like ghost houses. I didn't realize

1977
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
that was missing. I guess that's...

1978
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
I was just going to say, I can't wait for that

1979
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
level that's nothing but like Mario

1980
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
getting bumped around from start to finish.

1981
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
That's just going to be like the bounce house

1982
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
or something. Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.

1983
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Because you know that level's coming.

1984
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
And then the Koopa Clown Car is getting a

1985
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
version that shoots fire. And you can

1986
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
shoot like fireballs and then I guess

1987
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
you can charge shot and destroy

1988
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
blocks with it or something. Cool! More fire!

1989
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Yes, so that'll be coming

1990
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
December 22nd.

1991
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
And also with that, they're

1992
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
going to have a bookmark system that allows

1993
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
players to save levels from the web

1994
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
portal for later.

1995
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
That's kind of cool. Still don't know why

1996
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
they have a web portal to find levels

1997
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
instead of it having been built into the

1998
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
game like Little Big Planet. Once again,

1999
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
I just don't think they get it. I guess they're trying

2000
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
to work around it with what they got, but yeah

2001
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
I hear ya. I don't disagree.

2002
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Along with that, of course, some new costumes

2003
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
you'll be able to play as

2004
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
including Badge Arcade Bunny.

2005
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
They're going to have Mr. Saturn

2006
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
and...

2007
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Master Belch

2008
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
are going to be available.

2009
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
They are there, actually. They're already in the game.

2010
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Awesome, so check it out. Play the 8-bit

2011
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
games or 8-bit levels to

2012
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
unlock them. And then also there is

2013
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
another costume that's not part of this but

2014
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
actually leaked out already. And this

2015
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
is from a Mario Maker level

2016
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
that is on the shop right

2017
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
now that someone hacked

2018
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
and somehow got this costume

2019
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
in there. And it's actually

2020
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
the Skypop Plane from Super Mario

2021
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Land. Oh wow, that's obscure.

2022
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Yeah, so you'll be able to

2023
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
play that soon

2024
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
because apparently they already

2025
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
have the level out there

2026
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
to download. Wow.

2027
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
That's cool.

2028
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
And I'm loving that all these

2029
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
updates are free. Yes.

2030
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Thank you. Thank you, Nintendo.

2031
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
It's something you've been doing very well

2032
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
this year, so thank you.

2033
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Another game that's done very well for

2034
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Nintendo this year is Splatoon, which by the way

2035
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
did you know there was a Splatfest this weekend? Totally

2036
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
missed it. Just so many other games going on.

2037
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
But yeah, there was a Splatfest. Who won?

2038
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Act F? Who won

2039
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
the Splatfest thing? Because I probably

2040
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
would have used reverse logic

2041
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
and gone Team Nice, assuming

2042
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
everybody else would go Team Naughty.

2043
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
But maybe, I don't know who that is. Oh, Naughty 1.

2044
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
See, and I would have been fucked over again.

2045
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Alright.

2046
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Anyhow,

2047
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
so Splatoon, it's

2048
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
been a huge success since launching in

2049
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
May. It has sold over

2050
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
2.42 million copies

2051
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
worldwide, and

2052
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
it's done very well in Japan.

2053
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Apparently Nintendo announced this week

2054
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
1 million of those copies sold in

2055
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Japan, so congratulations. That's great.

2056
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Especially because Nintendo took a big risk

2057
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
on a new franchise, but a lot of

2058
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
people really love Splatoon, and

2059
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
it's been doing very well for them, so

2060
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I'm sure we have not seen

2061
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
the last of it. Also, to celebrate

2062
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
this milestone, Nintendo is

2063
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
going to hold a Squid Sisters

2064
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
concert. Splatoon

2065
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Squid Sisters Live 2016

2066
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
will take place

2067
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
at a convention center in Chiba City

2068
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
on January 30th, so

2069
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
yes, it's only for Japan, but

2070
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Splatoon kind of has a fun little

2071
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
like surf rock soundtrack that goes

2072
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
with it, so I bet that'll be a lot of fun to see

2073
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
played live, so

2074
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
I'm very curious to see what that

2075
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
turns out as. Maybe they'll,

2076
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
a lot of times these concerts get CDs

2077
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
made of them too, so I wonder if they won't end up doing

2078
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
a CD of the live concert

2079
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
later on. We'll see. But that's Splatoon.

2080
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Earlier in the show, I

2081
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
brought up Fast Racing Neo,

2082
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
and there is an update already planned for

2083
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
Fast Racing Neo from a tweet

2084
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
from Shin'en Games that actually

2085
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
created the game. They have announced that there is

2086
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
an update scheduled for January that will

2087
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
include a track mini-map

2088
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
that is not in the game right now, and I didn't mention

2089
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
this when I was talking about the game earlier. The Wii U

2090
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
gamepad, what's it used for?

2091
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Off-screen play, and that's it.

2092
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
It's not used for anything else. So maybe the track

2093
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
mini-map will be on the gamepad, who knows.

2094
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Online tags, I have not

2095
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
played the game online yet, so I guess you

2096
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
can't see people's tags online, but that will be

2097
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
fixed in January. And then they say

2098
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
stability improvements and the good old-fashioned

2099
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
various fixes.

2100
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
But that's nice to see that Fast Racing

2101
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Neo is getting that support, and

2102
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
from what I'm hearing, doing very well in the online

2103
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
store. It was the number one online game

2104
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
in the past week, so props to those

2105
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
folks. Gee, I guess people

2106
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
wanted an F-Zero-like game on the Wii U

2107
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
after all. Who knew?

2108
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Hey, look, even a story

2109
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
about Pokken Tournament, maybe just

2110
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
trying to get Dark Soccer's attention, begging for it

2111
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
here, it's going to launch alongside

2112
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
a special Wii U controller

2113
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
in Japan. When the Wii U

2114
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
version comes out on March 18th,

2115
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
there's going to be a Wii U bundle that has a

2116
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
digital copy of the game. There's going to be a wired

2117
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
controller that comes with it as well, but

2118
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
it's more, like, it looks different. It's

2119
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
kind of like a longer controller

2120
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
that, I guess,

2121
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
looks more like the arcade version.

2122
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
But anyway, it's going to be available,

2123
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
and it will also be compatible with

2124
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
the Wii U GamePad, the Wii U

2125
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Pro Controller, and the Wii

2126
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Classic Controller

2127
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
Pro. So, please look forward

2128
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
to that. Dark Soccer.

2129
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Well,

2130
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
we have some news about Nobby Nobby

2131
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Boy. Girl has

2132
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
finally reached Boy.

2133
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Girl and Boy have met up again.

2134
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
They are now completely

2135
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
joined and happy.

2136
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
So, Girl reached Pluto

2137
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
and then has looped around

2138
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
and started making her way back to Earth.

2139
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
And it took

2140
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
six years

2141
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
of people playing

2142
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Nobby Nobby Boy.

2143
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Is that all?

2144
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
That's all.

2145
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
But how many times did Boy

2146
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
eat, or,

2147
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Nobby Nobby Boy eat his own butt?

2148
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:10,000
That's a valid question, Dark Soccer.

2149
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
I played Nobby Nobby Boy

2150
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
on my phone for, like, ages.

2151
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I mean, you used to see,

2152
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I kept posting on Facebook,

2153
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
that I would give Boy and Girl

2154
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
all the love that I could.

2155
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Do you know that that's what

2156
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Dan and I call each other?

2157
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
Even before the game came out.

2158
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Like, when I give him

2159
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
cards, it's

2160
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
to Boy from Girl.

2161
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
Aww.

2162
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
You know what?

2163
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
They made treatments for Hairballs, Rob.

2164
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
So, the Final Fantasy 7

2165
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
remake group, they're getting some help

2166
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
from the Kingdom Hearts team, too.

2167
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
So, they are

2168
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
going to be doing

2169
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
a lot more development

2170
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
in it, too, where you can actually fully

2171
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
explore Midgar.

2172
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
So, the multi-part

2173
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
thing isn't going to affect

2174
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
your ability to go around the game.

2175
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
You get more attention on

2176
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Biggs Wedge and Jesse.

2177
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
And, uh,

2178
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
a lot more neat stuff on them.

2179
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
And they're trying to bring back the voice cast

2180
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
from Advent Children.

2181
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Nice. Also,

2182
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Cloud's hallucinations are supposed to be more meaningful.

2183
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
I wonder if he's going to mention Xenogears.

2184
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Like he did

2185
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
in the original. Anything is possible.

2186
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Um,

2187
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
and then, uh,

2188
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
sort of a last but not least,

2189
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Kurt Schilling, we know him, right?

2190
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Baseball guy?

2191
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
38 Studios founder? Yes.

2192
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Well, um, he's like, I'm not going to say

2193
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
anything else about this. I'm done.

2194
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
So, unless they subpoena him,

2195
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
that's it.

2196
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
Then, uh, he says,

2197
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I have not been served anything by anyone.

2198
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
There is not a person on this planet

2199
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
with even a smidgen of knowledge

2200
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
about the law who would say anything, but

2201
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
we all know he shouldn't testify

2202
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
while there is a bogus and incredibly wasteful

2203
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
civil suit still hanging around.

2204
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
So,

2205
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
and honestly enough, I mean,

2206
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
I don't know if it was

2207
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
exactly all his fault, but I think he's just

2208
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
done. I would be done too.

2209
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
I have a feeling he's kind of done with

2210
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
games for a long while.

2211
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Which was sad, because the guy himself,

2212
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
as he is, had a real passion

2213
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
for it. He did really love games.

2214
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
And got way burnt by the whole thing, so.

2215
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Yeah.

2216
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
So, sad face. I guess that's too bad.

2217
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
Alright, well, uh,

2218
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
but also I want to read this comment from our chatroom over at

2219
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
live.vognetwork.com.

2220
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Sj100matt commenting on Kurt Schilling saying,

2221
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
he's put his foot in his mouth too much lately. He's about

2222
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
to lose his job at ESPN. Ouch.

2223
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
And, uh, Bobby Blackwolf

2224
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
talking about Kingdom Hearts saying,

2225
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Kingdom Hearts team needs to work on Kingdom Hearts

2226
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
and not Final Fantasy. Uh,

2227
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
yeah, I think there's a lot of people that kind of feel

2228
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
that way. My assumption is that Kingdom Hearts

2229
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
might be at a point in development

2230
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
where some people can be shifted.

2231
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
Like, you know how some things are done

2232
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
early on in the process and that maybe

2233
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Final Fantasy VII Remake needs help with that part.

2234
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I don't know. We'll see.

2235
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
No. So, hopefully

2236
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
that's it. I can't see that they're actually

2237
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
taking resources from Kingdom Hearts. I mean,

2238
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
it's not like when they had to fix

2239
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
Final Fantasy XIV and things got

2240
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
really quiet at Square for a while

2241
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
before the Final Fantasy

2242
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
XIV Realm Reborn came out.

2243
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I don't think it's like that, but we'll see.

2244
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Alright, let's go to the FUGL

2245
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
question of the week.

2246
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Every week we go to our Facebook

2247
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
and our Google Plus communities.

2248
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
We ask a question

2249
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:38,000
and we get some answers.

2250
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
And this week we wanted to ask about

2251
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
sports ball. Because, you know,

2252
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
we did have Rick from

2253
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Tipping Goat Games who was here earlier

2254
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
and we wanted to talk about

2255
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
sports games. So our question this week

2256
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
is, do you prefer

2257
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
the simplicity of a

2258
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
retro style sports game

2259
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
or do you prefer the complexity

2260
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
of the modern style sports

2261
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
games? Why did you answer

2262
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
the way you did? So let's get to

2263
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
some of the answers over on Facebook.

2264
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Retertainment saying, the NBA

2265
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
street games were pretty dope until they

2266
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
started adding in the overly complicated

2267
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
game breakers that required

2268
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
four or five simultaneous button

2269
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
presses to pull off. So I'm going

2270
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
with simplicity. Tiger

2271
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Claw says, I prefer sports games with

2272
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
simplistic control. Games like

2273
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
NBA Jam is more fun for casual

2274
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
players since you don't have complicated

2275
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
controls. One button is passing

2276
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
the other for shooting. Any sports games

2277
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
that everyone can play makes for

2278
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
a good party game.

2279
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Andy R said, I don't play many sports games

2280
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
but the ones I have were the retro simple ones.

2281
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
So I guess those.

2282
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Hitstun says, I like old arcade

2283
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
style sports games more. Not because

2284
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
they're simple but because they're fast.

2285
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Modern sports games are

2286
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
accurate even to the boring parts.

2287
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Games like RBA Baseball, NBA

2288
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Jam, and NFL Blitz have

2289
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
better pacing than real life sports

2290
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
and that makes them better games.

2291
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
SSG100Matt says, to answer your question

2292
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
yes. To tell you the truth

2293
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
I have a place in my heart for both

2294
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
complex and retro or simplistic

2295
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
style sports games. I love

2296
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
playing, managing with real world characters.

2297
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
The professional athletes themselves

2298
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
and learning different strategies and skills

2299
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
to compete against certain defenses and offenses.

2300
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I also love playing the really simple

2301
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
and sometimes over the top sports games

2302
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
that are scaled down to the essence of why

2303
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
people enjoy sports.

2304
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Scoring, hitting, dunking, shooting, throwing

2305
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
passing, kicking, punching, etc.

2306
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Dartetsuya says, the

2307
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
realistic or simulation style

2308
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
stats stuff doesn't appeal to me

2309
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
as much as the fast paced arcade style

2310
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
sports game. Blitz, NBA Jam

2311
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
and so on. I suppose

2312
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
it's that I'm more a casual sports

2313
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
fan than a hardcore one.

2314
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
And lastly on Facebook, Jim Sally

2315
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
our buddy Jim Sally

2316
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
with his train says, when I play

2317
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
sports games I want the controls to be as

2318
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
simple as punching my buddy in the arm

2319
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
while he's sitting next to me.

2320
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
If you want to play some complex hockey, buy a hockey

2321
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
stick and a cooper ball and start

2322
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
playing for real. Best thing is the

2323
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
3D graphics in real life are

2324
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
almost as good as the new Xbox.

2325
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
But I like the way

2326
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
that's phrased, only almost.

2327
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
And going to Google Plus

2328
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
we have no answers on

2329
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Google Plus this week. Now

2330
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
look, I know we all joke about Google Plus

2331
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
being dead, but usually there's a few

2332
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
of you that are loyal over on Google Plus, so

2333
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I don't know what's going on. I've used Google Plus

2334
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
more now than... Yeah, ever since

2335
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Ingress started, right?

2336
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
I technically haven't posted anything

2337
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
on Google Plus, let's be clear.

2338
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
The hangouts. The hangouts, yes.

2339
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
So yeah, there you go.

2340
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Nothing on Google Plus this week, so

2341
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
there you go. Alright.

2342
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
So we're going to get back into some

2343
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
news. But Dark Soccer,

2344
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
you're on your way out, right? You had to take off a little early?

2345
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Yeah, I told the hubby a little bit later

2346
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
than this, but he says he's here now.

2347
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
So I guess

2348
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
I'm out.

2349
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Because I didn't drive here

2350
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
today. Dan dropped me off. We went to

2351
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
see Star Wars today. So

2352
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
yeah, he dropped

2353
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
me off because also my tires

2354
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
are a little bit unsafe.

2355
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Just a little bit. I mean, I don't think

2356
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
it would have really been too bad for me to drive

2357
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
on, but at the same time, it was

2358
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
we were just going to be careful, so

2359
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
especially with the rain. So I guess

2360
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
I'm gone. Alright, okay, well that's okay.

2361
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Did you want to tell us really quick that story you had

2362
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
coming up here? We'll do things a little out of order.

2363
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I just closed everything. Alright.

2364
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
Sorry. I got it. Alright,

2365
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Logie's got it. And

2366
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
some folks in chat are saying,

2367
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Dan on the show, Dan on the show, they got places

2368
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
to be. Sadly, they're on their way out.

2369
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
But

2370
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
thank you for being here tonight Dark Soccer

2371
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
and we'll see you next week.

2372
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Have a good holiday week. We will do

2373
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Cheesecake. Oh my god, stop it computer.

2374
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Your computer's

2375
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
giving you a little taste of what the show computer

2376
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
was giving me earlier. Alright.

2377
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Alright, well Logie and I will hold down the fort here

2378
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
with our remaining news stories. So let's get to it.

2379
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Logie. So this is kind of cool.

2380
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
So you know that whole

2381
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Retron console that was supposed to be

2382
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
coming out, the one that was going to be based off

2383
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
of like cartridges and it would

2384
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
play like 18 or 8 to

2385
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
32-bit style games. The Retro

2386
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Magazine people were doing it, right? Yeah, yeah.

2387
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
That console. So anyways, now

2388
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
they've got support. Now it's no longer

2389
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
going to be the Retron video game system,

2390
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
but it's now, they've been

2391
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
backed by ColecoVision.

2392
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
You remember Coleco?

2393
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Shit, that's like, that was like my first game

2394
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
system back in the 80s. You know, they haven't been around forever.

2395
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
But now they have a brand new system

2396
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
coming out called the

2397
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
ColecoVision, or the

2398
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Coleco Chameleon.

2399
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
A quick thought on your way out there.

2400
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I'm sorry, I'm putting on my shoes right now.

2401
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I actually still have my

2402
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
ColecoVision from when I was a kid.

2403
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
And another ColecoVision. I wonder if it'll

2404
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
have old school Coleco games built in.

2405
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
It makes sense because those Flashback consoles. We finally get the

2406
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
expansion module number 3.

2407
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I almost bought the

2408
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Coleco Flashback today. They have them on

2409
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
they're closing them out out of

2410
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Target. Or

2411
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Walmart actually. They're closing them

2412
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
out there. And I really want the

2413
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Atari one for some reason. They've got that in the

2414
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Intellivision one.

2415
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
But anyways, yeah.

2416
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
So that's pretty cool. And then of course

2417
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
this is supposed to be launching in 2016.

2418
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I'm

2419
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
curious to see how well it does.

2420
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
I'm kind of skeptical

2421
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
because

2422
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Well, I mean when they first announced

2423
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
this I was like, I think it's

2424
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
really awesome what they're doing. I think it's

2425
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
extremely niche and I'm not sure how

2426
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
they're going to make money on it. But

2427
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
now that they have the backing of Coleco

2428
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I kind of feel like that's going to maybe put it in more

2429
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
stores and it's going to make it more visible.

2430
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
So I kind of think it has a way better

2431
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
shot now than maybe. I mean and again

2432
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
I don't mean to poo-poo it and say

2433
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
it's never going to succeed. But I just

2434
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
feel like it was a really steep climb and this is

2435
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
going to really help give them that visibility

2436
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
that it needs. The controller looks interesting because it looks

2437
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
like a Wii U

2438
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
gamepad. Like the Wii U Pro

2439
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
gamepad. Not the

2440
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
screen or anything.

2441
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
It's identical

2442
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
to one of those gamepads.

2443
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
And then the middle portion

2444
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
it's basically the

2445
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Super NES controller.

2446
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I just think it's going to be weird when we see

2447
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
games out there. Like the retro-tastic

2448
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
games and it's like going to be coming out

2449
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
soon on Playstation 4, Xbox One

2450
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
and Coleco.

2451
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
What?

2452
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
I hope so as well but like I just

2453
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
don't know because like now if you want

2454
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
those retro games you can still get them on other platforms.

2455
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
It's not like this is the only way to

2456
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
get that fixed. Yeah they're going to have to have some

2457
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
exclusives or it's going to

2458
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
yeah I get that. Like I don't need the

2459
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
no I'm not going to buy a console for

2460
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
Shovel Knight when Shovel Knight's out on like a

2461
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
billion platforms right now. Yeah no I hear it.

2462
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
I hear it. Like several

2463
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
platforms.

2464
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Alright well I'm very curious

2465
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
to see how that progresses. Again I think that's really

2466
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
good news for that and it's going to bump it a little

2467
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
bit out of something that otherwise would have been extremely

2468
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
niche. Well let's

2469
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
move on and talk about another Wii U

2470
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
game this week. There's a lot of Wii U stuff in the news

2471
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
this week. Did you know that a new Wii U

2472
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
game actually came out this week?

2473
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
This last Friday called Devil's Third.

2474
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I actually think it wasn't, I think that was the Friday

2475
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
before where we're at now.

2476
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Yeah it was Itagaki's game.

2477
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
That's right. Itagaki had put this game together for Wii U

2478
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
and I remember it kind of like... It was supposed to be a

2479
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
THQ game and then like that's...

2480
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
kind of disappeared but now it's out.

2481
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Well apparently the game is

2482
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
really hard to find.

2483
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Apparently Best Buy

2484
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
had no copies in stock in an entire

2485
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
district and GameStop

2486
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
very few copies. GameStop

2487
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
apparently told this reporter

2488
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
that there was only

2489
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
420 copies of the game

2490
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
for sale in the entire

2491
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
country. What?

2492
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Is that like only for the dot

2493
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
com? Or is that like each store

2494
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
got one copy of the game?

2495
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
And that's not even each store.

2496
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
That's like big stores got one copy

2497
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
of the game. That's crazy. Is that a pre-order?

2498
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I know right? I hear the game wasn't very good

2499
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
but I mean that's

2500
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
I guess that's fine. It makes sense

2501
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
that there's only that many physical copies.

2502
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
It is available digitally

2503
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
so that's not a big deal. But people are

2504
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
snatching the shit up like it's a fucking collector's

2505
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
item. Yeah. And it's turning around

2506
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
and showing up on eBay right? It's a fucking

2507
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
it's a pretty shitty game

2508
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
so I don't know. Yeah.

2509
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I guess everyone wants to make a buck.

2510
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
William Murderface in chat says apparently

2511
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
it's really bad. Dungeon Buster

2512
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
saying the Europeans got it months ago and

2513
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
pretty much panned it. What meme

2514
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
is asking is it a full $60 game?

2515
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Unfortunately the answer is yes. 50. I think.

2516
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Or 50. 50 dollars.

2517
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Brad from Pod Culture in Act Deft mentioning

2518
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
the 420 there. 420

2519
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
blaze it! Which actually

2520
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
you know as much as you kind of joke

2521
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
sometimes people put news stories

2522
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
out there that are intentionally false

2523
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
to see how far they'll travel.

2524
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
420 that is an odd coincidence

2525
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
of a number to put in a story so

2526
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
maybe a little bit of salt with that but

2527
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
I think it really

2528
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
is fact to say the game is fucking

2529
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
hard to find. Whether it was 420

2530
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
or 600 or 12

2531
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
it's not an easy game to find.

2532
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
To be fair it is plausible

2533
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
because the reason for that is they manufactured

2534
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
those discs in lots of 30

2535
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
and so 420

2536
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
is divisible by 30 so

2537
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Oh look at you bringing science into this!

2538
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I mean there's that.

2539
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
I had no idea they did it in lots of 30.

2540
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Yeah it's cases of 30

2541
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
for like disc games usually

2542
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
so Wii U

2543
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Okay. Well I learned something today.

2544
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
24 for PlayStation

2545
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
because the discs

2546
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
are different. I don't know why

2547
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
it's only 24 but usually 24

2548
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
for like PlayStation 3

2549
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
I think now when everything is on Blu-ray it's all 30

2550
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
but most of the time

2551
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
it's 30. DungeonBuster

2552
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
in chat over at live.vognetwork.com

2553
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
saying Loki laying down the industry knowledge

2554
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
yeah I got to admit I'm pretty impressed.

2555
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
But then again 420 could also be

2556
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
completely made up so I mean

2557
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
it's plausible. It's not a lot

2558
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
and I kind of would wonder

2559
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
what the minimum runs are on those things because

2560
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
normally they have to sell

2561
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
so many in order to make it worthwhile

2562
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
and usually

2563
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
they have to run more than I think

2564
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
420 copies. Yeah unless

2565
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Nintendo just straight up took a loss on this

2566
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
but the game is available in the digital

2567
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
store right? You can get it on

2568
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
the store if you really want to pay the full money.

2569
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
I just think I don't remember what their minimums are because

2570
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
I just know from like

2571
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
you know like

2572
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
there was a 3DS title that someone had made

2573
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
or DS title that was like some

2574
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
simulation game and they independently

2575
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
had it printed and it was like

2576
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
they had to make like 8000 copies or something of it

2577
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
like some ridiculous amount

2578
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
so if you have to make 8000 copies of that

2579
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
you know you probably

2580
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
have to make more than 420 copies

2581
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
I have a feeling

2582
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I have a feeling someone's already written it off as a loss

2583
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Well I'm just saying because like why even

2584
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
make a physical disc if you're going to only print

2585
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
that many copies you would think that they would

2586
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
make at least a few thousand

2587
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I don't know. Maybe they have to for like tax

2588
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
reasons or something crazy I mean

2589
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
admittedly I'm talking out my ass a little bit

2590
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
but it would make sense.

2591
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Or they just

2592
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
they had trouble getting it through customs

2593
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
damn those customs

2594
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
It's just

2595
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
it's terrible. Hey that's

2596
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
a pretty smart move though. Hey let's

2597
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
make only these make copies and make it crazy

2598
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
that people want it and

2599
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
have to get it and now

2600
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
they're selling all those

2601
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
copies. I don't know.

2602
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Whatever. Alright. Well let's move on with some

2603
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
more stories. What else you got for us?

2604
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Alright. Actually I think

2605
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
that would be you.

2606
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
With the Devil's Third Story? I just did that.

2607
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Oh that's right. Oh we're talking about

2608
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Jamie. Sorry about that.

2609
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
Okay so

2610
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
there's apparently

2611
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
this is kind of interesting so

2612
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Good Game Studios they're

2613
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
accused of busting

2614
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
a union that was being

2615
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
created by

2616
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
their former employees

2617
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
and so

2618
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
I guess allegedly they were

2619
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
let's see here

2620
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
20 employees were involved

2621
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
with establishing a workers

2622
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
council and then

2623
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
the company laid off

2624
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
that council earlier

2625
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
this year and so they

2626
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
kind of were brought up against allegations

2627
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
and

2628
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
I don't know it's they're denying

2629
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
that they did anything wrong but it's kind

2630
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
of like that's kind of weird that you would lay

2631
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
all those people off after they did

2632
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
this. Well there's a lot of people talking about

2633
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
how difficult and demanding

2634
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
the industry can be sometimes. I mean you really

2635
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
have to love video games because

2636
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
especially during you know some real

2637
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
crunch periods you know people

2638
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
work these crazy long days

2639
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
and I'm sure you all have heard of this

2640
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
you know coming out of the EA and some of the stuff here. Now

2641
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
this studio if I'm not mistaken they're in Germany

2642
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
so I mean now it has

2643
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
that complexity of you know I know

2644
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
what the laws are like here in America but I don't know what it's like in Germany.

2645
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
It's hard to say is it because of the union that they

2646
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
were laid off or is it because of the

2647
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
development cycle that they were laid off? Yeah.

2648
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Yeah and who knows so there's a lot of those questions

2649
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
to answer but I think I think it definitely goes to show

2650
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
that there's some people that get so

2651
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
frustrated maybe with some of the

2652
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
the because sometimes

2653
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
these crimes and I'm saying sometimes

2654
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
sometimes these crunch periods are a result

2655
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
of bad decisions right

2656
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
bad decision is made up top and that

2657
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
trickles down and everybody else has to pay for it

2658
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
right. Yeah. So that's why sometimes these

2659
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
these unions and things are are being

2660
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
formed is to kind of like I guess make

2661
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
those higher up a little more accountable

2662
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
for the decisions they make and the trickle that

2663
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
that could have but again you

2664
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
throw the international complexity into it I'm not

2665
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
really sure how that all works out but

2666
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
very interesting.

2667
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Alright. Do you want to talk about

2668
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Minecraft as well before we get to

2669
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Sure. So Minecraft got a

2670
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
console update and they're saying it's the

2671
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
biggest one yet. Brings the game up to version

2672
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
1.88 and

2673
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
adds a bunch of new things new biomes

2674
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
including Mesa, Mega, Tiaga

2675
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Roofed Forest, Birch Forest

2676
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
Savannah, Extreme Hills

2677
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
plus Deep Ocean

2678
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
and Snowless

2679
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Tyga and

2680
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
see there's new mobs including the endermite

2681
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
guardian, elder guardian

2682
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
rabbits and chicken jockeys

2683
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
like

2684
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I seriously

2685
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I was looking through my son's

2686
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
book he has a Minecraft book that talks about like

2687
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
some of the enemies and I'm like I don't know who the fuck

2688
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
these characters are like this wasn't

2689
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
when I was playing so

2690
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
go back to the PC version

2691
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
other things, new blocks

2692
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
including granite, packed ice, red

2693
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
sandstone, diorite

2694
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
prismarine

2695
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
also you can catch treasure while fishing

2696
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
the buttons can be placed

2697
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
on top of or on the tops and bottoms

2698
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
of blocks

2699
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
skeletons flee from wolves

2700
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
and spiders no longer see through solid blocks

2701
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
and that's coming to PlayStation

2702
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Xbox players

2703
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
no Wii U update yet

2704
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
of course

2705
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
alright well

2706
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I guess I'll have to jump back in

2707
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
I have the PlayStation version

2708
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
of Minecraft so I'll check that out

2709
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
we should do that again cause I like kinda

2710
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
I keep talking to my son about like how we used to play

2711
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
on the server and stuff and it

2712
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
you know it's a lot more funny when you have more people playing

2713
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
it is, it is

2714
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
do you have it on PlayStation 4? we could just do a little

2715
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
I do have it on PlayStation 4

2716
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I have it on PlayStation 4

2717
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
and on Wii U

2718
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
and Xbox 360

2719
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
and Windows 10

2720
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
my phone on

2721
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
my iPod

2722
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
yeah pretty much everywhere

2723
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
oh and I thought I was bad at buying the same game

2724
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
multiple places

2725
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
your Minecraft collection puts my

2726
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Mass Effect 3 collection to shame

2727
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
alright well Valve

2728
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
a lot of people rumbling about

2729
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
the upcoming Steam sale right

2730
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
seems like it's inevitable we got a winter sale coming

2731
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
pretty soon and you know a lot

2732
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
of people usually praise Steam and all that they

2733
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
do but interesting

2734
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Steam's taken a few hits this year

2735
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
and another one on its way is that Valve

2736
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
is being sued in the country of

2737
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
France not here in the States

2738
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
but still we like to cover news everywhere

2739
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
and that is they're being sued

2740
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
in France by and I'm gonna horribly

2741
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
mispronounce this name I'm sorry it's

2742
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
UFC K

2743
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
I have no idea how to

2744
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
pronounce that I'm sorry because I do not speak

2745
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
French but that is a French Consumer

2746
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Association that's what you need to know it's French

2747
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Consumer Association and they put

2748
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
out a new letter and said that the

2749
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Steam subscriber agreement contains

2750
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
clauses which are detrimental

2751
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
to consumer interests

2752
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
apparently

2753
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
it all comes down to the fact that users

2754
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
cannot resell their digital

2755
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
games and that's something that French

2756
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
law allows for and we've talked about this

2757
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
on the show before is that whole controversy

2758
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
about being able to sell a

2759
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
digital game and what's interesting is that

2760
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
the Steam storefront is kind

2761
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
of set up for that right like because you

2762
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
can put games in your inventory

2763
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
but the used thing

2764
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
you can't really do it you can do it with a new

2765
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
game that you haven't installed and played yet but you can't

2766
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
really do it with a used game and I guess the

2767
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
French Association taking

2768
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
some issue with that also

2769
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
though it isn't just limited to that

2770
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
some other things cited is that Valve does

2771
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
not assume responsibility

2772
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
in cases where accounts get hacked

2773
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
and users personal information gets

2774
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
stolen and

2775
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
that is also can be said

2776
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
for how the company claims ownership

2777
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
of any user created

2778
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
content that is uploaded to Steam

2779
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
now apparently

2780
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Valve they use Luxembourg's

2781
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
consumer law in all countries

2782
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
it operates in so that way

2783
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
they don't take into account each countries different

2784
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
rules but it should be noted

2785
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
that Valve was already sued once

2786
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
in a German court by a German

2787
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
consumer group a couple years ago

2788
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
probably when some of these stories first came up

2789
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
about the whole used games digital stuff

2790
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Valve actually won that case

2791
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
but that was in 2014 and this

2792
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
is another country so

2793
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
we'll see what happens with that

2794
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
that could really change things

2795
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
if folks are able to resell

2796
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
their digital games I mean

2797
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
all of a sudden your library man

2798
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
people are going to be unloading games in their library

2799
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
for like 25 cents a pop

2800
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
I mean

2801
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
it's going to be very interesting

2802
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
I don't know

2803
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
I've always hesitated buying

2804
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
digital games I mean

2805
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
it's one thing on Steam when they

2806
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
unload games for you know

2807
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
99 cents or like

2808
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
$3.99 for a little game

2809
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
it makes it very easy to buy that digitally

2810
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
because whatever equity you feel like

2811
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
you'd have in that game would be literally dollars and cents

2812
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
but it's a little harder sometimes

2813
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
to spend $60

2814
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
on a game you're not sure about

2815
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
digitally because you know you're going to get

2816
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
stuck with that game if you don't really like

2817
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
it but if you have it on disc you can at least

2818
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
resell it your game has some equity it has some

2819
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
value in it it'll be very interesting to see

2820
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
how that could really change the market

2821
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
I worry for

2822
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
smaller indie developers that really

2823
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
rely on Steam that might

2824
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
not have the best effect

2825
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
yeah it's going to be kind of hard to do that

2826
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
yeah so I kind of worry for them

2827
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
but I definitely get people's

2828
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
frustration with the AAA side of things

2829
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
like what was it Batman

2830
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Arkham Knight right

2831
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
was a shit show on Steam

2832
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
and you know they kind of had to eat a lot

2833
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
of crap for it and they were charging what $60

2834
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
for that right so if people wanted to get

2835
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
rid of that there's a part of me

2836
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
that kind of thinks they should well Steam

2837
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
did enact that whole

2838
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
refund thing I think to

2839
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
try to account for some of that but I don't know

2840
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
I feel a little differently when it comes to a

2841
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
big big Warner Brothers $60 game

2842
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
like that and then like you know

2843
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
for example's sake the game we were talking about

2844
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
earlier tonight Super Slam Dunk Touchdown

2845
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
you know I don't know if I feel like

2846
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
you know we heard it's one guy

2847
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
that's doing most of this I mean you get some

2848
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
contract help and so forth that I would kind of

2849
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
feel bad if maybe the value of his game

2850
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
gets undercut by this

2851
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
all of a sudden emerging used game

2852
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
market right yeah so

2853
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
it'll be really interesting to see how this

2854
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
plays out I don't know so

2855
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
alright but I'm not a lawyer

2856
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
so I don't know at the end of the day

2857
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
we're going to get to the mailbag you guys it's time

2858
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000

participate at orange lounge

2864
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
radio dot com

2865
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I'm logging into the mailbag now because usually

2866
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Dark Soccer will dive into the mailbag

2867
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
and read some mail for you guys but

2868
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
as you all heard a minute ago she had to leave

2869
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
early so it's just me

2870
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
tonight so I'm going to get to the emails

2871
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
we have three of them tonight starting off

2872
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
with this one this is from Robert M

2873
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
who says

2874
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
here's two quick questions and a longer

2875
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:39,000
hopefully cool thing from Halloween

2876
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:41,000
yes the email is from this week

2877
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,000
first I don't know if the comic story line

2878
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:45,000
will affect Captain America Civil War

2879
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
and the MCU Marvel

2880
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Cinematic Universe but if Falcon

2881
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
takes over the role of Captain from Rogers

2882
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,000
will he be Captain Fal

2883
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
no that's a dumb question actually

2884
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:57,000
can Captain America fly now or did that not

2885
02:25:57,000 --> 02:25:59,000
happen in Ultimate Marvel

2886
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
I do not follow

2887
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
comics at all I

2888
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
hate to say it by the way I really

2889
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
want a comic show on VOG Network I'm just putting it out

2890
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
there I've been wanting one for years so if you

2891
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
know a long running show that's interested in joining

2892
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
up with some of us I would

2893
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
love that because this is where I would ask them

2894
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
help because I have no idea

2895
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
John picks up a lot of that slack

2896
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
so does Brad from Pod Culture but

2897
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
I would love some comic experts in here

2898
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Loki do you follow any of that stuff

2899
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
no

2900
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Brad from Pod Culture

2901
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
is filling in a little bit here saying Falcon became

2902
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Captain and flies so that's

2903
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
how that works and I do know from what I

2904
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
remember in the new movie trailer you do see

2905
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Falcon in it so who knows where the Marvel Cinematic

2906
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Universe will go with that anyhow

2907
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
second have any

2908
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
of you including Bobby gotten to

2909
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
see the Gear VR yet sorry if

2910
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
that was already discussed well funny enough

2911
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Jamie talked about her experiences earlier in the

2912
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
show Bobby owns one

2913
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I know that because he's the one that showed

2914
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
the Gear VR to me and so yeah

2915
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
I've used Gear VR funny

2916
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
enough I didn't play any games in Gear VR

2917
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
the stuff I saw was like experiences

2918
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
I saw like a Cirque du Soleil thing

2919
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
and like a Paul McCartney concert and I know

2920
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
I've talked about this on the show before you'll

2921
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
want to go back to February

2922
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
of this year when I was at PAX East

2923
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
that was the

2924
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
week I got to play the Gear VR

2925
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Loki did you end up getting one of these?

2926
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
I haven't bought one though because it's

2927
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
$100 and I don't use my

2928
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Oculus well I didn't use my

2929
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Oculus because it runs like shit on my laptop

2930
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
which is fine because it's not meant to

2931
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
run on my laptop

2932
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
I haven't had the money to

2933
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
build a new computer yet to run the Oculus

2934
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
and then of course I'll probably just buy the actual

2935
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
retail one but my phone's nice

2936
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
and should be able to run well it does

2937
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
run the Gear VR stuff so I just

2938
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
maybe eventually

2939
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
I don't know I have to see

2940
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
what they have on it and like maybe if I

2941
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
develop stuff for it that's a

2942
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
ways away so I'm holding out

2943
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
right now

2944
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
and let's see going

2945
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
to the last little bit of the

2946
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
email here from Robert M and

2947
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
finally I thought I'd share two months

2948
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
after slapping this together

2949
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
I built a nearly two foot

2950
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
tall figure for Halloween using

2951
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Lego's Hero Factory or

2952
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Bionicle building system

2953
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
I figured I wanted to try building a large scale

2954
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
character since I would certainly

2955
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
give it a cartoon animal design

2956
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
and I was sure the holo

2957
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
disproportionate robotic thing would

2958
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
invite the obvious comparisons I just went

2959
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
ahead and ran with it building for my

2960
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
parts bins in maybe two hours total

2961
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
in the end my brother didn't let me bring it to his

2962
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
house for his party fearing his three year old

2963
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
would tear it apart I considered building the

2964
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
white one for that reason it doesn't look

2965
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
that much like the in game model but it's effective

2966
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
for what it is and it actually stands

2967
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
up by itself although it's too top heavy

2968
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
for say a running pose

2969
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
now Robert M doesn't name what it is

2970
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
here in the email but he attached some pictures

2971
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
and you can actually see it's one of the

2972
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
characters from Five Nights at Freddy's I believe this is

2973
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Foxy this is the guy that's behind the curtain

2974
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
there it's definitely yeah it's definitely the red Foxy

2975
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
character there it looks like an

2976
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
like a

2977
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
cyborg version of that and the

2978
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
way the eye hangs out is really

2979
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
creepy and yeah I would not want to see that in Five

2980
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Nights at Freddy's or really probably real

2981
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
life so well done if you were going

2982
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
for scary so

2983
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
anyhow Robert M

2984
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
signs the email and then concludes saying

2985
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
PS do you have the public photo

2986
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
pool for OLR active

2987
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
no Robert we actually took that down on the old

2988
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
website a few years ago it was being abused

2989
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
and we didn't have a way to really effectively

2990
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
screen the photos that were going

2991
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
through there and it wasn't really

2992
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
emails like this are so few

2993
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
and far between that unfortunately it wasn't really enhancing

2994
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
the experience I think Twitter

2995
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
kind of took over now people just share their

2996
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
stuff on Twitter and we can kind of retweet

2997
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
and so forth so unfortunately the photo archive

2998
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
kind of kind of met its maker there

2999
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
but the old

3000
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
website in general is really in need

3001
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
of a boost and Jason and I

3002
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
have talked about that we really need to draw Dekeman

3003
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
into that too and see what we can come up

3004
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
with in the new year but we are

3005
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
it's kind of tricky where I'm at because

3006
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
at the same time I really want to make sure VOG

3007
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
has a lot of stuff and obviously

3008
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
we could always use more content for VOG so

3009
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
a lot of my focus kind of goes over there

3010
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
so Orangeloungeradio.com kind of becomes

3011
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
that's the place where the podcast

3012
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
is hosted and it works

3013
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
so don't upgrade the Skype version

3014
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:19,000
over there so it doesn't break so

3015
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
anyhow

3016
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:23,000
there it is that's our email

3017
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
tonight from Robert M let's go to the next email

3018
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:27,000
here from Raginator

3019
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:29,000
who's been emailing us an awful lot because as you know

3020
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:31,000
he can't participate live with the show

3021
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:33,000
if you've been following his emails

3022
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:35,000
so let's get on to the

3023
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
next and DarkTitsu is saying I know

3024
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Dekeman's got a lot of family stuff going on so there's

3025
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
that oh yeah obviously and that stuff comes from

3026
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
please I don't I don't make

3027
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
money doing OLR so I can't pay people

3028
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
so yeah I am beggars

3029
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
can't be choosers I can only take help when

3030
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
people are able to help but I appreciate all help

3031
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
moving

3032
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
on to Raginator's email hi everyone it's

3033
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Raginator again as per usual I'm writing

3034
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
in I have two topics for you the first is short

3035
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
but the second is a little long so I apologize

3036
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
for those that haven't noticed yet Humble Bundle

3037
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
is having a Neo Geo bundle going

3038
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
on thank you for reminding me I do have to get

3039
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
it by the time OLR airs and this

3040
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
email is read there'll be about a day and a half to two days

3041
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
left to jump on it but nonetheless I want to

3042
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
pass along the info all in all

3043
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
there's 25 or so games in the bundle which

3044
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
a few of them can be redeemed on Steam

3045
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
the rest are DRM free there's a few

3046
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
noteworthy games in there amongst them are Samurai

3047
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Showdown 2 and 5, Art of Fighting

3048
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
2, 2 or 3 King of Fighter games

3049
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
and Metal Slug

3050
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
1 through 3 and X

3051
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
in my opinion it's a good deal

3052
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
even for the Samurai Showdown games

3053
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
alone seeing as they're not on Steam

3054
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
so yes that is a

3055
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
good FYI because we missed

3056
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
last week's show and a chance to bring that up

3057
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
but it's just running in an emulator you're buying ROMs

3058
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
basically you are buying ROMs but at least

3059
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
you're doing it legally right and some of it's on

3060
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Steam so you have all that built

3061
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
in or whatever is there achievements or

3062
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
no? Not in the ROMs

3063
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
obviously but there's

3064
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
looks like the ones on Steam would be

3065
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Metal Slug 1 and 3

3066
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
and then they also have the King

3067
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
of Fighters 98 Ultimate

3068
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Match Final Edition

3069
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
and...

3070
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Is Fatal Fury Special in there?

3071
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
That's one of my very favorites Metal Slug X and the King

3072
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match

3073
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Fatal Fury Special you said?

3074
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Yeah that's my

3075
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
favorite

3076
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
Fatal Fury Special is one of the

3077
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
DRM free ones

3078
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Alright

3079
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
Act Deft in our chat room

3080
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
talking about there's some controversy there

3081
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
about the ROMs and the emulator that .EMU

3082
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
uses for the games he says he might call in about that

3083
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
later I am behind

3084
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
on this news if that

3085
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
all must come up while I was out of town so I'm very curious

3086
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
to hear what's going on there I did hear

3087
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
it didn't come up on tonight's show but I did hear something

3088
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
and maybe somebody in chat or

3089
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Loki even maybe you know about this

3090
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
remember a couple weeks ago we were talking about the whole

3091
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Bubsy coming back in the 1 and 2

3092
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Yeah that's basically S.N.E.X

3093
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Oh my god yeah I heard that

3094
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
was basically an emulator

3095
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
and those ROMs and that the people putting it

3096
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
up there weren't even authorized to do it right?

3097
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
I thought I heard that?

3098
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
They said they got the permission but

3099
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
I don't know if that's legitimate

3100
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Oh man

3101
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
that's crazy and see that's

3102
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
another thing Steam's taken some real

3103
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
hits left and right this year because that would be

3104
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
another thing that's going to make them look silly

3105
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Like I said I watch a lot of Jim Sterling

3106
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
and stuff and

3107
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
he reviews a lot of really shitty

3108
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
or doesn't review but plays

3109
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
a lot of really shitty Steam games

3110
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
and there's some though that are fucking

3111
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
ridiculous to have copyrighted shit

3112
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
in them that fucking just get through the Greenlight

3113
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
process and get put up there as legit games

3114
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
like they have Gabe Newell's simulator

3115
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
and it's like it's an absolute

3116
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
shit game

3117
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
and there's it's just

3118
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
people just send this

3119
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
stuff through and it's just cluttering up the

3120
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
fucking Steam store

3121
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Very curious

3122
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
about that now just I

3123
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
heard that somewhere I don't know that to be true

3124
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
so I just want to put that out there

3125
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
and in fact I just did a news search and I'm not seeing

3126
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
anything about it but I swear to god I heard something out

3127
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
there this week about that whole thing so

3128
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
the Bubsy thing was not

3129
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
as not as

3130
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
A plus so I just allegedly

3131
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
covering my own ass there

3132
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Alright let's get to Rage Nator's second topic here

3133
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Only kinda sorta tangently

3134
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
gaming related alright I guess we'll allow it

3135
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Hoping for your input nonetheless

3136
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
See I'm the oldest of four siblings

3137
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
and my sister two years my junior

3138
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
along with my one brother four years my junior

3139
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
for the past two months have repeatedly offered

3140
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
to loan me some money to get me a new PC

3141
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
I refuse for two reasons

3142
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
One being that when they do something out of the

3143
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
kindness of their hearts strings are always attached

3144
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
this time being no different

3145
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Secondly my sister isn't in a position to loan

3146
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
or give out money due to her own finances

3147
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
living in a very expensive area of Alberta

3148
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
Canada owing way more on her mortgage

3149
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
I feel like this is personal stuff I don't want to read on

3150
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
air I told her

3151
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
specifically that her kids need to come first

3152
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
and at least with the strings attached

3153
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
aspect they told me if they were going to loan me the

3154
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
money I was to get the computer that

3155
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
they wanted me to have a low end Dell

3156
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
that I wouldn't run all my games

3157
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
and I'd be stuck with a PC I couldn't use

3158
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
and a debt that I'd have to repay

3159
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
My brother seemed to have dropped the subject albeit

3160
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
in a huff a month ago but my sister apparently

3161
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
didn't and tried to be slick

3162
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
She told me on 12-9 that she sent me via

3163
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
UPS a $200 Target card

3164
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
to be used on a computer and that I needed to be

3165
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
home the next day to accept it

3166
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
That despite the fact I asked her not to do it

3167
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
plus I already had plans that day

3168
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
due to doctors appointments I couldn't be home

3169
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
all day waiting on UPS

3170
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Anyway I was forced to reschedule my appointment

3171
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
then when UPS did show up I refused delivery

3172
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Of course 20 minutes later my sister calls me

3173
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
in a huff and we had a massive argument

3174
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
We're not talking. What's your points

3175
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
regarding this?

3176
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
Wow this is this is

3177
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
the OLR therapy moment here

3178
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
You guys need to sit down and have a nice

3179
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
long talk about this. I think that's

3180
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
very nice that your family wants to do

3181
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
that and I think you should acknowledge it

3182
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
at such and say I think it's very nice that

3183
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
you want to do this but

3184
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
I really want to be able to do this on my own terms

3185
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
and build the system that I want to do

3186
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
so thank you but

3187
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
no thank you and I think that has to be that

3188
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
and if for whatever reason they can't hear

3189
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
that then I would kind of wonder

3190
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
why they can't

3191
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
respect your wishes that you want to go

3192
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
through that process of saving the money

3193
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
that you want to do and build the

3194
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
system that you want. Now granted

3195
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
there's three sides to every story

3196
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
your side, their side, and the truth

3197
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
so I'm only able

3198
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
to really say this based on what I'm reading in this

3199
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
email

3200
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
I would just say you're not really

3201
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
under any obligation to accept

3202
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
a gift but at the same time

3203
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
you should probably acknowledge that

3204
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
hey somebody wants to do something nice

3205
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
for me and that's a good thing but this whole

3206
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
thing about the whole I bought you

3207
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
a card and you need to be at home

3208
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
and all that stuff that's

3209
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
a little weird but the fact that you refuse delivery

3210
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
you could have accepted the card and

3211
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
then taken her the card and said you know I

3212
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
appreciate this but I'm going to give it back to you

3213
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
it might have been a little easier way to do

3214
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
it without starting a whole

3215
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
fight there

3216
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
but anyway

3217
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
would you care to

3218
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
suggest anything to that Loki

3219
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
I did not realize we were going to be

3220
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
playing therapy on OLR in that email

3221
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
but that's alright

3222
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
I hope you guys can work it out, it's the holidays

3223
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
it's the freaking holidays

3224
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
hug it out

3225
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
alright

3226
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
one more email here

3227
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
from YYR

3228
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
Hello

3229
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
OLR

3230
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
feverishly working on diagrams for my

3231
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
provisional patent application

3232
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
if that sounds boring it's because it is

3233
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
ugh I'm fascinated that you're going

3234
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
through your patent application I would like

3235
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
to hear more about that process someday

3236
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
seated to my right however is Amy

3237
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
and she is not bored because she is playing Ori

3238
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
in the Blind Forest I don't know how I missed

3239
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
this game when it came out months back but I took a

3240
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
gamble on it grabbing it for $10 on the Black Friday

3241
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
sale knowing absolutely nothing about it

3242
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
fast forward a bit and I can honestly

3243
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
say it's a game I feel I have a responsibility

3244
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
to recommend to almost everyone specifically

3245
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
if you like Metroidvania style games at

3246
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
all and have an Xbox One you need

3247
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
to buy this the controls are perfect

3248
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
the gameplay is just as addictive as it is

3249
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
in the best games in that genre and the graphics

3250
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
well as far as games with 2D

3251
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
gameplay and 3D graphics go I've never seen one

3252
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
so beautiful the music is fantastic

3253
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
too and some of the power ups are really

3254
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
inventive and fun to use it's not a super

3255
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
long game so it won't take you away from your other

3256
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
bigger games for more than a few days

3257
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
the chance is high that it will go on sale again

3258
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
when the big Xbox sale begins in a few days

3259
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
very possibly to the $10 I got

3260
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
it for but quite honestly I'd pay the

3261
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
full $20 for it

3262
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
it is that good and if you buy

3263
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
it over the next few days it will be on your

3264
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
best game of the year list Rob

3265
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
I'm looking at you and possibly winking

3266
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
um surprise YYR I

3267
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
actually bought that game already I bought it in

3268
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
a sale I don't think it was Black Friday sale but they

3269
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
did some other random sale it was either

3270
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
at the end of summer or um

3271
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
beginning of fall I don't remember there was maybe

3272
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Labor Day sale or something and uh

3273
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Codeman was telling me what a great game that was and I

3274
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
heard it was Metroidvania so I actually checked it out

3275
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
and I did really enjoy it admittedly

3276
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
I did not spend enough time with it because

3277
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
you know it kind of fell in that

3278
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
avalanche of games that's coming out in the

3279
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
fall but um I do want to go back

3280
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
and spend some more time with it because I

3281
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
also agree it's a real gorgeous game

3282
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
and you know I love me some Metroidvania

3283
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
uh the game

3284
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
really ramps up in difficulty fast though from what

3285
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
I remember like I remember I was like playing in the beginning

3286
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
I'm like oh this is easy this is easy and then like

3287
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
just kidding so

3288
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
um yeah there is that

3289
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
but yeah I've already checked that out YYR

3290
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
but uh I'm sure the listeners still appreciate

3291
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
uh a little uh plug

3292
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000

the Ori and the Blind Forest? Um

3294
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
no I have not you'll have to keep an

3295
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
eye out for that on the Steam sale because I

3296
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
I agree with YYR it's almost certain to show up

3297
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
on Steam sale or Xbox One

3298
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000

3348
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
um my FU of the week uh

3349
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
things have been going pretty well I uh

3350
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
I've had a pretty good weekend there's not a lot I can

3351
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
give an FU to um I would say

3352
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
um

3353
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
um oh FU to the computer problems

3354
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
I've been having tonight FU to Skype

3355
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
FU to Skype

3356
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
fucking breaking my computer with the

3357
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
updates and I really don't know how I'm gonna fix

3358
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
it I'm gonna have to do some type of like

3359
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
deep clean where I go in and remove every single

3360
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Skype file I don't even really know how to

3361
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
do that but that's time

3362
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
this week I didn't want to have to spend and now I'm gonna

3363
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
but I'm doing it for you guys

3364
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
so we can make sure we continue the calls here on

3365
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
OLR cause having a listener

3366
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
interaction here on OLR is very important

3367
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
and I would never say FU to that so

3368
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
I will work to fix Skype

3369
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
even if that means updating the computer

3370
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
because honestly the show computer hasn't been

3371
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
upgraded since when did I throw the

3372
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
DevaFit that was when I was living with John

3373
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
that was a while ago that was um

3374
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
the DevaFit was in the garage

3375
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
that would have had to have been what 2009

3376
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
2009?

3377
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
so this no

3378
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
I'm losing

3379
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
track in my head I want to say it was maybe like

3380
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
2009 when that happened maybe a little earlier

3381
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
even like 2008

3382
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
so getting old I know right

3383
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
I can't remember years well no I said the

3384
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
computer's getting old even those power supplies

3385
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
don't last that long yeah so it might be

3386
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
time to sub out a few parts

3387
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
maybe the power supply for sure

3388
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
and I don't know maybe try to put some more RAM or even

3389
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
another chip in there and just see

3390
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
if I can boost it to where it can run

3391
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Windows 7 or something and some of the more

3392
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
modern stuff but you know

3393
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
more RAM I am I am such

3394
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
the type that's like I don't want to fix

3395
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
what's not broken

3396
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
but now it's breaking so it never works correctly

3397
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
just like stupid Unity and fucking

3398
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Windows 8 and now Windows 10

3399
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
doesn't it's like for no reason it just

3400
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
stops working no one has the answer to why

3401
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
this isn't working it's just eh fuck

3402
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
it Unity 5 no not gonna

3403
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
work yeah uh TigerCon

3404
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
chat says I remember the time OLR's computer

3405
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
went down after the video card died that's

3406
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
when this computer came in because and that was you

3407
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
guys and I gotta say that is one of

3408
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
I I I I

3409
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
rendered speechless quite often on this show

3410
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
I must say by the generosity of the

3411
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
listeners and so far cause you know we don't we don't ask for

3412
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
money or anything like that but you guys

3413
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
banded together and bought fucking

3414
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
computer parts and so this computer

3415
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
we're using is a listener donated computer

3416
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
so there's also a tiny

3417
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
part of me there's a tiny part of me that wants to make it

3418
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
last as long as possible but

3419
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
I'm in a much better place finance not that I'm like

3420
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
rolling in money but I'm in a better place

3421
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
I'm certainly not but I'm in a better place financially now

3422
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
than I was six years ago so

3423
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
if I have to kick down a little bit of money to

3424
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
buy a new chip or some RAM or a new power supply

3425
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
or whatever I don't mind we'll we'll make

3426
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
it work so alright

3427
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
uh anyhow

3428
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
let's uh let's move on we got a few more

3429
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
stories for you guys then we're gonna try

3430
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
to open up the Skype line but I'm gonna warn you guys

3431
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
it's gonna be a little wonky tonight so we'll do our

3432
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
best uh try to at least get some calls in here

3433
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
so let's get to Loki

3434
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
so now they've added one on one

3435
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
rival battles for Guitar Hero

3436
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
TV that's of course part

3437
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
of Guitar Hero Live

3438
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
and um I guess you'll

3439
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
be able to once you've hit

3440
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
level 10 you'll be put

3441
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
against other similarly skilled

3442
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
uh players on one on one

3443
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
battles and they

3444
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
said that twice during every

3445
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
30 minute slot on Guitar Hero

3446
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
TV channel um

3447
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
you'll find another player I guess

3448
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
and then the winner of the challenge will

3449
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
receive an extra uh

3450
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
100 XP

3451
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
I don't get this game anymore

3452
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
I still need to

3453
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
get it I keep saying I'm gonna get it

3454
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
and then I uh I don't so

3455
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
I need to pick that up cause uh

3456
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
um it was a lot of fun to play

3457
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
in the demo and so forth and I have to

3458
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
admit I was not expecting that out of Guitar Hero

3459
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
so uh I didn't drop all the money for it day

3460
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
one but uh uh

3461
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
I want to check this out so

3462
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
too many games and not

3463
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
enough time that's right isn't that isn't

3464
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
that it and you know we all have to hold down

3465
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
day jobs so we don't get to

3466
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
I don't have time to play

3467
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
games unfortunately

3468
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
well I end up staying up till one in the

3469
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
morning every day to play games

3470
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
and get my nice

3471
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
five hours of sleep we

3472
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
try though we do the best we can cause we love games

3473
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
although for some stupid

3474
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
reason I can make tons of time for fucking ingress

3475
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
which is retarded

3476
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
ingress is a game it's just a different

3477
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
type of game it's a social game

3478
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
it's a chore

3479
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
it's like a farm

3480
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
I went to an ingress party that had nothing to do with

3481
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
playing the game I was just hanging out with some of the people this week

3482
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
oh I don't know who any of the people are I mean I've

3483
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
met them I gotta meet introduce some more of them

3484
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
just some really fun people to play

3485
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
alright uh

3486
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
anyhow let's move on one more story for you guys

3487
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
also about music games and this one is about

3488
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Rock Band 4 which I finally

3489
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
imported my Rock Band 3 songs over the weekend

3490
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
so I have that to look forward to

3491
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
playing all those games but one

3492
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
thing I'm not gonna get to do is play them online

3493
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
cause Harmonics said this week

3494
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
we're not sure yet where online multiplayer

3495
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
fits in our roadmap

3496
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
now Harmonics is saying that online multiplayer

3497
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
is very much on the table for Rock Band 4

3498
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
but they don't know exactly

3499
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
where that fits in

3500
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
on the Harmonics blog David Sussman

3501
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
said online multiplayer is

3502
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
a part of a much bigger conversation

3503
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
we know it's at the top of a lot of people's want list

3504
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
online play with Rock Band is a big deal

3505
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
given the amount of different combinations of player

3506
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
4 potential instruments, different difficulties

3507
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
song affinities between players and so forth

3508
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
there's a ton of testing necessary

3509
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
as well as technical back end to work through

3510
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
in order to provide a fun stable experience

3511
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
for any future development

3512
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
especially features that have existed in our legacy

3513
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Rock Band games

3514
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
we want to be able to improve and refine wherever

3515
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
possible in the case of online

3516
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
play we have a lot of critical feedback

3517
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
on the Rock Band 3 design that we'd love to be able

3518
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
to address. Adding this functionality

3519
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
is very much on the table but we're not sure

3520
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
yet where it fits in our roadmap

3521
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
part of our process includes taking

3522
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
your advice into consideration

3523
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
before it can deliver a feature as complex

3524
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
as online multiplayer we would like

3525
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
to better understand what you want

3526
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
and find to be important

3527
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
blah blah blah we're gonna send out a survey

3528
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
about online play shortly blah blah blah

3529
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
fill it out

3530
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
now dark to see you in chat saying I don't get there

3531
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
hold up I mean didn't the previous games have online

3532
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
multi maybe I'm wrong I've really only

3533
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
played a little bit of 3 offline

3534
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
2 and 3 both had it

3535
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
and I think that's why a lot of people

3536
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
are confused because it's adding

3537
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
into that whole perception that Rock Band

3538
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
4 was a step backwards for the game

3539
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
I just don't

3540
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
let's just call it what it is

3541
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
it was fucking rushed out

3542
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
seriously it shouldn't be

3543
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
it's on our table of stuff that we're gonna

3544
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
add into the game

3545
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
that's just features

3546
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
it should've been fucking if it's not done

3547
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
it's not done don't release the game

3548
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
don't just put it out there because oh we need to

3549
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
get those sales in

3550
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
but here's the double edged sword

3551
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
with that I think Harmonix is in a

3552
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
tricky position especially because you know

3553
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
let's not forget Rock Band 3

3554
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
had that EA money and it had that MTV

3555
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
money so I think in a way

3556
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
Harmonix had to get the game

3557
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
out there to fund the game they really

3558
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
wanted to make I realize

3559
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
that's not what you want to hear

3560
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
nobody wants to hear that

3561
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
but that's what's happening

3562
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
you know it's just like

3563
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
you know with Kinect and stuff

3564
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
well Kinect's gonna do all these fantastic

3565
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
things except it can't

3566
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
but Kinect 2.0 will

3567
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
but it can't

3568
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
but Kinect 3.0

3569
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
it's like no I'm not gonna buy that

3570
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
alright

3571
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
we are to the point of this show where we're gonna open

3572
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
up the Skype line over at 1877

3573
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
game OLR or actually

3574
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
I don't think the toll free number is working right now

3575
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
I think I enabled something

3576
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
that now because I can't log in on the desktop

3577
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
I can't undo that so

3578
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
I am just gonna give out our regular Skype

3579
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
which is Orange Lounge Radio all one word

3580
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000

3581
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
we're doing this a little differently tonight so I don't know how this

3582
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000

02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
yell those out in chat if you don't want to actually call in

3589
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
you can always give us the questions in the chat

3590
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
room I would usually use tweets

3591
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
to fill time but my phone

3592
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
is now dedicated to the Skype line

3593
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
tonight which we are getting a

3594
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
call coming in on the Skype line so I'm gonna try

3595
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
and get to it right now

3596
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this?

3597
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Legend of Zaku here

3598
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
Hey Zaku how you doing?

3599
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
Yeah it's been a long

3600
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
yeah it's been like ages I know I've been

3601
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
sacking off on this OLR thing

3602
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Well welcome back we missed you

3603
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
what's on your mind?

3604
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Nothing much other than

3605
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
well in about a minute my

3606
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
birthday's coming up Well happy birthday

3607
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
you're a holiday baby

3608
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
Yeah that too

3609
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
and you know essentially

3610
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
right now

3611
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
kind of in the midst of trying to

3612
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
switch over on FSX to the Steam

3613
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
edition which is gonna be fun

3614
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
and hopefully they'll get me

3615
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
onto Windows 10 Other than that

3616
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
it's like I guess going on that

3617
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
whole Rock Band multiplayer thing

3618
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
I guess you know

3619
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
you're right

3620
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
at some point

3621
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Harmonix wants to avoid

3622
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
something known as Scope Creep

3623
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
where because it's like

3624
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
because of the actual

3625
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
requirements

3626
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
and the fact that they need to hit a hard deadline

3627
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
they have to

3628
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
forgo certain features

3629
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
even if they were standard

3630
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
and I guess

3631
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
the fact that they have to

3632
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
position themselves as trying to contrast

3633
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
against Guitar Hero Live which

3634
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
for all intents and purposes I hear didn't

3635
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
do as great as Rock Band 4

3636
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
And you know

3637
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
what's interesting about that whole thing is

3638
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
I bet the history of the franchise

3639
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
really played into that because

3640
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
I have to be brutally honest

3641
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
as unfair and

3642
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
as it might sound of me

3643
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
I kind of judged Guitar Hero Live

3644
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
based on the prior Guitar Hero

3645
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
games and I probably

3646
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
shouldn't have done that

3647
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
I think as they

3648
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
were released

3649
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
I can't believe I'm going to say this

3650
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
I kind of think Guitar Hero was the better game out of the box

3651
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
and I kind of

3652
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
made a mistake choosing Rock Band 4

3653
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
based on all these other promises

3654
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
I don't know

3655
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
it's weird

3656
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
it's a really weird situation for me but the reality is

3657
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
there's only so many

3658
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
fucking plastic instruments I'm willing to have

3659
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
and Guitar Hero

3660
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
took a huge risk

3661
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
changing not only where the

3662
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
instruments can't really be used

3663
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
but they really changed the formula with the whole

3664
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
six buttons I mean you couldn't even

3665
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
use the old ones if you wanted to

3666
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
so unfortunately

3667
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
the risk isn't paying

3668
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
off and I almost feel bad because

3669
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
that's twice now

3670
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
that developer's kind of gotten screwed

3671
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
for problems that aren't really theirs

3672
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
because that was the developer of DJ Hero

3673
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
horrifically underrated

3674
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
game and now they've got Guitar Hero

3675
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
Live which also is kind of underrated

3676
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
and I feel bad, I'm part of the problem

3677
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Right

3678
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
and I guess in Harmonic's case to their

3679
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
benefit by focusing

3680
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
more on getting the install

3681
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
based compatibility

3682
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
at the expense

3683
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
of online multiplayer

3684
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
bringing it back to

3685
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
the core mechanics of

3686
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
actually having to go to someone's

3687
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
place to play Rock Band, bring back that

3688
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
experience I guess that was more important to them

3689
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
and you know

3690
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
as I said this is a stepping stone

3691
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
provided that they make enough

3692
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
money that they could probably just

3693
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
add, they could probably patch this in

3694
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
a later update. Remember

3695
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
you gotta keep in mind that Harmonic's

3696
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
for all intents and purposes

3697
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
would most likely release one

3698
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
version of that

3699
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
Rock Band franchise for that

3700
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
platform's entire

3701
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
lifespan meaning that

3702
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
because you could actually patch in features

3703
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
it shouldn't you know

3704
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
adding online multiplayer

3705
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
isn't like world ending in that sense

3706
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
because remember they see it

3707
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
as a platform and not necessarily a release

3708
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Right and you know

3709
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
I'm trying to be fair to Harmonic's

3710
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
and you know I think I kind of said what I said about

3711
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
the fact that you know they're in a different position now

3712
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
than they were a couple of years ago but

3713
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
the reality is niceness

3714
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
and understanding only goes so far

3715
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
when you're asking for $100 of my money

3716
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
true but

3717
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
at the same token

3718
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
it could have been worse like Guitar Hero

3719
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Live you had like

3720
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
almost zero

3721
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:31,000
songs from the original

3722
02:54:31,000 --> 02:54:33,000
the previous releases carrying over

3723
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:35,000
like you're talking about people who spent

3724
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
upwards of at least a thousand bucks

3725
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
on Rock Band DLC alone

3726
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
in almost a decade

3727
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
that it's been ever since the first

3728
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:45,000
release so that's a hell of

3729
02:54:45,000 --> 02:54:47,000
a longevity in terms of DLC

3730
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
literally carrying from one generation

3731
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
to another

3732
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
Well at least Guitar Hero is doing something a little

3733
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
different with the whole streaming thing

3734
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
but I get your point I mean I understand that

3735
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
you know Guitar Hero and maybe that's part

3736
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
of the reason Guitar Hero also took

3737
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
a hit in sales is that they didn't promise

3738
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
that backwards compatibility

3739
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
so to speak that Rock Band did

3740
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
and I think that's one reason a lot of people were jazzed

3741
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
about Rock Band and that would completely

3742
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
explain why Harmonic's

3743
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
had to cut certain features out because

3744
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
obviously making the hard

3745
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
deadlines a lot more important

3746
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
but I think this is important

3747
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
Harmonic still has not

3748
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
fully met that promise

3749
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
it took them a month to do it

3750
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
for Rock Band 3 we still

3751
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
do not have original Rock Band, Rock Band 2

3752
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
Rock Band Lego there's still a lot of stuff

3753
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
missing and I don't think that's

3754
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
okay I don't think that was okay

3755
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
for them to misrepresent

3756
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
that there's really

3757
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
no nice way for me to put it I feel it was really

3758
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
misrepresented when they announced it

3759
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
is that they're gonna bring all that

3760
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
stuff out but not day one

3761
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
well as I said this is

3762
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
welcome to the world of

3763
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
licensing where now the lawyers

3764
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
have to play have to basically negotiate

3765
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
they're basically

3766
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
negotiating with the music industry

3767
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
well negotiate it before you announce it

3768
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
true yeah you usually don't

3769
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
announce it until the ink is dry

3770
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
but you know now they're pretty much

3771
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
caught right there you know

3772
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
they're exposed in that

3773
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
if for some reason certain

3774
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Rock Band tracks unless they've

3775
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
specifically stated that certain tracks

3776
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
may not make it

3777
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
make it over to Rock Band 4

3778
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
as a disclaimer they're pretty much

3779
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
caught in the sense that

3780
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
you know there were the only thing they

3781
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
have is their word and if their word doesn't

3782
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
deliver on the you know

3783
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
thousand plus dollars worth of DLC

3784
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
certain Rock Band

3785
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
you know last gen Rock Band owners have

3786
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
then yeah you know

3787
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
it would suck to spend all

3788
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
that money and

3789
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
all of it getting left

3790
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
behind as a result because harmonics

3791
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
basically you know

3792
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
they basically jumped the

3793
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
gun a bit too early in terms of

3794
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
trying to handle that transition

3795
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
but that pretty much could break

3796
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
the entire music

3797
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
rhythm genre for consoles

3798
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
in general

3799
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
unfortunately I think

3800
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
I mean you're right and that's

3801
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
the really sad thing especially having been

3802
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
fans of music games for so long is that if

3803
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
both these games tank there's

3804
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
not gonna be rhythm games for a good

3805
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
well I shouldn't say that

3806
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
there will be rhythm games and it's gonna be

3807
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
indie and that's gonna be awesome

3808
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
but the day of the plastic instruments is dead

3809
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
yeah and this is where

3810
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
like an arcade would you know

3811
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
Japan probably being the last bastion

3812
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
of rhythm gaming or

3813
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
that area around the Pacific Rim

3814
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
but yeah you're right

3815
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
well unless but

3816
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
I mean for those that follow

3817
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Kyle Ward on Facebook

3818
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
something's up so

3819
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
we'll have to get in touch with him later

3820
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
to get more insight on that I don't know

3821
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
I don't want to comment on somebody's Facebook

3822
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
but I think all that stuff is public

3823
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
so it's not like it's not out there but

3824
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
very interesting stuff I heard

3825
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
I know he went to Japan

3826
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
past couple of weeks

3827
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
you know Grant that was in Peru just like

3828
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
following him there's a video we're seeing

3829
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
if you haven't seen it yet where

3830
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
he's definitely dancing on an 8 arrow

3831
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
mat you've never seen it before

3832
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
oh wait I think I get it

3833
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
now I think I may have saw that in my feed

3834
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
an 8 arrow oh Jesus

3835
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
so anyway that means he's probably

3836
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
unless he worked on something

3837
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
with Konami that would have to explain

3838
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
his meetings out there who knows

3839
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
who knows anyway I don't wanna

3840
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
I gotta watch how far I go down that

3841
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
we'll let him on the show when he wants to talk about that

3842
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
but anyway Zaku

3843
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
we'll let you go for now

3844
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
alright take care buddy thanks for calling

3845
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
bye have a good one you too

3846
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
alright that is Zaku there

3847
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
sorry you're gonna get Skype noises tonight on the show

3848
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
since we

3849
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
have to have this whole little rig

3850
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
here with my iPhone and all that stuff

3851
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
1877

3852
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Game OLR or username on Skype

3853
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Orange Lounge Radio if you wanna give us a call

3854
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
and I don't know why I gave out that

3855
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
800 number cause

3856
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
welp it doesn't work tonight

3857
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
but we are getting oh I'm sorry Skype noise is coming through

3858
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

3859
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
hey this is Akdeaf

3860
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
hey Akdeaf buddy what's on your mind tonight

3861
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
well like I taste

3862
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
with Reginator's email

3863
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
oh okay

3864
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
yeah I'm gonna talk about the

3865
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
Neo Geo

3866
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
Humble Bundle oh yes

3867
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
you were commenting in chat about the whole controversy

3868
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
around the emulators what's going on

3869
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
yeah basically

3870
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
nobody knows because

3871
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
it kind of was

3872
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
it did get

3873
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
some coverage

3874
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
but it wasn't like really big

3875
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
but basically

3876
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
on the day

3877
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
that Humble got released

3878
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
a friend of mine

3879
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
a really close friend of mine called

3880
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
FoxHack on Twitter

3881
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
found some really interesting details

3882
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
about the

3883
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
where they got the

3884
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
ROMs for the games

3885
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
so basically

3886
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
those ROMs came from

3887
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
torrents

3888
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
pirates torrents of those games

3889
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
and you can find

3890
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
them on the code they have

3891
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
and also

3892
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
a really big issue that

3893
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
also came from

3894
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
that is that the emulator

3895
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
at first

3896
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
was thought that it was

3897
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
like an illegal

3898
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
one at least for

3899
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
for in this case

3900
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
.emu to use

3901
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
so

3902
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
basically

3903
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
after a day

3904
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
the day after it happened

3905
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
basically .emu came out and

3906
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
replied to my friend

3907
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
here that

3908
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
the emulator was

3909
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
gotten or was acquired by

3910
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
GameTap

3911
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
I think

3912
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
and they have a legal use of it

3913
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
but

3914
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
some other details

3915
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
appeared on this

3916
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
I'm gonna

3917
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
pretty much quote something

3918
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
I have on the

3919
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
sorry on the website

3920
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
I have here

3921
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
some thread basically on

3922
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
name world

3923
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
so if I'm following correctly

3924
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
just to make sure because there's a lot of moving parts here

3925
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
if I'm understanding this correctly

3926
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
the pirated ROMs

3927
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Neo Geo grabbed them

3928
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
and ended up turning around and selling them

3929
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
which I have to admit

3930
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
is kind of some funny irony

3931
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
and honestly it's kind of like one of those

3932
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
well I don't

3933
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
this is gonna sound crazy

3934
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
I don't see the problem in that

3935
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
turnabouts fair play

3936
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
this is not necessarily the problem

3937
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
that they got the ROM from

3938
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
an illegal torrent

3939
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
it's more the

3940
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
hold on

3941
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
because Act F is gonna have a hard time

3942
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
hold on Act F

3943
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
they're gonna sue themselves what

3944
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
seriously it's like

3945
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
there's no way that whoever illegally put those up there

3946
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
is gonna have any recourse

3947
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
those are our files

3948
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
but I think this is where you're going Act F

3949
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
the problem is the emulator

3950
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
because the emulator technically is nothing

3951
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
that's not technically illegal

3952
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
I know a lot of people use them for illegal purposes

3953
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
but yeah if you include the

3954
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
emulator you didn't pay for that

3955
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
well that's not irony

3956
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
somebody did program that

3957
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
for homebrew stuff

3958
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
and who knows what

3959
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
that's a little bit of a different territory

3960
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
than the ROMs themselves

3961
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
yeah basically the ROMs are not the problem here

3962
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
it's more like

3963
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
they're pretty much lazy

3964
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
and .emu has a really bad history

3965
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
on laziness

3966
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
doing ports and stuff

3967
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
but that's not the issue here

3968
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
the issue here is the emulator

3969
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
and I'm gonna post

3970
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
a post here on this thread that I linked on

3971
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:51,000
on the chat

3972
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
the problem is Nebula

3973
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:55,000
uses the main

3974
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
FM cores, Nebula being the emulator

3975
03:02:57,000 --> 03:02:59,000
they use

3976
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,000
which even to this day we haven't got Jarek

3977
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
a person who programmed

3978
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
the emulator

3979
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
to relicense for commercial use

3980
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
it's one of the biggest sticking blocks

3981
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
for relicense efforts

3982
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
so unless Alsemi

3983
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
another programmer there

3984
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
specifically rewrote them

3985
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
for this then it can simply

3986
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
it can be legal

3987
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
there's other main codes

3988
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
in Nebula too so it's not really clear cut

3989
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
as they make out

3990
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
Nebula definitely uses main FM cores

3991
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
and some of the main bits

3992
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
I don't recall

3993
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
so it probably wasn't legal for GameTap

3994
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
to use it and it's likely

3995
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
not for .emu

3996
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
either unless they replaced

3997
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
all of it

3998
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
so a reply from that says

3999
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
from Alsemi himself

4000
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
one of the programmers

4001
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
I can hardly remember who wrote them

4002
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
it was many years ago

4003
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
but GameTap had their own FM

4004
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
68K

4005
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
and C80 cores

4006
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
that they plugged into Street Nebula

4007
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
core and integrated them

4008
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
in their platform

4009
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
I just provided the code

4010
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
and I was able to redistribute

4011
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
only the code

4012
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
written by me, Alsemi

4013
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
and assistance on

4014
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
how to plug the other cores

4015
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
into their frontend

4016
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
so to try and simplify

4017
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
this for listeners who might have a hard time

4018
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
following all this drama

4019
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
especially with all these internal names of emulators

4020
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
and so forth

4021
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
I get the sense what's happening is that MAME

4022
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
which of course is the multi arcade machine

4023
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
emulator, very popular

4024
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
multi arcade machine emulator

4025
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
if I'm not mistaken it's open source

4026
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
part of open source is that the source goes out there

4027
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:43,000
but you don't have the right to resell it

4028
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:45,000
am I correct?

4029
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:47,000
basically

4030
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
and so essentially if you're taking these MAME pieces

4031
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:51,000
and putting it in your Neo Geo

4032
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:53,000
emulator that I guess is being used

4033
03:04:53,000 --> 03:04:55,000
on the Steam platform

4034
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
they're essentially selling MAME

4035
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,000
and I'm really oversimplifying it

4036
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
but they're essentially selling those MAME parts which is illegal

4037
03:05:01,000 --> 03:05:03,000
correct?

4038
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:05,000
so that's kind of it

4039
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:07,000
although if GameTap

4040
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:09,000
in this case, sorry, DotEmu

4041
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:11,000
says they got those licenses

4042
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:13,000
from GameTap

4043
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
which they acquired them legally

4044
03:05:15,000 --> 03:05:17,000
so there's not a big

4045
03:05:17,000 --> 03:05:19,000
problem here but

4046
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
it's kind of shady because

4047
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:23,000
they didn't

4048
03:05:23,000 --> 03:05:25,000
came through at first with this

4049
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
and it's still

4050
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:29,000
not clear where they got

4051
03:05:29,000 --> 03:05:31,000
at least in this case GameTap

4052
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:33,000
how they got the code

4053
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
or at least how they

4054
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,000
they were selling those

4055
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:39,000
ROMs

4056
03:05:39,000 --> 03:05:41,000
and enablers

4057
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
well realistically I mean I could see it

4058
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
one of two ways I could see that they just put the MAME

4059
03:05:45,000 --> 03:05:47,000
code in there because they were probably like fuck it

4060
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:49,000
it's our game we'll do what we want

4061
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:51,000
and I realize that's not what you're supposed to do

4062
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
that could be

4063
03:05:53,000 --> 03:05:55,000
but I could also see that they could have contacted

4064
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:57,000
GameTap to get that code because

4065
03:05:57,000 --> 03:05:59,000
I mean GameTap is

4066
03:05:59,000 --> 03:06:01,000
it's not with Turner anymore

4067
03:06:01,000 --> 03:06:03,000
they sold that years ago to an overseas company

4068
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:05,000
they probably were able to get

4069
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:07,000
they probably emailed somebody at GameTap

4070
03:06:07,000 --> 03:06:09,000
yo do you still have this code could we pay you like

4071
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:11,000
pennies for this code and

4072
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,000
GameTap was like oh yeah sure we don't have anything else

4073
03:06:13,000 --> 03:06:15,000
going on I mean

4074
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000
they could probably got

4075
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,000
that GameTap code for pennies

4076
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:21,000
I mean so

4077
03:06:21,000 --> 03:06:23,000
but I

4078
03:06:23,000 --> 03:06:25,000
don't know but this guy here

4079
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:27,000
does say that he

4080
03:06:27,000 --> 03:06:29,000
gave the code written by him and assistance

4081
03:06:29,000 --> 03:06:31,000
on the other course so I don't know maybe they were able to get

4082
03:06:31,000 --> 03:06:33,000
the GameTap stuff but we don't know

4083
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:35,000
and I don't think they're gonna exactly

4084
03:06:35,000 --> 03:06:37,000
be saying it I guess

4085
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:39,000
we should be happy

4086
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:41,000
I don't know to try and put a positive spin

4087
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:43,000
on this even though I don't know there is one

4088
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:45,000
it is being sold on Humble Bundle

4089
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,000
which a lot of that goes to charity anyway

4090
03:06:47,000 --> 03:06:49,000
so yeah

4091
03:06:49,000 --> 03:06:51,000
that's something that a lot of people did

4092
03:06:51,000 --> 03:06:53,000
when they heard the story

4093
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000
break and when they

4094
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
read my friend's Twitter

4095
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
most people

4096
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:01,000
they did want the game

4097
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
so they

4098
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,000
they gave all the money to charity

4099
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:07,000
so at least something good came of it

4100
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
so yeah

4101
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
at least there's that but very

4102
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:13,000
interesting I had no idea that that was

4103
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:15,000
the drama but essentially it is that the

4104
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:17,000
mame is basically being resold

4105
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:19,000
potentially

4106
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:21,000
and I can see where that's

4107
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:23,000
ruffling a lot of feathers

4108
03:07:23,000 --> 03:07:25,000
thank you for the insight ActDeaf I'll make sure that the money

4109
03:07:25,000 --> 03:07:27,000
goes to charity when I pick it up

4110
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:29,000
sure alright

4111
03:07:29,000 --> 03:07:31,000
well take care of my friend I'm gonna let you go so we can try to squeeze in

4112
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:33,000
one more call ok?

4113
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:35,000
hey thanks for coming on take care

4114
03:07:35,000 --> 03:07:37,000
alright there it is

4115
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
one more call there

4116
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:41,000
and we're gonna try to open it up for one more call

4117
03:07:41,000 --> 03:07:43,000
to squeeze in 1877 Game

4118
03:07:43,000 --> 03:07:45,000
OLR or a username on Skype

4119
03:07:45,000 --> 03:07:47,000
Orange Lounge Radio if you want to give us

4120
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
a call I don't know why I keep giving out the phone number because I just said

4121
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
it didn't work but when you say one

4122
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
thing for hundreds and hundreds of episodes it's pretty

4123
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
hard to get it out of your vocabulary

4124
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:57,000
Loki any last minute

4125
03:07:57,000 --> 03:07:59,000
things you're pulling up there while we're waiting for one more

4126
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:01,000
call potentially here?

4127
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,000
just the HTC Vive has gotten some

4128
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:05,000
sort of improvements and because

4129
03:08:05,000 --> 03:08:07,000
of that I want to say that it was

4130
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:09,000
going to be pushed from

4131
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:11,000
to April 2016

4132
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:13,000
as far as

4133
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:15,000
the release date and they're going to be showing offset

4134
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:17,000
improvements at CES

4135
03:08:17,000 --> 03:08:19,000
interesting

4136
03:08:19,000 --> 03:08:21,000
alright

4137
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:23,000
one last shout out for calls

4138
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word on Skype

4139
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:27,000
it looks like it's working that's the good news

4140
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
the only downside is I'm getting some of the Skype noises

4141
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
there as I have to unmute and mute

4142
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:33,000
the cell phone feed

4143
03:08:33,000 --> 03:08:35,000
from the

4144
03:08:35,000 --> 03:08:37,000
mixing board but that also means

4145
03:08:37,000 --> 03:08:39,000
I can play stuff from my iPhone

4146
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
right there into the mixing board

4147
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
that's kind of fun do you want to play some Flappy Bird?

4148
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:45,000
have some Flappy Bird sounds?

4149
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:47,000
want to do Ingress?

4150
03:08:47,000 --> 03:08:49,000
well I'm dumping my keys out of my

4151
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:51,000
capsules because I had to put

4152
03:08:51,000 --> 03:08:53,000
them all in there when I was doing that fielding

4153
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
which by the way it made checkpoints so that's good

4154
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:57,000
hey congrats that's great did you go up on the leaderboards?

4155
03:08:57,000 --> 03:08:59,000
31 nice

4156
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:01,000
make 100 slots available so I can give you some gear

4157
03:09:01,000 --> 03:09:03,000
when the show's over oh I've got tons

4158
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
hook you up!

4159
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
let's see

4160
03:09:07,000 --> 03:09:09,000
I guess that's it

4161
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:11,000
we're not getting any other calls so I guess

4162
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:13,000
we're well after 9 o'clock anyway so I think

4163
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
I'll go ahead and close up the Skype line

4164
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
there and thank you guys who

4165
03:09:17,000 --> 03:09:19,000
did get in and if you didn't get in you

4166
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
can always email the show

4167
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:23,000
participate at orangeloungeradio.com

4168
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
is the place to send us an email I'm very sorry

4169
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,000
I didn't get to the tweets tonight but my phone was being

4170
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:29,000
taken up for something else so I'll

4171
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:31,000
try to get to those next week

4172
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:33,000
but that's going to do it for another

4173
03:09:33,000 --> 03:09:35,000
episode of Orange Lounge Radio

4174
03:09:35,000 --> 03:09:37,000
we're back weekly we will be

4175
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
here on Sunday I think many shows you

4176
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,000
listen to will be having

4177
03:09:41,000 --> 03:09:43,000
the week off and they probably deserve it

4178
03:09:43,000 --> 03:09:45,000
but since we already have taken several weeks off

4179
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
we're going to be here next week and

4180
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:49,000
the week after right on into

4181
03:09:49,000 --> 03:09:51,000
2016 and the 14th

4182
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,000
year of Orange Lounge

4183
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:55,000
Radio starting high school

4184
03:09:55,000 --> 03:09:57,000
and going through that very awkward puberty phase

4185
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
that is going to be our 2016

4186
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
here at Orange Lounge Radio

4187
03:10:01,000 --> 03:10:03,000
maybe our voices will start changing

4188
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,000
we'll get a little deeper

4189
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,000
get a little deeper here on Orange Lounge Radio

4190
03:10:07,000 --> 03:10:09,000

03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:31,000
long way and we appreciate them all

4202
03:10:31,000 --> 03:10:33,000

4203
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,000

hardworking indie developers as we

4213
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:55,000
get into 2016 I met a lot of great ones

4214
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:57,000
at GX and I hope to meet more at

4215
03:10:57,000 --> 03:10:59,000
MAGFest and whatever shows I show

4216
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:01,000
up at in 2016

4217
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:04,000
Dark

4218
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:06,000
Sakura had to leave early tonight but

4219
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:08,000
I'm sure if she had a final

4220
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:10,000
thought she'd say something like reject

4221
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:12,000
false icons we'll leave it at that but

4222
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:14,000
Loki how about you what's your final

4223
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:16,000
thought tonight as we head on out for the night

4224
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:18,000
at least it's a short week

4225
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:20,000
it is

4226
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:22,000
I was going to try to get my game

4227
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:24,000
done this year but I don't think it's going to happen

4228
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,000
you only got a week and a half left

4229
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:28,000
I've been trying to work on it but I've just

4230
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:30,000
been mentally exhausted so

4231
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:32,000
I actually have been working out

4232
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:34,000
very slowly like maybe a

4233
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:36,000
minute or two at a time

4234
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:38,000
because like I literally come home brain

4235
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,000
dead and between calls I don't have

4236
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,000
enough time to like shift focus

4237
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:44,000
like that so it's been a

4238
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:46,000
rough year in some ways I mean I was going through

4239
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:48,000
a lot personally especially in the first half of

4240
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:50,000
the year like you guys know how long

4241
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:52,000
some things were taken to get done and

4242
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,000
a lot of that I kind of blame on some of my personal

4243
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,000
life circumstance and that's getting better but

4244
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:58,000
you know I stay pretty

4245
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:00,000
busy with work and so forth so a lot of that

4246
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:02,000
like I wanted to do more streaming and more video

4247
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:04,000
production but it's just kind of slack this year

4248
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:06,000
I'm really hoping to kick that into gear next year

4249
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:08,000
so we'll see what happens

4250
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:10,000
so anyhow

4251
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:12,000
my final thought tonight is

4252
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:14,000
thank you for spending your

4253
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:16,000
holidays here with us at Orange Laundry radio

4254
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:18,000

4255
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:20,000
that you spend to take to listen to our show

4256
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:22,000
and it was great to meet some of you over

4257
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:24,000
at GX and I hope to meet many more of you

4258
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:26,000

4259
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:28,000

4264
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:38,000
if you can for the holidays

4265
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:40,000
that's what the holidays are really all about

4266
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:42,000
that and so much candy

4267
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:44,000
that you go into a coma

4268
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:46,000
enjoy the steam sale and the Xbox

4269
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:48,000
sale and the Playstation sale they're coming

4270
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:50,000
