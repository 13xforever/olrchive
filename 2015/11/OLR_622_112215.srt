Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This week, Sony too revisits backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 emulation on the PlayStation 4.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here's hoping classic Star Wars games help get us through to The Force Awakens.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There's plenty more along with your calls and comments tonight on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this November the 22nd of 2015 with episode number 622 of our show.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Rob Roberts, but you can find me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E,

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and I am joined here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California with my co-hosts.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I like this coffee.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You're having some coffee to help pick you up, give you a little energy?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's delicious.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah, I gotta say, I don't know who invented the Keurig. I'm assuming it was Keurig.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is that the name of the company? I don't know, but anyway.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Whoever invented that, that thing is a lifesaver for...

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But, so I don't sound like a free advertisement because we're not on the payroll.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To hell with that 2.0 thing where it wouldn't do the cups that weren't first party. It was so weird.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It was like an NES system that wouldn't play the third party cartridges.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I never have that problem.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Because when I buy a bag of coffee, it lasts about a month.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And my filters cost $2, and I can make my cup flavored any way I want to by adding things to it.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Can you make that cafe mocha right there?

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I could buy that cafe mocha because they sell the grounds.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, do they? Oh, that's something, I guess.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This is just the Target brand.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I thought there was something special because some of them now, they don't just put coffee in it, but they actually put cream.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have this one at work that actually has cream and sugar in the cup as well.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So it's like a whole all-in-one thing.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I enjoy that you share coffee with me, and I'm glad to buy you cups. I just wish that they were more biodegradable than they are.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It seems like some other companies are coming out with solutions, so maybe everybody will switch to that.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Because there's these other ones we get that are totally different, and they work, but they seem more out of materials that would biodegrade easy.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
These do make a lot of waste. However, delicious, and just exactly what I needed.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hits the spot.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I also have Kit Kats. I've been on a quest for all the different flavors of Kit Kats from Japan.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I finally got the cheesecake Kit Kats.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, that sounds amazing.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They're really good. I only have a few left from the package I bought yesterday.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But I forgot to buy the strawberry cheesecake ones that they had at...

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In Japan Town in San Francisco, they have an omiyage store, which it's like the packaged omiyage that you get when you travel all over Japan and then you take them to all your friends.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But they had the strawberry cheesecake ones, and I almost bought that box, except I thought I already had strawberry cheesecake, but I just had regular cheesecake.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Still super good. And then I got blueberry cheesecake soft Oreos.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's a flavor?

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's a flavor in Japan.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ah, that sounds amazing.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
They're amazing. Green tea Oreos are also good.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm kind of glad you didn't bring all that to the show, though, because I've eaten enough this weekend.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They also have heavy sweet cream Oreos.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It tastes like condensed milk.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is kind of funny to me that this weekend you traveled to the West and went to San Francisco to spend the day.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And I traveled to the East and I went to Reno and went to Wizard World this weekend on Saturday.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And then, of course, we're in Reno. We got to go to a buffet.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So we went to a buffet, and I am really not proud of how much I ate at that buffet, but it was pretty good.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You know, I did have something dismaying happen.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What's that?

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
One of the big reasons I went was to go to Soko Hardware and get a tatsunabe, an iron pot.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And the one I wanted was like $130 for a wrought iron pot.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And they had cheaper ones, but I think I'm going to just look online because I really want a good tatsunabe for making sukiyaki and other things.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I've started cooking a lot more.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let me ask you one other quick question, then I want to get to Techmaster Loki.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Because, obviously, this is a video game show and we do talk about gaming.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Did you go to that little arcade they have there with all the imports?

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I stopped by there, but I had Becky with me, so I didn't play anything.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Ah.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But you could see it from a little place that you go to get taiyaki.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Alright.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, also joining us in the studio tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hello.

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hey, Loki, how you doing?

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Doing fine.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Good. Well, since Dark Soccer and I are kind of pooped from our trips, you're going to need to carry the energy on the show tonight.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because before you were here, Dark Soccer and I were like, can we maybe have like a nap segment?

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Like maybe like the official OLR siesta of the week?

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And then we just go silent for five minutes while we nap.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Or maybe 20. I guess 20 minutes is a much better nap than five.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So you might have to pick up the energy a little bit on tonight's show, Loki.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Okay.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So, one little storyline here on OLR I'm sure people have been following and kind of getting a chuckle out of over the past couple months.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Was that you used to make fun of me for playing this cell phone game.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I didn't make fun of you for playing Ingress. I didn't get it. It was like Minecraft.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You know, where I didn't get Minecraft.

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think that's a good comparison. That's a fair comparison.

85
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because when I first played Minecraft, I was like, I don't get it.

86
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I still don't get it, but I'm playing it anyway.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So, but you've gone like full tilt boogie on Ingress.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
And right now they're doing a special event, which is like, it's for their third anniversary.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Double XP.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I just call it XP because for all the role playing games, it's always experience.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's basically what it is, but they call it AP because they got to be different.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So, but it's double that for like a week or two.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So you've been taking big advantage of this, right?

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yeah. So I went from level seven to level nine.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm not nine yet because once you get to past level eight, you have to have like certain amount of medals and stuff.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's like achievements.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So imagine like to get further in a game, you have to have achievements to unlock stuff.

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So I don't have the achievement yet.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't have a gold medal to level up to nine, but I have the experience to do it.

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I just don't have the medal yet.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's the only downside of the double AP because Alan gained a lot during that segment when they did it last year.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And he was short on badges for a little bit as well.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I think he just barely has the badges to get to 10 or whatever, which I think he's going to hit during this event.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
So kind of interesting.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So anyway, I just thought the listeners to get a kick out of that, that you've been playing a lot more than that.

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I had, you know, some time to take because I had these like floating holidays I had to take before the end of the year.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And I was just like, eh, if I tell my wife what I'm going to take time off or take time off, she's going to watch the kids.

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So I'm just not going to say that I am.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And so you better hope nobody plays this for you.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I mean, it's fine. It's, um, it was only like a day or two.

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And it's, you know, I just got out of the house and I was playing that until like eight at night.

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You know what to get you out, get you moving.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yeah. I, my phone's been buzzing, you know, tell me, Hey, you've hit your walking, you know, thing for the day.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hey, you've hit a new record of walking.

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And you know, so I did a lot of that and, um, I got to frack farm something with some people on Friday.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So that was kind of fun. I bought my first in app purchase, which I didn't actually, I didn't actually pay for that.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I answered free surveys through Google, you know, through the Android thing.

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And so I had like five dollars and I'm like, okay, I'm just going to buy some in app purchase for that.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And I still have money left over. So no real money has actually been spent on it. Okay.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay. Just time, just time. It's very little time.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I mean, anyone has an Android phone and seriously do that because it's like one second surveys and you get like a few cents and they send it to you like a few a week.

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
All right. Cool. All right. Well, I do want to also introduce the ever present fourth guest on our show.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We don't have anybody in studio tonight, but we do have our live chat room and we always appreciate those folks that participate along with our show live.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's part of what makes our little gaming podcast.

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We have here a little bit special is that we are all in the same room here in the studio, but then we're also with you guys virtually via our chat room.

126
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We do tape live Sunday nights at the voice of geeks network, vog network.com, vog network.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

127
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And if you are listening live, you can always go to our chat room live dot vog network.com.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We do read chat. We do.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Sometimes if we are not, you know, we again, we don't have time to play every single game in the world because, you know, we all have day jobs and stuff.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But, uh, sometimes you guys that have played games, maybe we haven't experienced, you will end your opinion on something or you might set us, like if we say, um, Oh, such and such game doesn't have this feature.

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You might correct us and say, yes, it does. Or in the case of what happened today.

132
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So to do a, do a small correction, the last week's episode, I suppose I get a message from Shane and he's like, I'm listening to last week's episode and he's like, nobody corrected you on how wrong you were.

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That Dragon Quest heroes is not on Xbox one. And you actually said it was, and now that I was kind of thinking back, I'm like, that's right.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It was a PlayStation four exclusive, wasn't it? So, Hey, sometimes, sometimes even with the help of chatters, we might miss something accidentally, but, uh, it happens.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But anyway, we do appreciate those. You guys that, uh, participate with our program and, uh, looking at the chat room, uh, some folks talking about coffee because dark soccer was talking about the coffee thing a little bit ago.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Uh, William murder face and chat says French press for life. Uh, Mr. Rizzo's agrees to the French press. I know Alan's a big fan of the French press.

137
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I have a French press. I also have a 1950s Pyrex percolator, which I love. Um, but Dan doesn't like the way the coffee turns out in it, but I love the sound. And then I have my drip cups.

138
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Um, dark to see in chat says, has Rob seen the Oreo churros? Yes, I have. They're only like one Oreo car in Disneyland. I think it's actually outside, um, in, uh, downtown Disney.

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But I, I, you guys, as much as we kind of always talked about Disneyland on the show, I haven't been in over a year now. The last time I went to Disneyland was last E3. I just, the prices have gone up so much. It's sad.

140
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So I've seen the Oreo churros. I have not experienced one yet. Um, let's see. Um, act deft in chat says we have some hazelnut spread Oreos in Mexico or Nutella Oreos, but not actually Nutella. That sounds kind of amazing.

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Actually. I told him if he sends me some, I'll send him a Kirby candies from the Japanese store. There you go. That sounds like a good exchange. Uh, let's see.

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Um, also going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Alan Alchemy, responding to the, uh, siesta we're threatening to take during the show says the ritual recording of part B will be an hour long. Deal with it. Z, Z, Z. New Adele album plays.

143
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, you know, we actually would not be able to stream the New Adele album because she put the kibosh on that. From my understanding, you cannot hear New Adele on Spotify because certain artists that can still sell millions of copies of their albums kind of just give the finger to streaming.

144
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Cause you know, they want to sell more copies of their albums at Target. I sort of say, you know, put it on a delay or people are going to turn to piracy anyway, but whatever. It's, it's an interesting, uh, decision that they make there.

145
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Uh, and blueberry in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says exotic limited edition snacks are the best. It's like finding shiny Pokemons in real life, but you can eat them too.

146
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Who says you can't eat Pokemons? Who says you can't cook a Pokemon? That's what Charmander's for. So if it's anything like, you know, uh, Ingress, you know, recycle. I want to convert this Pokemon into like, I don't know, something.

147
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, you, you, you joke about the Ingress comparison, but let us not forget. Those are the guys that are making Pokemon Go. That's why I made the comparison. So yeah, it may, it may, that may be a reality someday. We'll see.

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I have to say, just mildly speaking on Pokemon, the new Digimon series came out that's related to, uh, the first two series that came out in Japan and over here. Um, and it's amazing and it's on Crunchyroll.

149
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay.

150
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I have to say for any other people who were, did you, cause you know, I'm a, I was a big Digimon fan.

151
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I know you were, you were like the only person I knew that watched it.

152
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And there, you know, I played the Digimon games and everything, so it's kind of video game related, but, um, it's on Crunchyroll and everyone owes it to themselves to watch it.

153
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Cool. And you know, um, as much as that Pokemon Go thing, as a, as a Ingress player over a year, as much as when they first announced that I was kind of like, what the fuck? Like I was just like, this doesn't make sense.

154
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The more I kind of think about it and I'm like, I am actually like really excited for that because I think it is going to be the Pokemon MMO we've always wanted, except it's going to be real.

155
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
So are you supposed to like battle people with that or like?

156
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You know, everything is speculation at this point. They've shown one trailer, they've shown nothing on gameplay. Supposedly there was a beta test in 2015, but I kind of doubt that that's happening. I think, um.

157
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Why am I not hearing this from Kotaku yet?

158
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Maybe, maybe they got blacklisted by Niantic, I don't know. But to be fair, Loki, we haven't heard it either. So, we're just as much hot water as anybody else. So, anyway.

159
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I just, you know what's funny? I didn't even have any, I know this, getting into our kickoff topic tonight. I know that's the thing that like everybody's been talking about on blogs and everything and I know even Bobby was talking about it on his show tonight.

160
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And that's when I realized, when Bobby brought it up on his show, I was kind of looking at our show roll going, oh shit, I didn't put that anywhere on our show roll tonight, even though like that's a big thing.

161
00:13:49,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Because it's not fucking news, who cares if they, oh damn, a website that I don't care to read anymore because it's very sensational got blacklisted by two companies. Well, fuck them, who cares?

162
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I think it's more the precedent than anything else. What if it was a different site that you did like? Because there probably is going on with a site that you do like.

163
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Okay, well if you violate your NDAs, then you're probably going to get blacklisted.

164
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But my understanding was they weren't under NDAs for anything that they spilled. NDAs are usually very specific to what you can and can't disclose.

165
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Because that's the weird thing about the industry is that they've got one arm that's the very public facing stuff and everything that they're pushing and promoting and then there's the other that's working on everything in secret.

166
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Well, if you do something that they don't like, if you're an entity that's doing something a company doesn't like, they don't have to do business with you.

167
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:54,000
They don't have to share information with you because they don't see you as a trustworthy source anymore. It's like, well, I understand that you're not going to maybe follow our narrative or whatever as far as what we're putting out of PR and stuff.

168
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's fine. If a company doesn't want to do that, like a media company, then that's cool. But it's like, hey, we had this big announcement planned and you guys went and fucked it up. We're kind of mad at you for that.

169
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So we're just not going to give you the opportunity to do that anymore. I don't see a problem with that.

170
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:30,000
My whole thing on it is that a lot of this I see parallels as to why I really don't enjoy E3 anymore. And that is that it's about the script and sticking to the script and nobody wants to go off the script and everything is just, okay, you can come spend five minutes with our very blah copy of the game.

171
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Or now it's about, you can come to our theater where you've waited in line for an hour to get in this theater where you can watch somebody else play the game for 20 minutes.

172
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You know, and it's just like, I just, I'm not an on the script kind of guy, but I also don't do this for a living. I don't get paid for OLR. Has anybody here been paid for this show at all?

173
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I got a copy of Dragon's Lair once.

174
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Once in a while there might be like a fun little perk and we're always very thankful for that. We have some awesome listeners and all that. But as far as like, do we make $500 a show or something? No. God, no. In fact, we probably pay out more money than we're actually getting in perks.

175
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But this isn't, like we've been doing it for what? Like fucking 13 years, right? We wouldn't do it if we didn't have fun.

176
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Orange Lounge who?

177
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, right? So, I mean, it is what it is. But my whole thing is that, and we talked about this when I talked about why I just don't really enjoy E3 as much anymore. I love the networking part of it.

178
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I love to meet people, talk to other people and so forth. But as far as like, it's kind of boring at this point. Like it's just not worth the money to go to LA or the time off work and all that.

179
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But what I love and my favorite part and what I've found has been like the most rewarding in the past year or two working with games is working with the developers who aren't on the A-list.

180
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You know, there's a lot of very hard working game makers out there who are on like the B-list. And there's nothing wrong with being on the B-list.

181
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:10,000
We've had a lot of great people here on OLR who we've interviewed who are doing some great games, right? And even the indie level things. I love talking to indie people and about the games they're doing.

182
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So there's sort of that side of it where I'm like, okay, well, I think Kotaku in this case, they have a right to answer the question, why did you not review Fallout 4 when it came out like everybody else did?

183
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I think they do have a right to say, here's why.

184
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Totally do.

185
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But on the other hand, that doesn't mean I feel that Ubisoft and Bethesda should be strong armed into working with Kotaku.

186
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
No.

187
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't actually believe that. I just think Kotaku will have to work better and smarter like the rest of us do who don't have these cushy partnerships with the developers.

188
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Oh, boo hoo, you can't get your review copy. Where's my review copy?

189
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah.

190
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I didn't get a review copy.

191
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So, you know, it's just kind of one of those. And I kind of think, you know, well, then that website with their views.

192
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Okay, so they're not going to be running stories on Fallout 4. They're not going to be running stories on Assassin's Creed, as many maybe.

193
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's more real estate for them to run stories on people who are probably really desperate for the coverage.

194
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And that's not going to be what's going to be run on their website. But yeah, I see what you're saying.

195
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Ideally, I mean, again, I very rarely, you know, I've had an issue with that website for some time.

196
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think things have gotten a little better, but they're not, like, it's still just not a website that is in my rotation, really.

197
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But obviously everybody was tweeting about that story. I had to go see what the fuck was going on with that.

198
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
But anyway, that's just my thought on that whole thing.

199
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, I was going to see if anybody was saying about, let's see, Mr. Rizos.

200
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I was like, everybody's talking about Digimon in chat, and I think that's DarkSaga's fault.

201
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But I do see some comments.

202
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Hey, Digimon is great.

203
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
No, there's nothing wrong with that, but Mr. Rizos in chat says,

204
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I agree with Loki. Nobody who's looking for real info on gaming goes to Kotaku anymore.

205
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
SHO100Matt says, I do think that Kotaku is doing their jobs as journalists and reporting news from sources.

206
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If Bethesda and Ubi is really mad about this information being leaked out, then maybe they should be mad at their own staff or clients.

207
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I guess it kind of depends on how they got the information.

208
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let me finish. That leaked the information out.

209
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Plenty of companies have ways of locking down the information channels if they wanted to keep information quiet.

210
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I do think that is a valid point. Why are you not more mad at the people leaking the information?

211
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's just that they don't know who's doing that.

212
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And I don't know. What were you going to say?

213
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I was going to say it depends on how they got the information too, of course.

214
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,000
If they had talked with somebody and they're like, listen, this is under NDA, but here's what we're working on, blah, blah, blah.

215
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And then they went, oh, hey, here's the information we got from our source or whatever.

216
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And that's kind of fucked up. But if they have anonymous sources or whatever reporting this stuff to them, I mean, whatever, that's fine.

217
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Once again, though, but they're well within the right to blacklist you, though.

218
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You know, especially in a big industry where there's hundreds of people, somebody gets fired or let go for a reason that they're not happy with.

219
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And so they turn to one of these sites and that's how they get back at their old company.

220
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Come on, that has to happen. That has to happen.

221
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You know, and I'm sure that's probably a part of how some of these websites get their information is jaded former or current employees.

222
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yeah.

223
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So, you know, anyway. I'm not saying that's okay or that's right or people should do it. I'm just saying that's what's happening.

224
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
No, I want to talk to you. I want to talk to a Bethesda play tester.

225
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Because how how is this stuff like that's good.

226
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Good enough. I mean, because like I know it's such a double.

227
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's such a double standard to be like, you know, oh, what's a Bethesda game? It's going to be buggy as hell.

228
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I mean, and that's why I enjoy those games, because it's like, hey, the dog is stuck under the table clipping through the ground.

229
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's okay. Like the other day was that the dog was it was stuck in like an animation loop or something like that.

230
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So it kept like sneezing for like five minutes and then start like hacking up like a hairball for like five minutes.

231
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And it was scratching for five minutes. It kept getting stuck in these animation, these idle animations.

232
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It was kind of funny. Bobby Blackwell has a fair counterpoint here in chat saying,

233
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
My response that I said was that the bugs are most likely found by QA, but that the devs didn't have time to fix it.

234
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Most of the bugs were probably reported. So blame the firm release date that they didn't want to delay.

235
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I think he makes a valid point, because I've definitely heard the story of the QA tells them there's a problem.

236
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And oh, we don't have some of these bugs that are like have been in Bethesda games like from like Fallout,

237
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
you know, New Vegas, Fallout 3, you know, Skyrim. These are like bugs that have been in all of these games.

238
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
And it's just not been fixed. I don't know. I mean, yeah, I understand that they're not being fixed by the devs,

239
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
but will they ever? They're not. I mean, honestly. And you know what?

240
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
At this point, I would be surprised if we see console mods, because they can't get their shit together with the way it is right now.

241
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm going to take one more comment on the Kotaku thing here, and then I want to move on.

242
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
ActDeft in chat says both parties involved are in the right here. Kotaku is in the right to be pissed for being called out on doing their job.

243
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And I imagine he's probably finishing his thought right now. And I'm just reading this early.

244
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
But my thought is the one more thing I want to get out here is that maybe it's time to just re-examine this whole process to begin with.

245
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And it's always interesting to me how secretive and how tight-lipped a lot of the gaming stuff is,

246
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
where they really don't talk about what they're doing in advance.

247
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And we've talked and made a lot of comparisons to the movie industry before.

248
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I've always said on this show, game ratings should have the exact same ratings as movie ratings.

249
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I don't understand why the two are separate, right? We've made comparisons between the two industries before.

250
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
In the movie industry, they're usually a lot more forward with what they're working on.

251
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And that hasn't ruined anything in movies, as far as I know, right?

252
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
No, I mean, you get a lot of direction.

253
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I mean, okay, maybe people steal ideas and that's how you get those direct-to-video things like, what was it, like, instead of Snakes on a Plane, it was like...

254
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah, Snakes on a Train.

255
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Snakes on a Train.

256
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
No, but...

257
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I mean, come on.

258
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That company, that's all they do. They do those knock-off movies.

259
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Exactly. I would actually maybe enjoy some knock-off games for parody purposes.

260
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But, like, I think, I don't know if you really have to worry about companies stealing each other's ideas.

261
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I guess you could say, like, you know, Titanfall, you know, had, like, the mechanics from Titanfall and Call of Duty kind of borrowed those for their last two games.

262
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So there's some stuff that's being taken from one another.

263
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:56,000
But you can't copyright those mechanics, even though Konami would like to copyright, you know, arrows moving up a screen and you have to line it up with something.

264
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So that's kind of fucked up, but you can't really copyright that stuff.

265
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So, I mean, I don't see the point.

266
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Maybe that they just changed their mind. You don't want to get people hyped up on stuff that's not going to come out like Prey 2 or Half-Life 3, you know, that type of stuff.

267
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Alright, I'll end with one more comment here from William Murderface in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com who says,

268
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I think the main perp here is entitled shitlords on the internet.

269
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I can agree with that. DarkSaga, do you agree with that? The main problem here is entitled shitlords on the internet?

270
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Yeah.

271
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I just, like, you know, I hear Kotaku and I hear that there's something bad happening to them.

272
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And I'm just like, I just don't care.

273
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's not as violent as the reaction I have to certain other gaming websites, but it's, you know.

274
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
You know, it's just like, oh, they're blacklisted. Well, you know, they kind of had it coming.

275
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:00,000
You know, that's kind of like the way I feel with that. It's just, you know, maybe they didn't, but I just don't fucking care anymore because of so much garbage that's been posted on the website.

276
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Loki's over there going, they had it coming. They had it coming. They only had themselves to blame.

277
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Alright, moving on. The thing I actually wanted to talk about with the kickoff topic tonight is that we have a lot of anniversaries going on in gaming right now.

278
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Which makes sense because this being that week leading into Black Friday and Thanksgiving, you know, this is a huge release window.

279
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And usually a lot of game systems come out in this timeframe, right?

280
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So, actually, believe it or not, yesterday, the 21st, was the 25th anniversary of the Super Famicom system.

281
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
That's awesome. Were we getting any free virtual console games?

282
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Probably not because I don't think there's an Nintendo Direct.

283
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Ah, fuck them.

284
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:49,000
But November 21st of 1990 was when the Super Famicom, which of course was the Japanese Super Nintendo, that's when that was released.

285
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So believe it or not, that system is 25 years old.

286
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And I think many people would say, I don't know if everybody would say, but many people, including myself, probably would say, probably the best video game console ever made.

287
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I kind of think. And maybe that's just because of my age.

288
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You know, maybe people who are a little bit older than me, like if you're, or I'm sorry, a little bit younger than me, if you're like 7 years younger than me, maybe you think the best console of all time was the PlayStation.

289
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Because that's what was out when you were that age.

290
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Or maybe if you're like 15 years younger than me, you probably think it's the PlayStation 2, you know, or something.

291
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Or the Xbox even. But yeah, that's, I think is probably the greatest console they ever did.

292
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Even if it's really funny to look at some of the old ads and magazines, this is something that's been circulating around the internet this week.

293
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Is some of these old ads and magazines that showed just how much those games cost because they were on cartridge.

294
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I mean, you know, I seem to recall, like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II, like at the time, were like $80 games, I think.

295
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Because they were on cartridge. And that was $80 in the 90s, which was a lot of money.

296
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But those games were hella badass and worth it.

297
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Any quick Super Nintendo memories or favorite Super Nintendo moments or like thing you most anticipated on Super Nintendo to kind of cap this together here?

298
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't know. I mean, like a lot of the games were really cool.

299
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And I remember I sold my Nintendo to get a Super Nintendo and the first games I got for it were...

300
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I don't even remember what games I had. I know I had Roadrunner's Death Valley Rally, which is like Sonic the Hedgehog on Super Nintendo.

301
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,000
And I played the shit out of that. I don't remember what other games I had. Probably Link to the Past was amazing.

302
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
When we got my Super Nintendo, we got it with A Link to the Past. Of course Mario World came with it.

303
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
We had Home Alone, which my brothers played obsessively, and we got the Super Scope 6, which was actually fun. Blastress was pretty fun.

304
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Tigerclaw on chat at live.fognetwork.com says,

305
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I used to play a shit ton of Super Mario World. It was the game that came packed in the Super Nintendo.

306
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Oh yeah. I mean, Nintendo, man, they were masters of the...in some ways still are masters of the...well, they slipped a little bit on Wii U.

307
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
But they usually are masters of the must-have pack-in game, right?

308
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Think about it. Wii Sports sold that Wii. Super Nintendo was definitely bolstered by that Super Mario World.

309
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I mean, it's one of the best games they ever did on the console, and it was the first, if you think about it, being the pack-in game, right?

310
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
And then, you know, Super Mario Brothers being a pack-in game for the original NES.

311
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Granted, depending on which configuration you bought, but for most people they got the Super Mario Kart.

312
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah. Was an amazing Super Nintendo game. It was a pack-in game. Now, Nintendo may have slipped a little bit.

313
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I don't know if Nintendo Land is on the same level as those other games, but...

314
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Nope, it was shit.

315
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I wouldn't go that...I wouldn't go far to say it was shit, but it wasn't Wii Sports, and it definitely wasn't Super Mario World.

316
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
No one was like, ooh, it's Wii Sports.

317
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Let's see. Act F says, speaking of anniversaries for Nintendo on November 21st, Amiibo, one year old.

318
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
And that's how long it took for you to finally find them on shelves. There you go. One year out, and you can finally find the Amiibo on shelves.

319
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I bought one today because of Shane.

320
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Oh God, did he pressure you into Falco?

321
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:40,000
He woke me up this morning by a text message and said, Lottie's out at Target. So I got Lottie.

322
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
He's such a little jerk. He was messaging me all day Friday.

323
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I need the 3-pack now.

324
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,000
He was messaging me all day Friday going, you want to get a Falco? The Falco figure's so pretty. It's so blue, you should see it up close.

325
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm like, Shane, you are in the wrong line of work. You need to be a salesman. You need to be a salesman. This is what you do so well.

326
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I want to get the 3-pack so I can get my DJKK.

327
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I'm retired from Amiibo buying until the Cloud Strife Amiibo comes out. Then I will un-retire for one day only and then retire again.

328
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I may have to get that. May. But then again, I don't have Smash so that's kind of pointless.

329
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:30,000
If anybody from Nintendo is out there, seriously, do not make that fucking Cloud a retailer exclusive. Blood will be shed.

330
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,000
That's not a threat against Nintendo. I'm saying, you know those Black Friday fights you see at Walmart? That's going to be nothing compared to those Cloud Amiibos.

331
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You better make sure plenty of those are available.

332
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Let's see. SHO 100 Matt says, Shane waking up Jamie on a Sunday. He clearly likes to live dangerously. That's a very fair point.

333
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I went back to sleep.

334
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Allen Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, 2014 Sky. Amiibos are trash pandering to hoarders and merch addicts. Manufactured supply shortages. Burn it all to the ground.

335
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:12,000
2015 Sky. Amiibos cover my body with them and I'll roll around. They're pointy but I don't care. I have 80 of them. Money is no object.

336
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It's an accurate read. What can I say? Opinions change.

337
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:24,000
No, I still think a lot of the retailer shit they do is bullshit. I don't understand. I don't understand.

338
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I don't understand why Nintendo does not have their own store online where you could just buy the Amiibo and then they know you could preorder them on their store and then they would know exactly how many to make.

339
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
They could keep the money. I just don't understand why that's not a thing.

340
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
But see, if they're not in crazy demand, you'll stop talking about them and therefore they don't get the coverage.

341
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
They figured that out with the Wii and it's been like that ever since. These artificial shortages.

342
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Because no one is inept enough to be able to not predict their fucking amount of product that they need for their customers for how many years now? Almost ten fucking years.

343
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I mean, I'm sorry. They're not that stupid.

344
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
This does not ever seem to be a problem with Disney Infinity or Skylanders.

345
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Well, Skylanders actually was a big problem and for Disney Infinity, though, they manufacture fucking toys and they still have those issues as well and they've done retailer exclusive things.

346
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Skylanders I don't think is so bad because at least with Skylanders, for the most part, it's not a franchise. I don't think that people are like,

347
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Oh my god, I gotta get a new one! Well, maybe it is, but at least with Disney, it's like, okay, recognizable characters.

348
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Skylanders, I'm like, who the fuck is this character? I don't fucking care. Where's Spyro? That's not fucking Spyro. What the fuck did they do to Spyro?

349
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
My interest in this game is fucking up there.

350
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Let's see, Bobby goes on, he's kind of slamming amiibos a little bit, but then says,

351
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Lego dimensions don't have this problem. I haven't had a problem getting any Lego dimensions anything. Money is no object. Cover my body with Lego dimensions.

352
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Wouldn't that hurt, though? Have you ever stepped on a Lego? It fucking hurts.

353
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
If you step on enough of them, though, it doesn't feel so bad.

354
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Wasn't there a thing circulating on Facebook where now Lego is selling Lego-branded slippers for you to walk around the living room so you don't step on your kids' Legos that they've left all over?

355
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm always positive that's a thing.

356
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You're telling them to fucking clean it up.

357
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Anyhow, I want to say one other anniversary. This one's a tough pill to swallow, because when we get on here and we say the NES is turning 30 years old and the Super Nintendo is turning 25 years old, we can kind of look at that and go, God, I feel old right now.

358
00:33:39,000 --> 00:34:02,000
But this is definitely one that's going to make you go, wow, time flies, life's short. Also celebrating an anniversary tomorrow, November 22, 2005, 10 years ago, the release of the Xbox 360. Ten years ago, if you can believe it. The Xbox 360 turns 10 years old tomorrow.

359
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Am I getting any free games out of this?

360
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:15,000
No, you'll probably get a free avatar. I love how that's Loki's response to all these anniversaries. What free thing am I getting? Happy birthday to me. What am I getting for free?

361
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Well, if they're celebrating an anniversary, I'm not buying them anything, so what are they providing to me as a commemorative thing?

362
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Maybe they'll be a sale. Who knows? I don't know. Anyway. And actually, wow, why did I think today was the 21st? Probably because I was reading the Super Nintendo article. Good, the chair was correcting me. I was testing them. Today is November 22, so today is actually the 10 year anniversary of the Xbox 360. Sorry, my mind was still stuck on the Super Nintendo thing, which was yesterday.

363
00:34:47,000 --> 00:35:03,000
So it's actually today. But one day, differences aside, 10 years. I remember a time here on Orange Launch Radio when we were talking about the launch of the 360.

364
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And speaking of trash amiibo retail shortage, all this stuff, let us not forget the Xbox 360, that was a fucking mess when it launched. Remember that? It was impossible to find it.

365
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Oh yeah, I remember that.

366
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You had to check retailer stuff online. I remember the only way I was able to get it...

367
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
You had to go buy them out of the back of a car.

368
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Yeah, I had to go buy... That's right, you bought yourself a... Oh my god, and then didn't it not work or something?

369
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
No, it worked perfectly fine.

370
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Did it? Oh.

371
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah, it was good. I mean, it died eventually.

372
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
What was the one where you got ripped off? You like went to Stockton or something?

373
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Oh, it was because I went to mod an Xbox 360. I went to mod one, and then they stole it or something. But, you know, whatever. Had like 12 more or so.

374
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
So yeah, I had to get... I remember, in order to get one, I had to get the core system. Because Best Buy told me they got five in randomly one day.

375
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
And I got the core system, and I had to buy that hard drive separately. But it was like, whatever, I'm gonna pay it.

376
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Because I want to play Final Fantasy 11 on this thing when it comes out for the 360.

377
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I bought like almost every launch game, and I was disappointed by most of them.

378
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,000
But I did like... Why did I end up playing mostly? I played... I liked Amp 3, actually. That was pretty fun.

379
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I didn't like Perfect Dark because you can't jump. I'm like, dude, what fucking year is this that we can't jump in a game? That's kind of stupid. So, there's that.

380
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
As ridiculous as it is, Xbox Live Arcade was really what sold me on an Xbox 360.

381
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I have way too many Xbox Live Arcade games.

382
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Geometry Wars was a fucking game changer. And if you think about it, a lot of where we're at today in the industry with digital distribution and everything else,

383
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I mean, Xbox Live Arcade was the start of that. So, you know, that's going back a good ten years or so.

384
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
And there was a lot of, you know, shovel stuff that came out in those early days of 360.

385
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:01,000
But you also had a lot of, for the first time, legally emulated versions of classics that included online leaderboards,

386
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:10,000
sometimes online multiplayer, depending on the game, achievements, and things that kind of modernized these classic games.

387
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,000
And Sneaking! Where are my Burger King games? I was promised a second set of Burger King games.

388
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And they're not here, and I am so sad that there's not more Burger King games.

389
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I understand that you'd probably put them out as an app now, but that's not what... I want a fucking console game.

390
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I'll take it from any fast food place.

391
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Some folks in chat talking about their best 360 moment. S200Matt says,

392
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The best 360 moment was getting the Orange Lounge radio and Bobby Black Wolf icons that I still have today on the Xbox One.

393
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Yes, we were fortunate enough. That was back in the days when we were on All Games Radio.

394
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And we were able to kind of group together, and I don't remember the specifics about this, sorry,

395
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:02,000
but somebody over there, I don't remember if it was Bobby or Scott or whoever, got in touch with the folks at Microsoft,

396
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
and yeah, we were able to get those gamer pics on the Xbox 360, which sadly you can no longer get.

397
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
They were cleared off the store some time ago. Because, you know, everything kind of...

398
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Microsoft shifted away from those gamer pics in favor of those avatars.

399
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Oh, that was a good choice.

400
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Well, you know. But it was certainly an honor to be included.

401
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I mean, think about it. How many gaming podcasts got to have an official icon on Xbox 360?

402
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
There was only ever two packs. There was, you know, the All Games Network pack that we were in,

403
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
and then there was the one before that, whatever gamer tag radio was on.

404
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I think they're the only show out of that group that's still on today. Please don't hate me if I'm wrong.

405
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
I just don't remember all the specifics. But whatever their network was at the time, I think they had it as well.

406
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
So, what? That's maybe like 12 podcasts?

407
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Orange Lounge Radio Who?

408
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,000
We had gamer pics on Xbox Live. I'm sorry. I don't know what you guys...

409
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Well, you know, Bobby had the most successful icon out of any of them.

410
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Because I believe he was the only one that didn't actually put letters or like the name of his show,

411
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
because he had his little logo, the little wolf outline thing.

412
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
And because it didn't have letters on it or whatever, it can kind of be interpreted.

413
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I think many people that were using it have no idea what the Bobby Black Wolf show is, unfortunately.

414
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But maybe it gave some awareness to him.

415
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Hey, it's a furries icon.

416
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I don't know what the reason could be, but we'll see.

417
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So, certainly more people were using his than were using OLRs.

418
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
But we were thankful to everybody that was using OLRs. That was pretty cool.

419
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Alan Alchemy saying, best 360 gen memory.

420
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Sky, remember when Xbox Game Room was hype?

421
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Here we go.

422
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And they were like, we are absolutely supporting this.

423
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And then it was out for three days.

424
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
And they went, everyone is fired and we're closing it down. Bye.

425
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

426
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Not everything that has happened in the Xbox 360's time frame has been a good memory.

427
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
We could also talk about 1 versus 100 again, because I think I bring that up every week.

428
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
How I just love the concept of an online game show that's always kind of going.

429
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And 1 versus 100 was that.

430
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And when it shut down, I had a cry.

431
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Now, thankfully, and granted we've had them on the show to talk about this.

432
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And you all know we love them over at Jackbox Games.

433
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But they're filling that void a bit with what they're doing.

434
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
And they're kind of leveraging a lot of Twitch, I think too, to make that a little more current.

435
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,000
But there's something about that 1 versus 100 era that I miss.

436
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I think the fact that it was live sometimes during the day.

437
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And you actually had a host who was talking and saying things that were current.

438
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And a lot of the questions would be about current pop culture stuff.

439
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
And I thought that was really cool, actually.

440
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
My favorite moment? Grand Theft Auto IV.

441
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And maybe Saints Row.

442
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
But mainly my modded games in Grand Theft Auto IV.

443
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
That was the best gaming experience I've ever had.

444
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
All right, so Xbox 360 has certainly brought us a lot.

445
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I mean, if you think about it, my god.

446
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Achievements. That was new on the 360.

447
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And now that's like a standard. That's everywhere.

448
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
That's on... except Nintendo.

449
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
But even within some Nintendo games.

450
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Yeah, it's on Steam. It's on PlayStation.

451
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's in some Nintendo games.

452
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
But it's not system-wide yet.

453
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'm assuming the NX will have to have it.

454
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It doesn't have to.

455
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I guess not. And I guess you don't have to do anything.

456
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It doesn't also have to have party chat or anything like that.

457
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Some people can motivate themselves without arbitrary goals.

458
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
But arbitrary goals can be fun, too.

459
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
If you give me donuts, I will take that.

460
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Because it's not arbitrary. I can eat them and they're delicious.

461
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And then some folks talking about the Red Ring of Death in chat.

462
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Tigerclaw saying,

463
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
My first Xbox 360 Red Ringed during a session 1 versus 100.

464
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Yes, another dark spot in Microsoft's history there with the 360

465
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
that cost them a lot of money when they had to extend that warranty.

466
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I remember my Xbox Red Ringed within that first week.

467
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You could probably still find that episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

468
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I didn't end up getting my Xbox until, I think, February or March of 2006.

469
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I feel like it was around Valentine's Day.

470
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
But I remember. And we talked about it on this show.

471
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Yeah, I got my Xbox. I had to play it for three days before it Red Ringed on me.

472
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I had to send it back.

473
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I think our original never did, but we had another one that did.

474
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It's just so interesting.

475
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
The second one I got never did. It's still down here.

476
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
That's, you know, God.

477
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And I think about that thing is almost 10 years old then at this point.

478
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's crazy.

479
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Anyhow.

480
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
All right.

481
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
We've talked at length about some kickoff topics.

482
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I do want to get into our gaming week so we can get into the news tonight as well.

483
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
We always like to talk about what we've been playing

484
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
and where our head is at when it comes to video games

485
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
going into the show this week.

486
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So let's talk about how was your gaming week?

487
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

488
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
My gaming week was…

489
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I'm still tangled over here.

490
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
You're right there.

491
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
No, it's the wires here are always tangled

492
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,000
because there's this one that always is intersecting mine right here

493
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
that needs to not intersect my wire.

494
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Is it the guest mic?

495
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Or is it my mic?

496
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Yep, it's the guest mic.

497
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It's the guest mic.

498
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
All right. We'll work on that.

499
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Anyway, so what I've been playing is I played a little Final Fantasy XIV

500
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
but not for very long.

501
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

502
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
because that game is super cute and super fun.

503
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I also played Wrecka today as in the Super Famicom game.

504
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Dan put in some Thunder Force IV which is pretty fun.

505
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
It's a combination of retro gaming

506
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
but we also put in The Guardian Legend this morning

507
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
because we got our EverDrives

508
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
and so we wanted to see if there was any kind of play difference

509
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
or any kind of difference on the intro screen for Gaiden.

510
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
So apparently we'd always seen no game by Compile and Irem.

511
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Apparently Irem was the publisher for Compile

512
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
and it says that differently on the Japanese cartridge.

513
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So that was pretty cool.

514
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Really? That's about it.

515
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Oh, and Dan was watching Pat the NES Punks marathon this weekend.

516
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
So that was pretty neat.

517
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

518
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I played a whole shit ton of Ingress, so there's that.

519
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm kind of embarrassed about the amount of time they spent on it this week.

520
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,000
But I did level up from 7 to 9 basically experience wise.

521
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
I think on Friday I actually got 1 million AP in one day.

522
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
So that was pretty massive.

523
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And I kind of learned a little bit more strategy with that and everything.

524
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
So I'm enjoying it a little bit.

525
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's tiring.

526
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
God, I ate through so much data on my plan.

527
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It's ridiculous.

528
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
In fact, I'm kind of scared to look at it right now

529
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
because just in one day I think I ate through about a quarter of my data,

530
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
which is ridiculous.

531
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Aside from Ingress, I did manage to get some Fallout 4 time in,

532
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
so I have my settlements going

533
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and I've just been kind of exploiting the game a little bit.

534
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I played it a little bit last night and I'm still enjoying it.

535
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
It's very Skyrim-ish to me.

536
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm not really into the Fallout series,

537
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
so I don't really know too much about the backstory and everything,

538
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
but I'm enjoying it, so looking forward to that a little bit more.

539
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I'll probably play some more tonight actually.

540
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
And then I played a little bit of Minecraft,

541
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,000
the Windows 10 edition and Xbox 360 edition

542
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
because my son's been playing on my old game that I had done in Survival

543
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
and had a pretty nice map going there,

544
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
but he's really, really, really into that still.

545
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And the Windows 10 one, I missed the update,

546
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
so I haven't gotten a chance to see they're updating it now.

547
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
We're going to talk about that a little bit later.

548
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
But there's a lot more stuff that they're adding

549
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
to kind of bring it up to speed with the PC version

550
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
because I've actually been thinking about going back to the PC version again

551
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
just for maybe single player play some of the mods

552
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
because my son watches, like I said, all those mod videos and stuff.

553
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I'm like, hey, that looks kind of fun. I want to play that.

554
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So I don't know.

555
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Okay. Well, that's it for your gaming week.

556
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Then my gaming week, not quite as active as my co-host

557
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
because, again, I was out of town for a few days.

558
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I went to Wizard World, which I had a good time there

559
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
and some fun celebrity sightings and all that, some good panels,

560
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
but it actually didn't have anything to do with video games.

561
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
So except for the fact that I saw some cool video game stuff for sale,

562
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I did end up getting a Tron shirt from one of the vendors

563
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
because, unfortunately, I'm starting to see less and less Tron stuff,

564
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
so I did get an actual, I think it's a fan, it's not an official shirt,

565
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
but still, it says Flynn's Arcade with a little disc on it,

566
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
so I was excited about that.

567
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
But as far as games, I've still been playing Final Fantasy XIV quite a bit

568
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
thanks to the new 3.1 patch.

569
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
I've been leveling a DPS class up to 60.

570
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I've been working on Machinist because I already have the Astrologian,

571
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
who's my healer, it's kind of my main, already at 60,

572
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
but I want to be a little more versatile in what I can do

573
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
to help other friends of mine that play the game.

574
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
It's good to have more than one class, so I've been working on that.

575
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Otherwise, the only really new thing I played this weekend,

576
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,000
they actually had the Overwatch beta open up to a lot more people,

577
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and I was fortunate enough that I was able to check that out.

578
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I didn't really play against real people

579
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
because everything I'm hearing online is that it's still kind of a toxic trash environment,

580
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
which is really unfortunate.

581
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But I did play a little bit with bots,

582
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
and I've got to say, I do really enjoy the different characters

583
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and how there's so much variety.

584
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
It's kind of fun to just go through the different characters

585
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
and see the types of moves that they have.

586
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I really liked, I think her name was Mei.

587
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
She's the one that uses freeze things.

588
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
She can freeze people with a ray, she can drop a block of ice,

589
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
she can encase herself in ice and heal herself.

590
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I kind of liked playing with her.

591
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Yeah, I think there's a lot of great character design in that game.

592
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I hope they can do something about removing some of the junk stuff that's online.

593
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And I also really hope that there's some type of single-player mode in the game.

594
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
And in kind of thinking about it, I'm like,

595
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
you know, there probably won't really be a single-player mode.

596
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
And I've got to be honest, if all it is is multiplayer,

597
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I don't know if I'll end up getting it.

598
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I've got to be honest.

599
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I mean, it would be cool to play with friends and other people from VoG

600
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
and people that I know aren't going to be dirtbags online.

601
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
But I don't know if I'm really interested in playing a game

602
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
with nothing but strangers all the time

603
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
and dropping that kind of money on the game.

604
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So I really hope there's some type of single-player experience in Overwatch

605
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
or I might end up passing on it.

606
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
That's the one thing that kind of concerns me.

607
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
But I mean, the game does look really good

608
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
and I love the way it runs on my machine.

609
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
It's very smooth.

610
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Pretty awesome.

611
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
ActDeftInChat says,

612
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
it can't be more toxic than Team Fortress 2, can it?

613
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Well, it's a lot like Team Fortress 2.

614
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
The game itself is a lot like Team Fortress 2

615
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
but with just some very different characters.

616
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
So I don't know.

617
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
William Murderface says,

618
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I bet Overwatch will have some sort of grouping system.

619
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I hope they at least ask some type of question in the beginning.

620
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Like, are you an asshole? Yes or no?

621
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
And then they put all the yes people by themselves.

622
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Okay, well obviously a question like that won't work.

623
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Well, you know what's funny?

624
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
On the 360, I remember this was a thing,

625
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
because we were talking about anniversaries, right?

626
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
The Xbox 360 and stuff they did online.

627
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I remember when you would first sign up,

628
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
you would pick, like, which group do you want to be put in?

629
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Yeah, I remember that.

630
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
And one of them was, like, family-friendly.

631
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
One of them was hardcore,

632
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
which we all knew was where the dirtbags would go.

633
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And then there was another one that was kind of, like, casual or something.

634
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I don't know.

635
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
But they have, like, their four different...

636
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I don't know if that ever really was utilized.

637
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Oh, fuck no.

638
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Yeah, I kind of feel like that really did nothing.

639
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
So I wonder if maybe that wouldn't be a bad idea

640
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
worth approaching in Overwatch.

641
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
But I guess if they have maybe, like, ranked mode versus casual

642
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
or, you know, for fun or something,

643
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
maybe they'll help separate that out a bit.

644
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But I don't know.

645
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
I mean, I remember doing that.

646
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Of course I was in hardcore because, jeez, there's no more hardcore than me.

647
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
And I just want to make sure I make this clear

648
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
because I can already see this email coming in about,

649
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:06,000
well, you know, why do you razz Overwatch for having all this online communication

650
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
but then say Splatoon sucks because it doesn't have it?

651
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
The main difference is that when I want to be able to talk to friends,

652
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
like, if friends and I are playing, that's a nice thing to have.

653
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
We kind of work around it on the Wii U by using Skype.

654
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I did play Splatoon. I don't remember if that was last week.

655
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Maybe it was, like, Monday or something, so I forgot to mention it just now.

656
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
But I was playing a little Splatoon online,

657
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
and we were using Skype to communicate on that.

658
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
But it would be nice if that could just be done natively through the Wii U

659
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
for when I'm playing with friends.

660
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I did notice Overwatch seems to have a built-in voice chat,

661
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
which I don't think you get online when you play with strangers,

662
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
and let's all be thankful for that.

663
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
But it is an option when you're playing with friends,

664
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
so that's kind of cool that that's embedded like a console version of the game would be.

665
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with vognetwork.com,

666
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
use the passphrase TEETH.

667
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Let's see.

668
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says that's a horrible comparison

669
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
because Overwatch right now is on the PC platform,

670
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
which allows layering background third-party apps.

671
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Splatoon is what you see is what you get.

672
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I'm not really trying to compare the two games,

673
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
but I can just kind of see that coming,

674
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
like, why are you saying this on this game and this on this game?

675
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
I just want to make that clear what the difference is.

676
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
All right, so that's it for my game week.

677
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Getting into housekeeping tonight.

678
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
There is sadly going to be no OLR this next Sunday

679
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
due to the holiday weekend,

680
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
and I know Dark Soccer is doing something else.

681
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I feel like you said you were doing something else, Loki, but even if you're not,

682
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
well, oh well.

683
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
You're ingressing.

684
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
But many of our listeners will be out doing other stuff, too,

685
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
so with the Thanksgiving holiday this weekend,

686
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
we will not be doing a show on Sunday.

687
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
We could go do that.

688
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
What?

689
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Ingressing.

690
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
We'll see.

691
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I don't know if I'm going to end up out of town or not.

692
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
That's the other thing.

693
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I'm kind of on the fence on if I'll be out of town or not.

694
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
All right, we'll see.

695
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
So we'll play up here.

696
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
So there's that next Sunday,

697
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
and we're still going to try to make it work,

698
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
but I do want to remind everybody,

699
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
GamerX is coming up, or GX as they're calling it this year,

700
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
and VOG Network will be there,

701
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
although I just found out we're not going to have electricity at our table

702
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
because we have to pay for that,

703
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
and it's going to be too much money,

704
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
so I have to figure out what we're going to do.

705
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It's a standby, but Dark Soccer and I were talking before the show.

706
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
We think we have some good ideas,

707
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
but we will be there having a good time with the people and the event itself.

708
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
There's going to be a lot of great panels.

709
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I know there will be some good cosplay and some fun things to see,

710
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
so we will be at GX in San Jose,

711
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
and that's going to be the weekend of the 11th, 12th, and 13th,

712
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
which means we may not have a show the 13th.

713
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
We may have a short show because the only problem is

714
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
if we don't do a show the 13th,

715
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
we're going to have no show this Sunday, show, no show again,

716
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
and especially with me having been sick a couple weeks ago,

717
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I really don't like missing that many shows.

718
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I know y'all are understanding and so forth,

719
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
but I don't want to fall out of your rotation on your podcast app

720
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
or however you listen to this show,

721
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
so I do want to try and maybe get a short show,

722
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
maybe right as we get back from GX,

723
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
because I feel like we did that last year, didn't we, Dark Sakura?

724
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
We came back, and didn't we start a show at 7 o'clock?

725
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Yeah, I thought we did.

726
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I feel like we did something like that, so we may do that again.

727
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So, Loki can go ingress for an hour and then come to the show.

728
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I'd be playing more Fallout if my wife would get off the TV.

729
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
I mean, honestly.

730
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Maybe that'll happen.

731
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Okay, seriously, if she watches TV,

732
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I have to figure out whatever the hell I'm going to do to entertain myself.

733
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,000
If I want to use the TV, I have to find things to entertain her with.

734
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Like, I have to have a book for her or something, which is fucked up.

735
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Vidpower in chat says,

736
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Oh, hey, Jennifer Hale will be at GamerX.

737
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yes, that's true, Jennifer Hale will be there.

738
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Dark Sakura.

739
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I'm going to follow her around like a lost puppy.

740
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I can't imagine.

741
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Dark Sakura will meet Jennifer Hale in a couple weeks,

742
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
and that's going to be an amazing meeting.

743
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yes, that'll be great.

744
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Very excited for her.

745
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And there's going to be a lot of interesting, diverse people there.

746
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
So, I'm a little sad that the Ellen McClain, John Patrick Lowry thing

747
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
didn't end up panning out because I think they ended up having a conflict.

748
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm a little sad about that, but I understand these things happen.

749
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Some celebs always have to cancel the con.

750
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
It's not anybody's fault. It just happens.

751
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Same thing happened last year, too.

752
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I know, right?

753
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
That's kind of unfortunate.

754
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
But there'll be a lot of other fun guests there, so I'm excited to do that.

755
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And you know what?

756
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Dark Sakura and I will be there.

757
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,000
And hopefully you guys will be there.

758
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Some of you out there, at least in the area, will be there as well.

759
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
And we're going to have a good time.

760
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
We'll play some Jenga.

761
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Sounds good?

762
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Bobby says don't break the ice.

763
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Don't break the ice.

764
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Bobby says that LuckyWish is falling forward on the Wii U

765
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
so he can play it on the GamePad.

766
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Yes, I actually do wish that I could play it on the GamePad.

767
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
But oddly enough, I actually have the components to build a GamePad-type device

768
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
for other systems.

769
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I actually had planned on doing it at one time and purchased everything.

770
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Just never got around to making it because I would have had to 3D print a case

771
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
and I don't have that.

772
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
But I might be able to work something with duct tape.

773
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
All right.

774
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Let's get into some gaming news.

775
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
We're only, what, an hour into the show?

776
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I haven't touched a bit.

777
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Well, maybe a little news.

778
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
But we're going to get into the bulk of our gaming news tonight right now.

779
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Loki.

780
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
So hey, Sony has actually confirmed that they're going to be working on

781
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
utilizing PlayStation 2 and emulation.

782
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:23,000
So they're trying to get that technology to work on the PlayStation 4

783
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
to be able to bring PlayStation 2 games to the current generation consoles.

784
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And of course, they have nothing further to say at this time.

785
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I still don't understand how it's not possible that the system can't emulate PlayStation 2 games

786
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:44,000
because, hell, a PC can emulate PlayStation 2 games.

787
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And I'm not even talking about a really powerful PC.

788
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
A PlayStation 3 can emulate PlayStation 2 games.

789
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
And I'm not talking about the ones with the backwards compatibility.

790
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
So I would assume that a PlayStation 4 can do that.

791
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Hell, let's not even worry about PlayStation 2 games right now.

792
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
PlayStation 1 games.

793
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
A fucking PSP can run PlayStation 1 games.

794
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Why is that not a thing already on PlayStation 4?

795
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
To be fair, and I'm sure somebody's yelling that back at us

796
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
as they listen to this show, wasn't there the whole major chipset change

797
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
that came between the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4,

798
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
that they changed that type of graphics chip?

799
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I understand that, but it's a PlayStation 1.

800
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
My old phone could emulate a PlayStation 1 game.

801
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I kind of feel like, okay, and that was kind of a question I have,

802
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
is that, okay, if they're going to get the PlayStation 2 games playable,

803
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
then PlayStation 1 would just be a given with that, right?

804
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Because didn't the PlayStation 2 just natively play the PS1?

805
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
And it wasn't even like when the 3s were first out,

806
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
because the PlayStation 3s had a 2 in them, basically.

807
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
They were like 3s and 2s in the same box.

808
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
That's how the emulation worked.

809
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I think they still have the chipset from the 1 in there as well, but...

810
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Yeah, because the 3s played the 1 game. I don't know.

811
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
So I feel like...

812
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
They had the chipset there at one time,

813
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
and then they went and software emulated everything,

814
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
because on the PSP you could do it.

815
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
But that's my thing.

816
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
The PSP can run it.

817
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
The PlayStation 4 can definitely run it.

818
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
You can't tell me there's something that the PSP can run that the PlayStation 4 can't run.

819
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
I'm assuming it must be compatibility stuff,

820
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
because at this point, since the hardware's not in there,

821
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
they're having to turn to software emulation.

822
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
You're right, you can do it through software on the PC,

823
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
but if they're going to be selling these games at whatever price,

824
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
they've got to be able to do it.

825
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
You know what?

826
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
You know what? I'd love to see, actually,

827
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
because we're getting into that whole Windows 10 thing

828
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
where you can use a lot of the Windows 10 apps and stuff,

829
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,000
cross and play with Xbox One and stuff like that.

830
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I would love to see a bleem situation where you're having, you know,

831
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
someone can easily build an emulator, hide it somewhere,

832
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and just, oh hey, they can play PlayStation 1 games on your Xbox One.

833
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Who knows?

834
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
One other thing I kind of want to ask with this whole thing, too,

835
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
is I'm curious to see if they're going to allow it

836
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
where you can put the PlayStation 2 disc in the PlayStation 4,

837
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
and it'll work.

838
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Because now they're getting a little bit,

839
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
this is where the competition is a healthy thing,

840
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
because Microsoft is now really needling PlayStation.

841
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I think in their latest ad, at least the one out of the UK,

842
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,000
they even did a riff on, you remember that PlayStation 4 video

843
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,000
that they showed at E3 that had everybody screaming

844
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
when they said, look how easy it is to play used games on your PlayStation 4.

845
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
And it was like one of the executives handing the game to another one.

846
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
How to play your friends' games or something.

847
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And they kind of smiled, and it's just that easy.

848
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I remember they showed that at E3 and everybody was just screaming laughing

849
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
because it was such an amazing shade throw at Microsoft.

850
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Well, I want to say, Microsoft UK released some video this week

851
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
that was a parody of that, but it was backwards compatibility,

852
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
and they even say in it, you don't have to rebuy your old games.

853
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
You own them. They're yours. That's stupid.

854
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I feel like they even said language that was kind of like,

855
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
you shouldn't have to buy your games again.

856
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
So they're kind of putting baby in a corner here with PlayStation 2.

857
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And I 100% agree, you shouldn't have to rebuy your games.

858
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I think it is stupid, Nintendo, that you have to buy those virtual console games again.

859
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And that they're tied to a console, which I don't have anymore because it broke.

860
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So maybe, question mark, that's the slow down,

861
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
is that what they're trying to do is instead of being able to offer

862
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
select titles for download on the PlayStation 4,

863
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
they're going to open it up so all of them work on the PlayStation 4.

864
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Because then the shade throw, now what they can do

865
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
is they can throw shade right back at Microsoft and be all,

866
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
and it's not just some PlayStation 2 games.

867
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It's not just 104 games. It's all the games.

868
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Well, that's cool that they can say that.

869
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
It's all the games except for the PlayStation 3 games,

870
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
which you don't play on this because if we're comparing generations,

871
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
it's totally different.

872
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
And that's fair and that is still something I think all of us want to see.

873
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
But it's a start. It's better than where we're at now.

874
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I just want something. I mean, it would be nice to have this

875
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
because I did buy some PlayStation 1 games,

876
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
and I just don't feel like hooking up my PlayStation 3 to play them.

877
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,000
And I think there's just so much worth revisiting classic shit

878
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
that so many people didn't play.

879
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
I want them to play Import.

880
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Yeah, that would be great too.

881
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Then I don't have to dig out my JPS 2.

882
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Well, and then there's things out there now like VibRibbon

883
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
that they finally officially released in the U.S., even if digitally.

884
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
But that would be cool that you could play that on the PlayStation 4.

885
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Didn't they say when they released that at E3 or whenever that was

886
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
that they actually said we're working on the PlayStation 4 stuff?

887
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
How long has it been? It's been a little while now.

888
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Well, I think it would make sense that I have Norwegian Lock

889
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
because that's how they were with PS1 games on Xbox.

890
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Not Xbox, what I'm saying. On PS3.

891
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
My assumption is this is imminent with the PlayStation experience.

892
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
The PlayStation experience is in two weeks.

893
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
It's the week before GamerX in San Francisco.

894
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Maybe they have nothing to announce right now

895
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
because they're going to announce it in two weeks.

896
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I kind of feel like if you don't hear it out of that,

897
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
then I don't know what they're planning to do with this,

898
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
but I really feel like this is coming out of PlayStation experience.

899
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,000
And just, again, to tinfoil hat this a little bit,

900
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
didn't they say a long time ago,

901
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
we want to enhance the PlayStation games on PlayStation 4,

902
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
meaning we want trophies.

903
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
We want basically more support of those games.

904
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
So, I mean, if they come out with that at PlayStation experience

905
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and say not only can you emulate the PlayStation 2 games,

906
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
but they have more than they had before,

907
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,000
that's going to be a really, I think, cool addition to the PlayStation 4

908
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
that's going to have a lot of people perking up a little bit.

909
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Even if they don't have the three games.

910
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I mean, yes, I want to see the three games as well.

911
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
You do. We all want to see the three games.

912
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,000
But, I mean, there's still a lot of places where you can get PS1 and PS2 games.

913
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Go to any garage sale or flea market.

914
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
There's a ton of them out there, so we'll see what'll happen.

915
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
All right.

916
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Anyhow, let's move on with some more news,

917
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
and I want to talk a little bit about the Xbox One in all this.

918
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
And the Xbox One getting a feature that was on the PlayStation 4,

919
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
and that is now you can remap buttons on the Xbox One controller.

920
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
It's not quite the same as it is on the Elite controller,

921
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
but it's a lot more than what was there before.

922
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,000
So now there's a centralized way through the Xbox Accessories app

923
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
that launched as part of the whole UI overhaul

924
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
where you can actually swap buttons.

925
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
So you can have one button do the function of another.

926
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So X can do what LB did and so forth.

927
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
However, you cannot remove button functions entirely

928
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
or allow multiple buttons to one function.

929
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
That is still on the Elite controller.

930
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:13,000
But still, it's a pretty big step for people that need that button remapping in their games.

931
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
So that is now available on the Xbox One where it was not before.

932
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Even though it wasn't a part of this story,

933
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
we were talking a little bit with our pal Bobby Blackwolf

934
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
before we went live with our show tonight

935
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
about some of the accessibility changes and so on.

936
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
And something else that came out with this was more narration on Xbox One

937
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
where it now is reading more to you about basically what's going on.

938
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Not that it's going to read for you what's going on in the game,

939
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
but it's telling you a little bit more about what buttons are being pressed and so forth.

940
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:53,000
And funny enough, we were wondering if one of our blind listeners was listening

941
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
because he's called into this show before, Sturlock,

942
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
and he's talked about that experience and so forth

943
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:03,000
so that additional narration would kind of enhance that, I would assume.

944
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And Bobby did let me know in private message.

945
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
He did hear back from Sturlock after he ended his show who said,

946
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
It's pretty amazing. It's leaps and bounds ahead of what Sony has at the moment.

947
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
You can actually do most things, even buying games.

948
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
PlayStation 4 is still extremely limited.

949
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
So that's really rad for accessibility

950
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
and allowing more people to be able to enjoy video games.

951
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
So good move on Microsoft's part.

952
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
All right, let's move on. Darcyra.

953
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Well, we have had a lot of discussion about YouTube

954
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
and how, well, really the discussion has been more complaining,

955
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
which is very us to complain on this show.

956
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
You know what? Yes. Yes, we do.

957
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,000
So they have finally listened or at least responded to the complaints

958
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
about various fair use videos being taken down.

959
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And so they released this statement.

960
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
YouTube receives a lot of takedown requests under copyright law

961
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
asking us to remove videos, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

962
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Sometimes those request target videos that are clear examples of fair use,

963
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

964
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:25,000
So they are really working on trying to analyze if they are legitimate or not

965
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:31,000
by continuing to say that they've set up an initiative.

966
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And I'm going to continue.

967
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
YouTube indemnifies creators whose fair use videos have been subject

968
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
to takedown notices for up to one million of legal costs

969
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:45,000
in the event that takedown results in a lawsuit for copyright infringement.

970
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
This ensures those creators have a chance to protect their work

971
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
and makes the entire creative world better by educating people

972
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:58,000
on both the importance and limits of fair use doctrine.

973
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:05,000
However, this is only available to some people and not all people.

974
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I guess maybe they're taking their biggest, most high-profile users

975
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
and offering them this kind of protection.

976
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,000
So this would prevent the takedown requests from going through.

977
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And if they are sued, then YouTube's going to cover the legal costs.

978
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
That's great.

979
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
And that's one thing I've bitched about for the longest time on this show

980
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:37,000
is where is the fucking accountability of the people filing these copyright takedowns wrongfully?

981
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And why does YouTube not side with the people that are basically giving them the money,

982
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
which is their content creators?

983
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Finally, we're seeing that happen, at least in some capacity.

984
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
And I'm willing to give YouTube the benefit of the doubt

985
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
that they need to test this with a small group before they open it up to more people.

986
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
And I would imagine, especially what they're offering to do there with legal coverage and so forth,

987
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:02,000
you may have to meet a certain threshold of subscribers to qualify for it and so forth, which is fine.

988
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
But I'm so glad that they're putting this accountability in there for the people issuing the takedowns.

989
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:16,000
On the page about the details for this, they give examples of what fair use are using user-created video content.

990
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
It's only US videos for right now.

991
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And overall, really, the hope with this, I think, is that by showing an example of how fair use is,

992
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:38,000
and giving an alternative, that this could spread and give copyright holders a little bit more of an idea of how they should be acting.

993
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
And also, this relates to gaming, certainly for Let's Play and so forth.

994
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:50,000
But I believe one of the people that YouTube is backing right now is, and god, I forget his name at the moment,

995
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
but he's a huge commenter on...

996
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Jim Sterling.

997
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:59,000
That's it. And he actually had the bits and pieces of Metal Gear.

998
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Wasn't it like a read on Konami and then Konami pulled the video?

999
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
No. Well, I mean, that was, you're thinking of Angry Joe, then he had...

1000
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Oh, I got my wires crossed.

1001
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,000
I remember the Metal Gear one where he was talking about Kojima and stuff, and they had pulled down a video.

1002
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Or no, it wasn't him, actually. There was some other dude that did that. I'm sorry, I can't remember who now.

1003
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:25,000
There was somebody that was talking about the whole thing, and then they got their video pulled, and then they got reinstated by YouTube.

1004
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Jim Sterling had some other ones. He normally gets stuff, because he does his best of Steam Greenlight trailers,

1005
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:38,000
and he'll make fun of terrible-looking games, and he gets some of these small indie developers that'll pull that on him.

1006
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Even the way he's doing his fair use, they just don't like it.

1007
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:48,000
He did a video on his thoughts on that. Of course, I haven't watched it yet, but I will link it in the chatroom to watch during the break.

1008
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I did, because I follow him and I watch that stuff.

1009
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,000
He basically talked about that process that he was actually contacted by YouTube about this,

1010
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:03,000
and they kind of went through and how that's going to work with these different types of videos, and they're using that point.

1011
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Well, he sure raised a fuss when it happened, as he should.

1012
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I've also raised a fuss, but I don't have the YouTube following he does.

1013
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,000
He's had several small studios do that to him, too. They'll pull a copyright strike and threaten him,

1014
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
and make all these threats against him and his family, and stuff like that.

1015
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:29,000
It's ridiculous, because if you don't like it, it's criticism, and he's a critic, and too fucking bad.

1016
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So, good. I'm glad to see YouTube is taking steps in that direction. Hooray.

1017
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:42,000
So, that makes me feel a lot better. It's not 100% better, but it's a huge step in the right direction, that's for sure.

1018
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
I'm excited to see how that plays out. Let's move on. Logie.

1019
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Alright. So, along with that, this is kind of another company that I haven't really bought from them before,

1020
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
but I'm aware of them, and the company is called Green Man Gaming.

1021
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It's one of the Steam outlets that you can purchase Steam keys from. There's a lot of different ones out there.

1022
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:12,000
But, I guess they've been running into a problem with different publishers saying that they're not an authorized reseller for their keys.

1023
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So, for example, Witcher 3, the Wild Hunt, when it was coming out, apparently some of the keys, they weren't acquiring them legitimately,

1024
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:29,000
and some were not guaranteed to work. Also, with different new releases like Call of Duty, Black Ops 3, or South of the Screed Syndicate,

1025
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:38,000
both Activision and Ubisoft have contacted them and said that they are a non-authorized reseller,

1026
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:46,000
and some of the DLC that was supposed to be with those games weren't included with it, because they were getting them through some other means.

1027
01:11:47,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And, apparently, Activision and Ubisoft, they're saying that they're not authorized to sell EA, Bethesda, Warner Brothers, and Devolver Digital and ArenaNet games.

1028
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,000
So, I don't know. It's interesting. I guess just be careful who you buy from.

1029
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
But, I thought they were pretty legit. I mean, I know they do sales and everything.

1030
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I still think it's a good thing that the Steam Marketplace does have multiple locations that you can buy things from,

1031
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:26,000
so there's a little bit of competition there, as opposed to some of the other companies out there, or even the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace.

1032
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Some comments from Chad on this over at live.vognetwork.com. William Murderface says,

1033
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,000
There's been murmurs about them since word leaked that there were Witcher 3 keys may have been unauthorized.

1034
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
And Bobby Blackwell says, These are the guys buying Humble Bundles for a dollar and reselling the keys.

1035
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Which is, obviously, extremely tacky behavior.

1036
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I don't remember them exactly being that part of that, but if they are doing that, that's not a good thing to be a part of.

1037
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:04,000
No. Absolutely not. I should say allegedly. I don't know where the story is to back that up, but Bobby doesn't usually throw stuff out there.

1038
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:09,000
I know there's other sites that did that, but yeah, I don't remember them doing that specifically.

1039
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster adding to the Witcher 3 thing says, CD Projekt essentially came out and said they didn't get the keys from them,

1040
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
so I have no idea where they came from because it was a launch title for their GOG Galaxy.

1041
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Well, and the other thing too about their keys, too, is some of them were for other regions, too, so they were sending the SO.

1042
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Who knows where they're getting them? Yeah. Somewhere.

1043
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:41,000
And I've heard of that, too, where some websites will sell Russian keys for games and they sell them way cheaper because...

1044
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Piracy is an issue or something. Yeah. Unfortunately.

1045
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Alright, well, let's move on. Let's talk about Dark Souls 3. I know people are looking forward to that game.

1046
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:02,000
That's a series that's been going on for a while, but the director of the game, Hidetaki Miyazaki, says he doesn't expect that he'll be continuing to make these Dark Souls games.

1047
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:09,000
In an interview with GameSpot, he says that Dark Souls 3 will be the last in the series, or at least that's what he considers.

1048
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:15,000
In the quote, quote, I don't think it'd be the right choice to continue indefinitely creating Souls and Bloodborne games.

1049
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I'm considering Dark Souls 3 to be the big closure on the series. That's not just limited to me, but FromSoftware and myself together want to aggressively make new things in the future.

1050
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I believe that FromSoftware has to create new things. There will be new types of games coming from us, and Dark Souls 3 is an important marker in the evolution of FromSoftware.

1051
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Can one of those be another ChromeHounds game? I don't think they made ChromeHounds, but maybe they did. I don't remember who made that. I know it was published by Sega.

1052
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:49,000
But I know they do Armored Core, and I love Armored Core, although I haven't bought the last few games from them. But I'd love a new Armored Core game. We can make it super hard, too.

1053
01:14:50,000 --> 01:15:02,000
It's a tricky situation, because I'm one of those people that's like, yeah, I want Bioware to make Mass Effect games forever, or at least as long as they're still good.

1054
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
And Dragon Age.

1055
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:14,000
When they start being bad. But I also can kind of respect when he's like, I don't want to do these games forever, and maybe there's a point where I want to end the story, or what have you.

1056
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,000
I sort of think maybe just because he doesn't want to do it doesn't mean somebody else will pick up the rights.

1057
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:30,000
You know, like maybe, who knows, throwing crazy talk out there, like maybe Sony picks up the rights and has one of their in-house people do it or something.

1058
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,000
You know, it doesn't mean these games will stop forever, but I can understand why he doesn't want to be involved with it anymore.

1059
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
So, maybe Konami will pick up the rights and make a pachinko machine out of it.

1060
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Who knows? Anything is possible.

1061
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
And Bobby Blackwolf is confirming FromSoftware developed ChromeHounds.

1062
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Alright, I just couldn't remember. But yes, new ChromeHounds game.

1063
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,000
And Dungeon Buster says, if Dark Souls 3 is the last one, I'm okay with that. Love the series, but I'd love to see what else they can do.

1064
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Yeah, and I think there's a lot of people that are kind of, I think it would be okay to give the series a break.

1065
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Go work on something else for a little while and then maybe revisit Dark Souls on the Playstation 5 or something, if you want.

1066
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
You know, if the fans are really clamoring for that or what have you.

1067
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Alright, and William Murderface says, can we get a PC port of Bloodborne, please, and an Xbox One port too?

1068
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I think there was some type of deal though with Sony on that, because Sony has been putting their promotion dollars in it.

1069
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
So, I don't know. Maybe it's a timed window thing, kind of like Rise of the Tomb Raider, but we'll see.

1070
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates.

1071
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Well, this is an interesting one, although it's kind of a big duh as well.

1072
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:47,000
But there is research. They analyzed 500,000 data points for League of Legends players.

1073
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:56,000
That the usernames are reflective of the type of behavior that people show in game.

1074
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Meaning that usually players who are a bit more profane or antisocial also have usernames that reflect those same type of traits.

1075
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Whereas, you know, people who are kinder and more positive, those who are team builders or leaders, usually have the names that reflect positive traits.

1076
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Kind of a big duh, but at the same time it's just, it's leaning, it's giving an idea of more what to look for, ways to kind of, you know, play safely online.

1077
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:44,000
And they are actually now looking into using these data sets that they've gathered as methods for studying human psychology.

1078
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Ways to find people with clinical disorders who are playing games and whatnot. So, pretty interesting.

1079
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,000
The whole study's been published online. Put out by, looks like the University of York.

1080
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:09,000
So, I mean, even though you kind of say it's a duh, it is kind of an interesting stopping and thinking point about, you know, what is that username that you put out there maybe say about you.

1081
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And we'll get into this a little bit later with the FUGU Question of the Week and so forth.

1082
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:25,000
But I guess it's probably not a big surprise to hear that if somebody has a big name that's like the mixed caps, that's like, you know, Sephiroth misspelled 666.

1083
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:32,000
That person's, maybe, maybe they'll be cool. Actually, we used to have a listener that was like Sephiroth something with numbers. He was cool.

1084
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:38,000
But like, usually there's a lot of guys that use those names and like, you know, devil.

1085
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:42,000
They're also using those to determine age as well.

1086
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Yeah, yeah.

1087
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Because some of those have to, are more having to do with age and maturity level.

1088
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:55,000
But my thought is people that have those names with the mixed case and the punctuation and all that and the leet speak, those are usually the ones that are dirt bags in chat.

1089
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Whereas, you know, if you have somebody that's like cat loving grandma 123, probably not the person that's going to be as aggressive. You know what I mean?

1090
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I mean, I realize some people are always going to be ironic and there's that. That doesn't always work 100% of the time and I wouldn't want to make assumptions.

1091
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:20,000
But I can certainly see where, okay, a good majority of the time, what you kind of put out there is going to be reflective of that a little bit.

1092
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
But it kind of makes me stop and think about, I wonder what my username says about me.

1093
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Like when somebody goes into a match and sees my name, like what they must think about me.

1094
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,000
You guys kind of wonder that maybe like, what do you think your username says about you?

1095
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
He misspelled ski.

1096
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Probably on Twitter and stuff. Or yeah, a lot of people say that. Which is, it's actually funny.

1097
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
It's very lighthearted name.

1098
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:55,000
It's funny you bring that up. Where that comes from, and I haven't told this in a long time on the show, is that I had the name Green Sky years and years and years ago.

1099
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:03,000
And the whole point behind that was, if the sky was green, which I love green, if the sky was green, that would be different but cool.

1100
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
And that's me. I'm different but I'm cool.

1101
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Like that was, I don't know, everybody has a weird story behind their name, but in my mind that's where I got the name from.

1102
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
But then I found out, that name apparently is really popular. And so it's taken on a lot of sites.

1103
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:23,000
So a lot of places I have green s-k-i-e, because I would spell it wrong so I could actually get the name.

1104
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
That's where my gamer tag comes from and all that, right?

1105
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:32,000
But then at one point I was just like, it's a long name and I don't have to be green. So I was just Sky.

1106
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:39,000
But now, honestly, I'm kind of like, I actually kind of want to change. I don't think I really want that name anymore.

1107
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,000
I'm always like, I'm Rob Roberts, but I'm Sky.

1108
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Rob Roberts is my online identity at this point.

1109
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:54,000
So I would like to change my Twitter, if I could, to Rob Roberts, but a spam account has it.

1110
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
So I can't change it.

1111
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I can't change mine to Jamie Summers because it's a porn star.

1112
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
You could.

1113
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Well, and then there's a part of me that's like, should you let go of a four character Twitter name?

1114
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Nope.

1115
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,000
That's some rare real estate. And there's a part of me that's like, maybe I shouldn't actually let go of a four character Twitter name.

1116
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I got hate because someone else wanted Dark Sakura.

1117
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Oh, too bad, so sad.

1118
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Oh, well, there's places that have taken that one as well.

1119
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So I use my fallback, which is Kuro Tsubasa.

1120
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And I have a Gmail name all the time. I'm getting stuff that is not for me.

1121
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Like, and just like, and I get a lot because it's one of those things where it's like a very simple name.

1122
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And I know Bobby has talked about this on his show, too.

1123
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
I'm bringing Bobby up a lot tonight. I should have just had him on Skype as a host tonight.

1124
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
But Bobby, I know he gets that a lot with his name, too, because he's Black Wolf.

1125
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
And I think a lot of people, you know, that's a very, you know, it's kind of like Green Sky.

1126
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:57,000
It's a color object. It's kind of like a very, a thing that people want to grab.

1127
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
So it's interesting to me.

1128
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Loki, what do you think your name might say about you when you play online?

1129
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I don't know.

1130
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Doesn't say much about me until I play with somebody and they're like, I hate that guy.

1131
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:15,000
They probably think of the Thor movies.

1132
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
Yeah, probably. It wasn't from that, though. It was from The Mask, because I was a big Jim Carrey fan.

1133
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:24,000
But I like Loki from the Thor movies as well.

1134
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:31,000
But you know what's funny is that when I play other stuff, like Ingress, I have a very not-so-serious name that I use in Ingress.

1135
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And it's one of those things where it's because I just think, I just think it's funny.

1136
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And it's one of those things where video games aren't serious and it's just a video game.

1137
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:48,000
And so, you know, when it says my name is blowing up your portal, I just want people to kind of chuckle because it's not fucking serious, you know what I mean?

1138
01:22:48,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Yes, and then there's people like, also real player in the area, Phillip gets them wet, that, you know, that is a legit player that happens to be on our side.

1139
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Woo!

1140
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Yeah, there's a lot of people that use the names like 6ix9ine and 666 and, you know, all that stuff. Whatever. It's a video game. It's not that serious.

1141
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Let's see, going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1142
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Dungeonbuster says, I love the really creative ones. One of the neatest ones I've seen for a cleric was Blessedabon.

1143
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I do love a good, funny name. And I, you know, not to toot my own horn, but when I was playing World of Warcraft, I played a monk, a Tauren monk in the Pandaria. I played a Tauren monk named Calmane. And I, you know, usually got a chuckle out of that.

1144
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
I loved making fun names like that. Remember I had Rebecca Black?

1145
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I do, I do.

1146
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I found quotes that I say for the person who was following me around singing.

1147
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,000
But I had Mookal, remember?

1148
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Yeah, I do.

1149
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
M-U-U-C-A-U.

1150
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Mhm.

1151
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And, god, those are fun. And then, of course, the whole RIP characters.

1152
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,000
PrincePeachFuzz in our chatroom says Blaze420.

1153
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Seriously, with a name like that, what do you think most people are going to assume?

1154
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:16,000
When you play a person named Blaze420 on Xbox, what are you going to assume about that person?

1155
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
They're going to be easy to beat because they're high. That's what you're going to assume.

1156
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
They're hot and they're a Taurus.

1157
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:30,000
That's going to be my new online name, HotTaurus, which is funny because I'm actually not a Taurus.

1158
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
But, why not?

1159
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Alright, let's see. And TigerClaw says,

1160
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,000
For years, I wasn't happy with how Google forces your real-life name to show up in your YouTube account

1161
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:44,000
until they changed the rules and I was able to put in my nickname so that it shows up instead of the real life.

1162
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I found out you can put your nickname in first, then put a dot on last name since the dot will be invisible.

1163
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Yeah, the Google forcing your real name thing, that was kind of a mess as well.

1164
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,000
But I think they did kind of go back on that a little bit.

1165
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Anyhow, moving on. Let's talk release dates. We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates.

1166
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Let's start with Loki in the US.

1167
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,000
So there's nothing coming out this week, surprise, because it's Black Friday week and everything.

1168
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:21,000
But, since we're not going to be here next week, I'm going to go ahead and talk about what's coming out in the first,

1169
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:29,000
which of course includes the next purchase I will be making, Just Cause 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as well as PC.

1170
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Also coming out, and I didn't realize this was even coming out now,

1171
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:38,000
but Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, that's coming out on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1172
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Also they have a Kung Fu Panda game, Kung Fu Panda Showdown of Legendary Legends for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

1173
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, 3DS, and I'm assuming on Wii U even though you don't see it on there.

1174
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Well, for some reason they're re-releasing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas yet again on PlayStation 3,

1175
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
so that's also something else to look forward to.

1176
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Xenoblade Chronicles X coming out on Wii U on the Friday, on the 4th.

1177
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,000
And that's it, although looking at the following week, I can't believe that Devil's Third is coming out.

1178
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
I didn't even realize that was coming out. Not that I even give a shit.

1179
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Presumably Chronicles looks good. I'm not sure if I'll pick that up though. Maybe.

1180
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out some releases over there,

1181
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:30,000
such as Blade Arcus from Shiny EX is on the PlayStation 4 from Sega on the 26th of November.

1182
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Farming Simulator 15 is also out for you farmers.

1183
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Also, God Eater Offshot is like a twin pack. Volume 2 is being released on the PlayStation 4 this week.

1184
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:48,000
And Mato Kironai Yugi Itai Daybreak Special Gigs comes out in Japan this week.

1185
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
All of that on the 26th.

1186
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Checking out the Wii U, we do have a release on the Wii U this week. It's Taiko no Tatujin.

1187
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Atsumete Tomodachi Dai Sakusen comes out this week in Japan,

1188
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
so I wish we got those Taiko games here in the US,

1189
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:08,000
but I understand when they tried it, it didn't sell very well, so it is what it is.

1190
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
On the Vita, lots of stuff on the Vita this week,

1191
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
because Vita games in Japan is actually a thing, unlike it is here.

1192
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Criminal Girls 2 in regular and limited edition.

1193
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
The God Eater Offshot I mentioned before is also on the Vita.

1194
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Goze comes out in regular and limited edition this week.

1195
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Kasato in regular and limited edition.

1196
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Net High Ryuyoku no Melodia Diva with the Blessed Dragonol comes out this week on the Vita as well.

1197
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
And Shin Sankoku Musou 7.5 Empires.

1198
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Also, one more.

1199
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Jaigen Taisen Neptune vs. Sega Hard Girls You May Know Gatai Special comes out as well this week.

1200
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I have no idea what this game is. It looks like some type of role-playing game.

1201
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
And I don't know if Sega characters are in it or something,

1202
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
or why it has the word Sega in the title, but I'm not seeing that in the graphics.

1203
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
So, hmm.

1204
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
But there you go.

1205
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Maybe it is Sega characters, because it does say on the Sega logos on there,

1206
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Idea Factory and Compile Heart are all contributing to this game,

1207
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
so maybe there are some Sega-related characters in this.

1208
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
They've had a few of those RPGs that were crossovers between three of those.

1209
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Yeah, and they get more of the crossovers over there than we do here.

1210
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
We don't always get them over here.

1211
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Had them before, I just don't remember when the last one came out.

1212
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
It was like 3DS or DS.

1213
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Right.

1214
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:37,000
This week in Japan on November the 26th, Ikatsu, my number one stage in regular and limited edition.

1215
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:43,000
But, probably more people looking forward to a huge release on November the 28th.

1216
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Monster Hunter X is out on 3DS.

1217
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
That is going to be a pretty big deal.

1218
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
So, that's on the 3DS this week.

1219
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
And that is it for Japanese release dates.

1220
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.

1221
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
We have a few things in the UK.

1222
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Let me make sure I have the right date.

1223
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
On the 24th, we have The Whispered World for iOS.

1224
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:12,000
For the 26th, we have TrackMania Turbo on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

1225
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
And on December 1st, I'll go ahead and extend out a bit,

1226
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,000
we have Just Cause 3 and Rainbow Six Siege.

1227
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
That's it.

1228
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

1229
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
But, Dungeon Buster, talking about the Sega game.

1230
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Saying, haha, Sega Hard Girls.

1231
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
It's an anime with personified consoles.

1232
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Terrible animation, but it has its fans.

1233
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
There you go.

1234
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
I thought that was...

1235
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Maybe I'm confusing it with the other...

1236
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
What was it?

1237
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Of course, now I can't think of the goddamn name of it.

1238
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Hyperdimension Neptunia?

1239
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
That's what I always think when talking about, like,

1240
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
consoleized girls.

1241
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Because, I mean, they're supposed to represent the different game consoles and stuff.

1242
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
But, maybe that's a different series all the other.

1243
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Well, now I'm trying to go back and actually look at the artwork

1244
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
to see if maybe I can see, like, the consoles.

1245
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
That could be, well, I don't know.

1246
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Let's see, I'm trying to bring it up here.

1247
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Of course, I had closed it when I was done reading the dates.

1248
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
But, that's some good insight from Dungeon Buster there.

1249
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
So, I'm actually looking at the artwork.

1250
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I mean, is...

1251
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Oh, that's a Dreamcast controller on her head.

1252
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Okay.

1253
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
That is... I see it now.

1254
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
So, she's got a Dreamcast controller on her head.

1255
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
This one's a Genesis controller.

1256
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
So, okay. I see it now.

1257
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
So, it's consoles as anime ladies.

1258
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
I see now.

1259
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
They did Hyperdimension Neptunia with the original Xbox.

1260
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:43,000
They have a really, really plus-sized woman as the Xbox.

1261
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
The original one.

1262
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Oh, because that thing was...

1263
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
The size of a house.

1264
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Let's move on, Loki.

1265
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:55,000
So, apparently EA has confirmed that they're working on a new Assassin's Creed-type game.

1266
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
And, this is, of course, because, hey, guess what?

1267
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:02,000
They've got, you know, Jade Raymond, you know, joining EA.

1268
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
And...

1269
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
I mean, it just makes sense.

1270
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,000
They said, we've never really operated in the largest genre of gaming.

1271
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
That's the action genre.

1272
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I mean, I don't know.

1273
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
They've had other action games.

1274
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
They've tried to have action games.

1275
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
I mean, I guess they consider a lot of their games shooters.

1276
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
But, they're trying to make, like, an Assassin's Creed-type game.

1277
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,000
So, more open-world, more single-play versus multiplayer.

1278
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Hmm.

1279
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Which, I like single-player games.

1280
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I don't like Assassin's Creed, but...

1281
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I don't know.

1282
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
So, maybe this is something that we could see at E3 next year.

1283
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I just don't like stealth action games, is my thing.

1284
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
And, maybe you don't have to play Assassin's Creed stealth-ly.

1285
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,000
But, I just don't really like stealth games.

1286
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Like, if my Assassin guy would be just kind of like Leroy Jenkins,

1287
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,000
just kicking down the crowd and shooting people in the face.

1288
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
That's not really stealthy, so...

1289
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
He breaks down the door with a ham-sar voice.

1290
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I'm the best Assassin ever!

1291
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Can we just get, like, I mean, here's what I would like to see, okay?

1292
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Let's just back up here.

1293
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
I would like to see, like, a Deadpool through time game.

1294
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
You know, if you want an Assassin game, I want a fucking Deadpool game.

1295
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Like, and you can set them in, like, every single genre that Assassin's Creed's been in,

1296
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
as a pirate back in the, you know, the American Revolution days.

1297
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I'm down with that.

1298
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:23,000
As long as Deadpool's in the game.

1299
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
He's trying to seduce Bea Arthur.

1300
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
I think it would be amazing.

1301
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Alright, I got one more story for you guys, so we're gonna get to the classic game.

1302
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
And speaking of classic games, appropriately,

1303
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:43,000
there's apparently a quest, so to speak, going on right now to bring back Bubsy.

1304
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Do you guys remember Bubsy?

1305
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Yes, I do.

1306
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Yes, I rented that game.

1307
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Yes, the Bubsy Two-fer, which is two of Bubsy's classic adventures,

1308
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Bubsy Two-fer is on Steam Greenlight.

1309
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Oh, man, you can't even get that instantly published?

1310
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Yeah, it's kind of weird that it can't just get instantly published,

1311
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
but for whatever reason, yeah, they want to bring back these classic Bubsy games,

1312
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
and they have this whole hashtag campaign going and so forth,

1313
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
so it'll be interesting to see how the Steam Greenlight goes.

1314
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
It'll get in, because it'll ironically get in.

1315
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
It's getting a lot of coverage as well.

1316
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
There's really terrible games that get, you know, put in there,

1317
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,000
and this is a legitimately old game that's not that great, but it was okay.

1318
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Can we bring back Gex while we're at it?

1319
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Because Gex was pretty fun.

1320
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
And by the way, those two games that are a part of this collection,

1321
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
we have Bubsy in Claw's Encounter of the Ferdkind,

1322
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:40,000
which I believe was the first game, and then Bubsy Two, which has no title.

1323
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Bubsy Two, we're not creative enough for a subtitle.

1324
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,000
So I guess the last update, this is pretty high up on the Steam Greenlight chart,

1325
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
so it seems like a given that this will end up getting greenlit,

1326
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,000
but I'm kind of with you, I'm kind of surprised it didn't just automatically get put through.

1327
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
So, weird.

1328
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
And then folks in chat saying, Alan Alchemy says,

1329
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Bubsy One was amazing, but wasn't the second one shit?

1330
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
And then goes on to correct himself, okay, Bubsy 3D was the bad one.

1331
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Yeah, Bubsy 3D was...

1332
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Bubsy 3D was what pretty much killed the entire franchise.

1333
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,000
So, yeah, hopefully the original...

1334
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
It was an awkward time, it's like puberty,

1335
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
like everybody was getting into the 3D games,

1336
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
they didn't quite know what to do with it,

1337
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,000
and then unfortunately they just shit out Bubsy 3D.

1338
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And there's a lot of really bad 3D games that came out around that time.

1339
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
It was an awkward stage of gaming.

1340
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Kaijuto in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

1341
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I remember Bubsy and the only thing that was good about that game was

1342
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
he tapped the TV screen if you let him stand too long.

1343
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Other than that, the game sucked ass.

1344
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
I didn't think it was that bad, unless it was Bubsy 3D.

1345
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:52,000
But I do remember, the standing still animations are always

1346
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
some of my favorite in games, that's for sure.

1347
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Let's see.

1348
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
And bobbyblackwolf with a reality check saying,

1349
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Just because a game is old, it doesn't mean people will re-buy it on Steam,

1350
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
hence the green light.

1351
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I just kinda, I don't know, I guess I thought people had

1352
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
fonder memories of Bubsy, but maybe,

1353
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
maybe Bubsy 3D has still tainted people to this day,

1354
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
because even Alan was like,

1355
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
it wasn't one of those games, real shit.

1356
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Let's see, and tigerclaw is asking,

1357
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
you guys remember the Bubsy animated cartoon?

1358
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
No, didn't that not become a thing?

1359
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
I remember there was one, but I don't think I ever watched it.

1360
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Whenever I think of an animated cartoon like Bubsy,

1361
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I would think like, what was that, was it Bonkers or something?

1362
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
It was something that was part of the Disney lineup or whatever.

1363
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Alan Alchemy in chat at live.fognetwork.com saying,

1364
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,000
King's Quest VIII equals worst game to come out of the proto-3D-as-the-norm

1365
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Quake Half-Life 3D Awkward Puberty era.

1366
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Yes, talk about a franchise killer.

1367
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I mean, King's Quest VIII pretty much killed that franchise until like,

1368
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
just recently they did the whole, you know,

1369
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
kinda re-imagining of the series on consoles,

1370
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
but those games play very differently.

1371
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
What about like Dragon's Lair 3D?

1372
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Didn't they do like a 3D Dragon Lair game that wasn't very good either?

1373
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
I feel like they did like a real Dragon's Lair, something that was on like Xbox,

1374
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
like original Xbox or something.

1375
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
So, anyway, let's move on.

1376
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
We would need to get into the classic game of the week.

1377
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
We're running kinda long tonight, believe it or not,

1378
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,000
but we do need to step into the vault where every week

1379
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1380
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,000
hey, play some cute music and put on this game.

1381
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
And this game is one with cute music,

1382
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
actually we're gonna talk about it tonight.

1383
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:37,000
Dark Sakura, taking us to Japan tonight to visit the classic game of the week, right?

1384
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1385
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Classic game of the week is Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.

1386
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Yes, I'm doing this one.

1387
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
And I realize I've already done Super Mario 2 or Super Mario USA.

1388
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I am specifically doing Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.

1389
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Because I want to go into this for a particular reason.

1390
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Nintendo has sold out.

1391
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,000
They've done it several times in the past.

1392
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,000
You know, two of the times that they did this,

1393
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
and this is of course going back to the 80s,

1394
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
and yes, Garris makes my heart go Doki Doki, thank you, Alan.

1395
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
But three times in the past, and this is one of those times,

1396
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,000
did Nintendo sell out.

1397
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:35,000
One of them was with Kete Kita Mario Brothers,

1398
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:40,000
where they just were advertising stuff the whole time by reskinning Mario Brothers.

1399
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:43,000
There was On Night Nippon Super Mario Brothers,

1400
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
which was another reskinning of Super Mario Brothers.

1401
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And then there was this.

1402
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,000
This among those was the first time that it was a full game meant to advertise.

1403
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I was gonna say the real big time that they sold out was probably the CDI games.

1404
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
I'm talking about for advertising.

1405
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:08,000
So anyway, Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic,

1406
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:12,000
which will translate to Dream Factory Heart Pounding Panic,

1407
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:22,000
was released in conjunction with a very limited event that happened in Japan.

1408
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:28,000
It was for the Yume Kojo 87, which was a carnival done by Fuji TV

1409
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:33,000
to promote its fall lineup of shows.

1410
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:39,000
It was a big carnival, and one of the things that they had going on

1411
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:47,000
was a sort of dedicated Rio de Janeiro style carnival with masks and everything,

1412
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:51,000
which of course was also mildly influenced by Marty Roth.

1413
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:57,000
This only happened for about a month and twelve days.

1414
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:01,000
It lasted from July 18th to August 30th, 1987.

1415
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
So it wasn't very long.

1416
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:08,000
And a lot of the ads for this were masks.

1417
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Just all these masks.

1418
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,000
And a lot of the styles of the masks showed up in the Japanese version of the game.

1419
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:25,000
So how the shy guy and the little bird hopper guy and all of these things were wearing the masks.

1420
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,000
And you had a mask motif in the background.

1421
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:35,000
What for us were the mushroom blocks were actually different types of masks.

1422
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
One of them looking very much like Gene Simmons, I must say.

1423
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,000
The characters in the game were the mascots from the carnival,

1424
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:49,000
which had sort of an Arabian Nights kind of theme.

1425
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:59,000
So you had the main character who was Imogene, and then Mama, Lina, and Papa.

1426
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And they were going into a bedtime story where Wart was a character in the story

1427
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
and he kidnapped their children Pokey and Peaky.

1428
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
So there was...

1429
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,000
It was really in its core advertising.

1430
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:23,000
However, we got a really good game out of it.

1431
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Kind of a confusing game at first, but a really good game.

1432
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:32,000
And I really more wanted to go into the backstory of how this came into play.

1433
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Because not too many people...

1434
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I mean, people know that, yeah, it was the You Make Hojo game,

1435
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:47,000
but they don't really know how it came about or what You Make Hojo was or any of this other stuff going on.

1436
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,000
So other things this game had in it, as far as big differences,

1437
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
is that you had to beat it with all four characters to get the ending.

1438
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Oh my god. Can you imagine beating Super Mario Brothers 2 with Toad?

1439
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Yes.

1440
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Not for me, no thank you.

1441
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Peach or Luigi all the way.

1442
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
It's funny, Luigi was Mama.

1443
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And Luigi actually has a higher jump than Mama did.

1444
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So some of those were changes.

1445
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
You could not run.

1446
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:24,000
The run feature was something that had been a Mario thing,

1447
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:29,000
so they didn't implement it until they put the Mario stuff on it.

1448
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,000
In the Japanese version, you could kill Wart in four moves.

1449
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
They bumped it up to two in Super Mario 2.

1450
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
But in the prototype, it was four.

1451
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Bumped it up to six.

1452
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Yeah, bumped it up to six, sorry.

1453
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
They bumped it up by two.

1454
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Sound effects change, like the little creatures don't scream when you kill them.

1455
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
The Fanto actually was also redesigned.

1456
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
You had different masks as well.

1457
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
And it wasn't as...

1458
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:09,000
It wasn't as, I'd say, aggressive as it is in Super Mario Brothers 2.

1459
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:14,000
The White Mouser was changed because he was actually super hard and very erratic,

1460
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
so they put in Claw Grip, who was not in the original version at all.

1461
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
The sound effects are the big thing I noticed.

1462
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
You can even hear it in this Birdo fight.

1463
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Let me turn it up a little bit.

1464
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Yep, it's screeching.

1465
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,000
What's the mask? Look at the gate.

1466
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:38,000
The gate's a masked bird instead of the, sort of, falcon-looking thing.

1467
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:48,000
The Gray Sniffit is in the manual for it, but didn't show up in the Japanese version.

1468
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:51,000
The musical score shortened a little bit.

1469
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:57,000
The Subspace music was its own. It was sort of an Arabian theme.

1470
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Oh, here it is.

1471
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Dammit, it just passed by.

1472
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
You could hear it in the background for a little bit there.

1473
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
The character playing this just went into Subspace.

1474
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:11,000
The Starman is in there, but a different music plays.

1475
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Your mushrooms, where you go to gain extra life, are hearts.

1476
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Which makes sense that you have the hearts on the side.

1477
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
You have a save feature in the game.

1478
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Some of the sound effects actually had to do with the fact that it was the disk system versus the NESP,

1479
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
so it had different, with the different pin connectors.

1480
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Actually, you can go back and play this one, because that's a little bit longer of a theme.

1481
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Oh, they're already out of Subspace?

1482
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Yeah.

1483
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,000
That's a good one.

1484
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Um, anyway.

1485
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Some of the platforms were changed around.

1486
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Some of the artwork was different.

1487
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Okay, so here it is.

1488
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:14,000
The animations were, uh, they actually added animations for the US version,

1489
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
so they improved upon that.

1490
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Which was really weird, because in some games, like Contra, they removed animations.

1491
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:30,000
The explosion blocks say bomb B-O-M instead of bomb, and the bomb thing was just for Super Mario Bros. 2.

1492
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Some of the vegetables looked different as well.

1493
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,000
The one up mushrooms were the heads of whatever character that you were controlling,

1494
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
and the potions were actually lamps.

1495
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
They were magic lamps.

1496
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,000
One thing that was very big is that when you could pull up a shell in the US point,

1497
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:50,000
in the Japanese one in Doki Doki Panic, it was actually a little head.

1498
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:57,000
And it was in the game called the Big Head, but it was actually a face in blackface.

1499
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:06,000
So, granted, that's a pretty good reason to get rid of that, given that's a very, I'd say, racially insensitive thing.

1500
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000
So yeah, a few things were different about the ending.

1501
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:18,000
You, uh, instead of rescuing Subcons, you rescued Pokey and Peaky,

1502
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,000
and you're standing on their cage while they're still inside it.

1503
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
You know, you don't get the-

1504
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Oh, here's the star music.

1505
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
It's different. It sounds like something out of Kid Icarus or something.

1506
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Yeah.

1507
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Another thing is that you don't get the who beat how many number of levels,

1508
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
because, honestly enough, you have to play through the game with everyone.

1509
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Yeah.

1510
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,000
So, there's a need.

1511
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
And so, that's it.

1512
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:51,000
That is the differences with Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic and why the game exists.

1513
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:54,000
It's basically Nintendo giving advertising.

1514
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I like some of these comments in chat here over at live.vognetwork.com.

1515
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
S2100matt saying,

1516
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Seriously, Mouser doesn't get that much love in Mario games anymore.

1517
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:10,000
You know, a lot of the characters from Doki Doki that crossed over into the Mario universe,

1518
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
you know, kind of retconned in, essentially,

1519
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
you see Shy Guy a lot today, but that's really the only one.

1520
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Like, you don't see a lot of the other Mario 2 mobs,

1521
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
and it always kind of, you know, and I know I've said this on a show before,

1522
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:27,000
I'm always kind of surprised that Wart never came back as a villain in any other game.

1523
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Is he just, does he just suck compared to Bowser?

1524
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Maybe he actually died.

1525
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Mario actually murdered him.

1526
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:40,000
The sub-cons executed him, and Mario went back to the real fucking universe,

1527
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
where somehow there are Shy Guys,

1528
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:47,000
which my theory about the Shy Guys is that when they take off their masks,

1529
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,000
they're the big blue puffy things hanging around in Klonoa's universe.

1530
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Akdeft is screaming in chat because, in all caps,

1531
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
because he was a dream, he never existed.

1532
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Okay, like, this is a fucking video game, people.

1533
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Like, that could stop the story from, I mean, come on.

1534
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,000
It doesn't matter. He could still, he could still be a villain in a game.

1535
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I'm linking a few of the posters for the game, the promotional art,

1536
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:15,000
that, um, it's kind of interesting because it actually does show, um,

1537
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Mario and Peach with the characters that they replaced.

1538
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Um, I just find it very interesting, you know, um,

1539
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:31,000
it was really, I'd say, you know, and given, I mean,

1540
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
now this is sort of common knowledge now,

1541
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
the real reason why it became Super Mario Bros. 2 over here

1542
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
is because the lost levels are fucking hard.

1543
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:43,000
What we got is the lost levels were hard, but that was Super Mario 2.

1544
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,000
And it was actually in that game that Luigi got his higher jump.

1545
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:54,000
So, since then, though, this game has had a big influence

1546
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
on the rest of the Mario games, because you think about it,

1547
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Peach has always had her floating in any game that she's played in.

1548
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Yeah, and Act Deft actually said,

1549
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
I like how they transferred the abilities in Super Mario Bros. 2

1550
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,000
to Super Mario 3D World.

1551
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Well, now then, that part of the dream ended up working out, didn't it?

1552
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
See what I mean? They can bring back what they want.

1553
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
It doesn't matter, it was a dream.

1554
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,000
And Toad was the fast puller, a little lighter on his feet.

1555
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
He knows how to pull out.

1556
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Mario was always the middle-of-the-road guy. He's the reliable one.

1557
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,000
And Luigi has his weird floppy legs.

1558
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And I would always call him Crazy Legs Luigi,

1559
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,000
ever since I was a kid, ever since playing this game.

1560
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,000
DartTet Studio says,

1561
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I'm sure I mentioned it before,

1562
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,000
but Video Game Historian did a thing on Super Mario Bros. 2 and Doki Doki Panic,

1563
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
and seems like those characters were from Fuji TV,

1564
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
so maybe that's part of why. I didn't realize that.

1565
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
No, they were mascots for this event.

1566
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:50,000
For the Yume Kojo 87.

1567
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Because the theme of their carnival was an Arabian theme,

1568
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:58,000
and they created the mascot.

1569
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
I see.

1570
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:02,000
And his whole family and everything was specifically for that,

1571
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:03,000
but all the masks...

1572
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
The family never came over.

1573
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
They were...

1574
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
The family doesn't come over in Mario Bros. 2.

1575
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
They changed them to Mario and Luigi.

1576
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Oh, well, yeah, all of them changed.

1577
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Even Ima Jean, the main character.

1578
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Mama was replaced by Luigi.

1579
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
What was the girl's name again?

1580
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
The dad is Toad.

1581
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Papa is Toad.

1582
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Yeah.

1583
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
And I'm trying to find the girl's name again,

1584
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
because I had it a second ago.

1585
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Lina. Her name was Lina.

1586
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
That's it.

1587
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:39,000
And she got...

1588
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
But yeah, that last picture they posted in chat room

1589
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,000
was from a telephone card.

1590
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:47,000
They did a lot of promotion for the event and for the game,

1591
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:51,000
and it really seems like a lot of work to go into this,

1592
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
and that carnival thing was huge.

1593
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
It was a really big thing,

1594
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
but it only happened for just over a month.

1595
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
So that's really the part that blows my mind.

1596
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
It's like where the World's Fair used to be years and years ago.

1597
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
I guess, but this is really...

1598
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
And I guess Nintendo is still doing it,

1599
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
because they sold out with Mercedes.

1600
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
That's true.

1601
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,000
It hasn't ended. It hasn't ended.

1602
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Alright.

1603
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Yeah, but that's really it.

1604
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:21,000
There it is.

1605
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
It's basically Nintendo advertises for Fuji TV.

1606
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
There it is, your classic game of the week,

1607
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,000
Doki Doki Panic,

1608
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,000
the game that would become the Super Mario Brothers 2

1609
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,000
that we know here in the US.

1610
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Alright, we are going to take a break.

1611
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
We're running long tonight, but that's good.

1612
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,000
We're having some good discussion.

1613
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
We're going to have a little more.

1614
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
When we come back, after a quick break with you guys,

1615
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
your emails, your phone calls,

1616
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
the Fuqua Question of the Week,

1617
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
and more news when Orange Lounge Radio returns,

1618
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
right after this.

1619
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,

1620
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,000
live tonight with episode number 622 of our show

1621
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,000
for November the 15th of 2015.

1622
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
We're having a pretty long show tonight.

1623
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Funny how that works sometimes.

1624
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
We had a lot to talk about in the beginning of the show,

1625
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
a lot of anniversaries to celebrate in gaming with this,

1626
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
leading up to the big Thanksgiving holiday,

1627
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
and of course, the shopping,

1628
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
and I'm using my quotey fingers,

1629
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:21,000
holiday that comes with that Black Friday.

1630
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,000
I'm curious, anybody in here planning on venturing out

1631
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,000
on any of that Black Friday stuff?

1632
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,000
I don't support it.

1633
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Yeah, it's not for me.

1634
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
I can't deal with the crowds.

1635
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,000
No.

1636
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I actually have to work this year.

1637
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I don't have Friday off,

1638
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
which is a little different for me.

1639
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,000
But, you know, there's a lot of people out there

1640
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
working hard that work on Thanksgiving,

1641
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
and not even just retail,

1642
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,000
although certainly a lot of people in retail just get,

1643
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
oh my God, they get put through the ringer this week,

1644
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:51,000
so my prayers for you all.

1645
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Isn't there supposed to be some steam sale going on or something?

1646
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
A lot of restaurants, movies.

1647
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Is there a steam sale?

1648
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
There's a steam sale coming up.

1649
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
They're doing a fall one,

1650
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,000
and then they're doing a winter one as well towards the new year,

1651
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
and then this time, I hope it's not a story they were going over.

1652
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
No, this time they're doing, like, it's different.

1653
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
They're not going to have the flash sales or anything.

1654
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
It's just going to be a sale.

1655
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Here's the price.

1656
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,000
That's it.

1657
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,000
That's probably for the best.

1658
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
They did a lot with the whole robot game last time.

1659
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Well, I don't know if you saw me.

1660
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:25,000
I was looking at Red Box

1661
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
because they're selling off some of their games

1662
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
between now and Black Friday for like under $10.

1663
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Like they had Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and Ghosts.

1664
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:39,000
It's not my cup of tea, but Assassin's Creed Unity was like $9.

1665
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
I was trying to get Far Cry 4,

1666
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:45,000
but yeah, good luck finding a kiosk that has a game from last year

1667
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
still in their kiosks.

1668
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:51,000
And if you do buy it, good luck at being actually a diss.

1669
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:56,000
If there is a sale coming up, does that mean I can maybe get 10% off Fallout 4?

1670
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Too early for that?

1671
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I don't know.

1672
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
You never know.

1673
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Maybe.

1674
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
You all right over there, Dark Sakura?

1675
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Wasabi Kit-Kats.

1676
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Ugh, it's too spicy.

1677
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:09,000
I want the Sakura Matcha Kit-Kats, but it's a little expensive.

1678
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Oh my gosh.

1679
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Someone send me some.

1680
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
You're going to be full of Kit-Kats.

1681
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,000
You're going to turn into a Kit-Kat.

1682
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
You're going to eat so many of them.

1683
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
All right.

1684
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Let's give me a break.

1685
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
You mean to break you off a piece of that Kit-Kat bar?

1686
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Yes.

1687
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:25,000
I believe that was the joke, Loki.

1688
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Yes, I believe that was the joke.

1689
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:33,000
It's just a little bit of highbrow pun there, but I kind of gave her a dirty look for it

1690
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
anyway.

1691
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
All right.

1692
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Let's please get back into some gaming news quick before Jamie tells another joke.

1693
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Get back into gaming news.

1694
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
So, let's see.

1695
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,000
So, for rapid fire news, we've got Telltale confirming that they are working on season

1696
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
two of Game of Thrones.

1697
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Apparently the first one sold pretty well.

1698
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
So, hey, why not?

1699
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Because, you know, the fans are asking for it.

1700
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
So, let's keep it going.

1701
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
So, I'll have to look forward to that.

1702
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,000
I still have not played the first season, and I know I think I had the first episode

1703
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
free, so I may have to check it out.

1704
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:12,000
So, with each Black Ops game that comes out, they have, like, of course, you know, the

1705
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Nuketown map.

1706
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:19,000
And this time, and of course each one has a little Easter egg, usually involving the

1707
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
mannequins.

1708
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
This time they have some robot mannequins.

1709
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:27,000
If you shoot the arms off of them, it kind of, within two minutes, and that's off of

1710
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:34,000
all the mannequins, it turns into this, like, I don't know, really crazy, like a creepy

1711
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
weeping angel thing.

1712
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
And if you don't know what the weeping angels are, those are basically like these monsters

1713
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
that when you look at them, they're completely still.

1714
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,000
You turn your back to them, they run up to you to try to kill you.

1715
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
And so, that's what happens in the game.

1716
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,000
And then when you do that, all the robots start chasing after you when you're not looking

1717
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,000
at them, and you turn around and just like in mid-pose, like striking at you and stuff

1718
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
like that, and it's crazy.

1719
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:00,000
But then they can actually hurt you in the game.

1720
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:05,000
So, that's something to check out if you decide you don't want to play multiplayer on Nuketown

1721
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
and you want to kill two minutes by shooting all the arms off of the robots, then go right

1722
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
ahead and check out that Easter egg.

1723
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:16,000
And speaking of kind of like a Silent Hill type of Easter egg, Norrin Reedus has come

1724
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:20,000
out saying basically Silent Hills still needs to happen.

1725
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,000
And he's super bummed that the whole thing just kind of blew up.

1726
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Basically saying the internet buzz about Silent Hills happening was so huge.

1727
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,000
I've never seen anything like it, petitions with hundreds of thousands of people that

1728
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,000
signed it, petitions to please make it happen.

1729
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
That's crazy.

1730
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:40,000
That's a crazy fan base for not just a video game, but also for people making that video

1731
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
game.

1732
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:45,000
And for me to jump on that truck with him, I was like holy balls, it has to happen.

1733
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:48,000
You need to do this.

1734
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
And then of course Konami said fuck that.

1735
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:58,000
We're just going to make a pachinko slot machine out of that.

1736
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Why is it like every week on this show we have a story about how Silent Hills is just

1737
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
continuing to disappoint us?

1738
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Because it was like such an amazing thing.

1739
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Like the last few Silent Hill games have been kind of meh.

1740
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
And then they're like, hey guess what?

1741
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
We're going to do this shit fucking right.

1742
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:17,000
And it's just like the way they announced it was right, the people behind it, it just

1743
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:18,000
felt so good.

1744
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:22,000
And then Konami's like, fuck it.

1745
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,000
It's like the greatest tease of them all.

1746
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Aside from Half-Life 3.

1747
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Alright.

1748
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Let's move on and talk about Rock Band.

1749
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
And guess what?

1750
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Rock Band 4 is going to be getting an update.

1751
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Which is good because it kind of needed one.

1752
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:42,000
So it's getting an update on December 8th.

1753
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
And some of the features that will be going into the game.

1754
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Leaderboard and friend challenging.

1755
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
More detailed song results.

1756
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
In-depth statistics.

1757
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Improved calibration.

1758
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
More items in the rock shop.

1759
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,000
A mode that automatically plays the drums kick pedal for you.

1760
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Which is something, you know, again we talked about accessibility earlier.

1761
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:01,000
People have been asking for that for a while.

1762
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:02,000
So that's good that's there.

1763
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
And also I just suck at using the kick pedal.

1764
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
And there's that too.

1765
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:11,000
And a full combo tracker that marks which songs have been full comboed.

1766
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
And gives you an in-song indicator to show if you're doing it.

1767
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Or if you have actually broken your combo.

1768
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,000
And the tracks from Rock Band 3 will finally be able to be imported into Rock Band 4.

1769
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Not hearing anything about, I don't know if that includes Rock Band 2 and 1.

1770
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Because that's 3.

1771
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
But we'll see.

1772
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:33,000
So anyway it sounds like a lot more features coming out on December 8th.

1773
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Maybe what should have been there when the game came out.

1774
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
But I guess better late than never, right?

1775
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
So there's that to look forward to.

1776
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Moving on, Don't Starve Shipwrecked.

1777
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Which, you know, if you played the original Don't Starve.

1778
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Which a lot of people have lost many hours to that game.

1779
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:53,000
It was one of the early PlayStation 4 download games.

1780
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
And of course it's done very well on Steam as well.

1781
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:58,000
But Don't Starve is getting an expansion called Shipwrecked.

1782
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
And it's coming out on Steam early access on December 1st.

1783
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:08,000
New seasons, new creatures, new biomes, and many other new ways to die.

1784
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
Hooray!

1785
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Many different types of job classes to hopefully not die as you're playing Final Fantasy Explorers.

1786
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
That's right, 21 jobs announced for the game.

1787
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Which is weird to say that they've announced them because the game has been out in Japan for some time.

1788
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:29,000
But I guess it would be appropriate to say some of the PR push is starting now.

1789
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
And this is one of the early PR things that they're putting out there.

1790
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Is here are all the classes you can play in Final Fantasy Explorers.

1791
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Which include things that, you know, if you're playing Final Fantasy XIV or other Final Fantasy games.

1792
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:46,000
You probably are familiar with things like Machinist, White Mage, Black Mage, Dark Knight, Bard.

1793
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
You probably know all those classes.

1794
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,000
But there are some other long time dormant Final Fantasy classes that are coming back.

1795
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Such as Sage, Alchemist, Blue Mage, Geomancer.

1796
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I know those were in Final Fantasy XI, but I haven't seen those otherwise.

1797
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Blue Mage.

1798
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Yeah, lots of fun stuff coming to the game there.

1799
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
So I'm excited to pick that up.

1800
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Even if it is a little different than your normal Final Fantasy game.

1801
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Because it's a little more Monster Hunter.

1802
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I still want to check that out when it comes out in January here in the States.

1803
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Dark Sakura.

1804
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
Excitement!

1805
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:22,000
There is, I didn't announce this to anybody.

1806
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:28,000
But I broke my, um, I popped my Kickstarter cherry.

1807
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
With this one.

1808
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:35,000
The Hot to Full Boyfriend plushie Kickstarter has passed $95,000.

1809
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:40,000
When I went to check on my contribution, it actually passed $100,000.

1810
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:43,000
So, um, all of the birds are unlocked.

1811
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
There's limited stock.

1812
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:51,000
For people who earlier pledged the $25 tier and up.

1813
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:58,000
You actually get to pick one more bird.

1814
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,000
You can add another one for $12 each one.

1815
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
I got emails on it.

1816
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:09,000
The $25 tier, by the way, gives you shoes so he can stab you in the back while you sleep.

1817
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
You get Ryota, who is adorable.

1818
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:14,000
And you get Okasan, who is really funny.

1819
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
So, those are great.

1820
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:26,000
And then, um, Capcom has confirmed a second round of Street Fighter V characters.

1821
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Um, well, they've put out shadowy images of them.

1822
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:37,000
But the thought is that it's Alex, Guile, Ibuki, Balrog, Juri, and Urien.

1823
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
So, who knows.

1824
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:48,000
And then, um, last but not least, um, the Mega Man Legacy Collection will not have a physical release in Europe.

1825
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:53,000
It looks like it's going to be, uh, download only.

1826
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:58,000
So you do not have a chance of getting the gold Mega Man amiibo.

1827
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Sorry.

1828
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
That's it.

1829
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:07,000
Alright, let's go to the FUGL question of the week.

1830
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

1831
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
And we read some of our favorite answers on the air.

1832
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,000
And if you're not following us on Facebook, you should be our friend.

1833
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Be my friend on Facebook.

1834
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1835
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,000
You can also, if you're one of those that's like, oh, I don't do Facebook, then maybe you're on Google Plus.

1836
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:40,000
And you can add us over there at Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

1837
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
This week's FUGL question of the week is about a story that Dark Soccer was talking about earlier.

1838
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Uh, where, what does your username say about you?

1839
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:51,000
So we asked our listeners tonight, what is your username when playing online games?

1840
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,000
And what do you hope that says about you to the other people playing?

1841
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
This is probably a tricky question because we didn't get as many responses as we usually do.

1842
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
But we did get a few good ones here.

1843
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Um, Brad's starting us off tonight over on Facebook saying, my username on just about every platform is Pod Culture.

1844
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,000
What it says is that I am not above shameless plugging for my podcast.

1845
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Excellent answer. Excellent answer.

1846
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
As you, as you shouldn't be. It's a great show too.

1847
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Uh, Tiger Claw is responding to us on Facebook saying, my username has always been Tiger Claw since day one.

1848
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,000
The name was taken from the video game Wing Commander, which had a ship called the Tiger Claw.

1849
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
You know, I don't think I ever realized that.

1850
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
And Wing Commander was an awesome game.

1851
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,000
He probably told this story at some point like six years ago, but I forgot.

1852
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:42,000
So that's a great, Wing Commander series is awesome.

1853
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
Um, so that's cool.

1854
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Uh, it was a name that has stuck with me ever since.

1855
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
And what does it say about me? I don't really know.

1856
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:53,000
But recently there's a new character in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series on Nickelodeon called Tiger Claw as well.

1857
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Which is why I changed all my avatars to reflect that character.

1858
02:02:56,000 --> 02:03:01,000
I never thought I'd see the day where a nickname I've been using for many years is also the name of a character.

1859
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
That just puts a smile on my face.

1860
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:07,000
They must have seen your tweets because you were a big supporter of the Ninja Turtles movie and all that stuff.

1861
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:10,000
That was a shout out to you, bro.

1862
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:15,000
That's, you never know. At least it's fun to think that, right?

1863
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Alright, how about Redertainment who responds and says, I am Redertainment.

1864
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:22,000
What I hope my name says is that I am entertaining and red.

1865
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Also, names don't necessarily correlate with behavior.

1866
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,000
I mean, my real name is Hunter and I've never once hunted.

1867
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Rob doesn't rob people and Jamie doesn't, well, what is it to Jamie somebody? Is it dirty?

1868
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:39,000
The name is the female version of James which means a supplanter.

1869
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Oh.

1870
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I've looked it up.

1871
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Um, for the record, this is talking about nicknames.

1872
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
So these are names that you would be choosing yourself.

1873
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I see.

1874
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,000
But do you celebrate Arbor Day, just out of curiosity?

1875
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
That has nothing to do with planting.

1876
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,000
With planting a tree.

1877
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,000
Subplanting.

1878
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Oh, sorry, I heard planting.

1879
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Alright, moving on. Fat Cylon responded and said, fat because I'm fat, not p-h-a-t.

1880
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Cylon because, well, I have a plan.

1881
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
I have a plan.

1882
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
I'm sorry, I love that answer.

1883
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
It's just, it's very direct.

1884
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
It's very, it's just very like, you know, hey, here it is.

1885
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I have a plan.

1886
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Cyber Judge responds and says, I use Cyber Judge in games most of the time.

1887
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:37,000
However, since Blizzard's naming policy about no titles caused me to not be able to have Judge in my name back when I played WoW,

1888
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:42,000
I now use names like C.Y. Jaden, I think is how you pronounce that. Sorry if I mispronounced that.

1889
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I don't think my name says anything about me. Maybe seeing Cyber Judge, you think I'm a Judge. I'm not.

1890
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:53,000
I came up with that name because my real name was also a TV Judge's name, and co-workers started calling me Judge.

1891
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Judge was just too popular of a name, so I added Cyber to it.

1892
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,000
I figured you would just like, judge people on the internet or something.

1893
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Alright, anyhow.

1894
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:11,000
ActDeft responds to us over on Google+, saying, I've used Deft and many variations of it as my handle since I ever started using the internet,

1895
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
and I keep using it just for recognition purposes.

1896
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:17,000
Usually most people don't know what it means and probably don't expect something about it.

1897
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:29,000
And lastly, PrincePeachFuzz responds to us on Google+, and says, I came up with PrincePeachFuzz because I was facially follicle challenged.

1898
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Again, another very honest, direct answer, but I actually love that name. PrincePeachFuzz is a pretty great name, I gotta say.

1899
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:42,000
So there you go. Thank you guys for sharing those stories and answering. I know we didn't get a lot of answers tonight.

1900
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Probably because I posted the question really late, because I got back from Reno like three hours before the show, so it was a little later than usual.

1901
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:53,000
But I appreciate the answers nonetheless. And I learned something about some of you this week, where your names come from.

1902
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I want to hear more stories.

1903
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Would you guys go answer the question anyway, even if I don't read them on air, just because I'm curious?

1904
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I want to know where some of your names come from. I'd be curious.

1905
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,000
So just humor me and answer the question throughout the week.

1906
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Alright, let's get back into some longer news. Loki.

1907
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Alright, and I was actually just checking this out right now, although I didn't actually do anything.

1908
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
I may have to restart my level in order to get this to show.

1909
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,000
But there's been a new update to Minecraft Pocket Edition, or Windows 10.

1910
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
I'm still pissed off that it's the Pocket Edition that it's based off of.

1911
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,000
But they upgraded to 0.13. And what did they add with this?

1912
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Well, they added some of the basic redstone mechanics.

1913
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:42,000
So they have the redstone torches, the redstone dust, also some of the pressure plates, buttons, that kind of thing.

1914
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,000
The Nether. I'm surprised they didn't have the Nether there, but the Nether's there now.

1915
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Enchanting and, I guess, brewing as well.

1916
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:57,000
And then also they've added rabbits to the game.

1917
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And sandstone temples and desert bottoms.

1918
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Like seriously, it's been so long I've played the PC version, there was not rabbits in the fucking PC version.

1919
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Like I need to go back to the PC version, it's probably going to be a completely different game for me when I see that.

1920
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I'd be like, what the fuck is all this shit going on?

1921
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Like I see these videos, my son watches with puffer fish and shit, and I'm like, what the fuck is that?

1922
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
I'm like, I don't know that character.

1923
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:25,000
But yeah, it's available as a free update, so if you haven't checked it out yet, you should definitely play it.

1924
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:34,000
But what's the most frustrating thing though is that this game runs so well on the Windows 10 edition, but it's just not up to the PC yet.

1925
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
And there's no mod support.

1926
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:39,000
I noticed you were playing Minecraft during the break, was that the Windows 10 version?

1927
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Yeah, it was.

1928
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
But it's not, you don't have the updated one yet.

1929
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Oh you do?

1930
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Yeah.

1931
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Is it getting better?

1932
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Is it getting there?

1933
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Yeah, it's getting better.

1934
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I mean, I'm just playing the creative, or not creative, survival mode thing that's like wasting time now.

1935
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I may have to start over in order to get the rabbits and stuff, but I don't know.

1936
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:58,000
It's alright.

1937
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:01,000
I just am kind of bored because I'm playing by myself.

1938
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:06,000
That's why I kind of want to look into the mods so it's more of a challenge and stuff.

1939
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Alright.

1940
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Well, I need to check out the Windows 10 Minecraft updates.

1941
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:19,000
But yeah, I really wanted to get to where the original PC version was at, but with the graphics rendering of the Windows 10 version.

1942
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
The Windows 10 one runs awesome.

1943
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
If they would just make a new client for the PC version, I'm fine with that.

1944
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:30,000
You just get it to run better because it doesn't run very well, and the Windows 10 one runs so well.

1945
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
And I think that's because it's based off the Pocket edition.

1946
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Alright.

1947
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Well, we're going to talk rumors, and I don't usually like to talk rumors on the show, but for two reasons I'm going to do it.

1948
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:45,000
One, it's about Mass Effect, so therefore I totally love this series, as is Dark Sakura.

1949
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Loki, we never did convert, but maybe next time.

1950
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:52,000
And two, this is something where it's on Reddit.

1951
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Again, I know grain of salt, but the moderators of the Mass Effect Reddit basically said,

1952
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:04,000
We have reason to believe that this is coming from an actual source. It's an internal source.

1953
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:09,000
So, again, take it with a grain of salt, but I don't know about you, Dark Sakura.

1954
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
I'm ready for some details on Mass Effect Andromeda.

1955
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I know.

1956
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
So, this is exciting.

1957
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
So, here's the deal.

1958
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:19,000
You will be accompanied by two AI squadmates, just like you were in previous Mass Effect games.

1959
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Two squadmates that came up, a blonde woman, and the krogan that's in the E3 trailer is one of the squadmates as well, it looks like.

1960
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Characters are equipped with jetpacks for environmental exploration.

1961
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
So, that could be interesting.

1962
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Add kind of a third dimension to that.

1963
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
Don't know if jetpacks will be in combat.

1964
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Apparently they're saying the omni-tool, you'll be more of that, and you'll be able to create a shield with your omni-tool.

1965
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
And there'll be also more destructible cover.

1966
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Weapons otherwise will be the same as what you've seen before, but the ship is very different.

1967
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,000
The Mako is visible inside the ship.

1968
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,000
There's a meeting room with the squad members, which is kind of like the first game, or first trilogy.

1969
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:02,000
You can manually fly the ship from location to location in first person rather than going on the galaxy map,

1970
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:05,000
although you get a guide that you can use for rapid travel.

1971
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Waypoints and markers guide the player.

1972
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:10,000
That's going to be interesting if you actually fly the ship yourself.

1973
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
I wonder what you'll get from that.

1974
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:18,000
There's also a Pathfinder's Quarters, which refers to the N7 protagonist title of Pathfinder.

1975
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:21,000
They're on a quest to find a new world for humanity.

1976
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Other species, who you might recognize from previous games, are also on the hunt for a new planet.

1977
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:31,000
There is a new enemy race, described as a cross between Vortia and Collectors,

1978
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:37,000
which are two really nasty enemy types from the original trilogy.

1979
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:41,000
And there's an antagonist the player can choose to kill or spare, which kind of seems like a duh.

1980
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:44,000
That's a very common thread in Mass Effect games.

1981
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Also, as far as the graphics go, supposedly the facial models have been improved drastically.

1982
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Armor is customizable, but there's no further details than that.

1983
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:57,000
So that is what's all pouring out right now about the new game.

1984
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Hopefully some official details from EA sooner rather than later,

1985
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:05,000
but I'm going to guess they're going to keep it all under their hat until E3.

1986
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:11,000
And I remember there were some earlier leaks on an internet forum way before they announced Mass Effect Andromeda

1987
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:15,000
that talked about that the game would take place in the Andromeda Galaxy.

1988
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:20,000
And so a lot of that is turning out to be seeing that too.

1989
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:26,000
So I don't know how much longer EA is going to be able to keep the secrets there, but we'll see.

1990
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000
Well, they could always blacklist everyone who reports on it.

1991
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Right? Oh, I guess we got on the EA blacklist tonight because we opened our mouths and we talked about it.

1992
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Then again, I don't think we've ever had an EA person on this show or ever gotten.

1993
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:42,000
So I don't know. I guess you can't lose what you don't have, right?

1994
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Whatever.

1995
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Well, there's harmonics, but...

1996
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,000
It is what it is.

1997
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Anyway.

1998
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Yeah. Let's move on.

1999
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Well, the nominations for the game awards were announced.

2000
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:03,000
However, with the jury this year, Killscreen has decided not to participate

2001
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:11,000
because it was noted that all but one of the members of the jury were male.

2002
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:21,000
And they basically stated out there that when they noticed the disparity on the jury, they decided not to participate.

2003
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:29,000
They're committed to doing things 50-50 when it comes to gender and will only involve itself with companies that do the same.

2004
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:45,000
One of the big things that was stated as well by the Polygon editor-in-chief is that, and this is just a quote,

2005
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:51,000
it's not enough to simply acknowledge the gender imbalance while many editors on staff participated in selecting Polygon's nominations

2006
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:55,000
and many will similarly participate in selecting our final vote in each category.

2007
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:07,000
I've asked, and this is Jeff Keeley, moving forward, to replace Polygon's jury spot with, I can never pronounce this lady's name,

2008
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Megan Farrokhmanesh, to participate.

2009
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:19,000
So, he's saying that basically you have to change it from within rather than without.

2010
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:25,000
But I think in sitting out is a pretty good course of action as well.

2011
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:31,000
If you don't want to be a part of anything that acts that way, then pull yourself from it.

2012
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I totally commend their action.

2013
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Yeah, it is a little, and the thing that kind of is interesting about this is that the Game Awards were called out on this last year.

2014
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:50,000
And that's the part to me that kind of goes, they didn't really change anything from last year, did they?

2015
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:55,000
So, I guess, yeah, now some people are going to get a little louder, and so that's what it takes.

2016
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Get really loud.

2017
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Yeah.

2018
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Make things change.

2019
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Also, I heard that they're going to scale down the show from three hours to two hours, and I'm kind of like, what the hell are they going to cut out?

2020
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Like, they were already cutting corners going, well, hey, since I'm interviewing you, why don't I just give you this award?

2021
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Are they going to cut out, like, Geoff Keighley's interviews and some of that?

2022
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Are they cutting out the Lifetime Achievement Award then, I guess?

2023
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Maybe because we didn't hear who's getting it this year, right?

2024
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Maybe they're cutting out music performances, which is okay, but...

2025
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I'm down with them cutting out music performances.

2026
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Well, but if they're performing music from a video game, then I'm okay with it.

2027
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:36,000
But if it's just, like, random, like, hey, here's a metal band with a new single, then, you know, get out of here.

2028
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:41,000
But I want to say, didn't they do something last year where they actually played a bit from, like, Zelda or something?

2029
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:47,000
And my memory's fuzzy, sorry, guys. But I thought they had, like, there was, like, a little interlude or something, so...

2030
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:50,000
I thought there was something around that, so...

2031
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:57,000
William Murderface in chat says, well, many of us cut out caring about that award show a long time ago, so...

2032
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:05,000
I guess I'm curious, I do still feel like, all these criticisms aside where, you know, I just sound like that cynical guy,

2033
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:12,000
I do feel like the Game Awards were better than anything that's come before it that was on Spike TV and all that,

2034
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:17,000
so I feel like it's still progress, even if there's a long way to go.

2035
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:25,000
So I'll be interested to see if maybe they make positive steps in other places for this year's show. We'll see.

2036
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Moving on, Loki.

2037
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Alright, so, Fallout 4 has a game-breaking bug. I'm surprised it's just one.

2038
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:38,000
But anyways, this bug, it's popped up and it actually renamed to a little bit of it.

2039
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:50,000
The first place that they kind of noticed it was in Monsignor Plaza, and apparently when you try to travel in Monsignor Plaza,

2040
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:58,000
it crashes to your desktop, and it affects both not only the PC players, but also PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2041
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:02,000
It doesn't happen to everybody, but some players are experiencing that.

2042
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Also, some players are experiencing that at other locations, and so basically you can't go to those locations.

2043
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:14,000
You can step right up to the border of them, and as soon as you step in, boom.

2044
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,000
So that kind of sucks. Haven't run into that yet.

2045
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:22,000
I'm a little surprised it took this long to come out.

2046
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Especially if it's part of the story.

2047
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:32,000
But it's not happening to everybody, and it's happening in different locations.

2048
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
So maybe it's like certain graphics cards.

2049
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
But it's happening on consoles, too.

2050
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Oh, shit.

2051
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:42,000
So, it's just, I mean, come on, that's ridiculous.

2052
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:50,000
And there's got to be something, these publishers, the software development companies, Sony and Microsoft,

2053
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,000
have to do something to say, listen, this kind of shit is ridiculous.

2054
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
I mean, all these companies are doing it.

2055
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Maybe we just need to step up to all these game companies that are releasing this shit all fucking broken.

2056
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Warner Brothers, EA, fucking Bethesda, releasing these games completely broken and fixing them after the fact.

2057
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:15,000
There's got to be something that can be done.

2058
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I mean, it's kind of shady saying, oh, yeah, the game's perfectly fine.

2059
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:24,000
And it's just like all fucked up in every single which way.

2060
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I think some of the glitches are funny.

2061
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:30,000
But if it's breaking the game, then no, I don't think that's very funny.

2062
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:36,000
All right, well, we'll see how they get out of this one.

2063
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
I'm sure there'll just be a patch at some point.

2064
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Patches fix everything, right?

2065
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Well, the thing, though, is they're patching on PC first, and then they're going to do consoles.

2066
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
So it could take a while before we see that.

2067
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Because the patches go through some huge quality check, right?

2068
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:55,000
Exactly. And then along with that, though, some modders discovered some unused weapons in the game,

2069
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
including a harpoon gun that didn't make it in.

2070
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Maybe it's going to be part of DLC or something like that.

2071
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:07,000
But you can check it out if you have the PC version.

2072
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
You can download the mod to bring in the gun.

2073
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
So that's pretty cool.

2074
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
All right.

2075
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Let's move on. Changing topics here to talk about Nintendo and something they've done this week.

2076
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:24,000
They have opened up an official eBay store.

2077
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,000
That's right. You can now shop for Nintendo products on eBay.

2078
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,000
But don't look for things like actual auctions.

2079
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:34,000
I don't know if you guys know, but eBay has a lot of the whole buy it now stuff.

2080
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
So it's not really like an auction.

2081
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:41,000
So they opened up a storefront where you can actually buy things like games and accessories.

2082
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:45,000
But you're not really going to find a whole lot of difference between what you find in stores.

2083
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Mario Party 10 is still going to be $49.99 on the store.

2084
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Wow, what a deal then.

2085
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:56,000
I guess Super Mario 3D World, they're showing us $30 US, where the list price is $59.99.

2086
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:01,000
But I seem to think a lot of retailers have probably already slashed the price on some of those.

2087
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Let's take a look at eBay. Let's see how competitive they are.

2088
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:11,000
I'm sorry. I just don't think that they're going to be offering great deals on that stuff.

2089
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Well, they're only selling 33 products in their store.

2090
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:17,000
But you know what they're not selling on the Nintendo eBay store?

2091
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Amiibos. There's none of them.

2092
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,000
No amiibo on the Nintendo eBay store.

2093
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Remember I was just saying earlier, wouldn't it be something if Nintendo just had a place where they could see how much demand there was for it and be able to make everybody happy?

2094
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:33,000
I guess it's not so fun if you just go on eBay.

2095
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:37,000
I guess they can't keep shelf space at GameStop if they turn to eBay and so forth.

2096
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
It's just a little silly.

2097
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:44,000
But anyway, I don't know. I've got to be honest. I'm looking through here. I don't see a lot of things where I'm like, ooh, I've got to get that.

2098
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:51,000
My thought is, the reason why this store exists is probably not for me or you.

2099
02:19:51,000 --> 02:20:01,000
This is probably to catch some people, especially as the older generation, I think, turns more and more to online shopping to get around.

2100
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Honestly, now that I look at it, I do stand corrected. Their price is pretty good.

2101
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I mean, out of all the Buy It Now pricing, they are the lowest. Bravo to them.

2102
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Well, they're charging retail price, though.

2103
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
$30. No, they're not charging retail price.

2104
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
Oh. For that one specifically.

2105
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,000
The retail price for Super Mario 3D World is still $60.

2106
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Interesting. Alright, so maybe you can catch a good deal.

2107
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:30,000
So props to them on that one. But if you want to buy used, you may be able to find it cheaper.

2108
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:37,000
And why couldn't maybe I get some classic Nintendo stuff? I guess they're pushing virtual consoles, so it does them no good to sell cartridges.

2109
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:43,000
But wouldn't it be cool if I gave... Like, that's the type of stuff I shop for on eBay, is the classic stuff, but I guess Nintendo is not as good.

2110
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Yeah, I don't think I would buy, like, I don't know, from the actual publisher on eBay. I would think, okay, well, I'm going to look for the best deal.

2111
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:56,000
But hey, I mean, in this case, they do have a pretty nice deal, so let's go for it.

2112
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Why can't they offer that digitally instead of fucking just, like, discount... Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you do some sales like PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace does?

2113
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:13,000
That'd be nice. Discount your games instead of having to charge $60 for a game that doesn't even come down in price.

2114
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:23,000
I feel like on Black Friday last year, they did do something like that. I mean, it's one day out of the year, but I feel like something will happen with that, so...

2115
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:30,000
But anyway, the only thing, the thought I wanted to finish on the eBay thing is that, again, I don't think this storefront is for you or me.

2116
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:40,000
I think it is for people who have turned online to doing shopping, where people are like, I want to get a 3DS for my granddaughter, because she's been talking about wanting Mario or whatever.

2117
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:48,000
So, I kind of think this is just for a different audience, and this is just Nintendo trying to get more market coverage. I really think is what this boils down to.

2118
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:57,000
I don't think it's really for the enthusiasts like you or me. But hey, if there's a deal in there once in a while, then what the hell? A deal's a deal, right?

2119
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
So keep an eye on it.

2120
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Alright, let's move on. We're gonna get to the emails. Every week you guys email us.

2121
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com is our email address. If you want to participate with the email bag segment in the show, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com.

2122
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I don't think we had a lot of emails this week, but Dark Soccer's gonna dive in.

2123
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
One long one.

2124
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:22,000
One long one, she says tonight in our mailbag. Let's get to it, Dark Soccer.

2125
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Hi everyone, it's your friendly neighborhood Raginator. I just wanted to say that despite not being able to participate live during shows like I normally do due to temporarily not having internet at home, I do manage to catch shows via podcast.

2126
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:39,000
I'm looking forward to seeing everyone again come May 2016.

2127
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Anywho, on to the meat and potatoes of my email. I was hoping to get your input in advance on my getting a new PC.

2128
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Excuse me.

2129
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Alright, now I'm contemplating between two retailers to go to for a gaming desktop PC.

2130
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:10,000
I was wondering which in your opinions I'm better off going to. In terms of traditional brick and mortar stores, I'm considering going to Best Buy.

2131
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:18,000
In terms of online retailers, I'm considering iBuyPower.com. Of the two, which am I better off going to?

2132
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:28,000
When it comes to buy my new PC, I definitely want a gaming desktop. My spending limit will be $1350 including my sales tax, shipping, and handling if applicable.

2133
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I definitely want to go get the most bang for my buck, get the most powerful PC I can afford with said budget. That way hopefully I don't have to upgrade my parts for a while.

2134
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:41,000
I'm gonna stop you right there. Build your own.

2135
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Yeah, I would say neither of those. I mean, I don't know about iBuyPower, but Best Buy, you're not going to find gaming PCs. They're going to be very limited on what they offer gaming PC wise, and it's probably going to be expensive.

2136
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:57,000
Yeah. Build your own. Seriously?

2137
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:02,000
But, I mean, if he doesn't know how to build his own, I would try even Newegg or something.

2138
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Yeah, Newegg is good. But, honestly enough, we built both mine and Dan's computers. Now, we already had our graphics card and power supplies, which would probably have been the most expensive parts.

2139
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:23,000
We still built our pair of computers for $900. And both of them are gaming computers.

2140
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:36,000
When I was mocking up a PC I was going to build for PC gaming and for the Oculus Rift, I think it was about $1300 that I was looking to spend.

2141
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:47,000
And that was just from Newegg and different locations. If you definitely know how to build a PC, do it that way. Don't buy retail if you can avoid it.

2142
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Even if, or if you're going to buy retail, buy from a company that's going to make custom PCs. Don't buy an Alienware PC because it's overpriced.

2143
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:00,000
And they're Dell.

2144
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:05,000
And just, you know, maybe, I don't know.

2145
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:10,000
William Murderface had a good analogy. It's like grown up Legos.

2146
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Yeah, I mean, half the fun is learning how to build that stuff. And it's not that hard. I mean, actually putting stuff together isn't hard. It's just figuring out what works together with each other and what you're going to need as far as spec-wise.

2147
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:32,000
And finding the best deals is kind of the tricky part. But the actual assembly is not that hard. I mean, you can find instructions online on how to do it. It's not like a daunting task or anything.

2148
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:49,000
And for the most part, it's you open it up, you punch out a little piece of perforated metal and stick your piece, the back end goes out, secure everything in, plug in some cables, you're done. It's easy.

2149
02:25:49,000 --> 02:26:00,000
Finally, Loki, I have an idea for you to use in Time to Car or any other game projects that you may work on. It's one of those so stupid it's actually brilliant ideas.

2150
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:10,000
How about a rocket launcher? But not any ordinary rocket launcher. No, no, no. Instead of shooting rockets, it'll shoot, wait for it, weasels. Fuck yeah.

2151
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:18,000
And these are no ordinary weasels either. These weasels will seek out human targets and summarily burrow up to the humans asses and then explode.

2152
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:24,000
What? Or should I say ass-plode over the top? Yes, weird. Yes, but that's why it's so brilliant.

2153
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:27,000
That's a little too postal for me, unfortunately.

2154
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Well, I will say, I can see them part way, but instead of a weasel, what about a ferret? Isn't that the OLR thing?

2155
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Yeah, I'm not going to put like rocket weasels or anything like that, although that sounds like an awesome name for a game.

2156
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Rocket weasel does sound like an awesome name for a game. We might have a dream game in the making here.

2157
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,000
With the sequel Fuck It Ferret? I don't know.

2158
02:26:52,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Maybe it's like a buddy game, kind of like Banjo Kazooie or something. It's like, you know, Rocket Weasel and Fuck It Ferret.

2159
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:05,000
I'm still waiting for someone to make Mortal Wombat. Anyhow.

2160
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Anyways, I got to get off. I said get off this library computer now since my time is up, but I hope everyone is well and I'll see you all as soon as I can.

2161
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:22,000
One counterpoint I want to just offer real quick to the computer building thing, and I'm going to paint a lot of nerds with this, but I just want you to hear me out.

2162
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:30,000
If your goal is to get back online and just play casual games, I actually don't know if you need to do all this build your own computer stuff.

2163
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:36,000
I think it would be more fun, and if you are, you know, the nerdy type, you'd probably get more out of it for yourself.

2164
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:46,000
But I think if you're like, quote unquote, desperate for a computer and you just want to be able to play casual games, because I know you play a lot of Steam games and like Magic and all that stuff.

2165
02:27:46,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Like, maybe just look for Black Friday. And again, I don't know when your finances will turn around, but yeah, I say Black Friday, but when you are able to, just look at getting a cheap all-in-one solution that, you know, has the specs for what you need.

2166
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:09,000
And I know there's a lot of people that are going to disagree with me, but if you're not going to be doing the hardcore gaming, casual machine ought to do you just fine and get you back up and running.

2167
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:16,000
You might even get a decent, like, a decent laptop. Like, my laptop wasn't that expensive. It was like a few hundred dollars.

2168
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:30,000
And it's just, if you're looking for like a, I mean, desktop PC you're obviously going to get more out of, but if you're looking for like a laptop, anything with a dedicated graphics card and preferably not AMD, I got an AMD and it's okay.

2169
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:35,000
But, you know, the way they do their chips, the APUs and stuff is kind of annoying.

2170
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:42,000
But if you can find something like that, that would work out as well if you're not looking to play like, you know, really high-end games.

2171
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:52,000
But yeah, if you can build your own, you're going to save the most money that way, because they really do, they mark up everything to try to, I mean, they got to make their money somewhere, so, I don't know.

2172
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Ask yourself, though, what do you really need?

2173
02:28:54,000 --> 02:29:00,000
I'm sure you've got a friend who's tech-savvy, if you're not, and just have them help you build a PC.

2174
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:05,000
And if you, like, seriously don't have friends, there's like a Reddit, I can't believe I'm endorsing Reddit, but I am.

2175
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:12,000
There's like a Reddit that's like, build me a PC, because I either, when I build, because I, well, I didn't build the PC.

2176
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:16,000
See, here's the trick, Raginator, if you can't do it, date someone who can.

2177
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
That's what I did.

2178
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:26,000
But Alan built my PC, but I, you know, kind of told him like the specs and all that stuff, and we were actually kind of looking at that Reddit, that build your PC.

2179
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:33,000
There's actually people out there, if you tell them the budget and all that, they'll come up with some ideas for you, so, there's a lot of online resources.

2180
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Alan is even chiming in here in chat, saying, pcpartpicker.com is a lifesaver, it deserves a shout-out.

2181
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Yeah, that was the site where you can actually, like, look at whatever parts you want to buy, and it finds what site has it cheapest, and it actually, like, monitors, like,

2182
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:55,000
here's how much your computer would cost today, here's how much it was yesterday, here's how much it was a week ago, and it kind of, kind of, tracks that, which I think is good.

2183
02:29:55,000 --> 02:30:03,000
By the way, a lot of talk on Rocket Ferret, by the way, Embryon in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, please shoot me with ferret cannons all day.

2184
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I don't want them to crawl up my ass, but I would snuggle them forever. William Murderface asks, wouldn't Fuck It Ferret be a porn?

2185
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:19,000
No. No, no, no. The word fuck is a very versatile word. In this case, fuck it doesn't mean, like, literally have sex with it, it just means, like, I'm done, fuck it.

2186
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,000
Ferret's just like, fuck it, and goes up.

2187
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:26,000
Yes. That is the ferret's special ability is to flip a table. Fuck it. And flips the table.

2188
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:29,000
The table just appears out of hammer space.

2189
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:33,000
And then the table smashes, the table smashes the enemy.

2190
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:36,000
And, like, it's a giant table that lands on everyone on the screen.

2191
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:45,000
Yes. I love it. Perfect. And we may already have somebody working on it. Dark Tetsuya says, Rocket Weasel. Oh, I might have to try and make that game.

2192
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:55,000
So, there you go. And SSG100Matt, and I think ActDeft was saying this in another comment too, what I think you should do is buy a pre-built and upgrade it. It's the fastest and easiest solution for him.

2193
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:59,000
I don't know if there is a correct answer here.

2194
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:05,000
But you've got to be careful with buying pre-built and upgrading, because some of them you can't. I mean, you're limited on what you can. That's why building your own, so.

2195
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:13,000
So, ask lots of questions if you are going to go that route. Ask questions. Don't just buy it because it's the cheapest. Ask yourself why it's cheap.

2196
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Anyway, I think we've given you a lot of ideas. Hopefully we didn't just confuse you more, but there you go.

2197
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:28,000
That was it for emails, right? So, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you would like to submit an email for next time.

2198
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Meanwhile, it's time to get into the FUs of the week. It's time for us to get angsty. Why? Because...

2199
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

2200
02:31:52,000 --> 02:32:00,000
I don't really have a legit FU. Except to just the problems I've had putting my staff play together.

2201
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:08,000
So, I had to go out and buy more tacky glue. I was trying to debate if I'd get gorilla glue or tacky glue, but I love tacky glue.

2202
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Cosplay. Cosplay problems.

2203
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Loki.

2204
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:23,000
I also don't really have an FU, I guess. I did want to take this point to say, they're making a sequel to Kung Pao finally, and I'm so excited about that.

2205
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
I've been waiting so long for that.

2206
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
FU to the fact that it took so long.

2207
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Yeah, FU to the fact that it took 13 years. You're wasting your fucking time with those stupid barnyard movies or whatever the fuck it was.

2208
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
God, I know.

2209
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:43,000
FU to the fact that I'm still coughing, like two weeks after I was sick. I'm still coughing, and it's really annoying.

2210
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:49,000
And when I was up in Reno and it was a lot colder up there than it is here, like that cold just even irritated my cough worse.

2211
02:32:49,000 --> 02:33:00,000
So, FU to that nasty flu I had two weeks ago that took me out of the show and has continued to annoy me as I will be mid-sentence and then feel the need to cough.

2212
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Doing radio sucks when you have a cough, just saying.

2213
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:06,000
But I love you guys. That's why I'm still here.

2214
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:14,000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2215
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:20,000
Get on there and get ready to go, because I won't leave the Skype line open forever tonight, because we're already almost to 9 o'clock.

2216
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:24,000
But before we get there, I do want to get to a couple more stories. So first, Loki.

2217
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:29,000
So even though we haven't gotten to release stays for a couple weeks, I am looking forward to this.

2218
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Two Earth Defense Force games out on the same day, December 8th.

2219
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:42,000
We're getting Earth Defense Force 4.1 on PlayStation 4 and Earth Defense Force Portable 2 or Earth Defense Force 2.

2220
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:48,000
I'm not sure what the actual subtitle is on that, but those are both coming out.

2221
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:51,000
That one, the second one is on PS or the Vita.

2222
02:33:51,000 --> 02:34:02,000
And yeah, so $50 for 4.1, which is kind of an expansion on 2025 that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

2223
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:12,000
And then the Earth Defense Force 2 was a PlayStation 2 title that never came out over here.

2224
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:18,000
So, gonna have to pick up 4.1, though.

2225
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:24,000
I just figured we had to work. Any movement on Earth Defense Force is worthy of reporting on, right, Loki?

2226
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:30,000
I would like to see a new game. Even like another Insect Armageddon game, I mean, it was okay.

2227
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:34,000
It wasn't great, but it was still interesting. I don't know.

2228
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Alright. Well, we're gonna end tonight with a story on Mark Cuban. Oh yeah, that guy.

2229
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Well, you know, he's a very controversial owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

2230
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Although, I gotta confess, I do like me some Shark Tank. That's a pretty good show. You guys ever watch Shark Tank?

2231
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:53,000
I kind of like it. It's a guilty pleasure.

2232
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
They have a lot of spin-off shows now.

2233
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Yeah, well, it was one of those shows that was getting really horrible ratings, but then it just kind of grew and grew.

2234
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
But anyway, so Mark Cuban, you know, he's out there and he's a big business guy.

2235
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
And why am I talking about him on a video game podcast?

2236
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Well, because he was in a charity event this week where he was playing League of Legends against the CEO of Intel.

2237
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:21,000
And there was an interview that he did where he said he was actually talking about Colin Cowherd,

2238
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:26,000
who was the one that was throwing the fit about esports getting airtime on ESPN.

2239
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
And they ended up, like, I think he ended up leaving.

2240
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:34,000
So anyway, Mark Cuban said, I love Colin, but he's an idiot when it comes to esports.

2241
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Don't hold back. I'm a noob. I'm still getting into it, but I love it.

2242
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:42,000
It's like playing five-dimensional chess against the world.

2243
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:47,000
It is one of the smartest games I've ever played. You've got to have dexterity. You've got to be quick.

2244
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:52,000
This is a real sport. People are going to figure it out really, really quick.

2245
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Now, this man owns an NBA team.

2246
02:35:55,000 --> 02:36:03,000
I find that to be newsworthy, that he's putting his support behind saying, yes, League of Legends is a sport.

2247
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:10,000
And I kind of really love that, how he calls it, five-dimensional chess.

2248
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:13,000
It's a very, I kind of like that.

2249
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Anyway, so also just kind of funny, he actually dropped the F-bomb in the interview.

2250
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:27,000
And the host let him know that he's going to be fined $15,000 for dropping the F-bomb in the interview.

2251
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:32,000
But that was okay because all the fines were going to be donated to the CyberSmile Foundation charity.

2252
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:39,000
So Cuban's response to the fine? Fuck it. And he ended up paying two fines to the charity.

2253
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
That's awesome.

2254
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:47,000
That's pretty awesome. I don't always agree with him, but he has his moments where he's pretty awesome, I've got to say.

2255
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
So, there it is.

2256
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:52,000
All right, we're going to open up the phone lines right now.

2257
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:57,000
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2258
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:03,000
If you want to get through and talk to us about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe something we haven't talked about yet.

2259
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:07,000
sj100matt saying he gets fined by the NBA all the time, so it's kind of an in-joke with him.

2260
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:11,000
I see that. All right, anyway, the phones are lighting up already, so let's get to it.

2261
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2262
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Hey, it's Sterlok.

2263
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
Hey, I'm glad to hear from you, Sterlok. How you doing?

2264
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Pretty good.

2265
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2266
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Not too much. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Xbox One.

2267
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:34,000
I was hoping that was the case. Tell us a little bit about, from your perspective, what all's changed with Xbox One and why it's important.

2268
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Well, yeah, with the new Xbox experience thing, they added a bunch of access changes, and one of them was Narrator, which is pretty awesome.

2269
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:52,000
It's actually a lot better than what Sony did.

2270
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:56,000
What does the Narrator feature do for those that haven't experienced it?

2271
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:07,000
It's a screen reader, basically. It will say, you know, what you're highlighting and all that fun stuff, so you have a speech on your console.

2272
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
That's great.

2273
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:19,000
PS4 has this as well, but it's very, very, it's less bare bones than it was, but it's still not very good.

2274
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:28,000
Have you found that this has opened the door up to experience maybe something that you have yet to experience?

2275
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Yeah, actually. I mean, I had a 360 and I played the crap out of it.

2276
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:46,000
The reason I got the 360 over the PS3 was because of the web store.

2277
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:55,000
So you could buy games directly in your browser, and then next time you're sharing it on your console, it'll just download it.

2278
02:38:55,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Because narrators on the web browser, that's common.

2279
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Microsoft has that built into Internet Explorer as a part of Windows, right? That's very common.

2280
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Yeah, well, actually, most blind people use external screen readers.

2281
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:25,000
Well, I kind of use a combination of Mac, which has a screen reader called VoiceOver, and a Windows screen reader called NVDA, Non-Visual Desktop Access.

2282
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:34,000
But yeah, no, it was just a web interface, so it was literally just a web page, so it made it really easy.

2283
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:43,000
But now with this on the Xbox One, don't need all that. It will actually let you buy things from the console.

2284
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:48,000
That's fantastic. I'm glad to hear about this progress.

2285
02:39:48,000 --> 02:40:08,000
Yeah, well, the sad thing is it took, I don't know how many people knew this or if you guys knew this, but the reason they're doing this is because of a law that passed.

2286
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Oh, I didn't.

2287
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:35,000
It was, I forget the name of it now, but it was a ruling that was made several years ago that basically required devices, like entertainment devices, to be accessible, at least the communication side of it.

2288
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:51,000
That's kind of important because, well, games and consoles were granted a waiver for a few years, but that finally expired.

2289
02:40:51,000 --> 02:41:11,000
So now they are required to have at least some functionality, like with the communication and stuff. Not everything is required.

2290
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:18,000
I think especially with the PS4, they just kind of did the minimum of what they had to do.

2291
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:19,000
I gotcha.

2292
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:27,000
So Microsoft kind of, you know, they took their time and they added a little more maybe than what the law requires. I had no idea there was a lot more.

2293
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:39,000
There was only, to my knowledge, there's only like two things that don't read all that well, which are achievements and the community section.

2294
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Okay.

2295
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Everything else is, oh, and of course, like external apps. You know, like Hulu and WWE, that kind of stuff.

2296
02:41:50,000 --> 02:42:03,000
Let me ask you this before I let you go. What do you think would be a great, like, you know, as a gamer who benefits from these accessibility enhancements, what would you like to see next?

2297
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:13,000
What do you think should be next on the list for Microsoft or Sony to do to make the experience even better? What would help you out?

2298
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Well, the ultimate thing is something that will never happen, sadly, and that is that, you know, game menus would read.

2299
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:38,000
But there's no way they're going to, you know, be able to, unless they built an API, which they aren't going to, you know, like to have game menus read would be pretty sweet.

2300
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:49,000
You know what though, Sturlock? Never say never, because maybe some developer, you know, I do know we have some industry people that listen to this show, just a few, and not all of them are vocal.

2301
02:42:49,000 --> 02:43:01,000
But this is, I think, sometimes a good thing for them to hear because, you know, maybe if even in the system themselves, they can't mandate that the menus are readable, maybe that developer who's making their game might think,

2302
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:10,000
you know, it wouldn't really be that hard for me to go in and have a button that you hit, and then it will read the menu, and that will help more people enjoy my game. Maybe somebody will hear that.

2303
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Yeah. I mean, I never thought that this was going to happen, honestly. So, yeah, you never know.

2304
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:32,000
But I mean, I have now retracted my I will never get by an Xbox One statement.

2305
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:33,000
It means a lot.

2306
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:44,000
It took me four years, or however, no, it was three years. Whenever they made their stupid DRM announcement, that was just like, nope, I'm done.

2307
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:48,000
Which they're still trying to recover from in many ways.

2308
02:43:49,000 --> 02:44:00,000
But, you know, they have really kind of gone above and beyond, and this is pretty awesome. So, I think I know which console I'm getting.

2309
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Alright. Well, Sturlock, thanks so much for the phone call. I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in some more calls, but have a good one, and it's great to hear from you.

2310
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Alright, you too.

2311
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:08,000
Alright, take care.

2312
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Yep. Bye.

2313
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:16,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, if you'd like to give us a call.

2314
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
And here we go. Phones are lighting up again. Let's get to it.

2315
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2316
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Hey, it's Embryon.

2317
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
Hey, how you doing?

2318
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I am well.

2319
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:25,000
Great.

2320
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:28,000
I'm glad you're doing a little bit better, even though you're still coughing.

2321
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Yeah, I know. I hate when somebody's probably sitting there at home going, get that guy some tea. I drank some coffee. That's my hot drink of choice. But, yeah, I probably need some tea with honey. Maybe I'll enjoy that after the show. We'll see.

2322
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:43,000
Yeah, I suppose. Whatever works. It's all good.

2323
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
So, what's on your mind tonight?

2324
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:57,000
I'm just calling to say hey. I played some Final Fantasy 14 tonight. I've been doing that, and I'm wrapping up the weekend with some Yokai Watch. Have you guys talked about that much?

2325
02:44:57,000 --> 02:45:05,000
I did a little bit, because I was playing a little bit of Yokai Watch. I think I'm on Chapter 5, and there's, what, 11 chapters in the game? I think I'm on Chapter 5.

2326
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:17,000
But, yeah, I think a lot of people were really harsh on the demo, and I think the full game is a lot of fun. I like it. What are your thoughts on Yokai Watch?

2327
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Kind of the same. I wasn't super impressed by the demo, but I think the full version kind of opens up some of the breadth the game has to offer.

2328
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:34,000
I think that in typical Level 5 tradition, there are some parts of the game that are really focused and really good, and then other parts that are kind of head-scratchingly obtuse.

2329
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:41,000
Because I think that it's a really pretty game. I love the designs of the Yokai. I love the animations, and I love the idea.

2330
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:49,000
It's a really fun little town and world to wander around in, but there are some things like, I think the quest design could use some work.

2331
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Like, I don't know, have you gotten to one of the points where you have to upgrade your Yokai Watch before you can enter an area?

2332
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Yeah, I had to get the grandpa's underpants.

2333
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Yeah, so there's some parts where you have to go fight certain Yokai to upgrade your watch, but the current main story quest overwrites that as far as the markers on the map.

2334
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:17,000
So it's really hard to figure out where you're supposed to go, and I guess I could read the dialogue better.

2335
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:23,000
I don't know, but it feels like when you accept one of those quests, I wish they would just put the markers for the Yokai you need to fight on the map.

2336
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:31,000
But other than that, I think it's really cute. I think it's a good example of a Pokemon clone quote-unquote game done right,

2337
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:38,000
although it does seem kind of weird that they're shying away so much from taking away the Japanese-ness of it.

2338
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:42,000
Like, welcome to Springdale, USA. My name is Nate.

2339
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:52,000
It's super obviously taking place in Japan, like Yokai or Japanese spirits, and even the bathhouse that you go to early in the game, right?

2340
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Like, you're getting an old man's fundoshi.

2341
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Yeah, I mean, it's funny because you do say that, and there are certain parts of the game that are very clearly translated over,

2342
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:03,000
but there's other parts, like even very, very early in the game.

2343
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:06,000
I don't consider this a spoiler because you're going to get into this within the first hour of the game.

2344
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:12,000
But, you know, you find out that there's this cat that, you know, you're trying to rescue, and then if you didn't already know,

2345
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Yokai is, because I didn't really realize this when I was first playing the game, Yokai is like dead spirits in Japan.

2346
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:24,000
So the cat talks about how he was run over by a car, and he's dead, and I'm like, this is a game for children.

2347
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Right?

2348
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:26,000
Because it feels a little dark.

2349
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Like, surprisingly heartbreaking. I was like, oh, poor kitty.

2350
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:34,000
I know, and me too, because I am, you know me, I'm a total cat person, so when I hear, like, cat getting hit by car,

2351
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:39,000
I have that instant response of, oh, you know, like, it hurts my heart.

2352
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
And so I'm like, this is for kids? I don't know.

2353
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:48,000
But, you know, at the same time, kids are going to find out about that stuff eventually.

2354
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:55,000
I guess it's kind of the same if you think about Pokémon essentially being like humans trapping animals and forcing them to fight to the death.

2355
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,000
It's true.

2356
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:06,000
One other thing that people don't often talk about about the game that definitely caught my eye is the 3D in the 3DS.

2357
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
We don't talk about that a lot anymore with games.

2358
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:12,000
When you were talking about, like, the graphics, the 3D effects are really well done, I think.

2359
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
That was just something I picked up on.

2360
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:18,000
I realize most people have probably long since shut off the 3D, which is fair.

2361
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:26,000
The game still looks fine without the 3D effects, but I was just, I was, like, the way the cloud bursts when you spot a Yokai is a really cool 3D effect, I think.

2362
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Yeah. Every now and then there will be a time I turn the 3D back on for a game.

2363
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Like, the most recent time I did that was with Legend of Legacy, because I really like the storybook pop-up effect in that.

2364
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:39,000
And then this is another one that I think actually makes really good use of it.

2365
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Because, like you said, it's easy to forget about almost, because even though the system is called the 3DS, I think many of us just sort of forgo that.

2366
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Because, at least for me, 3D hurts my eyes and gives me a headache after a little while, so I, like, tend to just kind of leave it off.

2367
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:53,000
But it works well in this.

2368
02:48:53,000 --> 02:49:02,000
And the Yokai cam is pretty cute, too. If totally silly and superfluous, whatever, but it's still, it's fun to use that.

2369
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Have you found that Tumblr that has nothing but a collection of all the QR codes for Yokai Watch?

2370
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:08,000
No, I haven't.

2371
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:12,000
You need to check that out, because then you get all these coins to use in the little machine.

2372
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:18,000
And that's how I got, like, a B-rank Yokai, like, in Chapter 4. Like, when you haven't even upgraded your watch yet.

2373
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
I better do that then.

2374
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Exactly, right? It'll give you a little bit of an edge in the game. Awesome. Well, thanks for calling and talking to Yokai Watch with us. Appreciate it.

2375
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,000
For sure. Take care.

2376
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Alright, take care. Good to hear from you.

2377
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:38,000
Alright, let's get to some more calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

2378
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:43,000
It's not ringing right away again, so I think I have a moment to go to Loki and see if there's a last minute story.

2379
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:46,000
I think your mic might be off, Loki.

2380
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Sorry, I can tell you that the PlayStation TV has come down in price even more. You can get it for $20 at Best Buy.

2381
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:57,000
What? The PlayStation TV? That 3D TV thing?

2382
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:00,000
No, the PlayStation TV as in the portable Vita.

2383
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
Oh, God. Okay, so I'm...

2384
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
The Vita for your TV.

2385
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:07,000
Okay, you know where my mind went, though, right? It was the actual TV.

2386
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Oh, shit. If it was $20, I'd be like, I'm sorry, I leave, gotta go get me a 3D TV.

2387
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:17,000
$20 for a 3D TV? I could use that as a computer monitor, right?

2388
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:18,000
Yeah.

2389
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:21,000
I've always wanted to play triple screen Final Fantasy IV.

2390
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:25,000
But seriously, you should pick $20. Come on, man. At the very least, it's a Vita you can play on TV.

2391
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
You could probably use it as a PlayStation 1.

2392
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
That's not bad. That's really not a bad deal.

2393
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:35,000
That's not a bad deal. I don't use mine at all, but it was worth the $30 I paid for it.

2394
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
You can play the PSP games with it, right?

2395
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:38,000
You play PSP games?

2396
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:46,000
It would be worth $20 just to play the Final Fantasy IV remake that was on PSP. It was the 2D remake.

2397
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:52,000
Because there was one. Remember, the 3D remake is what's shown up on tablets and PC and 3DS.

2398
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:58,000
No, the 2D remake, which is really good, is on PSP. I would pay the $20 for a Vita TV just to play that.

2399
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
Plus, I have pixel shits on there, so...

2400
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:04,000
That's right. Pixel shits. If you got it when you still could.

2401
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Yes.

2402
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,000
Because I don't think you can anymore.

2403
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
No. But it's preserved.

2404
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:11,000
It is. Unless maybe there's a mod way to do it.

2405
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:15,000
And I would hate to say piracy, especially for one of YYR's games.

2406
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:20,000
But maybe there's a way to do it, and maybe you could PayPal YYR a dollar and he'll be fine.

2407
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:21,000
It's free on his website, too.

2408
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Oh, is it? I don't know. We'll have to see what his opinion is on that.

2409
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:28,000
If it's possible to backdoor the game into the Vita TV.

2410
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Let's see. ActDeftInChat says,

2411
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:36,000
Until PSTV can play Taiko New Tatujin, I'll get one.

2412
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:40,000
And bonds006 says, I was thinking the same thing, which I'm assuming is about the monitor.

2413
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:43,000
So I'm glad I'm not the only one that jumped to that conclusion.

2414
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
But also, what does that say about that device?

2415
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:50,000
That when you said PlayStation TV, it was not the first thing that came to mind.

2416
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:53,000
It should have been just... What did they call it before?

2417
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:57,000
It was the Vita TV or the... What did they call it before?

2418
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
Like in Japan, it's the Vita TV.

2419
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:03,000
But here, since the Vita is not really a thing, it's not the same thing.

2420
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:07,000
For $20, I mean, shit. Fucking get, like, Netflix works on it.

2421
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
Fucking get Hulu to work on it for 20 bucks and be like,

2422
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Hey dude, you can fucking stream shit with this for 20 bucks.

2423
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:18,000
But my TV already has PlayStation 4 on it, so...

2424
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:22,000
I understand that, but my boxing, my fucking old ass thing is falling apart.

2425
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Like, it loses internet connection all the time.

2426
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Like, shit. 20 bucks. Come on.

2427
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Now, see, I'd get a PlayStation TV and bring it here in the studio on this TV.

2428
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
And then that would allow us to, if we wanted to, during the show.

2429
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:37,000
We never do this. We never play games during the show.

2430
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
But, anymore. We used to.

2431
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:40,000
But maybe if we had guests in the studio or whatever,

2432
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:43,000
we could actually stream from the PlayStation 4 to this TV.

2433
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:46,000
So, there's still that part of me that's like,

2434
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:51,000
Maybe I should bring the PS4 in here and then we can do a broadcast

2435
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
with the PS camera during the show.

2436
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
But then, you know, I'm always also, I'm like,

2437
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:58,000
But this is Orange Lounge Radio, not Orange Lounge Video.

2438
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
I don't think it's that exciting to watch. I really don't.

2439
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
So...

2440
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
But some of our listeners seem to miss it, so I don't know.

2441
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:05,000
I'm thinking about it.

2442
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
It's more exposure, though.

2443
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:11,000
That is true. That's honestly a big reason why I'm thinking about it.

2444
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:14,000
I'm like, Well, if we did put it on Twitch,

2445
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:18,000
then that's gonna be potential way more exposure for the show.

2446
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Even though I think this is super boring to watch.

2447
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:26,000
But there's a lot of gaming podcasts that are just talking heads on Twitch,

2448
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:27,000
and they do very well.

2449
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:30,000
So, you know, and no shade against those shows.

2450
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
They're getting great numbers, so what can I do?

2451
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
I just, I'm always kind of like,

2452
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:37,000
But it's radio, not television. I don't know.

2453
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
Anyway.

2454
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:40,000
You all right?

2455
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:41,000
Yeah.

2456
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Okay. Did you have a comment?

2457
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:43,000
No.

2458
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Oh, okay.

2459
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:45,000
You just picked up your mic suddenly.

2460
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:46,000
I thought you were gonna say something.

2461
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
Yeah, when I was about to sit on it.

2462
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

2463
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Our username on-

2464
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Most people wanna listen to my butt.

2465
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:53,000
Our username on Skype.

2466
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

2467
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Last call for calls.

2468
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
If we don't get any more, we'll shut it down,

2469
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
and we will call it a night.

2470
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
And then we'll all go get cheesecake.

2471
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Oh, my God.

2472
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
Did I tell you how much I ate this weekend?

2473
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:06,000
I don't care.

2474
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:07,000
Go eat cheesecake with me.

2475
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:08,000
No, seriously?

2476
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:11,000
No, I can't, because yesterday I went to the buffet,

2477
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
and my fat ass had two full plates at the buffet,

2478
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:14,000
because it was good.

2479
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:15,000
It was good.

2480
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:16,000
Only two?

2481
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:17,000
Only two.

2482
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:18,000
And then dessert.

2483
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:19,000
And then-

2484
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:20,000
Girl.

2485
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:21,000
I went to-

2486
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:24,000
And then my friend that I was with was like,

2487
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
there's a hash house at Go-Go in Reno.

2488
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:27,000
We gotta go.

2489
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,000
So we ended up having a late night set.

2490
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
I couldn't eat more food.

2491
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
I think I had half a side of fries.

2492
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:33,000
That's all I could even-

2493
02:54:33,000 --> 02:54:36,000
And even that was like, oh, my God, I'm so fat.

2494
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:39,000
And then this morning, we had Steak and Shake,

2495
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:42,000
because I can't go to Reno and not go to Steak and Shake,

2496
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
because we don't have them here in California.

2497
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
I'm telling Becky right now that I wanna go to Farrell's.

2498
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:50,000
And again, I'm sure lots of people throughout the rest of the country are like,

2499
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Steak and Shake is not that big a deal.

2500
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
Steak and Shake is that big a deal.

2501
02:54:54,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Try not having it, and then realizing you can't get a birthday cake shake at McDonald's,

2502
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:01,000
or whatever else.

2503
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:05,000
Or, everyone in the South, imagine no Waffle House.

2504
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Waffle House does not exist here in California.

2505
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:11,000
But I actually, you're the only one that sticks up for Waffle House.

2506
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Most people tell me it's shit.

2507
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Except the waffles are, like, which I would fucking hope,

2508
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
if you were to call your place Waffle House,

2509
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
your waffles fucking pass.

2510
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:22,000
The grits-

2511
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:23,000
I've never been to one.

2512
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:26,000
I'm a lifelong Californian, I've never been to a Waffle House.

2513
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
The grits have to stick up.

2514
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
The spoon has to stick up in the grits.

2515
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Waffle House.

2516
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
See, Brad says, told me to shut my mouth.

2517
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
Well, don't you tell me what to do, first of all.

2518
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:41,000
But, Waffle House is amazing, and their grits are amazing.

2519
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Waffle House is amazing, and their grits are godly,

2520
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:47,000
and I still have bags of grits from Waffle House in my cupboard.

2521
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
I said imagine no Waffle House,

2522
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:53,000
and that's what it's like for us not having steak and shake.

2523
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:56,000
So you shut your whore mouth in return.

2524
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:59,000
I'm having an argument with someone typing, this is great.

2525
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Imagine there's no waffles.

2526
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
No, I don't wanna.

2527
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:07,000
But it makes me want to go back now and have Waffle House.

2528
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:10,000
At least have the grits at home, so that's good.

2529
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
When are you gonna make me grits?

2530
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Come to my house.

2531
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Kiss my grits.

2532
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
I need you to make some grits.

2533
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
See, he told me he doesn't have a whore mouth.

2534
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
He has a slut mouth because he's going to get paid.

2535
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
Alright, the phones aren't lighting up,

2536
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
and this is just descending into toilet bowl humor,

2537
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
so I think it's time to wrap up the show.

2538
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Thanks to those that did get through tonight.

2539
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:34,000
If you want to participate with the show, but were too shy to call,

2540
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
you can always consider sending us a tweet.

2541
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:39,000
I know I don't often go through and read the tweets verbatim on the show,

2542
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
but I do read them all.

2543
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2544
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:46,000
You can always leave us feedback on the show postings at VOG Network.

2545
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
I love seeing those, too. V-O-G Network dot com.

2546
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:51,000
And then, of course, you can always send us an email.

2547
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:54,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2548
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:55,000
And I'm serious.

2549
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
Go back and answer the Facebook and Google Plus,

2550
02:56:57,000 --> 02:57:00,000
FUGL Question of the Week about your usernames,

2551
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:01,000
because I want to know.

2552
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
Because some of you have some really weird usernames.

2553
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:04,000
I want to know the story.

2554
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:07,000
So, but that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2555
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Thank you guys so much for downloading and checking out our show

2556
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
or listening live, whatever the case may be.

2557
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Thank you for supporting independent radio.

2558
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
And you know what? If you thought this show was stupid,

2559
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
I don't know how you made it all three hours,

2560
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
but thank you for doing so.

2561
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:22,000
And check out another indie podcast, then,

2562
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:23,000
if you didn't like what you heard here.

2563
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:26,000
Just support indie podcasting and the people that do this

2564
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:27,000
just because they love it.

2565
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
Spread indie podcasting like an STD.

2566
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:30,000
That's right.

2567
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:31,000
With love.

2568
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
Spread it with your whore mouth.

2569
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Becky was listening.

2570
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
Maybe that'll be on a future iTunes comment.

2571
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Spread it with your whore mouth.

2572
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:41,000
That'll be our new tagline.

2573
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Anyway, maybe that can be on the shirt.

2574
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:44,000
O-L-R.

2575
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Spread your mouth.

2576
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:47,000
O-L-R. Spread it with your...

2577
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Okay, now Jamie just convinced me maybe we do need video

2578
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
because she made a face.

2579
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:56,000
You may have...

2580
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
I've made Rob convulse.

2581
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
Damn this cough.

2582
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:01,000
All right.

2583
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:02,000
All right.

2584
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:03,000
We're definitely done.

2585
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Thank you guys for supporting the show.

2586
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Please consider...

2587
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:09,000
Tell a friend or two or five or 15, 25 about the show.

2588
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Help us spread the word.

2589
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:13,000
A five-star review on a place like iTunes, Stitcher Radio

2590
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:17,000
or wherever you found this show goes a long way as well.

2591
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
Appreciate all of that.

2592
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:20,000
Thank you guys again.

2593
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
We will be back in two weeks.

2594
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
Remember, we will not be here next week.

2595
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:28,000
Those of you in the States have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.

2596
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:32,000
Those of you overseas, have a great week.

2597
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:33,000
Have some turkey.

2598
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
In honor of your American friends.

2599
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:36,000
That's right.

2600
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:37,000
Have some pumpkin pie in honor of me.

2601
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:40,000
In celebration of spreading death and disease.

2602
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Anyhow...

2603
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:44,000
Small pox.

2604
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:45,000
A gift from England.

2605
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
Let's go ahead and wrap things up.

2606
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:48,000
We're done.

2607
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:49,000
We're definitely out of here.

2608
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:50,000
Just kidding.

2609
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:51,000
Hearts.

2610
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2611
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:54,000
Loki, how about you?

2612
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:55,000
What's your final thought tonight?

2613
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
At least it wasn't large pox.

2614
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:03,000
My final thought is that in two weeks I would like to be rid of this cough completely.

2615
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Let's all cross our fingers and our toes.

2616
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
Dark Sakura, last but not least.

2617
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:09,000
Your final thought.

2618
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:10,000
Drink half a bottle of bourbon.

2619
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:11,000
You won't care.

2620
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:15,000
I did have unlimited Jack and Cokes last night.

2621
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:18,000
I didn't talk about my trip to a country bar here on the show.

2622
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:20,000
I guess we'll have to save that for another week.

2623
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Have a wonderful week everybody.

2624
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:26,000
We'll see you in two weeks with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

2625
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,000
