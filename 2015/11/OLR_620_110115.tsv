7000	14000	There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	This week, Twitch breathes new life into art with the resurgence of infamous big-haired painter Bob Ross, while new life was also given to some DRM-laden plastic games.
21000	27000	Raise your Bob Ross kappas, zappas, and join us in our happy little Studio N7 on this week's show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 620 for this November the 1st of 2015.
44000	51000	I hope all you guys that celebrated Halloween yesterday had a happy and safe one and are on Candy OD today.
51000	59000	So, you know, you can sit around and eat Snickers bars and play video games and listen to us talk about games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.
59000	66000	Myself here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, Rob Roberts, joined by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
66000	67000	Boar.
67000	68000	How are you?
68000	69000	Um, yeah.
69000	70000	Yeah?
70000	71000	Yeah.
71000	72000	I'm fantastic.
72000	73000	Is that fantastic?
73000	74000	I'm glad you are.
74000	76000	I'm glad you're fantastic.
76000	77000	Are you not fantastic?
77000	79000	I don't know.
80000	83000	You're so difficult to get emotion out of sometimes.
83000	85000	I know. That's what I do.
85000	92000	If you were an NPC in a video game, you'd be the one that you walk up to and you press A and the character pops up and just says dot, dot, dot.
92000	94000	I'd be the Tsundere.
94000	95000	Is that what they're called?
95000	96000	I guess.
96000	99000	Alright. Also, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.
99000	100000	Hi.
100000	101000	Hi, Loki. How are you?
101000	102000	I'm doing fine.
102000	106000	So, not that I'm nosy, but I'm totally nosy and I notice you're on the Humble Bundle website right now.
106000	109000	I got like four emails from them and I was like, is there anything good on here?
109000	110000	Nope.
110000	112000	You are being tempted by Humble Bundles, I thought.
112000	113000	No, I'm not.
113000	114000	Oh.
114000	117000	I'm not because I don't have the money for it right now and there's something I really want, so.
117000	120000	They still the Capcom Bundle or is that done now?
120000	121000	That's done.
121000	124000	It's the Humble Jumbo Bundle 5 now or something like that.
124000	125000	Gotcha.
125000	126000	Well.
126000	127000	Doesn't have any games I want.
127000	129000	At least it's, you know, all charity and all that.
129000	131000	Well, hell, there's games I didn't even realize that were in my library.
131000	133000	Like, I just saw Command & Conquer Red Alert 3.
133000	141000	I'm like, wait, I thought I had that like little like teaser thing that they had as part of the EA Bundle, but I don't remember getting the full game, but apparently it's there.
141000	143000	So, somewhere I bought that.
143000	144000	Alright.
144000	146000	I don't even remember anymore.
146000	155000	We are joined in studio tonight with some special guests, but I do also want to give a shout out to the other ever present fourth guest on our show, the Chat Room.
155000	162000	If you are listening live to our program, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
162000	171000	And if you are listening live, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Black Wolf, and you can chat along with the show live, live.vognetwork.com.
171000	177000	And over in chat, Tiger Claw says, we didn't have any trick-or-treaters show up, so we had all the candy to ourselves.
177000	184000	Yeah, I noticed like less and less trick-or-treaters are actually out there and it's probably because, you know, people are crazy and, you know.
184000	191000	But actually I found in our neighborhood, Alan actually went out and bought like candy at the dollar store or whatever, so he'd have something to give away.
191000	197000	Because last year he got caught without candy and he answered the door and there were some kids there and he had that awkward moment of uh.
197000	203000	And like luckily we had like an emergency supply of Smarties, because who actually eats Smarties, right?
203000	205000	So we had an emergency supply as we gave it to the kids.
205000	207000	But this year he was better prepared and we actually had the light on.
207000	208000	Apparently he gave it all away.
208000	211000	And I was like, wow, we had enough kids show up in the neighborhood.
211000	212000	Oh, that reminds me.
212000	213000	Yeah?
214000	215000	Is it candy?
215000	216000	It must be candy.
216000	217000	Shut up.
217000	218000	Yay.
218000	219000	Trick-or-treat.
219000	220000	Smell my feet.
220000	222000	I was gonna say there was always that Japanese candy if you had any more of that left.
222000	223000	Fucking yes.
223000	224000	There's this uh.
224000	225000	She got my favorite.
225000	226000	It's the little.
226000	228000	And clearly she has picked them all out of the bag.
228000	229000	Yes I did.
229000	232000	She got me the vanilla Tootsie Rolls, which are my favorite.
232000	234000	I picked them out of the bag for you.
234000	235000	Yeah.
235000	238000	Actually I picked them out for me and then I decided I wouldn't eat them so that I gave them to you.
238000	240000	Now I feel like a true rock star.
240000	242000	Because, you know, like those uh.
242000	244000	I only want the green M&Ms.
244000	247000	You have to pick out all the green M&Ms from the bag.
247000	249000	They taste different.
249000	250000	That's right.
250000	251000	The green ones make you horny.
251000	252000	Uh, let's see.
252000	254000	Go into our chat over at live.vognotework.com.
254000	257000	ActDeaf says, I want to get Undertale on Steam.
257000	258000	The soundtrack is pretty good.
258000	260000	You know, I've heard a lot of good things about that game.
260000	265000	I haven't picked it up myself yet, but I hear a lot of comparisons to like Earthbound and that it's like a love letter to video games.
265000	266000	So I'm very curious about it.
266000	268000	I watched a YouTuber play part of it.
268000	269000	It looked okay.
269000	270000	Yeah, it looked alright.
270000	271000	I'll have to check that out.
271000	275000	If you want to recommend some games, join our chat room over at live.vognotework.com.
275000	277000	But we do have some friends in studio.
277000	279000	These are actually some new friends to OLR.
279000	281000	These guys have not been on the show before.
281000	283000	But there's some guys that I've known for a little while.
283000	285000	So I'm going to let them introduce themselves.
285000	287000	Because I don't know if they want to use their real name on the show.
287000	289000	But first off, joining us tonight we have.
289000	290000	Hi, I'm Mike.
290000	291000	Hi Mike, how are you?
291000	292000	I'm good.
292000	293000	Good.
293000	295000	Make sure when you talk in the mic, get real close to the mic.
295000	296000	Make sweet love to the mic.
296000	297000	Otherwise they can't hear you.
297000	298000	Okay.
298000	299000	You have to practically deep throat the mic.
299000	300000	You do.
300000	301000	You do.
301000	302000	You do a little bit.
302000	303000	Should not be that challenging.
303000	304000	Alright.
304000	305000	How are you doing?
305000	306000	Doing good.
306000	307000	Good.
307000	308000	Welcome.
308000	309000	Welcome to the show.
309000	310000	So you've listened to OLR before.
310000	311000	You know what you're getting into, right?
311000	312000	Yeah.
312000	313000	Yeah.
313000	316000	And you and I have played Final Fantasy XIV online together before, right?
316000	317000	Yes.
317000	318000	What do you play in XIV?
318000	319000	I'm in Ora.
319000	321000	A male Ora.
321000	322000	Yeah.
322000	323000	The new race.
323000	324000	The Ora.
324000	327000	Well, I started up when it came out for Mac.
327000	331000	So I was interested in playing with a controller.
331000	334000	And the Mac client's not as bad now.
334000	336000	It was awful at first.
336000	337000	Gotcha.
337000	340000	And folks that are listening live, I am trying to get his voice up a little bit.
340000	341000	So sometimes we have to adjust.
341000	342000	I'll talk a little louder.
342000	343000	Talk a little louder.
343000	344000	Thank you.
344000	345000	Perfect.
345000	346000	Sounds good.
346000	349000	And in chat they say, Mike sounds just like Shane.
349000	350000	No.
350000	351000	Okay.
351000	353000	I'll spice it up a little.
353000	355000	There you go.
355000	356000	There you go.
356000	359000	Which is funny because Shane is actually here in the studio.
359000	362000	And it's not like there's this weird like twin identity thing.
362000	364000	But I don't know if Shane's actually.
364000	366000	Shane just wants to play on his cell phone tonight.
366000	367000	They could do that though.
367000	368000	We'll see.
368000	371000	I'll speak with some excitement.
371000	372000	There you go.
372000	374000	A little more enthusiasm than what Shane usually gives us.
374000	375000	Appreciate it.
375000	376000	All right.
376000	378000	What other games do you play besides XIV?
378000	381000	I'm pretty much addicted to Hearthstone right now.
381000	384000	Last month I spent pretty much the whole month.
384000	391000	I took a break from XIV because we're in the lull of waiting for the patch.
391000	395000	And so I decided to try to push for Legend in Hearthstone.
395000	398000	Which is the top ranks and stuff.
398000	400000	And I didn't quite make it to my goal.
400000	404000	But I peaked at rank 4.
404000	406000	And it's a ladder system.
406000	407000	So up to rank 1.
407000	409000	After rank 1 it's a legend pool.
409000	411000	So made it up to rank 4.
411000	413000	And then I don't know what happened.
413000	415000	But slipped all the way back down.
415000	417000	And boo.
417000	421000	Now Blizzcon is obviously a pretty big deal in the Hearthstone community.
421000	423000	And that's happening this weekend.
423000	425000	And I'm kind of bummed out that I don't get to go after all.
425000	427000	Even though I'm a Diablo player.
427000	430000	And I feel like we're getting the short end of the stick.
430000	433000	Or no end of the stick this year at Blizzcon.
433000	434000	But whatever.
434000	437000	But I know they do a lot of big Hearthstone stuff there.
437000	438000	With the tournaments and everything.
438000	442000	Are you going to have your big popcorn watching the Blizzcon at home game?
442000	444000	Depending on what I'm doing.
444000	446000	I'll keep up with it.
446000	449000	But otherwise I'll probably be...
449000	454000	If I'm doing something else I'll probably just try to keep up as best I can on my phone or Twitter or whatever.
454000	457000	But looking forward to all the stuff they're going to announce.
457000	463000	Supposedly supposed to be a new expansion or adventure coming out.
463000	465000	So new stuff. Yay.
465000	466000	Nice.
466000	470000	Is that free still or are they still doing that stupid pay per view bullshit?
470000	472000	It's pay per view but it's all...
472000	473000	Oh come on.
473000	474000	It's not through DirecTV I don't think.
474000	476000	Thank you Activision. You're awesome.
476000	479000	Pay per view to view stupid fucking conferences.
479000	483000	You get a digital pet and I think some other things.
483000	485000	Ah fuck them. Seriously.
485000	488000	If all you want is news, that's what Twitter's for.
488000	491000	And that's probably what I'll end up doing honestly.
492000	497000	And if any big moments come up like the red shirt guy asks a question or something, it'll be on YouTube.
497000	500000	As much as they want to get it taken down. It'll be on YouTube.
500000	502000	Once it's on the internet you can't take it off, right?
502000	505000	I know you have some other passions that aren't just video games.
505000	507000	I want to give you a chance to give a cheap plug.
507000	509000	I know you've done some other work with podcasting.
509000	511000	I don't know if you want to give it a cheap plug here.
511000	515000	Well, just like talking about sports pretty much.
515000	519000	I don't have anything really to plug at the moment because I'm not really tied with anything specifically.
519000	523000	But trying to do something on my own eventually.
523000	526000	See what I can do with the podcasting actually.
526000	528000	What sports ball is your favorite sports ball?
528000	532000	I really, really, really love basketball.
532000	534000	Basketball? Then who's your team?
534000	537000	I don't have a team. I actually just like watching basketball.
537000	539000	You're a free agent right now?
539000	540000	Yes, pretty much.
540000	542000	I thought you were going to say football.
542000	543000	I'm cheap. Just entertain me.
543000	545000	I know you have a team for football.
545000	548000	Oh, let's not. No, I'm just kidding.
548000	550000	San Diego, sadly.
550000	552000	Aw, everybody feels sorry for Mike.
552000	554000	Just kidding.
554000	556000	Whatever.
556000	560000	But you're from San Diego, so you have to have a little loyalty there, I understand.
560000	562000	What about sports video games?
562000	564000	Obviously that's a little...
564000	567000	We don't usually get into that topic a lot here on OLR.
567000	569000	But do you play them at all?
569000	570000	Do you dabble in that?
570000	572000	Or no, it's just not the same experience for you?
572000	575000	Not at all, because I'd rather...
575000	581000	Usually when it comes to sports, if I'm watching a game,
581000	584000	I really get the itch to actually go out and play, especially basketball.
584000	586000	I'm like, oh my god, I can't wait to go out and play.
586000	590000	I want to just mess around and imitate some players.
590000	595000	Just mess around. Not even imitate, imitate, but just screw around, basically.
595000	600000	So when you're there playing video games and one of the parents is yelling,
600000	602000	why don't you go outside and actually play that game?
602000	605000	You're one of those people that will actually go outside and play the game.
605000	608000	Kind of. I was forced to.
608000	612000	I was forced to as a kid to go out and play basketball, and then it ended up sticking.
612000	613000	Alright.
613000	615000	Alright, mom. Thank you.
615000	617000	There you go.
617000	620000	Also joining us tonight, we have another guest.
620000	622000	Another guy that I've played Final Fantasy XIV with.
622000	623000	He sends a pattern here.
623000	626000	We're having a little free company IRL meetup this weekend.
626000	628000	Sort of. Mini thing.
628000	630000	But why don't you introduce yourself?
630000	632000	Hi, I'm Daniel.
632000	633000	Hi, Daniel. How are you?
633000	634000	I'm doing great.
634000	635000	Great.
635000	638000	I feel that coffee kicking in, so my heart's palpitating right now.
638000	641000	And with you and Michael sharing a mic tonight, this is going to be very interesting,
641000	645000	because you're much louder, but you're in a good place.
645000	648000	How are you? So you play XIV as well.
648000	649000	Yes.
649000	651000	That's how we sort of know each other.
651000	653000	What do you play in XIV?
653000	655000	I play a...
655000	658000	Oh, great. I'm going to blank out. What are the cat people called again?
658000	659000	Mikote.
659000	660000	Yes, Mikote.
660000	661000	Mythra?
661000	662000	I was thinking Mythra. That's what I was thinking of from XI.
662000	666000	I mean, really, they're just the same races, but they have to change the names for some stupid reason.
666000	668000	A Mikote, I think they're called.
668000	669000	Yeah.
669000	670000	A Coyote Mikote.
670000	671000	Mikote.
671000	677000	Now that 3.0's come out, I've been put back to Summoner as my main, which I'm loving.
677000	681000	For a while, I was really hating the endgame with the Summoner, so I switched to the Black Mage,
681000	687000	but now with all the new rotations and everything coming out, I really enjoy Summoner a lot with Heavensward.
687000	691000	Awesome. What other games are you into besides just XIV?
691000	699000	I also play Hearthstone as well with Michael, and for this last month I haven't played too much,
699000	703000	but I did end up playing Guacamelee, the Super Turbo Championship Edition.
703000	705000	Oh, yeah. That's a fun game.
705000	709000	Yeah. I've been watching a lot of Let's Plays of Mario Maker, and I don't own a Wii U,
709000	713000	so I was like, I need to get my platforming fixed somehow.
713000	717000	And I looked through my whole PS4 library, and I happen to have Guacamelee from PlayStation Plus,
717000	721000	so I was like, hey, let's give this a shot, and it managed to scratch that itch well enough.
721000	726000	Good. But we have a Wii U here at Studio N7, so were you checking out Mario Maker earlier?
726000	730000	I did. I did finally get a chance to play it, and it seems the controls are slippery.
730000	732000	I didn't expect that.
732000	737000	At least with a lot of the levels I tried were the original Super Mario Brothers-style level,
737000	743000	and I don't know if it's just that particular style, but the controls are a lot more slippery than I remember.
743000	750000	So I don't know if that's something that they did on purpose, or if that is actually how it was, or if I'm remembering wrong.
750000	754000	Our mind plays interesting tricks on us, but I'm sure some of the physics have changed,
754000	758000	because obviously, well, and what's funny is that I saw you just before playing Mario Maker,
758000	763000	you were playing NES Remix, which actually uses the ROMs, and it's the smaller screen.
763000	768000	So in Mario Maker, they had to basically go back and reinvent the wheel, because everything's rendered for widescreen now,
768000	772000	which, you know, remember folks, Super Mario Brothers was not widescreen.
772000	773000	Yeah, and I commented on that.
773000	778000	It was not HD, yeah, so they did have to remake everything, so if the physics are a little different...
778000	782000	And having that Super Mario Brothers graphics, but on a full screen, you're just like, whoa!
782000	783000	Yeah, right?
783000	784000	Giant.
784000	789000	It's a little jarring at first, but I think that's part of the reason, too, that you don't just have World 1-1,
789000	796000	at least not endorsed by Nintendo, I'm sure it's been done 5,000 times over by Mario level makers,
796000	801000	but that's why they didn't have an official World 1-1, because people that remember how to do it,
801000	804000	you know, with their hands tied behind their back and blindfolded, or whatever,
804000	805000	With their toes.
805000	809000	Whatever it was Jamie could do on World 8-1 or 8-2, which still blows my mind.
809000	814000	I can't do it anymore, but the whole level was all timing.
814000	822000	Yeah, but I bet if you were to, you could even go, like, essentially pixel perfect or object perfect in Mario Maker with that same level,
822000	828000	and you would not do it, because just that slight difference in the mechanics when things go to HD.
828000	833000	We talked about this just a little bit last week, we were talking about that Mega Man remake in Unity,
833000	838000	and how it looks great, but it's probably, if the physics are even slightly different,
838000	842000	the purists are going to have a big problem with it, because I can't speedrun this the way I used to.
843000	845000	So, just food for thought. Food for thought.
845000	849000	Let's see, going over to our chatroom over at live.vog.network.com.
849000	852000	ActDef saying Guacamelee is freaking awesome.
852000	857000	It is. Let's see, USS Rover says just added OLR to list.
857000	860000	Now 194 shows in spreadsheet.
860000	866000	Awesome, well I hope that's a good list, and not like list of shows to send flaming bag of poo to.
866000	871000	I hope that's, of course 194 would be a lot of bags, so no, I appreciate you being here in chat and checking us out.
872000	876000	And VXJ6V, I love this answer in chat over at live.vog.network.com, says,
876000	879000	My favorite sports ball is Rocket League.
879000	882000	Hell to the yes, that game is awesome.
882000	884000	Mike, can you check out Rocket League? Have you seen Rocket League?
884000	887000	No, I haven't. I've heard you guys talk about it.
887000	889000	I know what we're doing after the show.
889000	892000	I know you guys have like an hour drive home, but you have to see Rocket League, it's a lot of fun.
892000	898000	It's like, it's soccer meets, okay, you just made a face when I said soccer.
901000	902000	Are you one of those guys?
902000	903000	I'm one of those guys.
903000	904000	Okay, well try to...
904000	907000	Soccer's like, I don't know, they're just...
907000	911000	You're going to start a fight here on OLR that I don't need.
911000	912000	That's fine.
912000	917000	Will you at least do Mega Man soccer? Because Mega Man soccer is rad.
917000	918000	But it's still soccer.
918000	922000	Ah, you're hopeless. Alright, it's soccer meets like Mario Kart.
922000	924000	Which is awesome, I don't know.
924000	927000	I've heard good things about it, so I'll check it out.
927000	933000	I mean, the second I start seeing it as, this is just soccer, it's going to be awful.
933000	938000	Let me break it down into mic terms then. It's soccer if soccer was cool.
938000	947000	No, I've heard nothing but good things about it, like across from everyone that's on the podcast I listen to.
947000	949000	It's been nothing but good things.
949000	951000	So, eh, I want to check it out.
951000	953000	But, the soccer comparison is probably...
953000	955000	How about air hockey?
955000	956000	Sure.
956000	959000	That's worlds better than soccer.
959000	961000	At least people can't flop on air hockey.
961000	962000	Wait, what's that Dan? We can't hear you.
962000	966000	I'm sorry non-Americans, but I can't do soccer.
966000	967000	Alright, whatever.
967000	969000	At least people can't flop on air hockey.
969000	971000	That's true, that's true.
971000	973000	Alright, alright. Let's see.
973000	979000	Act Deft in our chatroom, who by the way, he's from Mexico, if you guys didn't know, listens to the show.
979000	984000	Act Deft says, why are you laughing at that? Because you know you're about to get some big shit, aren't you?
984000	985000	He's about to get red.
985000	986000	He's about to get red.
986000	987000	I know what I said.
987000	988000	You are about to get red.
988000	989000	That's fine.
989000	991000	The library is open. Here it is.
991000	995000	Act Deft says, soccer is awesome. You're just American and you're built to hate it.
995000	998000	That's what I know. I know.
998000	1002000	I played soccer for five years when I was a kid. Did you know that?
1002000	1003000	Sorry.
1003000	1004000	I played soccer.
1005000	1007000	Why do you think I'm so skinny?
1007000	1010000	For the record, Manchester United all the way.
1010000	1013000	I like soccer. The views and opinions expressed by that guy...
1013000	1014000	Are wrong.
1014000	1016000	Do not reflect those of Orange Line.
1016000	1019000	I watched soccer before I watched baseball.
1019000	1020000	Uh oh, uh oh.
1020000	1022000	No, no, no. Hold on, hold on.
1022000	1023000	Shane is gonna wreck you.
1023000	1025000	Let me explain for a second.
1025000	1031000	It's because baseball, like I've tried so hard for like several times to get into baseball.
1031000	1034000	And I end up flat out falling asleep.
1034000	1036000	Like during the games on the TV, on TV.
1036000	1038000	Going to a game is different.
1038000	1040000	I can already see the comments to this episode.
1040000	1042000	Never invite that guy again.
1042000	1043000	No, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.
1043000	1045000	Soccer is worlds better.
1045000	1049000	Somebody's gotta have the opinion that other people don't want to hear.
1049000	1051000	That's what we're about.
1051000	1053000	I hate all sports. They all fucking suck.
1053000	1056000	All of them. Every single one of them.
1056000	1058000	Especially baseball.
1058000	1064000	From fucking ballet to fucking ice hockey to football.
1064000	1066000	It all fucking sucks.
1066000	1067000	There, done.
1068000	1070000	So what do you do in sports?
1070000	1071000	What about esports?
1071000	1075000	You have to get the puck into the cup and then someone vomits.
1075000	1077000	Is that how sports ball works?
1077000	1079000	Yeah, as long as there's cheerleaders.
1079000	1081000	Alright, back to video games, people.
1081000	1083000	Blades of Steel.
1083000	1086000	Yes, let's all agree. Blades of Steel is awesome.
1086000	1090000	Daniel, what else? What's your favorite video game of all time?
1090000	1092000	I always ask new people this to the show.
1092000	1096000	What is your favorite video game of all time?
1096000	1098000	And I'm only taking your first answer.
1098000	1100000	Final Fantasy IX.
1100000	1103000	Really? Nine of the whole series?
1103000	1106000	Yes, VIII has a special place in my heart because that's what I started with.
1106000	1117000	But IX, I replayed it in 2011 and after really being able to appreciate the writing and the character development in it and the music,
1117000	1120000	I was just like, nope, this is my favorite. This is it. Got it.
1120000	1122000	Oh, you sweet, sad summer child.
1125000	1127000	Wait, am I wrong?
1128000	1130000	You need to go back and play the classics.
1130000	1135000	Well, I think IX is one of the better ones. I will give you that, but it doesn't hold a candle to VI.
1135000	1137000	True.
1137000	1138000	Let me ask this question.
1138000	1140000	I can't have that opinion yet because I haven't finished VI.
1140000	1146000	I know you're a younger guy than me. We were having this conversation about how old you guys were when OLR started earlier and I wanted to cry.
1146000	1148000	I wanted to fucking cry.
1148000	1151000	How old were you when Final Fantasy IX came out?
1151000	1156000	Oh, god, I remember playing it, but I'm trying to remember the freaking year. What was it, 1999?
1156000	1158000	1999 was eight, so nine was...
1158000	1159000	So 2000 it came out.
1159000	1161000	About 2000, 2001, yeah.
1161000	1166000	Okay, if it came out in 2000, then I was just going into like sixth grade.
1166000	1175000	Okay, because I don't know if it was Bobby who said this or somebody else, but it's always your favorite Final Fantasy game is the one that came out when you were 12 years old.
1175000	1178000	That is going to be your favorite Final Fantasy game, always.
1178000	1182000	Well, it was my favorite for a long time because I was about that age.
1182000	1183000	But they were close.
1184000	1186000	Well, they were one year apart, really.
1186000	1196000	And so I feel like after getting older and being able to appreciate some of those more eccentric parts to the storyline and everything, IX kind of won my heart over.
1196000	1198000	Alright, fair enough, fair enough. No, I like IX.
1198000	1204000	IX had that fan service that people wanted to see that VII and VIII didn't have because VII and VIII were so like...
1204000	1208000	Especially VII was just a radically different setting compared to like IV or V and VI, right?
1208000	1211000	So IX kind of gave a taste of that classic Final Fantasy.
1211000	1224000	It began to set the trend that VIII followed and so did X and then you see it again in XIII where it's that futuristic kind of neo-science fantasy that you see in a lot of Final Fantasies now.
1224000	1230000	That thankfully XIV kind of went backwards a little bit and is incorporating more of the fantasy aspect.
1230000	1238000	Okay, fair enough. Mike, since I didn't ask you this same question about favorite video game of all time, what's your answer?
1238000	1241000	Any of the Metal Gears, except for like Peace Walker.
1241000	1243000	So any Metal Gear game?
1243000	1247000	Metal Gear 1, of course, is gonna be my... or Metal Gear Solid 1.
1247000	1253000	So not Metal Gear NES, but Metal Gear... because I love Metal Gear NES. The truck have started to move.
1253000	1255000	It's one of my favorites.
1255000	1258000	But you were probably too young. Were you even born yet when that game came out? Probably not.
1258000	1259000	Probably not.
1261000	1262000	Snake's Revenge doesn't count.
1262000	1265000	Yes, no, Snake's Revenge wasn't a real Metal Gear game anyway.
1266000	1269000	And Snake Rattle and Roll just was a really weird departure of the series.
1269000	1272000	Snake Rattle and Roll was like what happened when he took LSD.
1272000	1275000	So Metal Gear Solid 1, we'll say.
1275000	1276000	Yeah.
1276000	1277000	And why?
1277000	1282000	Just holds nostalgia purposes, but I mean I think it was...
1282000	1285000	Oh god, I don't want to say how old I was.
1285000	1287000	Just say it. Fine, I'm over it already.
1288000	1292000	I was younger than 10 when I started playing it.
1292000	1296000	And I don't know what it was. I just thought it was super cool.
1296000	1303000	And then I've gone back and kind of replayed some of the earlier games in the series.
1303000	1309000	And I've got a better appreciation for the plotline and stuff.
1309000	1312000	As convoluted as it is, I'll be the first to tell you.
1312000	1314000	Yeah, it's a clusterfuck and a half.
1315000	1323000	But if you've stuck with it from one all the way through, it makes a bit more sense.
1323000	1328000	You can't just jump into four or five and be like...
1328000	1335000	And really give it a fair judgment because it's like, what is this shit?
1335000	1338000	Tell me, do you believe love can bloom on a battlefield?
1341000	1343000	I love that song, Love is a Battlefield.
1343000	1344000	Thank you, Pat.
1344000	1347000	And then Jordan Sparks sang about a battlefield too.
1347000	1350000	Oh no. I'll take it back three.
1350000	1352000	Snake Eater was my favorite.
1352000	1354000	Was it the song? Because the song was pretty great.
1354000	1361000	It was the music and the fact that you go back and it finally clears up some things that you've been waiting on for a while.
1361000	1366000	And just the origin of it, basically. It was really, really great.
1366000	1370000	I remember with that one E3 where they gave away the Snake Eater on vinyl.
1370000	1372000	Do you know how much that must be worth these days?
1372000	1373000	I've got two of them.
1373000	1375000	Oh my god, you should look them up on eBay.
1375000	1376000	They're probably worth the money.
1376000	1377000	No.
1377000	1380000	Anyway, out of curiosity, have you played Phantom Pain yet?
1380000	1386000	I have not. It's on my list to pick up things. I'm always really slow on picking up games.
1386000	1387000	That's fine.
1387000	1392000	But I played, what was it, the Ground Zeroes?
1392000	1393000	Yeah.
1393000	1396000	Yeah. I played that and that was cool, I guess.
1396000	1406000	It didn't quite scratch that Metal Gear itch for me, but it's essentially a demo, so you can't ask for too much out of a demo.
1406000	1412000	So obviously, if you like Metal Gear, you must be a bit of a Kojima fan, so what do you think about all this fuckery between Kojima and Konami?
1412000	1413000	Sad face.
1413000	1416000	I think that's the only way to describe it.
1416000	1419000	That's like when your computer crashes in Windows 10.
1419000	1423000	They got rid of the blue screen to death, now it literally just puts up a sad face.
1423000	1430000	I'm sad. They took a cue out of Apple's playbook. That's what the Mac always did, right? Like a little sad computer.
1430000	1432000	So they have a little sad face that comes up now.
1432000	1446000	It was just really shitty to see how that all ended because it's just, especially for me, being a big Metal Gear fan and seeing Kojima's name on all the titles.
1446000	1454000	It's like, man, this guy's done quite a bit with Konami, and then it was just, nah, fuck you.
1454000	1455000	They have it all be over.
1455000	1461000	Yeah, it was just like a shitty breakup. It was almost like watching a friend go through a horrible breakup.
1461000	1462000	It is.
1462000	1467000	It's just disgusting and awkward and sad.
1467000	1470000	Yeah, they ran away from home to join a soccer league.
1470000	1473000	Yes, or a baseball team.
1474000	1480000	Anyhow, I want to introduce him real fast. He is here in studio. Hand the mic over to Shane. Hi, Shane, how are you?
1480000	1481000	Hi.
1481000	1483000	Do you want to say anything about baseball and how Mike's wrong?
1483000	1487000	I want to go into the other room with this mic so I don't have to be in the same room with him.
1487000	1489000	How are you doing this week?
1489000	1490000	Fine.
1490000	1491000	How's Power Rangers toy hunting?
1491000	1492000	I'm technically done.
1492000	1494000	Alright. Congrats.
1494000	1495000	Thank you.
1495000	1496000	Good job on that.
1496000	1497000	It'll never end, though, for real.
1497000	1501000	Tell us the latest and greatest in amiibo hunting because you're kind of our amiibo expert here.
1501000	1508000	There's no hunting really going on right now. The 3-pack came out today for the fighters and I picked that up and they're not bad looking.
1508000	1510000	The end.
1510000	1511000	The end.
1511000	1518000	I'm going to be very mean here and spoil a little bit of what I know Loki's going to talk about in the opening here, but I know you love right now this year.
1518000	1520000	You talk non-stop about Until Dawn.
1520000	1523000	Because it's so good. It's the best game this year.
1523000	1527000	Alright. Well, what did you think when the Sony thing happened this week?
1527000	1529000	I already heard about that.
1529000	1530000	Until Dawn in VR.
1530000	1539000	I heard about that before they announced it and it doesn't look great, but, you know, if it gives them a little more money to make a real game, then that's fine.
1539000	1543000	Do you think that they just took this existing idea and just slapped Until Dawn's name on it?
1543000	1550000	Possibly, but I also think Sony made them make this before they found out Until Dawn was actually successful.
1550000	1552000	Interesting. Is it the same studio doing it?
1552000	1553000	Yeah.
1553000	1555000	Huh. Interesting. Did you want to comment on that, Dan?
1555000	1556000	No.
1556000	1557000	Oh, I saw you, like, pointing. Alright.
1557000	1558000	I think that's a good point.
1558000	1560000	Yeah. That's a good point. Alright.
1560000	1563000	Let's see. Anything else to check in on Shane with? Let's see.
1563000	1566000	I got an epitome, though, also from my non-girlfriend at Toys R Us.
1566000	1569000	Okay. Can you tell us about your girlfriend at Toys R Us?
1569000	1571000	There's this girl that I always talk to at Toys R Us.
1571000	1573000	And I'm using girlfriend in my quotey fingers.
1573000	1574000	I even met her.
1574000	1576000	Yeah. Yeah, Jamie met her.
1576000	1579000	Completely independently of Shane being there.
1579000	1583000	Does she listen to OLR? Because if not, you need to go take the show information.
1583000	1590000	Anyway. Anyway. So there's this girl at Toys R Us that always helps me with Power Rangers and amiibo stuff.
1590000	1595000	And I always go, because Toys R Us' layout, Power Rangers is really close to amiibo.
1595000	1600000	So I just head straight back there, look at my Power Rangers, go look at amiibo, and then I'm done.
1600000	1602000	And I talk to her a little bit, and she helps me find things.
1602000	1605000	Like, that's how I found a lot of the stuff that I've been looking for.
1605000	1611000	And then I guess her coworkers keep asking her if I am her boyfriend, because I always go back there and talk to her.
1611000	1614000	So it got me a pit amiibo.
1616000	1617000	So there it is.
1617000	1619000	Best relationship ever.
1619000	1626000	Shane goes shopping for amiibo so much that Toys R Us employees think he's in a relationship with the girl.
1626000	1631000	Mostly Power Ranger toys, let's be honest, because amiibo only happened when I couldn't find Power Ranger toys.
1631000	1633000	All right. Fair enough. Fair enough.
1633000	1637000	All right. Maybe we'll hear from Shane again later in the show. Maybe we won't. I don't know.
1637000	1641000	But I do want to talk a little bit here, get into a kickoff topic for tonight.
1641000	1650000	And I want to talk about, this is interesting because this doesn't really have to do with video gaming, but it totally does.
1650000	1654000	And if you've been watching your blogs and your social media feed this week,
1654000	1661000	then I'm sure you have inevitably seen that all your friends are watching on Twitch, Bob Ross.
1661000	1672000	Yes, that's right. The painter from the 70s is now streaming on Twitch TV, the network dedicated to video games and streaming gameplay.
1672000	1677000	And you might be wondering, what the hell? Like, what does Bob Ross have to do with video games?
1677000	1678000	That's what I'm wondering.
1678000	1685000	Because, well, I know there was supposed to be a Bob Ross game on the Wii like years and years ago, but I think it got canceled.
1685000	1689000	Like it didn't actually end up happening. I just remember a story on that a long time ago, which would have been awesome.
1689000	1697000	I just want to preface with this. Bob Ross is fucking rad. And like, when this happened this week, this actually kind of made me giddy.
1697000	1702000	I was like, Bob Ross is streaming on Twitch? I'm like, I don't even need to know the reason.
1702000	1708000	Like, just, it's fine. Just, you know, that's it. Like, I don't need to know. But here is the reason.
1708000	1714000	So, Twitch is starting to open up a little more and they released this blog post about Twitch Creative.
1714000	1722000	Now, Twitch was already running creative streams. And by creative streams meaning people doing artwork, maybe that's game inspired.
1722000	1727000	People doing music that's game inspired or just, you know, kind of adjacent.
1727000	1730000	It's a really weird gray area because it doesn't have to be about games.
1730000	1734000	I know they do, like, live podcasts would sometimes stream through Twitch as well.
1734000	1737000	That's a little different. That's considered a gaming talk show. That's not a part of this.
1737000	1740000	But that is another, like, non-gaming thing that's there.
1740000	1744000	So, let's see. Part of the blog post here.
1744000	1751000	The Twitch community has included a determined community of artists, crafters, and builders who have been using Twitch to broadcast their creative processes.
1751000	1756000	These creative broadcasters share many of the same characteristics as all Twitch broadcasters.
1756000	1759000	Passion, engagement, and a community-centric world view.
1759000	1762000	Today we're happy to announce our official support for the Twitch creative community.
1762000	1766000	There are a few things that make the creative category unlike anything else on Twitch.
1766000	1770000	So, we along with our launch partner Adobe are excited to see what you can dream up.
1770000	1773000	Obviously Adobe, you know, Photoshop, pretty big deal.
1773000	1776000	And all the other illustrator and all the other tools they make.
1776000	1783000	So, they have a new landing page for the creative category to highlight specifically creative broadcasts and so forth.
1783000	1788000	And then at the end of this they just say, thanks to our friends at Janssen Media and Bob Ross Inc.
1788000	1795000	We'll broadcast every episode of the original Bob Ross show, The Joy of Painting, in an epic marathon starting at 2 p.m. Pacific.
1795000	1802000	That's 403 episodes of Bob Ross that will play over the course of 8.5 days.
1802000	1805000	And there's a special Bob Ross Kappa emote, too.
1805000	1809000	So, the Bob Ross tie-in is to celebrate, basically.
1809000	1815000	I mean, even though Twitch already had this creative side, now we're embracing it and taking the next step with it.
1815000	1824000	Which is so interesting to me because Twitch started as a spinoff of Justin TV, which was more about life casting and so forth.
1824000	1830000	But I would have expected that most of this stuff, if Justin TV was still around, would be on Justin TV.
1830000	1833000	So, it's almost like they're bringing back a little piece of that.
1833000	1839000	Because there's nothing that says that the music, the art, and all this stuff you do has to be games, necessarily.
1839000	1844000	I could be drawing, I don't know, the Golden Girls tattoo I'm going to get for my birthday.
1844000	1846000	And that would be art, right?
1846000	1850000	But I guess because I'm still a gamer in the gaming community, it counts.
1850000	1854000	But I mean, I'm not slamming it by any means. I think it's really cool.
1854000	1860000	And I know, DarkSakura, you're a creative individual.
1860000	1867000	Because then I say, and I'm not, but these sorts of things I know are things that you have done.
1867000	1870000	You've done broadcasting of art and so forth.
1870000	1878000	When I was doing all that Mass Effect artwork, like just the Let Me Draw Your Shepherd thing was going on.
1878000	1882000	I think I did like 24 different femsheps.
1882000	1892000	And I streamed almost all of the artwork I did, either on Twitch or livestream when I moved to livestream.
1892000	1897000	Because livestream I thought was a little bit better for that audience.
1897000	1900000	Well yeah, and I think you hit the nail on the head what Twitch is trying to say.
1900000	1906000	Is they're basically, they're literally rolling out the red carpet saying, you are welcome here with this.
1906000	1914000	It was easier streaming on Twitch. Livestream was kind of not exactly easy, but Twitch was super easy.
1914000	1922000	So I would be more than happy to go back and do the next artwork if I ever have time to do it on Twitch.
1922000	1928000	I actually didn't even know Twitch had stuff other than games.
1928000	1931000	I mean that's just me not really exploring Twitch.
1931000	1936000	Because for the most part all I've been doing is watching people play Hearthstone.
1936000	1939000	Or watch the tournaments and stuff like that.
1939000	1943000	Because Blizzard doesn't do too many tournaments throughout the year.
1943000	1948000	So it's a bunch of other people doing their own League Championships and all that other jazz.
1948000	1950000	But that's pretty cool.
1950000	1954000	I think it's probably a lot easier to get into that than what YouTube is trying to do.
1954000	1957000	Trying to get into the streaming with the gaming thing.
1957000	1966000	Because trying to get people to switch from Twitch where it seems really easy and everybody's already invested in it.
1966000	1977000	It's going to be a lot harder for them to do that than people wanting to get into streaming creative stuff.
1977000	1981000	Like the drawings and all that other stuff.
1981000	1987000	And what you just said I think hits the nail on the head of why I think this move on Twitch is part.
1987000	1990000	And I've been critical of Twitch in the past when necessary.
1990000	1993000	I've been complimentary of Twitch in the past when necessary.
1993000	1997000	I think this move that they did with the Bob Ross stream is genius.
1997000	2005000	It just shows that they're not just gaming and that, hey by the way you can do other things on here as opposed to...
2005000	2007000	It got your attention.
2007000	2013000	Like what the hell is Bob Ross, who is awesome by the way, doing on Twitch TV?
2013000	2016000	That's the reaction I think every person's having this week, right?
2016000	2020000	So I don't know. Shane, you're shaking your head. You don't agree?
2020000	2023000	I gotta hear this. I gotta hear this.
2023000	2026000	Why are you shaking your head no over there?
2026000	2030000	Because I watch a lot of Twitch. Let's get that out of the way.
2030000	2034000	It's more entertaining than Netflix and Hulu most of the time.
2034000	2039000	But good on them for opening it up. I don't want to watch Bob Ross.
2039000	2041000	I guess you don't have to.
2041000	2043000	But Bob Ross is awesome.
2043000	2045000	That's why I'm shaking my head too. I just don't care about him.
2045000	2047000	I think Bob Ross is awesome.
2047000	2050000	Here's why I think the Bob Ross stuff is awesome.
2050000	2055000	Why did live streaming, and this is again why I use that word genius.
2055000	2061000	And I don't know if this is one of those idiot savant things where they didn't even know how genius this was and they signed the deal.
2061000	2063000	But I'm gonna tell you why this is genius.
2063000	2067000	Why is live streaming of video games popular in the first place?
2067000	2070000	Because I like watching Until Dawn. That's why.
2070000	2074000	What made live streaming break through? Anybody in the room.
2074000	2079000	What was the game and why did live streaming really break through?
2079000	2083000	Wouldn't it have been like League of Legends or Dota in that instance?
2083000	2088000	I would say that's kind of like one half of the coin, but there's another big half of the coin.
2088000	2090000	What's the other game?
2090000	2092000	Anybody. Anybody.
2092000	2095000	Anybody. It's got the word craft in it.
2095000	2096000	Warcraft.
2096000	2097000	Minecraft.
2097000	2098000	Minecraft.
2098000	2099000	Crafty craft.
2099000	2101000	Minecraft is one of the big reasons.
2101000	2102000	Craft cheese.
2102000	2104000	Why streaming is popular.
2104000	2108000	And you may not totally agree with what I'm saying, but hear me out here.
2108000	2111000	Why do people watch Minecraft streams?
2111000	2112000	Because they're on drugs.
2112000	2115000	Shane says because they're on drugs.
2116000	2121000	Well, it's the same reason you sit and play it for mindless hours of doing nothing.
2121000	2125000	Creating. You're creating, right?
2125000	2127000	I destroy.
2127000	2130000	How many times were we seeing news posts on game blogs?
2130000	2134000	Somebody made a video game sprite in Minecraft.
2134000	2137000	Somebody made this amazing roller coaster in Minecraft.
2137000	2140000	Somebody created this whole little universe.
2140000	2143000	Somebody recreated Disneyland in Minecraft.
2143000	2149000	And it was like, you see all these things that people painted in Minecraft.
2149000	2151000	Minecraft was the canvas.
2151000	2155000	That's why the Bob Ross tie-in is genius.
2155000	2163000	Because it's so, everything that Bob Ross says in a lot of these things, in his art and about expression,
2163000	2167000	applies to these creative gaming streams like Minecraft, I think.
2167000	2168000	I don't know.
2168000	2170000	Again, maybe I'm giving it too much credit.
2170000	2178000	But that was kind of what I saw in it, where I was like, wow, that is a really subtly awesome connection.
2178000	2180000	Not bad for a former drill sergeant.
2180000	2182000	Was Bob Ross a drill sergeant?
2182000	2183000	Yep.
2183000	2184000	Get out.
2184000	2185000	Also, the fro was all branding.
2185000	2186000	Oh, I'm sure.
2186000	2187000	He apparently hated it.
2187000	2188000	Oh, really?
2188000	2189000	Yep.
2189000	2191000	But the hair was recognizable.
2191000	2196000	And if you want to see something funny, you should see the guy he replaced on The Joy of Painting.
2197000	2199000	Something Alexander.
2199000	2203000	This kind of bitter German guy.
2203000	2204000	It was really funny.
2204000	2205000	Gotcha.
2205000	2206000	Doesn't sound very joyous.
2206000	2207000	No.
2207000	2208000	All right.
2208000	2212000	Well, going back to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
2212000	2215000	actdef says, I haven't seen Bob Ross' stream.
2215000	2220000	It's just twitch.tv slash bobross, and I think the marathon should be going for another couple days.
2220000	2223000	So, after tonight's show, you can go check that out for a little bit.
2223000	2230000	But do remember, it's a 1970s TV show, so don't expect it to be like, you know, but this was the stuff.
2230000	2234000	I remember from when I was a kid, because if I got up really, really early on a Saturday,
2234000	2240000	this is what was on before like square one television and the stuff I was really trying to watch was Bob Ross.
2240000	2247000	Bob Ross, for me, I forever associate him with watching Doctor Who in the early 80s.
2247000	2248000	Got it.
2248000	2253000	I watch both of them on PBS like the same, you know.
2253000	2263000	And Jason in our chat, vxjasonxv, our announcer says, what Twitch's creative program means is also partnering creative broadcasters.
2263000	2267000	A few friends of mine I met in September have already been partnered since this program started.
2267000	2271000	So, that's an important little footnote too is that now Twitch is actually partnering with some of those groups as well.
2271000	2279000	I thought they already had some partnerships with like, you know, celebrities like Darude was obviously the big like kind of tongue-in-cheek one.
2279000	2284000	Doesn't Skrillex have a stream on there? Am I crazy? I thought that was a thing.
2284000	2289000	There was some other electronic musician who had a random stream on there that would do random stuff.
2289000	2293000	Maybe I'm blurring the lines here a little bit. I apologize.
2293000	2294000	A Minecraft stream?
2294000	2296000	Maybe, maybe.
2297000	2302000	No, I'm thinking, not Skrillex, I'm thinking of, what's his name, Deadmau5.
2302000	2304000	That's it. It's Deadmau5, not Skrillex.
2304000	2305000	That makes sense.
2305000	2306000	My bad.
2306000	2311000	Caijuto in chat says, Bob Ross was on until the 90s, so it's not just 70s stuff.
2311000	2316000	Yeah, but I don't think a single thing changed on that set in the 20 years the show was on.
2316000	2320000	So, yes, it was on in the 90s, but it was still the same damn show they were making in the 70s.
2320000	2321000	Alright.
2321000	2323000	Anyhow, there it is.
2323000	2327000	Bob Ross on Twitch, and again, I gotta hand it to him.
2327000	2329000	You know, credit where credit is due.
2329000	2333000	That was a great move to bring exposure to this side of things.
2333000	2337000	Alright, we're going to start off now after our kickoff topic, getting into our gaming weeks
2337000	2340000	and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2340000	2343000	So, let's go around the room real quick and check out what games have you been playing this week?
2343000	2344000	Darzaka.
2344000	2347000	Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer, because it's cool.
2347000	2350000	You can design their yards and pick the house.
2350000	2353000	And I had to design a schoolroom because Isabel told me to.
2353000	2355000	I love Isabel.
2355000	2358000	And it's just really fun.
2358000	2361000	And it's not like you have to do it every day, like all the stuff in Animal Crossing.
2361000	2366000	You can just do it as you want to, and it's not on the clock like that.
2366000	2368000	So, it's really fun.
2368000	2373000	I've played a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition because I have new mods.
2373000	2374000	Because it's you.
2374000	2375000	Shut up.
2375000	2378000	I say that with love.
2378000	2379000	Girl.
2380000	2384000	Also, Dan and I are going through Super Metroid.
2384000	2389000	He has learned that he hates playing it with the Wii U controller.
2389000	2393000	So, we're using our Wii Classic controller.
2393000	2398000	And we just beat Ridley before the show.
2398000	2402000	And we're trying to get the last reserve tank.
2402000	2404000	We have all the E tanks and all the stuff.
2404000	2409000	So, we're going to get the last reserve tank and then go after Mother Brain to Torian.
2409000	2411000	Awesome. Well, good luck.
2411000	2413000	Well, it's Dan playing, so it'll be fine.
2413000	2414000	I suck at Super Metroid.
2414000	2416000	Aren't you still there guiding him through?
2416000	2420000	Surely, I know you and Dan, and you're sitting there telling him what to do.
2420000	2422000	I know that's the case.
2422000	2425000	We've actually discovered a trope.
2425000	2427000	I guide him onto spikes.
2429000	2431000	I'm like, no, you're going the wrong way.
2431000	2434000	I go down, so he'll just jump and land on spikes.
2434000	2436000	I'm like, husband.
2436000	2439000	So, finally, I led him into this one room.
2439000	2441000	And lo and behold, there are spikes.
2441000	2445000	And it's the room on the wrecked ship where you jump on the Chozo statue.
2445000	2448000	And it carries you down through the spikes and into the ground.
2448000	2449000	Yes, I remember that.
2449000	2452000	And Dan's like, we did this.
2452000	2453000	We did this.
2453000	2456000	I was like, yeah, but did you see that there's a pipe leading under the Chozo statue?
2456000	2460000	Oh, so, yeah, we're playing together.
2460000	2461000	We're playing together.
2461000	2462000	Good.
2463000	2467000	And so, next we are going to be doing...
2469000	2471000	Crap, what was the one?
2471000	2474000	Not Zero Mission, because that was the first one.
2474000	2477000	The one that was on Game Boy Advance.
2478000	2480000	Oh, God.
2480000	2482000	Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion.
2482000	2484000	Metroid Fusion.
2484000	2486000	So, we're going to be, I think, doing that one next.
2486000	2488000	I know Prime was GameCube, but I know they came out at the same time.
2488000	2493000	And you know the whole Prime trilogy is on the Wii U store for like 20 bucks.
2493000	2494000	Not bad.
2494000	2497000	Although, we already have three and haven't touched it.
2497000	2499000	But, yeah, that's going to be next.
2499000	2502000	And then we're going to be doing Earthbound Zero.
2502000	2503000	Nice.
2503000	2505000	So, we bought that right quick.
2505000	2506000	Great.
2506000	2508000	Sounds like you've had a fun week.
2508000	2509000	Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?
2509000	2513000	I didn't play a whole lot because I was working on my costume.
2513000	2516000	But I did play a little bit of Minecraft Windows 10 Edition.
2516000	2518000	And, I don't know.
2518000	2521000	I keep playing it, but there's like no point to it, it seems like.
2521000	2523000	I just, I don't know.
2523000	2525000	The survival is super easy.
2525000	2529000	And I just don't feel motivated to do anything in it.
2529000	2531000	It's definitely a lot more fun with other people.
2531000	2536000	I'm actually thinking about going back to the PC version to play with all the mods on there.
2536000	2538000	But, it runs so well in Windows 10.
2538000	2541000	I was like, why can't you just add mods to this one?
2541000	2544000	Because this client runs so much better than your other one.
2544000	2548000	But no, they don't want mods on this one, so it's fucking annoying.
2548000	2551000	So I did that, and then I played a little bit of Ingress.
2551000	2559000	And, I reinstalled Burnout Paradise, the box thing or whatever.
2559000	2562000	Because I thought I had it on my PC, but I don't.
2562000	2564000	And I want to play some more of that.
2564000	2568000	And then, apparently I have Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, which I was unaware of.
2568000	2570000	So, I'll try that too.
2570000	2575000	Also, I think I downloaded it on Origin for Command & Conquer Red Alert 2, because that's free.
2575000	2577000	I'll double check that.
2577000	2578000	That's it.
2578000	2580000	Alright. Fair enough.
2580000	2582000	My Gaming Week.
2582000	2586000	We had a conversation on last week's show about Minecraft, Windows 10 edition.
2586000	2589000	I actually did install that and get it all up and running after last week's show.
2589000	2591000	So I was playing that for a little bit.
2591000	2593000	I was enjoying it.
2594000	2600000	It's interesting how you get achievements in that game that are actually tied to your Xbox gamer score.
2600000	2604000	Which I realize is a thing in Windows 10, but it's just kind of weird how that works now.
2604000	2608000	The achievements are on your PC and your Xbox 360.
2608000	2611000	It kind of annoys me though that they don't have the interface like the Xbox 360 one.
2611000	2614000	Where if you have the parts, it shows you what you can make.
2614000	2616000	Yeah, that I don't like.
2616000	2618000	That I don't like.
2618000	2621000	I guess that's kind of the point you're supposed to discover recipes and stuff.
2621000	2623000	No one fucking does that. They just look up that shit on the internet.
2623000	2625000	No one does that.
2625000	2627000	It's easy. Game facts on the second monitor.
2627000	2629000	Alright. Let's see. Other stuff I played this week.
2629000	2631000	Honestly, more stuff I've talked about before.
2631000	2633000	More Diablo 3. More Final Fantasy XIV.
2633000	2636000	So really as far as new stuff, I only did some demos.
2636000	2638000	So I'm just going to talk really quick.
2638000	2640000	Because I don't like to give full impression on games based on demos.
2640000	2642000	But you know we all do it.
2642000	2644000	So Guitar Hero Live.
2644000	2646000	I played one of the in-store demos.
2646000	2648000	And I actually thought it was kind of rad.
2648000	2653000	It's kind of different than the music games from a few years ago.
2653000	2659000	Just in its formula where now you have the buttons for down and the buttons for up.
2659000	2662000	Or sometimes you push them at the same time or whatever.
2662000	2665000	And the full motion video I thought was kind of funny.
2665000	2671000	Even though it's so 1990s with the video that changes depending on how well you're doing.
2671000	2677000	But the attention to detail and the filming and all the extras and stuff is done so well.
2677000	2681000	I was actually laughing and I was enjoying failing a song.
2681000	2685000	Because the reactions that people have are so funny.
2685000	2688000	Like the camera will pan down and it shows the audience.
2688000	2691000	And there'll be a girl who's looking up really blankly at you.
2691000	2693000	And then she'll just stick her tongue out at you.
2693000	2695000	And I don't know why but that just made me die laughing.
2695000	2696000	It was so funny.
2696000	2698000	And then just the expression on the drummer's face.
2698000	2701000	Like, dude, what are you doing?
2701000	2704000	It's so hilarious.
2704000	2710000	So yeah, I just thought it was more interesting to look at than the characters we've been used to in music games for a while.
2710000	2715000	So Alan Alchemy also putting out a chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2715000	2719000	It's in HD and it's obvious it had good production values.
2719000	2722000	Full motion video stuff in the 90s was cheap, cheap, cheap.
2722000	2725000	Yeah, no, this had some good production values to it.
2725000	2727000	So I gotta give credit where credit's due.
2727000	2731000	I'm very enticed by the fact that they have this whole MTV side of things.
2731000	2735000	Where you can basically play along to an MTV style network.
2735000	2737000	And it's like we're bringing MTV back.
2737000	2739000	Now it's like GHTV or whatever.
2739000	2741000	It's very interesting to me.
2741000	2749000	But then I think, God, I have to spend $80 on another plastic guitar when I just bought Rock Band 4.
2749000	2751000	I don't know.
2751000	2753000	You know, Shane tried though.
2753000	2755000	Shane tried really hard to get me to get...
2755000	2756000	I did not try really hard.
2756000	2758000	Wait, hand him the mic here real quick.
2758000	2760000	You kept saying...
2760000	2763000	I didn't try hard at all. That was my passive trying.
2763000	2764000	You said, and I quote,
2764000	2768000	Look Rob, here's that Guitar Hero game you're gonna go home with.
2768000	2771000	No, no, but that's passively.
2771000	2774000	This is the Guitar Hero you're looking for.
2774000	2776000	You will buy this Guitar Hero.
2776000	2779000	And then you were so proud you said that you deserved a medal.
2779000	2783000	I was like, well, it's in the Guitar Hero box. You have to go back and get it.
2785000	2787000	Anyway, so there was that.
2787000	2791000	The other demo I played this week was Yo-kai Watch on the 3DS.
2791000	2794000	And Shane's shaking his head because he knows we disagree on this.
2794000	2797000	I think Shane did two battles and said this is stupid.
2797000	2798000	Yup.
2798000	2800000	But I thought it was a lot of fun.
2800000	2806000	Here's the thing, I get why the battle system in Yo-kai Watch is different.
2806000	2809000	Because it's not like, you know, fight, magic, run type of thing.
2809000	2811000	You know, press A to do whatever.
2811000	2813000	But the characters auto attack.
2813000	2816000	And what you do is that you have this wheel of six characters.
2816000	2820000	So you have a line of, you know, three that are in the front and three that are in the back.
2820000	2823000	So the three in the front are consistently attacking.
2823000	2826000	And they build up their little meters and they can do a super move.
2826000	2828000	So then you can tap your little thing to do a super move.
2828000	2834000	And you play like a WarioWare style game for five seconds to do like a big attack of some sort.
2834000	2839000	And then if they get knocked out, you cycle them to the back row.
2839000	2841000	And then you can do like a WarioWare style game to revive them.
2841000	2844000	And I don't know, I thought it was kind of fast paced and different.
2844000	2847000	Like a WarioWare battle style system. I thought it was kind of cool.
2847000	2849000	So, I don't know. I don't know why Shane didn't like it.
2849000	2852000	I just thought the demo was too short. That was my only problem with it.
2852000	2855000	But it interested me enough to get the full game.
2855000	2857000	So I probably will get Yo-kai Watch when it comes out.
2857000	2860000	So, there you go. That was the other game I played this week.
2860000	2864000	Let's go to our guest this week. Who has the microphone?
2864000	2867000	Alright, Dan, do you want to tell us about your gaming week?
2867000	2871000	Sure. I was, you know, played Hearthstone a bit.
2871000	2873000	Tried to do that for a little bit.
2873000	2875000	Nothing as serious as Michael's been trying to do.
2875000	2877000	But just my own little thing.
2877000	2885000	I did log on to Final Fantasy XIV after being off and on very sporadically throughout the month.
2885000	2888000	Because of the Halloween event, which is fantastic.
2888000	2893000	Anyone listening who hasn't done that event yet but has a subscription needs to tune in and do that.
2893000	2898000	Because that broom mount that you can get at the end of the event is magical.
2898000	2900000	And I want everyone to have it.
2900000	2902000	I love that mount too.
2902000	2908000	But, you know, if you're too lazy to log in, they'll probably sell it for $5 in the store after the holiday's over.
2908000	2910000	But it won't be until next year.
2910000	2911000	Because that seems to be the trend they're doing.
2911000	2915000	Is they'll wait until the next year's holiday before they release it on the store.
2915000	2922000	So you've got 365 days where you can brag that you got that mount and everyone else can just cry.
2925000	2928000	Alright. Is that it? Final Fantasy XIV?
2928000	2932000	Well, if we're going back further in the month, we did play Until Dawn.
2932000	2936000	Both myself, Michael, and our friend Aaron, who you know.
2936000	2939000	The listeners don't, so it's alright.
2939000	2941000	There's another guy that you don't know.
2941000	2942000	Yes, another guy that no one else knows.
2942000	2945000	We did play Until Dawn over the weekend.
2945000	2947000	And it was a lot of fun.
2947000	2952000	I mean, we love those 90s horrible horror movies.
2952000	2954000	I love Nightmare on Elm Street.
2954000	2956000	And for some reason, this month...
2956000	2957000	That wasn't the 90s. It was the 80s.
2957000	2959000	Well, Scream. That's what I'm thinking.
2959000	2962000	I'm thinking Scream was 90s. Yeah, Nightmare on Elm Street was 80s.
2962000	2965000	But still, love those kind of horror slasher fics.
2965000	2967000	Until Dawn was a great way to kind of reinvigorate that.
2967000	2971000	And I actually ended up watching a lot of horror movies following that.
2971000	2973000	Because it kind of just spurred us on.
2973000	2976000	And it's very heavy rain.
2976000	2978000	Very, very similar to heavy rain.
2978000	2981000	In terms of how you make the decisions and everything.
2981000	2983000	But it's a lot of fun.
2983000	2986000	Especially to play that with friends who are also into horror movies.
2986000	2989000	And really bad tropes and everything.
2989000	2992000	Sorry, I love this comment in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2992000	2993000	Tigerclaw says,
2993000	2997000	Scream were horror movies for hipsters.
2997000	3000000	Isn't your Twitter handle gaming hipster?
3000000	3002000	It is. It is.
3002000	3005000	So, you got me.
3005000	3008000	I'm not going to try to get out of that one.
3009000	3013000	But what's funny though is that even though I don't usually like horror movies.
3013000	3016000	Gore is what I have a big problem with. I don't like that stuff.
3016000	3019000	But I thought the Scream movies were funny.
3019000	3020000	They're supposed to be.
3020000	3022000	I like that they were tongue in cheek.
3022000	3024000	So it made it more entertaining.
3024000	3027000	Yeah, it's supposed to be a satire. So that's what's hilarious about it.
3027000	3029000	Yeah. Alright, cool.
3029000	3033000	I bet Shane's very happy to hear that you have a lot of Until Dawn timing under your belt.
3034000	3041000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Undrated with vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, CAMEL.
3041000	3044000	Alright, how about you, Mike? What have you been up to? How was your gaming week?
3044000	3047000	Let's see, I played...
3047000	3048000	Don't forget that mic.
3048000	3049000	Like I said, I played a lot of...
3049000	3050000	Real close.
3050000	3051000	I know.
3051000	3053000	I played a lot of Hearthstone this week.
3053000	3055000	This month, really.
3055000	3059000	Actually logged into 14 for the first time all month.
3059000	3061000	Like two days ago.
3061000	3062000	To get that, yeah.
3062000	3067000	For that broom mount and all that fabulous Halloween gear.
3067000	3068000	It was awesome.
3068000	3072000	And promptly dyed it because that purple was hideous.
3074000	3079000	Other than that, I just decided to brush off some old games on my phone.
3079000	3084000	I started playing, or tried to replay some Sword and Sorcery, Monument Valley.
3084000	3088000	Those are some pretty good, beautiful games.
3088000	3090000	I'm the gaming hipster.
3091000	3094000	Sorry, I found them on the App Store.
3094000	3096000	Like, just one day.
3096000	3098000	And I was like, ooh, let's try this.
3098000	3103000	Monument Valley is really gorgeous, and everyone should play that one.
3103000	3107000	I forgot to mention, I actually played Hearthstone for the first time in probably like a year today,
3107000	3108000	thanks to your guys' influence.
3108000	3111000	Because you were like, oh, you should check it out.
3111000	3114000	And then I actually beat Dan, which I wasn't expecting to happen.
3114000	3117000	So I don't know if he just let me win to boost my ego a little bit.
3117000	3121000	He didn't let you win, but you guys played with similar level decks.
3121000	3122000	I see.
3122000	3125000	So it was a fair fight.
3125000	3126000	Yeah, it was a fair fight.
3126000	3130000	So it wasn't like a deck he built or anything like that.
3130000	3131000	Fair enough.
3131000	3132000	Well, I might have to play a little more.
3132000	3133000	So that was good.
3133000	3134000	Proud of you.
3134000	3135000	Thank you.
3135000	3136000	Thank you.
3136000	3137000	All right.
3137000	3138000	Well, I think that's going to do it.
3138000	3141000	Unless Shane wants to jump in with his gaming week, but I'm thinking, I don't know.
3141000	3142000	Shane, what do you want to say about your gaming week?
3142000	3144000	Do I not play video games?
3144000	3145000	Why were you going to skip me?
3145000	3146000	That's really rude.
3146000	3147000	I don't know if you want to.
3147000	3148000	Really rude.
3148000	3149000	Fine.
3149000	3150000	Well, how was your game?
3150000	3152000	I want an apology first.
3152000	3160000	Shane, I am so sorry that you don't like candy corn.
3160000	3161000	How was your game week?
3161000	3167000	I played 14 for the first time in months and months and months.
3167000	3168000	And then got yourself locked out.
3168000	3175000	Then I got myself locked out because I had to get a new phone and I attached my authenticator.
3175000	3181000	But when I got back, my Pokemon shuffle data, which is very important, was not on my phone.
3181000	3185000	So I restored it from a backup and that put a different authenticator on.
3185000	3187000	So now I'm locked out, which is funny.
3187000	3191000	But I got my Pokemon shuffle data back because I play that all the time.
3191000	3192000	Yeah.
3192000	3193000	Priorities for sure.
3193000	3195000	It's not hard to fix it though.
3195000	3196000	What?
3196000	3197000	Your authenticator stuff.
3197000	3199000	Oh, I have to contact Square.
3199000	3201000	I never had to do that.
3201000	3204000	I don't have the recovery key because I've had like three different ones now.
3204000	3205000	Oh, fun.
3205000	3218000	And I played and am in the process of playing the download case for the Ace Attorney game on 3DS because I hadn't done it yet.
3218000	3223000	And I've been watching a guy stream the entire series and it made me want to go back and play.
3223000	3225000	And I'm having such a blast.
3225000	3228000	Your defendant that you're defending is an Orca.
3228000	3230000	It's amazing.
3230000	3231000	Wow.
3231000	3232000	Yes.
3232000	3233000	It's so good.
3233000	3234000	It's so good.
3234000	3235000	All right.
3235000	3236000	No one till dawn this week?
3236000	3241000	I watched people play it and then one guy got really mad because on Twitch they were telling him what to do.
3241000	3245000	And he stopped playing for like ten minutes and went off on his chat room and was like, you're boring.
3245000	3247000	I just want to see people happen.
3247000	3248000	Why are you streaming your game?
3248000	3251000	Why are you streaming your game if that's the reaction you're going to have?
3251000	3253000	Don't stream your fucking game.
3253000	3254000	I don't know.
3254000	3255000	You should ask him.
3255000	3256000	I'm sorry.
3256000	3257000	I find that really gross.
3257000	3258000	I don't know.
3258000	3259000	Anyway.
3259000	3260000	Yeah.
3260000	3261000	Just don't look at your chat room.
3261000	3262000	It's weird.
3262000	3263000	Weird, weird, weird.
3263000	3264000	All right.
3264000	3265000	Anyhow, anything else, Shane?
3265000	3266000	I gave the mic away.
3266000	3268000	You are accordingly invited to share the rest of your week.
3268000	3269000	All right.
3269000	3270000	You gave the mic away.
3270000	3271000	All right.
3271000	3273000	Let's get into some housekeeping for this week.
3273000	3283000	And I don't have a whole lot to say except now that we're in November, I will say that we are not going to have a show the week of Thanksgiving here in the States.
3283000	3288000	So we will not be having a show on Sunday the, I think it's the 29th?
3288000	3290000	That's my hubby's birthday.
3290000	3291000	Yep.
3291000	3292000	I think just with Thanksgiving.
3292000	3293000	Which is an important holiday.
3293000	3297000	I think some people might go out of town and stuff and I doubt many of our listeners will be around either.
3297000	3298000	So we just won't be here that weekend.
3298000	3301000	So I have the best idea because Dan's going to turn 40.
3301000	3302000	Oh yeah.
3302000	3303000	Wow.
3303000	3304000	I'm going to get him a bunch of 40s.
3304000	3305000	You should.
3305000	3308000	He's going to drink a 40 when he turns 40 because that's so meta.
3308000	3309000	Yo dog.
3309000	3310000	I heard you like 40s.
3310000	3312000	So here's a 40 while you're turning 40.
3312000	3313000	I like it.
3313000	3314000	There you go.
3314000	3315000	Great.
3315000	3316000	40 40s.
3316000	3317000	All right.
3317000	3318000	So yeah.
3318000	3320000	So we will not be here that week, but we'll remind you as that gets a little bit closer here.
3321000	3322000	Otherwise follow us on Twitter.
3322000	3323000	Twitter dot com slash o l r.
3323000	3324000	We're also on Facebook.
3324000	3326000	Facebook dot com slash Orange launch radio.
3326000	3328000	Also very important.
3328000	3330000	One of our friends shows.
3330000	3332000	One of our friendly shows.
3332000	3336000	Another network show here at the voice network celebrating a big milestone this week.
3336000	3341000	So I want to give a big congratulations to Girls Gone Wow.
3341000	3346000	And Raven and EJ over at Girls Gone Wow hit 200 episodes.
3346000	3348000	They recorded it today.
3348000	3351000	Y'all at VOG will hear that on Wednesday.
3351000	3356000	And how apropro that this week is BlizzCon.
3356000	3360000	I don't know how they timed that so perfectly, but they did.
3360000	3365000	And I thought it was really cute because Raven and EJ were like taking selfies together today and putting it on Twitter.
3365000	3370000	And I don't think they're usually in the same place when they record, but they kind of came together for their 200th episode.
3370000	3380000	So if you have even a passing interest in World of Warcraft, I really urge you to go visit the gals over at Girls Gone Wow in celebration of their 200th episode.
3380000	3386000	And big congratulations to everybody that's involved with that show now, has been involved with that show in the past.
3386000	3391000	And just able to keep a topic about one game for so long going.
3391000	3393000	I couldn't do it.
3393000	3396000	I tried. We couldn't do it.
3396000	3400000	Good job ladies. You did something we couldn't do.
3400000	3402000	So there it is.
3402000	3409000	Thank gosh there's this general gaming show where we can always change and talk about whatever we want.
3409000	3412000	Because that's how we made it as far as we did.
3412000	3417000	In all seriousness, big congratulations to Girls Gone Wow. 200 episodes.
3417000	3422000	Okay, let's get into this week's gaming news.
3422000	3423000	We'll start off with Loki.
3423000	3427000	Yeah, so they have this big Sony Paris event where they announced a bunch of shit.
3427000	3431000	Mostly just kind of updates on things that have already been announced.
3431000	3437000	So for example, they talked a little bit about Uncharted 4, like it's going to have multiplayer now.
3437000	3442000	Which I kind of have to say, wow that's news.
3442000	3446000	I mean, kind of figured that it would have multiplayer. Most games do now, even if it's shoehorned in there.
3446000	3448000	But it does.
3448000	3452000	A release date for No Man's Sky, tentatively.
3452000	3455000	It's supposed to be June 2016.
3455000	3459000	Yay, another game for 2016 that I thought we were getting this year. Joy.
3459000	3462000	Well, whatever, it's fine. I'll wait longer.
3462000	3468000	They will have explained the game by that point, right? No, I'm kidding. I know they've done a better job of that recently.
3468000	3470000	I'm interested, I'm interested.
3470000	3477000	New quadratic dream game was Detroit Become Human, I guess.
3477000	3479000	Or Carrot in Detroit.
3479000	3485000	So it's kind of, I don't know, a quadratic dream game, I guess.
3485000	3487000	Lots of fangasms over that.
3487000	3488000	David Cage, yeah.
3488000	3490000	Shane's nodding his head over there.
3490000	3492000	I love Quantic Dream, they're the best.
3492000	3496000	And that Detroit trailer I've watched so many times, I'm so pumped up for that game.
3496000	3499000	I want it like last month, or the month before.
3499000	3501000	Here's the question I always ask, why?
3501000	3507000	Because it looks like, I don't care what people say about Quantic Dream games.
3507000	3512000	Like, oh, you know the writing's not good, the voice acting's not good, whatever.
3512000	3517000	I love Indigo Prophecy, I love Heavy Rain, I love Beyond Two Souls.
3517000	3525000	The storytelling I actually like, and they're always like, the stories are really good, and this one doesn't look like it's not gonna be good also.
3525000	3527000	You know what it really is? It's because he likes Until Dawn.
3527000	3533000	I think he likes Quick Time Events. He is a huge fan, huge boner for Quick Time Events.
3533000	3545000	I don't like Quick Time Events so much, but I always think, even with the crap that happened at the end of Indigo Prophecy,
3545000	3549000	and basically all of the games always have really bad endings for some reason,
3549000	3554000	they're so good, and I can just sit there and play them all the way through.
3554000	3560000	I can't think of a Quantic Dream game I didn't just sit down and play from start to finish.
3560000	3562000	Because I did that with all three of their other games.
3565000	3568000	Alrighty then. And I can't believe it's been like, how many years?
3568000	3574000	Like when they showed that first demo of, was it Carrow? That was 2012 I guess.
3574000	3579000	Yeah, but that was, I think that was before Beyond Two Souls, and it was just supposed to be like,
3579000	3582000	because they do little tech demos to show off their stuff.
3582000	3583000	Like the old guy.
3583000	3588000	Yeah, like the wizard in the studio that was just like a TV set or something.
3588000	3596000	But I don't think, even at the time I thought that Android robot thing demo was going to amount to anything.
3596000	3601000	But I'm glad it did, because even the trailer tugged at my heart a little bit. It was really good.
3603000	3611000	Some other things that they announced, they talked a little bit more about, was it the Horizon Zero Dawn,
3611000	3615000	which looks pretty awesome, they showed some more gameplay from that, still looking pretty cool.
3615000	3619000	So I definitely want to check that out whenever the hell that comes out, probably 2016 at this point.
3619000	3620000	2017, who knows.
3621000	3626000	Gravity Rush 2 is supposed to be coming out over here, as well as the remaster for Playstation 4.
3626000	3627000	So that's pretty cool.
3627000	3632000	They showed off a little bit more of Dreams, which is that new media molecule game,
3632000	3635000	which I still don't have any fucking clue what the fuck you're supposed to be doing in that,
3635000	3637000	but whatever, it's going to be kind of creative and shit.
3637000	3638000	So that'll be coming out.
3638000	3644000	Drive Club is getting bikes, so if you're still interested in that game, cool.
3645000	3648000	They'll be having some motorcycle content soon.
3650000	3653000	Let's see here, also Gran Turismo Sport.
3653000	3658000	So they're going to be doing a new racing game in typical Gran Turismo fashion.
3658000	3664000	It'll be coming out someday, because they're going to be working on it until it's right.
3664000	3666000	So we'll just wait a little longer for that.
3667000	3672000	They have this Minecraft-looking thing called Boundless that was shown off.
3672000	3678000	It's like a mythical Minecraft thing with these different portals that could take you to other worlds and stuff.
3678000	3680000	So that'll look kind of neat.
3681000	3683000	No real details on that, though.
3683000	3686000	And then they were showing off some VR stuff as well.
3686000	3689000	I like the whole Battlezone reboot.
3689000	3690000	That looked pretty sweet.
3690000	3692000	So they've got that from Rebellion.
3692000	3698000	They are talking about Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, which is going to be another VR game.
3698000	3702000	Riggs, which was the one that they showed off at E3.
3702000	3704000	Or was it Tokyo Game Show? One of those.
3705000	3710000	And then they have this game Robinson, The Journey, which is from Crytek.
3710000	3712000	So all different things.
3712000	3716000	Still no mention of when the fuck we should expect PlayStation VR.
3716000	3719000	So 2016, I guess.
3719000	3722000	Hadn't they quoted the 2016 timeframe previously, though?
3722000	3728000	I think, well, everything's kind of VR for 2016, but I don't know if it's early 2016 or holiday 2016.
3728000	3732000	I kind of feel like if they haven't dated it now, I know they spoke about early 2016 before,
3732000	3735000	but I really just feel like it's going to be holiday at this point.
3735000	3740000	They're going to keep it in their pants until the holiday, and then they'll have something to blow all over Christmas.
3740000	3743000	Maybe to see what the NX is, and then kind of combat that.
3743000	3754000	Maybe, but there's a lot of buzz that NX is basically a Wii U with a detachable gamepad that you can take wherever.
3754000	3758000	So I don't know how true or to what extent that ends up being.
3758000	3763000	Well, the other thing I would think is releasing the latter half of the year anyways would be a good idea,
3763000	3768000	because you're going to have at least people releasing stuff for Oculus when that comes out, I think in the beginning of 2016.
3768000	3772000	And then there'll be more content that can be ported over to PlayStation VR,
3772000	3777000	so it'd make more sense to have a platform with more content available instead of,
3777000	3783000	oh, here's a few games, and all right, let's wait until some more stuff comes out. I don't know.
3783000	3787000	All right. Anything else to share from Sony Paris Games Week?
3787000	3791000	They had a game called Vector that's a rhythm game. That looked pretty cool.
3791000	3795000	It's with a collaboration of an artist, Avicii.
3795000	3798000	Funny you mentioned that, because that was actually what I was about to mention,
3798000	3805000	was that particular game that, yeah, Avicii is collaborating for this PlayStation 4 game, Vector.
3805000	3811000	And they have this whole little preview video for it, but it looks like they have a very social kind of edge to this,
3811000	3816000	because you can actually design your own levels and then play against other people's levels.
3816000	3819000	So I'm assuming it's kind of like the thing where you can kind of make your own music tracks,
3819000	3821000	and then other people can actually play those tracks.
3821000	3822000	That's pretty cool.
3822000	3826000	So I guess it's like Mario Maker with music, and Avicii just kind of is there.
3826000	3831000	And then, last thing I want to add, they have a release date now for Street Fighter V,
3831000	3836000	which is supposed to be February 16th, and they announced Dalzim.
3836000	3840000	That seems kind of early in the year for such a huge game, but I guess...
3840000	3843000	No, they've been releasing a lot of fighting games around that time, in fact.
3843000	3848000	I mean, there's got to be something out for people to use their Christmas gift certificates on, right?
3848000	3852000	February gets a little busier in March. It's pretty good. I don't know.
3852000	3854000	I guess that's true. That's true.
3854000	3858000	Dark Sakura, next. I think we might have touched on this a little bit last week,
3858000	3860000	but we have some clarity on this, what you're about to talk about now.
3860000	3866000	Yeah, so Batman Arkham Knight is supposed to be...
3866000	3871000	Well, it was pretty disappointing, for lack of a better description.
3871000	3876000	I mean, so bad that Steam was offering refunds right away.
3876000	3878000	I'm sure we recall that, right?
3878000	3886000	So, they actually have relaunched Arkham Knight, and had a bunch of free goodies.
3886000	3898000	So, anyone who purchased the PC version before 11.59 Pacific Time on November 16th, 2015,
3898000	3902000	will receive free digital copies of the entire series.
3902000	3906000	So, that's going to be Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition,
3906000	3911000	Arkham City Game of the Year Edition, Batman Arkham Origins, and Blackgate.
3911000	3915000	So, you will be getting all of these goodies in your Steam library.
3915000	3919000	And there will also be the Community Challenge Pack, but that's coming out in January,
3919000	3921000	and no one knows what it is.
3921000	3926000	And WB is working with Valve for a Team Fortress 2 cross-promotion,
3926000	3931000	so that they're going to be doing Batman-themed items for Team Fortress 2.
3931000	3936000	And Valve will pick the best one and, I guess, put them in the game.
3936000	3951000	So, however, as far as what is said, for the relaunch, there are no improvements from the patch back in September,
3951000	3954000	other than adding support for add-on and season pass content.
3954000	3956000	Oh, that's important, of course.
3956000	3957000	It might be.
3957000	3961000	I forget fixing the game, but hey, as long as you can buy DLC, we're happy.
3961000	3963000	As long as you can spend more money.
3963000	3966000	However, the game's really not going to be getting any better.
3966000	3971000	So, get your money back while you can while Steam is offering refunds.
3971000	3977000	Let's be clear, everybody. The game's not going to be better. It's just going to work.
3977000	3983000	So, this whole thing has really tarnished what otherwise has been such a fantastic series.
3983000	3985000	It's just kind of depressing.
3985000	3988000	You know what would have made the game infinitely better already?
3988000	3989000	Less Batmobile.
3990000	3992000	Less remote-controlled Batmobile.
3992000	3993000	That is true.
3993000	3995000	That was, like, the worst.
3995000	3996000	Yeah.
3996000	3997000	Alright.
3997000	4001000	Well, let's move on. Loki, some big news from another company this week, right?
4001000	4007000	Yes. Nintendo's finally announced what their successor to Club Nintendo will be, which is my Nintendo.
4007000	4011000	And my Nintendo's kind of a move towards an account-based system.
4011000	4017000	They're going to allow you to be able to create new logins for this and be able to tie it with your social media accounts.
4017000	4025000	Right now, they don't really have a system to tie your purchases to your actual account.
4025000	4027000	It's really just tied to your consoles.
4027000	4035000	So, it kind of makes it a little bit difficult if your console breaks or if you buy a new 3DS or something like that and you want to transfer your content.
4035000	4037000	It's a big convoluted system to do that.
4037000	4045000	So, hopefully, this will kind of allow for better connection between your consoles that you own and be able to transfer that content.
4045000	4053000	Or, hey, maybe even, you know, those games where you purchase one version of the game, you get the other version of the game for free or something like that.
4053000	4054000	So, that would be kind of nice.
4054000	4060000	And then, along with that, they also announced their first mobile game, which is called Miitomo.
4060000	4062000	And what is Miitomo?
4062000	4065000	Well, it's some weird fucking game that looks...
4065000	4072000	It kind of reminds me, like, what's the one that came out back in June where you had all the Miis doing shit?
4072000	4073000	Tomodachi Life?
4073000	4074000	Yeah, Tomodachi Life.
4074000	4076000	With that same kind of root word in it?
4076000	4077000	Yeah, pretty much.
4077000	4084000	So, interesting, because I think a lot of people were expecting, you know, Mario, maybe not so much Pokemon.
4084000	4088000	Because if you think about it, Pokemon is technically with another company that just works very closely with Nintendo.
4088000	4091000	Or Zelda, you know, one of the big franchises.
4091000	4094000	They're just going to keep shoving Miis down your throat until you accept it.
4094000	4099000	Well, I'm willing to suspend disbelief a little bit and see what it really is.
4099000	4104000	Because I didn't want them to just make Mario Brothers on the phone.
4104000	4106000	Because the phone does not have a tangible controller.
4106000	4110000	So, I think they need to do something maybe a little different.
4110000	4111000	So, I'm open to this.
4111000	4113000	I mean, it's way too early to judge it.
4113000	4114000	We don't know what it is.
4114000	4116000	But, Dan, do you have any thoughts on Miitomo?
4117000	4124000	Yeah, I mean, because Nintendo's known to be very protective of the brands and all of their, you know, Mario, Kirby and everything.
4124000	4131000	I don't think that their first dip into the mobile market would be something with one of their biggest IPs.
4131000	4136000	They'd want to play with something like Miis, which, you know, if it ends up flopping, then...
4136000	4138000	That's okay, because it's just you.
4138000	4139000	Yeah, it's just you.
4139000	4140000	You're the horrible person.
4140000	4142000	This is your fault that the game did that.
4142000	4143000	Not our fault.
4143000	4144000	Exactly.
4144000	4145000	It's your fault. You're ugly.
4146000	4149000	They should have just done, like, Nintendogs.
4149000	4151000	Actually, that would have been cute.
4151000	4152000	That would be brilliant.
4152000	4154000	That would be so smart if they went with that.
4154000	4161000	I'm just saying, I mean, imagine all the fucking microtransactions you could have for all the, like, pet accessories and shit.
4161000	4168000	That's really not a bad idea for a mobile phone type game from Nintendo is to really expand on the Nintendogs plus cats.
4168000	4169000	Let's not forget cats.
4169000	4171000	Even though the cat owns you.
4171000	4179000	And, you know, they could probably make a pretty penny off of, like, dippy accessories and things to dress your doggies with, because...
4179000	4182000	Or even breeds. Like, you want dalmatians? $4.99.
4182000	4184000	Yeah, exactly. Throw all your money at the street.
4184000	4186000	Yes, all your money. Just throw it.
4186000	4189000	I wouldn't be surprised if that's something in the pipeline for later on.
4189000	4190000	It's been a while.
4190000	4191000	Yeah.
4191000	4194000	And DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
4195000	4197000	It looks like a social app more than anything else.
4197000	4202000	At least there are four more games after that to see what else Nintendo and DNA have in store.
4202000	4206000	They're probably testing to see how this does and will go from there.
4206000	4209000	So, yeah, I think this probably is a little bit of a test.
4209000	4214000	But it also looks like it's not just a platformer.
4214000	4218000	So that means, you know, there's probably going to be something a little more to it.
4218000	4222000	And I'm kind of curious to see where Nintendo goes with this social element.
4222000	4227000	Because I know I've been somewhat critical of Nintendo's online presence in the past.
4227000	4232000	But this seems to be something that could really kind of break those walls down a little bit.
4232000	4236000	So it's a little exciting. I have reserved caution about this.
4236000	4239000	But that's all I can really think of for now, because it's way too early.
4239000	4243000	Do you know if it's going to have any functionality with the My Nintendo thing that they're launching?
4243000	4247000	They're supposed to have some sort of functionality with it, but they really go into detail.
4247000	4250000	They didn't say a lot. They had this whole press conference to basically say,
4250000	4255000	So, our mobile phone game that y'all have been waiting for is going to be delayed.
4255000	4257000	Thank you for coming.
4257000	4259000	Please understand.
4259000	4261000	Please understand. Thank you very much. Have a good night.
4261000	4264000	So, oh yeah, okay, here's some slides to hold you over.
4264000	4267000	So it was kind of interesting. And then their stock kind of went...
4267000	4270000	You know, because people were expecting that game to come out this year.
4270000	4273000	But, you know, stock is stock. It'll recover.
4273000	4275000	I wouldn't read too much into it.
4275000	4283000	But at the same time, God, some of the Nintendo apologists were out in force on the social media talking about,
4283000	4287000	It's okay, Nintendo, you know, they can do it.
4287000	4294000	And I'm just kind of like, alright, look, can we just say Nintendo is having kind of a mediocre holiday?
4294000	4298000	They've got one huge game, Super Mario Maker.
4298000	4300000	I mean, in props, it's probably going to be one of the greatest games of the year.
4300000	4302000	Hope you like tennis.
4302000	4307000	You know, it's not really where they should have been here in 2015.
4307000	4312000	But they can still, like, the stock can come up. 2016 can be a big year for Nintendo.
4312000	4316000	It could be a big year. We'll release all of our great games in 2016.
4316000	4318000	Then 2016, we'll announce all those great games to push to 2017.
4318000	4322000	And 2017, yeah, you get where it's happening here.
4322000	4325000	Crackdown, are you ever going to come out? Seriously?
4325000	4327000	You have me waiting until 2015.
4327000	4329000	I'm not buying your system until it comes out.
4329000	4332000	And probably even at that point, we probably won't even see the need to that.
4334000	4338000	Alright, well let's move on and talk a little bit about another series.
4338000	4341000	And I know this is a series that's very popular with some people here in the room.
4341000	4344000	But it's going to be taking a very different turn.
4344000	4349000	The first footage was shown from the next Five Nights at Freddy's game.
4349000	4354000	But it's not, like, Five Nights at Freddy's 5. No, no, no.
4354000	4357000	It's going to be Five Nights at Freddy's World.
4357000	4360000	And you probably heard that they were going the direction of Scott Cawthon,
4360000	4363000	who creates the game, is going a different direction with it,
4363000	4365000	where it's more of a, like, cutesy RPG.
4365000	4370000	And, yeah, when you see it, it is more of a cutesy RPG.
4370000	4375000	Pretty much every character that's ever been even obscurely referenced in a previous game,
4375000	4378000	and then some, are teased to be in the game.
4378000	4383000	Also, it will be out for PC, iOS, Android.
4383000	4386000	And there will be a demo for the game, they're saying.
4386000	4391000	And it looks kind of like a classic sort of JRPG Super Nintendo type game.
4391000	4395000	So, there you go. I'm curious what our Five Nights fans...
4395000	4399000	It was stupidly cute.
4399000	4402000	Yeah. No, we got to keep it moving.
4402000	4403000	I'm going to play it.
4403000	4407000	Shayne, what were your thoughts of the trailer that you saw?
4407000	4409000	It's adorable.
4409000	4410000	Yeah?
4410000	4412000	Mangle at the end with a little ball and paddle is so cute.
4412000	4415000	But isn't Five Nights supposed to be scary?
4415000	4417000	Well, sometimes.
4417000	4418000	Do you think there will be jump scares?
4418000	4420000	Do you think it's going to be, like, one of those, like, twisted things,
4420000	4422000	where at the end everybody goes to hell or something, you know?
4422000	4424000	That would be okay. That would be fun.
4424000	4427000	I just want the movie to come out.
4427000	4430000	The Inevitable Movie.
4430000	4433000	Yeah. I thought they already said that they sold the rights to that.
4433000	4435000	I feel like they did sell the rights, yeah.
4435000	4437000	We'll see.
4437000	4439000	All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.
4439000	4441000	Oh, wait. Dan, did you want to say something on this?
4441000	4444000	I just wanted to say, this guy is known for messing with his fans
4444000	4446000	for Five Nights at Freddy's.
4446000	4449000	Like, he loves to play tricks on his fans
4449000	4451000	and put all these little hints into all of his stuff.
4451000	4454000	So I'm not going to be surprised at all if this comes out.
4454000	4456000	And it starts out as cutesy in the beginning,
4456000	4459000	and then it takes a really dark turn, like, halfway through.
4459000	4463000	But then maybe the joke will be it stays cute the entire time.
4463000	4465000	You know, we had you on edge the whole time.
4465000	4467000	I don't know. I don't know. Who knows?
4467000	4469000	All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.
4469000	4472000	I was in charge of, like, a Hatoful Boyfriend reboot.
4472000	4474000	I'd play it.
4474000	4479000	So, um, this isn't the first time in Nintendo's long history
4479000	4484000	that they have censored content for Western audiences.
4484000	4488000	There is more censorship on its way.
4488000	4492000	Actually, for Xenoblade Chronicles X,
4492000	4496000	they already showed in the European release
4496000	4500000	that this, uh, actually a couple of, like, very, like,
4500000	4504000	uh, bikini outfits, very skin-oriented,
4504000	4508000	have been changed to, like, weird bikini tops with shorts.
4508000	4511000	Um, and I think that part of it was just because
4511000	4513000	they're for younger characters.
4513000	4516000	But still, uh, I don't know.
4516000	4518000	Nintendo's been doing this for a while.
4518000	4521000	Um, they also did the same thing, um,
4521000	4524000	with, uh, Fatal Frame Maiden of Blackwater
4524000	4527000	when that came out. So, it's not surprising.
4527000	4530000	It's fine for the Xenoblade Chronicles game
4530000	4532000	because that character is 13.
4532000	4535000	So do you need to see her in a skimpy bathing suit?
4535000	4537000	Because if you do, you're a pedophile.
4537000	4539000	Why don't you have a seat over here?
4539000	4542000	What? Are you a pedophile?
4542000	4546000	No! Why didn't you ever see the To Catch a Predator series
4546000	4548000	where the guy goes, why don't you take a seat over there?
4548000	4549000	No.
4549000	4550000	I'm sorry you didn't get me.
4550000	4551000	But that's not how you did it.
4551000	4553000	You're like, why don't you take a seat right here?
4553000	4555000	I thought you was talking.
4555000	4558000	Then I will, I will say this.
4560000	4563000	If you think that the outfit is unnecessary in a video game,
4563000	4566000	then you need to be also petitioning, uh,
4566000	4569000	major clothing chains to stop providing
4569000	4572000	bikinis for young children starting
4572000	4574000	three years old and up.
4574000	4575000	Just saying.
4575000	4577000	They make bikinis for toddlers.
4577000	4579000	But if we don't have that, then we don't get a new season
4579000	4581000	of toddlers and tiaras.
4581000	4582000	So we need that to happen.
4582000	4584000	It is a complex question.
4584000	4588000	But, then would you say that that, by the same token,
4588000	4590000	would also lead to pedophilia?
4590000	4591000	Oh, I'm sure it does.
4591000	4594000	I saw an episode of Always Sunny in Philadelphia about that.
4594000	4596000	Okay, this is going to a dark place,
4596000	4599000	so we're going to keep them moving on to a new topic.
4599000	4602000	Hey, I'm just pointing out some double standards here.
4602000	4604000	We're going to travel around the world and check out some
4604000	4606000	release dates and find some things coming.
4606000	4608000	I need release from this episode.
4608000	4611000	A lot sooner than a new season of toddlers and tiaras.
4611000	4612000	Loki, US.
4612000	4614000	Yes, we're getting into the thick of it now.
4614000	4617000	So, we've got Need for Speed coming out.
4617000	4620000	Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
4620000	4626000	Also, Snoopy's Grand Adventure on 3DS and Wii U.
4626000	4630000	Air Conflict Pacific Carriers on PlayStation 4.
4630000	4634000	The Jackbox Party Pack coming out on PlayStation 3,
4634000	4637000	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360.
4637000	4639000	That's been out, or is this like a disc release?
4639000	4640000	It's a disc release.
4640000	4642000	Totally forgot to mention during our gaming week that
4642000	4644000	we did do some Quiplash and Fibbage yesterday.
4644000	4645000	Good times.
4645000	4646000	That's always a...
4646000	4649000	Man, they do such good party game work over there.
4649000	4650000	And Game of the Year contender,
4650000	4652000	Barbie and Her Sister's Puppy Rescue,
4652000	4658000	also coming out on PlayStation 3, 3DS, Wii U, and Xbox 360.
4658000	4660000	Shane, have you reserved your copy?
4660000	4661000	I think he, I don't know.
4661000	4662000	Did he reserve his copy?
4662000	4663000	Hopefully.
4663000	4664000	Barbie and the Puppy Rescue.
4664000	4665000	I love puppies.
4665000	4667000	I would rescue puppies with Barbie.
4667000	4668000	There you go.
4668000	4670000	But no, I didn't reserve my copy.
4670000	4671000	All right.
4671000	4673000	We've got Shovel Knight, the disc version,
4673000	4677000	coming out on Wii U, 3DS, and it looks like PlayStation 4.
4677000	4680000	They're doing like a re-release of some of the old Ninja Turtles
4680000	4681000	games on 3DS.
4681000	4684000	The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Master Splinter's Training Pack.
4684000	4685000	It's just old shit.
4685000	4688000	Evolve Ultimate Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4688000	4691000	Yes, that's the old DLC included edition.
4691000	4694000	Same with Lords of the Fallen Complete Edition.
4694000	4697000	That's also coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360.
4697000	4699000	PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4699000	4704000	Tiny Troopers Joint Ops on PlayStation 4.
4704000	4707000	World Poker Championship on PlayStation 4.
4707000	4710000	And then finally on Friday, because god dammit,
4710000	4712000	I hate companies that have to release everything
4712000	4715000	on different days of the week, but Call of Duty Black Ops 3
4715000	4718000	coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4,
4718000	4720000	Xbox One, and PC.
4720000	4722000	That's somewhat of a big deal.
4722000	4723000	Somewhat of a big deal.
4723000	4724000	For retailers, yeah.
4724000	4726000	And then Yokai Watch also coming out on 3DS.
4726000	4727000	Boom.
4727000	4729000	Yay, I'm going to be buying that one.
4729000	4731000	And then I'm going to tell Shane how awesome it is.
4731000	4734000	And then PlayStation 4 is also getting Awesome Knots Assemble
4734000	4736000	on the disc version of that.
4736000	4738000	Wait, Darsakha, you want to interject something there
4738000	4739000	at our screening match?
4739000	4741000	No, that's why I shook my head before.
4741000	4742000	Oh.
4742000	4743000	And then, hold on.
4743000	4745000	Still not done yet, because we got to release shit.
4745000	4746000	Oh, wait, no.
4746000	4749000	Yeah, one on the weekend, so Skylander Supercharger
4749000	4752000	Starter Pack is getting a release for iPad.
4752000	4753000	That's it.
4753000	4754000	All right, let's head over to Japan
4754000	4755000	and check out the releases over there.
4755000	4757000	Fairy Fencer F, Advent Dark Force,
4757000	4759000	is out on the PlayStation 4 this week
4759000	4761000	in regular and limited edition.
4761000	4764000	And LEGO Jurassic World also getting its release
4764000	4765000	in Japan this week.
4765000	4768000	And a game getting a price reduction from Sega.
4768000	4773000	Ryu Ga Gotoku Isshin gets a new price version out this week.
4773000	4776000	Traveling over to the Wii U.
4776000	4779000	LEGO Jurassic World is out on the Wii U this week as well.
4779000	4781000	Hey, it's a game release on the Wii U.
4781000	4782000	Everybody, pay attention.
4783000	4784000	On the Vita this week,
4784000	4788000	To Love Ryu, Trouble Darkness, True Princess,
4788000	4791000	comes out in regular and limited edition on the Vita.
4791000	4796000	And all I can say is there are girls holding hands on the cover,
4796000	4798000	and I don't know, Jamie may take issue with that.
4798000	4799000	I don't know.
4799000	4803000	But it looks like some type of...
4803000	4805000	I don't even know if it's a dating sim or what.
4805000	4807000	Whatever.
4808000	4810000	Yeah, that's pretty much what I have to say about it, too.
4810000	4811000	How about the 3DS?
4811000	4813000	Looking over on the 3DS real quick
4813000	4815000	to see what's releasing there.
4815000	4817000	We have Disney Magic Castle,
4817000	4819000	My Happy Life 2,
4819000	4821000	as well as LEGO Jurassic World,
4821000	4825000	and Seikaiju no Miku 4,
4825000	4827000	Denshu no Kyojin,
4827000	4828000	and that gets a price reduction.
4828000	4829000	That is from Atlus.
4829000	4832000	I'm curious what this Disney Magic Castle,
4832000	4834000	My Happy Life 2 game is.
4834000	4836000	And it looks like you actually get to exist
4836000	4839000	with your little Mii with Disney characters.
4839000	4841000	And that actually looks super cute.
4841000	4843000	That's kind of adorable.
4843000	4845000	I don't know, I think I might actually play that.
4846000	4848000	I mean, I can't understand the Japanese,
4848000	4849000	but it looks super...
4849000	4851000	Oh, look, the three little pigs are in it.
4851000	4853000	It's kind of cute.
4854000	4856000	I don't know, I might have to get that one.
4856000	4858000	I'm sure they have it over here under a different name.
4858000	4859000	Disney Games.
4859000	4860000	Pretty universal.
4860000	4863000	It's Disney Buy Our Stuff edition.
4863000	4864000	Of course.
4864000	4865000	How about Europe, DarkSaga?
4865000	4866000	Some stuff's coming out.
4866000	4868000	That's all you need to know.
4868000	4872000	No, on the second, we have Sonic Lost World for PC.
4872000	4876000	And on the sixth, we have Call of Duty Black Ops 3 for Xbox 360,
4876000	4880000	PlayStation 3, PS4, Xbox One, blah, blah, blah, PC,
4880000	4885000	a need for speed on all the same blah, blah, blah systems,
4885000	4889000	and the Peanuts movie Snoopy's Grand Adventure on everything else,
4889000	4891000	and the major blah, blah, blah systems.
4891000	4893000	I don't know if it's just my brain or something,
4893000	4894000	but I swear to God, you just said Peanuts.
4894000	4896000	I heard that too.
4896000	4897000	I heard that too.
4897000	4900000	But you all are hellbound, all of you going to hell.
4900000	4901000	I heard Peanuts.
4901000	4905000	You know what? Hell doesn't exist in my religion.
4905000	4907000	Fair enough.
4907000	4908000	All right.
4908000	4910000	By the way, it's being clarified for us in chat.
4910000	4914000	Act Def says, it's the Disney magical world game
4914000	4917000	that was like Disney's Animal Crossing.
4917000	4919000	I remember that from a couple of years ago.
4919000	4921000	Why do I not own this?
4921000	4922000	That's a very good question.
4922000	4923000	Why don't you own it?
4923000	4925000	BRB going to Target.
4925000	4927000	I don't know if you can find it now.
4927000	4930000	You know what? BRB going to Amazon right now.
4930000	4932000	All right.
4932000	4934000	Meanwhile, we have a couple more stories for you guys,
4934000	4936000	and then the classic game of the week,
4936000	4939000	and it's a real good one this week, but I'm being biased.
4939000	4940000	All right, Loki.
4940000	4944000	Oh my God, it's totally time to jump in on that Kinect action.
4944000	4948000	Yes, you can get a brand new Kinect for $50 cheaper.
4948000	4949000	That's right, for a limited time.
4949000	4954000	Microsoft is taking that integral part of the Xbox One,
4954000	4957000	and they're reducing its price by $50.
4957000	4960000	I think now to what, $100?
4960000	4962000	Yeah, $100 maybe?
4962000	4964000	Yes, $100.
4964000	4967000	And you can play all these wonderful games on it.
4967000	4971000	And yeah, it's a limited time offer though.
4971000	4973000	So that integral piece of the Xbox One
4973000	4975000	can continue to be ignored.
4975000	4977000	Yes.
4977000	4979000	Mike, you want to say something on this?
4979000	4981000	That thing cost $150 fucking dollars.
4981000	4982000	Are you shitting me?
4982000	4984000	Yeah, as standalone it did.
4984000	4985000	$150.
4985000	4986000	Oh my God.
4986000	4987000	Oh my God.
4987000	4988000	It came with Dance Central.
4988000	4990000	It's $30 on Amazon.
4990000	4991000	Uh-oh.
4991000	4992000	Yeah, but it came with Dance Central,
4992000	4995000	the fucking Xbox Live game,
4995000	4999000	not like a disc-based game that had a lot of songs in it.
4999000	5002000	It was the piecemeal buy-all-of-our-DLC game.
5002000	5003000	I know.
5003000	5006000	$150 for your Xbox to keep tabs on you.
5006000	5008000	Yeah, to listen in on you and shit.
5008000	5009000	That's...
5009000	5010000	Oh, come on.
5010000	5011000	Come on.
5011000	5012000	Come on.
5012000	5014000	But you can play such wonderful games like...
5014000	5017000	If I want pizza, I will text Domino's the emoji.
5017000	5020000	Like Zoo Tycoon, or Kinect Sports Rivals,
5020000	5025000	or Rapids Invasion, or Fantasia.
5025000	5027000	Here's the reality.
5027000	5029000	I'm happy the Kinect is lower priced,
5029000	5032000	where it's now in line of where it was on the 360.
5032000	5033000	That's good news.
5033000	5036000	What's not so good news is I still don't understand
5036000	5037000	why I need one.
5037000	5038000	Yeah, exactly.
5038000	5040000	What games are they releasing that are Kinect games,
5040000	5042000	that are Kinect games that are coming out?
5042000	5043000	I will give it this.
5043000	5046000	I really want to play that Fantasia game.
5046000	5048000	But I'm like, it's one game.
5048000	5049000	You know what I mean?
5049000	5052000	The only Fantasia game I want to play has to have Fantasia in it.
5052000	5054000	I think this one does.
5054000	5057000	As in, not the movie, but Fantasia.
5057000	5062000	Does the Xbox have any streaming, built-in streaming?
5062000	5065000	Oh yeah, and you can use X to for streams.
5065000	5068000	Well, don't they have the Xbox 360 version?
5068000	5071000	Don't you have the Kinect for 360?
5071000	5073000	Yeah, I have the Kinect for 360.
5073000	5074000	Get that on 360, then.
5074000	5075000	Maybe I will. I don't know.
5075000	5078000	So, by the way, an Xbox One might be happening at my house.
5078000	5079000	Finally.
5079000	5080000	Hey.
5080000	5081000	It goes down with Forza.
5081000	5082000	Well, there you go.
5082000	5083000	Forza's a pretty good game.
5083000	5085000	I will say this, though.
5085000	5088000	I do own a PlayStation camera.
5088000	5089000	I will say that.
5089000	5091000	And it's just about equally as useless.
5091000	5093000	Yeah, I bought one to do live streaming with.
5093000	5096000	Outside of that, it's also fucking useless.
5097000	5099000	And that's why I don't want to make the same mistake twice.
5099000	5100000	Yeah, that's what I was about to say.
5100000	5104000	I know for sure that the PlayStation has streaming built-in.
5104000	5106000	And at least you can make the excuse of,
5106000	5110000	if you're going to get the camera, and you intend on streaming your shit,
5110000	5113000	that it at least serves some purpose.
5113000	5118000	But I don't know anything really about Xbox, because I'm a Sony fanboy.
5121000	5123000	Playroom was fun, and that was free.
5123000	5125000	So that was kind of cool.
5125000	5128000	Although some of the best games on it don't actually use the camera.
5128000	5132000	So I'm not really sure why they're on Playroom, but, you know, okay.
5132000	5133000	All right.
5133000	5136000	SHU100Matt in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com,
5136000	5139000	pointing out that Just Dance, that series,
5139000	5141000	they don't require the Kinect anymore either.
5141000	5143000	You can use your mobile device camera.
5143000	5146000	And that's the way a lot of these peripheral games are going.
5146000	5149000	SingStar on Sony, you don't need the mics anymore.
5149000	5150000	Use an iPhone app.
5150000	5152000	There's an app for that.
5152000	5155000	And that's where a lot of, you know, if they can build a controller into the phone,
5155000	5158000	you know, Jackbox Party Pack, we've talked a lot about on this show,
5158000	5160000	because, you know, we had Jackbox games on a couple weeks ago.
5160000	5164000	The phones are an integral part of those games.
5164000	5165000	That's how you control them.
5165000	5172000	For Android, at least, you can stream to Twitch from your phone now.
5172000	5174000	You can, with the new Twitch app.
5174000	5177000	Which, you know, that's kind of one of the bummers right now
5177000	5179000	about the locked ecosystem of Apple.
5179000	5182000	Some people can look up your nostrils when you play Hearthstone,
5182000	5184000	or whatever the hell you're going to be playing.
5184000	5185000	They don't need to see that.
5185000	5187000	They do not need to see that.
5187000	5188000	All right.
5188000	5190000	Well, it's only fair we take a moment, you know,
5190000	5192000	to be a little critical of something in Sony's world too,
5192000	5195000	because this is one of those things where we kind of keep looking at this going.
5195000	5197000	This just doesn't make sense.
5197000	5199000	And so apparently what happened this week,
5199000	5202000	Yoshida was doing like a Q&A on Twitter,
5202000	5204000	answering some different questions.
5204000	5206000	And one of the questions that was asked was,
5206000	5209000	when are we going to be able to change our PlayStation Network names?
5209000	5211000	You know, this is something that's been asked for for a long time.
5211000	5214000	Can we change our PSN names?
5214000	5218000	And the response that came back was,
5218000	5220000	we're not sure if we can do it.
5220000	5223000	We don't know if we can ever do it.
5223000	5227000	And, yeah, that has a lot of people kind of going,
5227000	5228000	Why?
5228000	5229000	Why?
5229000	5233000	What's the, like, it's really a technical challenge to say,
5233000	5237000	like, if A, it's now B, like a search and replace,
5237000	5239000	which is in the most basic word processing is not,
5239000	5242000	I mean, I don't, again, I don't do the tech stuff as well,
5242000	5245000	that I would make games and not talk about them if I, you know,
5245000	5251000	was more tech savvy, but I just can't fathom why this is such a stinking challenge.
5251000	5253000	But they're changing their answer.
5253000	5254000	That's what irritates me so much.
5254000	5259000	Their previous excuse was that they didn't want people to abuse the system
5259000	5262000	and change their user tags so that they could continue to harass people
5262000	5263000	that previously blocked them.
5263000	5265000	Now it seems like they're shifting their position.
5265000	5269000	So it's like, okay, why wasn't this your answer in the first place?
5269000	5273000	Oh, my God, Dan, do you mean that sometimes in the industry,
5273000	5278000	companies make things up about some sort of what consumers want
5278000	5280000	to hide a technical challenge?
5280000	5285000	Oh, my, that, lying in my industry?
5285000	5287000	Oh, my, never, never.
5287000	5288000	No, I know, I know.
5288000	5290000	Cover-ups in gaming?
5290000	5293000	Do you wish to take the technical challenge?
5293000	5295000	Yes, Mark Summers, I will.
5295000	5297000	Double dare.
5297000	5302000	It just, it pisses me off so much because I don't know,
5302000	5309000	my PSN name is from way back in 2011, and by God, I wish I could change it.
5309000	5315000	And it just, it's frustrating to see them shimmy like this.
5315000	5319000	I don't know why now they're coming out with this,
5319000	5321000	and I don't understand it either.
5321000	5325000	But as a reminder, PlayStation Plus is available for just, you know, this,
5325000	5330000	now I'm going for a low blow, but I just, it is one of those weird things.
5330000	5335000	You kind of have to wonder, like, obviously the technical challenge
5335000	5338000	dates all the way back to when they first implemented it,
5338000	5340000	or it would not be going on this long.
5340000	5342000	So I don't know.
5342000	5345000	We had issues with the calendar one time that rendered the system
5345000	5348000	kind of stupid for a little bit.
5349000	5352000	Well, maybe they'll be able to do something in the PlayStation 5.
5352000	5357000	Or they'll just come out with a new network like Nintendo's doing.
5357000	5360000	Oh, well, you know, we're going to throw away PlayStation Network
5360000	5363000	and come out with something new, or you can actually change your name
5363000	5367000	and all these other features too. Who knows? Who knows?
5367000	5371000	But guess what? The best part about that is you get to buy all your apps again.
5371000	5373000	Fuck you guys.
5373000	5375000	Except I don't know that's the case.
5375000	5376000	All right. I can see them.
5376000	5379000	Well, we have no way to tie those old purchases to this new console.
5379000	5381000	And you're fucked.
5381000	5383000	Well, let's take a trip down memory lane.
5383000	5388000	You know what? We need to go back to a time when you didn't sign into your console.
5390000	5392000	Do you know how you said hello to your console?
5392000	5396000	You blew on the cartridge and then blew inside the Nintendo
5396000	5400000	hoping that the two would connect and miraculously work.
5400000	5401000	We're going to take a step.
5401000	5404000	That was the technical challenge was that the cartridges would just stop
5404000	5406000	fucking working at some point.
5406000	5409000	We're going to take a step into Dark Sakura's gaming vault
5409000	5411000	where she's going to find a game and she says,
5411000	5414000	Hey, you ungrateful little shits.
5414000	5416000	I just made that up. I don't know if she does say that.
5416000	5420000	But you should play this video game right now, Dark Sakura.
5420000	5424000	What is it? What is the classic game of the week?
5424000	5427000	Did you not see where I said play the sound first?
5427000	5428000	Oh, I'm sorry. Let's get to it.
5428000	5430000	Let people guess.
5430000	5432000	How can you not know this? How do you not know it?
5432000	5436000	It's because you talk over it, Rob.
5438000	5440000	The game is Metroid.
5440000	5442000	No shit.
5442000	5447000	Hell, I've done Super Metroid, but I've not done Metroid.
5447000	5449000	Hearts.
5449000	5451000	It needed to be done.
5451000	5456000	It was the first of a long line of Metroid games
5456000	5459000	and arguably the second best.
5459000	5464000	It was co-developed by Nintendo's Research and Development 1 Division
5464000	5468000	and Intelligent Systems and came out for the Famicom Disk System
5468000	5472000	on August 6, 1986, and for the Nintendo Entertainment System
5472000	5477000	in North America, August 1987, and in Europe, January 1988.
5477000	5481000	It had a re-release for Game Boy Advance in 2004
5481000	5484000	and Wii Virtual Console in 2007.
5485000	5493000	It was also produced by the late Gunpei Yokoi, who we lost tragically,
5493000	5498000	also by Okada Satoru and Sakamoto Yoshio,
5498000	5501000	and the music was done by Tanaka Hirokazu,
5501000	5507000	which is some of the best video game music ever of the 8-bit era, so to say.
5507000	5510000	So basically, you land on the planet Zebes
5510000	5517000	and you play as Samus Aran, who tries to go basically retrieving the Metroids.
5517000	5520000	They were stolen by space pirates who were big lizard people.
5520000	5522000	Damn you, pirates!
5522000	5524000	Yeah.
5524000	5528000	And it's basically just an exploration game.
5528000	5531000	It's a very difficult exploration game in some places.
5531000	5534000	You know, it requires on different tricks and things,
5534000	5539000	some things invented by just people playing the game normally
5539000	5544000	that ended up making it into being required pieces of,
5544000	5548000	required skill sets, I should say, for the later Metroid games.
5548000	5554000	And it's in a power-ranked Metroid as number 11 on their list of best video games.
5554000	5556000	Not high enough.
5556000	5562000	Game Informer listed, it is number 7, and then it was 69th by EGM.
5562000	5565000	What does EGM know?
5565000	5566000	Nothing.
5566000	5567000	Nothing.
5567000	5570000	Clearly.
5570000	5575000	We sure say some ballsy things on this show sometimes that we have no business saying.
5575000	5577000	We have all the business saying.
5577000	5582000	So the neat thing about this game is that really your path to exploration
5582000	5586000	is gained not just by the act of exploration,
5586000	5589000	but by the certain tools and weapons that you pick up on the way.
5589000	5593000	You start off with a very weak power beam and all you can do is jump.
5593000	5598000	You immediately get the morph ball, which, um,
5598000	5602000	I mean basically you can't play the game without the morph ball anyway.
5602000	5605000	It's like, uh, how do I get into this really low thing?
5605000	5610000	Uh, if only there were a way I could turn into a little ball and roll under it.
5610000	5611000	Yeah.
5611000	5615000	So, um, other power-ups that you get, you can drop bombs as the morph ball,
5615000	5618000	which you can also learn how to do the bomb jump,
5618000	5623000	which was a way to get sneakily into some other places in the game.
5623000	5627000	Um, you could get the, uh, the screw attack, which is basically like,
5627000	5629000	I'm invincible, bitches.
5629000	5630000	Get out of the way.
5630000	5631000	Screw it.
5631000	5636000	Screw you, screw you, screw you, and especially screw you.
5636000	5639000	I could just imagine Samus saying that.
5639000	5646000	Um, and so you get, you know, like the freeze beam and rockets and all kinds of shit.
5646000	5652000	So, um, this game also introduced us to some of the, uh,
5652000	5658000	most hardcore of enemies, including, uh, Kraid and Ridley,
5658000	5661000	because there's a guy at my work.
5661000	5663000	Ridley for Smash Bros.
5663000	5668000	There was a guy at work who had like a huge perler of Ridley,
5668000	5669000	Super Metroid Ridley.
5669000	5671000	I was like, I have to make that.
5671000	5674000	I think when you get into the perler bead thing,
5674000	5676000	which every gamer does at some point in their life,
5676000	5679000	you're like required to make a Metroid sprite.
5679000	5680000	Like it's just, you have to.
5680000	5681000	You know the first one I made was though.
5681000	5682000	What's that?
5682000	5683000	The Guardian Legend.
5683000	5684000	I made the Guardian.
5684000	5685000	Of course.
5685000	5687000	Because the Guardian Legend is the best Nintendo game of all time.
5687000	5691000	I would say Metroid inspired the Guardian a little bit.
5691000	5693000	Didn't it come out earlier than Metroid?
5693000	5695000	Um, I don't think so.
5695000	5696000	Okay, field time for me.
5696000	5701000	Guardic did, but the original Guardian Legend, which would be Guardic 2,
5701000	5702000	wouldn't have come out.
5702000	5705000	Guardic Gaiden came out in 1988.
5705000	5707000	So, you're right.
5707000	5708000	Okay, but Guardic.
5708000	5710000	My favorite words in the Ingress language.
5710000	5711000	Shut up.
5711000	5713000	But Guardic came out in 1986.
5713000	5716000	So, anyway.
5716000	5718000	Guardic Gaiden was fun.
5718000	5722000	Anyway, so basically it's really just going around.
5722000	5726000	He finally, finally, finally reached the Mother Brain,
5726000	5729000	who was also the main bad guy of Captain and the Game Master.
5729000	5733000	And we forget that that series existed because it was mega bad.
5735000	5736000	Mega bad.
5739000	5744000	Anyway, so after you destroy Mother Brain, you get a bomb set for 999 seconds,
5744000	5749000	and you have to escape and fly away with the little Metroid baby.
5749000	5752000	The last Metroid is in captivity.
5752000	5754000	The galaxy is at peace.
5754000	5755000	Not for long, bitches.
5755000	5757000	So, anyway.
5757000	5766000	This was basically green-lighted because of all of the games that had just been so successful for Nintendo,
5766000	5771000	including here goes Donkey Kong from 81, Ice Climber in 85, Super Mario Bros.,
5771000	5773000	and then The Legend of Zelda, which came out right before this.
5773000	5777000	So, it gave, it opened up for an adventure game to come out.
5777000	5784000	And Metroid was a, the name came across as a portmanteau of Metro and Android.
5784000	5786000	And I guess it evolved from there.
5786000	5790000	So, the game was, I mean, it took a lot of development.
5790000	5793000	A lot of people were involved in it.
5793000	5799000	Big names in Nintendo and, of course, the late Yokoi.
5799000	5808000	So, the particular game was also meant to be one of the first non-linear, non-RPG games.
5808000	5812000	Which, I mean, if you look at it, yeah, it is completely non-linear.
5812000	5817000	You can play anything in any order, provided you have the materials to get there.
5817000	5822000	So, and it requires a lot of creativity to make your way through the game.
5822000	5827000	I mean, I was no good at it because I was kind of uncoordinated.
5827000	5830000	But, you know, that's another story.
5830000	5836000	You also, there's, this was one of the early games to use a password system
5836000	5845000	because the Famicon disc version had, you could save up to three save files on the disc.
5845000	5851000	Which, of course, there was no battery built into the game for the US release.
5851000	5853000	So, they had the password system.
5853000	5858000	But the password system gave us two particular special codes.
5858000	5864000	One of them was Justin Bailey, where Samus would run around in a bathing suit.
5865000	5868000	And then you had a Narpa sword.
5868000	5875000	Which, it gives you infinite ammunition, health, power-ups, and a modified ice beam.
5875000	5881000	What Dan and I discovered is that if you do the Narpa sword and do the quick beat,
5881000	5888000	where you can skip right to the Mother Brain level, it's like some trick where you freeze something and jump off of it and make it into the little deal thing.
5888000	5894000	Then you can go back and play in the bathing suit with the Narpa sword power-up.
5894000	5897000	So, we called it Narpus Bailey.
5897000	5903000	So, you also had up to five endings available.
5903000	5907000	And the third, fourth, and fifth endings, Samus would appear without her suit.
5907000	5912000	So, it was also where you found out that you were playing a female character the whole time.
5912000	5918000	Which, me being a kid, I was like, oh shit. It was so cool.
5918000	5927000	I think this really was, as far as I can think of, and I'm sure on some of the older systems like Atari I'm neglecting something in the moment,
5927000	5934000	but really the first big twist ending that shouldn't be such a big deal, but it is.
5934000	5936000	It was important.
5936000	5942000	And now, thankfully, this has paved the way for today where it's really not so much of a big deal.
5942000	5947000	Right. Because now we look back at it and go, was it really such a big deal? Yes, it was.
5947000	5953000	Yes, it really was. Which is now why it's also paved the way for us to look at Ubisoft, for example.
5953000	5959000	Well, yeah, you can have a female protagonist get on it for Assassin's Creed.
5959000	5965000	Although, from what I understand, they are barely catching up in the terms of the sexism market in that series.
5965000	5971000	So, basically, with the music, now, I mentioned the music and how awesome it was.
5971000	5979000	The sound designer, Tanaka, said that he wanted to make the players feel like they were entering a living organism,
5979000	5983000	so there was no distinction between music and sound effect.
5983000	5991000	So the only melodic theme that you hear is when the mother brain is defeated, so you get that.
5991000	5999000	But the rest of it is supposed to be more like it's part of your whole experience.
5999000	6001000	So I thought that was pretty cool.
6001000	6010000	And they also acknowledged, the creators did, that the movie Alien influenced the game quite a bit.
6010000	6019000	I mean, because you've got the character Ripley, and that Samus herself was inspired by Ellen Ripley of Alien.
6020000	6028000	Also, that the background music, the score itself, was inspired by the score for Alien as well.
6028000	6045000	So, it has sold 2.73 million units worldwide, and it spawned so many different, I'd say, sequels, an entire mythos.
6045000	6048000	It has a manga series. It's pretty amazing.
6048000	6056000	And on top of that, this game is one of the ones that is credited with creating the speedrunning genre.
6056000	6061000	Because of the multiple endings that were based on how quickly you beat the game.
6063000	6066000	So, let's see what we've got.
6066000	6071000	Yeah, and of course it also influenced Castlevania Symphony of the Night, so that's awesome.
6072000	6083000	The game Metroid Zero Mission is a re-imaging of this game, with more backstory, enhanced graphics, but it has the same game layout.
6083000	6089000	Now there was another thing that, I didn't see a mention of this anywhere, and I've been trying to find it again.
6089000	6103000	The hubby was playing, it had to be like 10 something years ago, but it was called the Metroid Maker, which was a ROM editor for Metroid.
6103000	6111000	And there's a few people out there who have done custom Metroid games that you play via emulator or via ROM players.
6111000	6121000	So, those are out there and definitely worth it, but I would say the only game that has surpassed the original Metroid would be Super Metroid.
6121000	6124000	And that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.
6124000	6126000	Fair enough. I can agree with it.
6126000	6127000	And that's it.
6127000	6132000	There it is. Your classic game of the week. Really, truly. I mean, they're all classics.
6132000	6133000	Why haven't I done this yet?
6133000	6134000	Yeah, right?
6134000	6138000	I've done like three games in a row that I'm like, what? I didn't know.
6139000	6148000	I mean, but what a testament to, there are so many great games in the world that here we are, you've been doing this, you haven't done this every week, because we didn't start this segment until about episode 250.
6148000	6150000	I've named how many hundred games?
6150000	6158000	That's still about 350 games that, you know, are just classics that are games you should check out at some point.
6158000	6161000	Even though admittedly a few of them were pretty terrible.
6161000	6163000	And I'll admit, I suck at Metroid.
6163000	6164000	Flat out suck at it.
6164000	6165000	That's okay.
6165000	6172000	I love, I mean, it's like you were talking about what we're doing with Super Metroid, me and the hubby, just, you know, me doing the guide, him doing the playing.
6172000	6177000	But I like when you can do stuff like that when there's things that you can find.
6177000	6178000	Yeah.
6178000	6184000	And have more about the memories or what it did for future games or like I remember a few weeks ago, you did that LSD game on the PlayStation.
6184000	6189000	It's like that game actually isn't very good, but it's just kind of like it was something very different.
6189000	6190000	It was different.
6190000	6198000	I like to, I like to, I still am trying to find the name of the game that you played with nothing but sound that came on the Sega Saturn and it came with seeds.
6198000	6200000	Do you remember?
6200000	6201000	Maybe somebody in chat knows.
6201000	6206000	What was the store that was in Burlingame that had all the imports where it got?
6206000	6210000	Oh, I remember the place. I don't remember the name of the place.
6210000	6217000	But, um, I know it was Game Masters was the one that was in, um, uh, Citrus Heights.
6217000	6223000	But, um, but they had that game there and I was like, get it and play the weird Japanese game that you had to grow seeds.
6223000	6229000	But yeah, I, I like the obscure, but you can't go without mentioning Metroid.
6229000	6237000	So, you know, Tiger Claw points out talking about like alien and all that in Metroid, one of the bad guys is named Ridley, which I'm sure was named after Ridley Scott, the director.
6237000	6238000	Indeed.
6238000	6239000	Yeah.
6239000	6240000	Very cool.
6240000	6241000	All right.
6241000	6243000	Well, anyhow, we're going to take a quick break, guys.
6243000	6248000	We're having a long show tonight, but with good reason because we've got friends joining us here in studio.
6248000	6249000	We're going to take a break.
6249000	6252000	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
6252000	6253000	Don't go anywhere.
6260000	6263000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6263000	6269000	Live tonight with episode number 620 of our show for November the first of 2015.
6270000	6274000	And if you're just joining us, you missed a pretty exciting first part of the show.
6274000	6279000	We were talking about Bob Ross and a lot of news out of Sony as well as Nintendo.
6279000	6288000	We have some guests in studio tonight, although some of them actually stepped out for a minute, doing the all-important ice cream run that we need this time of year.
6288000	6290000	So, or this time of the show.
6290000	6296000	Well, I mean, you know, this time of year, you start to crave ice cream even more and more with all the holiday treats and things going on.
6296000	6301000	But a mic is still here. Dan and Shane ran out on the air, and so Mike's still here joining us, of course.
6301000	6304000	Having a good time so far, being here on the show?
6304000	6305000	Yeah.
6305000	6310000	Is it weird to, like, listen to it and then now you're here and seeing it all play out?
6310000	6311000	Yeah.
6311000	6312000	Yeah?
6312000	6315000	What do you think the listeners miss by not being here?
6315000	6318000	What do you think they'd be surprised to know about the studio?
6318000	6320000	Oh, your lovely faces.
6320000	6322000	Me rolling my eyes at you.
6322000	6323000	Yeah, that too.
6323000	6324000	Yeah.
6326000	6327000	Cool posters.
6327000	6328000	Yeah?
6328000	6333000	I'm surprised there's Konami stuff in here, because I know recently, at least.
6333000	6337000	Well, you know, we started as a show about, you know, DDR.
6337000	6341000	So, you know, Konami's still always going to hold a special place in our heart.
6341000	6343000	But now it's like, god damn it.
6343000	6346000	Exactly. It's the old Konami that, you know, we really love.
6346000	6353000	And, you know, I've used this metaphor to death, so I apologize for bringing it up again, but it's the old Tyra Banks thing.
6353000	6355000	We were rooting for you. We were all rooting, you know.
6355000	6358000	To see Konami keep going down that path is frustrating.
6358000	6363000	But I love this, this DDR second mix marquee with the Konami seal that is official.
6363000	6365000	I love this. It's one of my favorites.
6365000	6367000	And sadly, it doesn't translate well to radio.
6367000	6371000	There have been a lot of people always asking, are you ever going to do the live stream thing?
6371000	6373000	People live stream on Twitch TV.
6373000	6375000	Why don't you guys do live stream?
6375000	6377000	But I'm always like, it's Orange Lounge Radio.
6377000	6381000	It's like, all you would see is our faces buried in the computers.
6381000	6385000	And once in a while, there might be a thing where we look up and throw something at each other.
6385000	6388000	Maybe a special occasion, but probably not like a permanent thing.
6388000	6391000	Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. That's how I feel anyway.
6391000	6392000	Maybe.
6392000	6396000	A lot of things that I watch, too, are just like big talking heads on webcams.
6396000	6401000	And it's like, this isn't, you know, it's not really, with all due respect, it's not a compelling video.
6401000	6404000	I could just look the other way and just listen to the audio, which is far more compelling.
6404000	6407000	So, anyway. Little side tangent.
6407000	6410000	But let's get back into some gaming news, because we still have a lot of ground to cover.
6410000	6415000	We've been running long, and we want to make sure we have time for some of your calls over at 1877 Game OLR.
6415000	6417000	Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
6417000	6420000	So, let's get to some rapid fire news. Loki, start us off.
6420000	6424000	So, Criterion has basically said, hey, guess what?
6424000	6429000	We are working to make Burnout Paradise backwards compatible on Xbox One.
6429000	6433000	Which has everybody, I'm sure, excited, because that game is fucking amazing.
6433000	6435000	No surprise whatsoever.
6435000	6437000	Really, they should just make a new Burnout game.
6437000	6442000	I mean, I know they're making some sports game, or it's like some extreme sports type thing.
6442000	6445000	But I'd rather them make a new Burnout game.
6445000	6447000	Because that would be goddamn amazing.
6447000	6450000	But hey, that's something at least.
6450000	6456000	To go along with that, also, Rocket League is going to be getting a free November update.
6456000	6459000	And they're going to add some mutators to the mix.
6459000	6462000	So, different things that you can have in the game.
6463000	6467000	Include the size and shape and weight of the ball. Gravitational effects.
6467000	6471000	If you want the ball to be a cube, you can do that.
6471000	6473000	It should make games a little bit more interesting.
6473000	6477000	And also, more opportunities to live stream and stuff.
6477000	6480000	Because you're going to have weird parameters.
6480000	6483000	Balls that dwarf the cars.
6483000	6485000	That would be kind of funny.
6488000	6490000	Yeah, looking forward to that.
6490000	6494000	And then, Fallout 4 is just a couple weeks away.
6494000	6500000	And if you want to get hyped up about it, you can check out the Nuka Cola Quantum.
6500000	6504000	Which is being put out by Jones Soda.
6504000	6511000	And they've got this. It's going to be sold exclusively at Target stores starting November 10th.
6513000	6515000	So, I don't know.
6515000	6517000	But I want to know, what does it taste like?
6517000	6519000	It's blue. Is it radiation?
6519000	6521000	Punch.
6521000	6525000	I thought the flavor was out there. I thought I remember reading about it, but I don't remember what it was.
6525000	6527000	Maybe somebody in chat knows.
6527000	6529000	It's just Jones Soda, right?
6529000	6531000	Yeah, it says...
6533000	6535000	Is it pomegranate, maybe? I don't know.
6535000	6537000	Pomegranate. Pome wonderful.
6537000	6540000	Alan Alchemy in chat says, bubble gum or punch?
6540000	6542000	Ew.
6542000	6546000	Ew. I will not drink it if it is remotely gum related flavors whatsoever.
6546000	6548000	That is a Nuka Jamie Cola.
6548000	6550000	Yuck. Just disgusting.
6550000	6552000	Or cotton candy or some nonsense like that.
6552000	6554000	Cotton candy would be fine.
6554000	6556000	Gum is nasty.
6556000	6558000	Gum is just gross.
6558000	6560000	She feels about that how I feel about mayonnaise.
6560000	6562000	It's like shitty medicine flavor.
6562000	6566000	I will drink a bottle of Robitussin before I will smell gum.
6566000	6568000	Alright.
6568000	6575000	Anyway, I know a lot of people are very excited about Fallout 4 and are literally saying goodbye to their life for November.
6575000	6577000	I do want to play that game.
6577000	6579000	I will work and then I will Fallout 4 and that is that.
6579000	6581000	I will play Fallout 4 for most of November.
6581000	6585000	I actually thought my game Call of Duty, but I'm like, eh, I don't have the money right now.
6585000	6589000	So I will wait until Fallout 4 comes out, maybe, and spend money on that.
6589000	6591000	Alright.
6591000	6594000	Alright, well, hopping around for some other news.
6594000	6600000	The late Satoru Iwata to be honored with a lifetime achievement at the Golden Joystick Awards.
6600000	6602000	Actually, I apologize. That actually already happened.
6602000	6608000	That was at the O2 Arena in London and it was the 33rd annual event for games and people in the industry.
6608000	6614000	He was honored with the lifetime achievement award for, obviously, everything he's done with Nintendo and for gaming as a whole.
6614000	6623000	So he was given that award and, you know, I'm sure this is the first of many memorial awards to be given.
6623000	6625000	Let's see.
6625000	6629000	Going over to PlayStation Plus and the releases for November.
6629000	6634000	PlayStation 4 will be getting Dragon Fin Soup, Magica 2, and The Walking Dead Season 2.
6634000	6639000	PlayStation 3, Beyond Good and Evil, Dragon Fin Soup, and Mass Effect 2.
6639000	6643000	Interesting. I know they had already given away Mass Effect 3, so it's interesting they're going back there.
6643000	6647000	And on the Vita, Dragon Fin Soup is there as well, and Invisimals.
6647000	6651000	So those games will be out on November 3rd.
6651000	6656000	Xbox, not to be missed, will also have their free games with gold.
6656000	6661000	On Xbox One, you get Numa, I think is what it's called, Breath of Life.
6661000	6664000	It's a first-person puzzle game adventure.
6664000	6669000	And then on the 16th, you'll be able to get Night Squad, which is a throwback party game type of thing.
6669000	6674000	On the Xbox 360, Dirt 3, and then Dungeon Siege 3.
6674000	6679000	By the way, don't forget that the Xbox compatibility backwards stuff happens.
6680000	6687000	So these two games expected to be backwards compatible, because they said that all the Xbox 360 games would be backwards compatible.
6687000	6692000	I wish they had that on PlayStation 4, like where the games are backwards compatible.
6692000	6698000	Wouldn't that be nice? Wouldn't that be nice? But sadly, I don't think that's the case.
6698000	6702000	Also, last but not least, this really shouldn't be too much of a surprise,
6702000	6708000	but Sega is going to be looking at re-releasing the first two Shenmue games.
6708000	6713000	Which, with all the hype trained for the third game and all the money they made on Kickstarter,
6713000	6719000	no surprise here that Sega Europe marketing director John Rook, in talking with Marketing Week,
6719000	6724000	said that Sega is, quote, exploring ways to re-release the original two Shenmue titles.
6724000	6728000	Quote, we want to innovate and back smartphones and virtual reality,
6728000	6732000	but our key purpose is to go back to what the brand used to stand for.
6732000	6736000	And I think the buzz around Shenmue 3 shows that people love our legacy.
6736000	6741000	So you can expect those games will turn up at some point along the way to Shenmue 3.
6741000	6742000	You alright?
6742000	6747000	Yeah, we love their legacy, not the new fucking Sonic games.
6749000	6752000	Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
6752000	6757000	Well, it's finally happening. There's going to be a Portal board game.
6757000	6762000	I need to have this. I can't help, but this must be mine.
6762000	6764000	Oh, and it has GLaDOS in it too.
6764000	6768000	No, Jamie, you don't need it. You need water and a roof over your head.
6768000	6771000	She gave me the same lecture like two weeks ago. You don't need it.
6771000	6773000	No, you're correct. I want it.
6773000	6777000	I want it very badly to the point that I can confuse it with a need.
6777000	6782000	Fair enough. I had to. I had to. You left me no choice.
6782000	6785000	You had a choice. You always had a choice.
6785000	6788000	Okay, but it was an easy choice.
6790000	6792000	You're number one.
6792000	6795000	Alright, I got one finger being shown at me right now. Alright.
6795000	6796000	Hearts, hearts, hearts.
6796000	6804000	So anyway, it's going to be 50 bucks, and you can get it from the Cryptozoic, or buy it at other places.
6804000	6806000	You monster.
6807000	6812000	Also, Mario Maker has more updates coming out very soon.
6813000	6819000	You'll be able to add checkpoints to existing levels, or to create new ones that include them.
6819000	6826000	For you people that like to make Satan levels that are just ass hard, then you can finally put some goddamn checkpoints in them.
6826000	6827000	Ass hard.
6827000	6828000	They won't.
6828000	6831000	Yeah, except you won't because you're a dick, and you like to make your levels hard.
6831000	6832000	Speaking of hard.
6832000	6834000	But they can clear it. Why can't you?
6834000	6835000	They probably can't.
6835000	6843000	Because they probably only clear it because they put a little cheat in the beginning, like invisible blocks that lead up to a warp pipe that just drops them on the flag at the end.
6843000	6845000	Bitches.
6846000	6851000	So anyway, you can also add status-dependent power-ups.
6851000	6856000	For example, if you put a fire flower block, it can eject a super mushroom if you're small instead.
6856000	6859000	You know what's funny? I criticized the game for that in the very beginning.
6859000	6861000	I said it doesn't work like Mario Brothers works.
6861000	6862000	Yeah.
6862000	6865000	Yeah, so it's kind of funny they went back and fixed that. That's interesting.
6865000	6868000	Well, and there's also going to be more Nintendo-designed courses.
6868000	6876000	So it'll have the winning level from the partnership with Facebook, but you have to use your real name on it.
6876000	6884000	And then you can tackle the level that was in the final round of the PAX Prime Omega-thon.
6884000	6888000	And it's got some official makers. More things will be coming out.
6888000	6892000	Yes, and the Facebook level will just autoplay, even though you didn't really want to see it on your screen.
6892000	6894000	And then you have to install a plugin.
6894000	6895000	Yep.
6895000	6901000	Also happening is the SSSW.
6901000	6904000	South by Southwest.
6904000	6905000	Whatever.
6909000	6910000	What?
6910000	6912000	It's South by Southwest.
6912000	6915000	Okay, fine. I don't keep up with those things.
6915000	6921000	But they did have to cancel two panels they were going to have in response to threats of online...
6921000	6927000	Sorry, on-site violence that were set around online harassment.
6927000	6930000	Ironic, right?
6930000	6933000	But their director, Hugh Forrest, said,
6933000	6941000	By canceling two sessions, we sent an unintended message that they not only tolerate online harassment, but condones it.
6941000	6943000	And for that, we are truly sorry.
6944000	6954000	So, on Saturday, March 12th, they're hosting an online harassment summit that will be taking place in the 2016 event.
6954000	6956000	And livestreamed to the public for free.
6956000	6963000	They are going to have a large number of speakers, including Wendy Davis.
6963000	6969000	Who, I don't know if people remember, she did the filibuster for...
6969000	6975000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't remember what it was. I remember she was there on the floor for hours and hours.
6975000	6978000	Although I'm very disappointed that she's a Hillary supporter, and I like Bernie.
6978000	6981000	Get out of the politics. This is video games.
6981000	6983000	It's all wrapped up together.
6983000	6986000	And also, Brianna Wu's going to be there.
6986000	6989000	A few other people.
6989000	6996000	Actually, from all over the political and industry spectrum. So, pretty neat.
6996000	7002000	This whole thing was a bit of a shitstorm online, and if you didn't see any of it, you're honestly for the better.
7002000	7006000	Because every time I think, I'm not going to see this ever again, hooray!
7006000	7012000	I'm just like, I'm done with it. It's a big ol' fucking circle jerk. I just don't give a shit anymore.
7012000	7015000	It's like...
7015000	7021000	You're right. This panel will totally solve online harassment forever. It will do nothing.
7021000	7024000	It will not bring more awareness to it. It will do nothing.
7024000	7036000	No, no, no. The thing is that by saying something is going to do nothing and immediately dismissing any attempts to rectify it, all that does is perpetuate the same thing over and over.
7036000	7043000	The more exposure something like that gets, the more people willing to stand up and do something about it, the better chance there is of having something being done.
7043000	7047000	By more exposure, I'm sure you mean more exposure for Brianna Wu, because that's really what she wants.
7047000	7054000	Hold on, hold on. Let me say it this way, because I'm all for intelligent people speaking, but the problem is, nobody's...
7054000	7059000	I shouldn't say nobody. That's not true. The people that need to hear it are not going to be listening.
7059000	7070000	However, what I would like to see is a summit discuss on what to do to retaliate. As in, hold the people who pull the shit accountable.
7070000	7075000	You can only anonymize yourself so much online. There's a way to find most of these people.
7075000	7077000	That's why I find Wendy Davis...
7077000	7080000	That's why you can dox everybody, because that's what they like, right?
7080000	7093000	But that's why we need to have politicians, and that's why it's encouraging that Wendy Davis is participating, because what legally can we do to hold these doxers and these people who do this shit and get away with it because they can, what can we do to hold them accountable?
7093000	7096000	That's a discussion that needs to happen.
7096000	7106000	And see, what my thought is, is that if you find people like this, even just saying... Well, do you remember when I was being harassed, what was it about?
7106000	7111000	God, it was a while back, and it was one friend of Timmy. Do you remember Timmy, right?
7111000	7113000	No, vaguely, vaguely.
7113000	7121000	But it was one of his buddies, and so I just basically responded back with it, here's your IP address, and here is your physical address. Are you going to stop now?
7121000	7122000	Yeah.
7122000	7130000	And it stopped. But the thing is that the moment that you expose who it is to say, I know who you are, and I know how to find you.
7130000	7131000	Basically cut their balls off.
7131000	7132000	Exactly.
7132000	7134000	Well, that's more like accountability. Like, I'm going to make you accountable.
7134000	7137000	That's what I want. I want accountability.
7137000	7144000	You know, even if it's, I know who you are, it will stop more often than not.
7144000	7153000	Once they realize that, yes, you can do something about it, too, you know who they are, it's that whole anonymous having no face to it.
7153000	7157000	I mean, that's the reason why the KKK freaking wears sheets on their faces.
7157000	7166000	You know, it's the same thing. By being an anonymous, no name, no face person, you can get away in some cases literally with murder.
7166000	7177000	And if you hold them accountable, you remove the masks so that people know who they are, then that removes the safety of being able to do it without, you know, having to deal with consequences.
7177000	7188000	All right. Well, before we get to our FUGL question of the week, I got to roll it back a little bit here to address a comment on something I'd previously said about the whole fact that people are going to be giving up their months for Fallout.
7188000	7195000	Tigerclaw is pointing out, what about Battlefront? That's coming out in a few short weeks. So say goodbye to your Star Wars fans. They'll be busy playing that game all night.
7195000	7199000	Well, you know, you can listen to this show and play video games.
7199000	7206000	Especially if they want their collector's edition, which is $200, they're not going to have any money to purchase the rest of the games coming out in the fourth quarter.
7206000	7210000	If I can contribute to the show and write fan fiction, then you can listen and play.
7210000	7214000	All right. Let's get to our FUGL question of the week.
7214000	7232000	Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and we ask a question and we read some of our favorite answers here from you guys, the folks participating with the program.
7232000	7239000	So let's get to this week's question, which this week was about Kinect, the article we talked about.
7239000	7241000	I think Loki brought up in the first half of the show tonight.
7241000	7246000	Microsoft has cut the price of the Kinect by $50 and reinforced its commitment to the device.
7246000	7251000	Do you have an Xbox One with Kinect? If yes, do you think it's worth it for the rest of us to spend the money?
7251000	7256000	If no, does this recent price drop interest you? What would it take to get you interested if not?
7256000	7261000	So kind of a multi-part question, but I really want to know where people's heads was at where if you have one, why?
7261000	7264000	If you don't have one, why? And what's going to get you there?
7264000	7270000	Tigerclaw starts us off on Facebook saying, I don't have a Kinect and don't have any use for it since my room is too small for one.
7270000	7276000	But I think some people may get one for the voice command features, Skype video chat, and as a mic for in-game voice chat.
7276000	7287000	And I saw a little conversation going on there where it was pointed out that you can do like a little filter, like little thing you put on top of the Kinect to help make a small room bigger in the eyes of the Kinect.
7287000	7293000	But I can also see that in certain spaces it's probably still not going to work. It's probably still not enough.
7293000	7301000	But yeah, certainly if you don't have the adequate room for Kinect it may be more difficult, especially without an extra peripheral.
7301000	7311000	Brad from Pod Culture over on Facebook says, I got one and outside of the occasional voice command I don't use it. Had it been an option when I got my system I would have got the bundle without.
7311000	7322000	Mike C. replies on Facebook and says, I have an Xbox One with a Kinect. I keep it disconnected because voice commands don't work well for me and I don't want Phil Spencer to watch me walking around in my underwear.
7322000	7331000	And lastly, Hitstun says, I don't have an Xbox One and I wouldn't want to use a Kinect as a game controller. I'd like to try one for motion capture for game development.
7331000	7338000	That requires a $50 Windows adapter and a beefy PC, so I still won't get a Kinect until I know it'll do what I need.
7338000	7343000	You know, Hitstun does bring up an important point though that didn't come up in the room when we were talking about this earlier and that was,
7343000	7351000	Kinect also has its purposes on PC and some of the greatest advances that Kinect has brought us, especially for science and everything,
7351000	7361000	and I mean on like the 360, had nothing to do with gaming. Especially the fact that doctors can use them without having to touch anything is really kind of a cool use for that.
7361000	7367000	So that is the fact that you bring up the whole fact of a PC adapter and using it that way to do motion capture for games.
7367000	7373000	That kind of shows another side of Kinect where I go, okay, yeah, that's a really good use for Kinect.
7373000	7379000	So my thing is like, if you want to do the voice commands and stuff like that, why doesn't it work with the headset?
7379000	7383000	It's like, why do I need to have a fucking $150 peripheral to do that shit?
7383000	7386000	Like it doesn't, I don't think it processes any of that crap.
7386000	7387000	Give me your money.
7387000	7395000	All right. Redertainment on Google Plus says, I have an Xbox One with Kinect and I use the Kinect nearly every day.
7395000	7403000	The Kinect makes it easy to switch from playing games to watching TV or WWE. I definitely recommend the Kinect to anybody.
7403000	7405000	Xbox wrestling.
7405000	7408000	Xbox wrestling. I love it.
7408000	7415000	Lastly, Act Def says, I don't have a Kinect, but I would like to get one just to get the full Xbox One experience when I get the console.
7415000	7420000	Granted, I probably won't miss that much if I don't get it, so I'm not that excited over it either.
7420000	7429000	So a very wide variety of answers to our question there over at Facebook and Google Plus. Thank you guys who participated tonight.
7429000	7433000	All right, let's get back into some gaming news. Loki.
7433000	7440000	All right, so we kind of talked about this last week that Sony wasn't going to be making video games.
7440000	7444000	Just kidding. They say they still are going to make some video games.
7444000	7448000	Okay, what? What game are you making? Prove it. I want to see the receipts.
7448000	7462000	Well, they're saying that, let's see, I think what we said is that we're no longer in the business of AAA development of games for Vita, but there's still first party Vita content being worked on.
7462000	7467000	What the fuck does that mean, though? That doesn't make any sense.
7467000	7471000	That's so vague. Like, what the fuck does that mean?
7471000	7472000	Wait, say that again.
7472000	7478000	I think, okay, this is according to Jim Ryan, the Sony Computer Entertainment Europe president.
7478000	7486000	He said, I think what was said is that we are no longer in the business of AAA development of games for the Vita.
7486000	7491000	Well, that seems pretty straightforward to me, but there's still first party Vita content being worked upon.
7493000	7498000	So you're going to make AA games? I mean, I don't understand what...
7498000	7505000	If you said, I think what we said is that we're not in the business of AAA development for the Vita, that's okay.
7505000	7508000	I don't think you can get much more clear than that. So you're going to put out other things?
7508000	7513000	Two ways to read this comment. There's two answers, I think.
7513000	7518000	Do you remember last year at E3, not this year, but last year, and I just remember this because I was there.
7518000	7521000	It was the conference that I saw from PlayStation.
7521000	7527000	They started relatively early. They showed this game called Entwined that they were releasing on the store that day.
7527000	7535000	That was a first party game. Sony made that, but it was a very small startup studio that was a lot of students within their company.
7535000	7539000	So I would not call that AAA development, but that's still a first party game, if that makes sense.
7539000	7541000	So a game like Entwined would count.
7541000	7544000	Maybe they're thinking more games like Journey and that type of thing.
7544000	7550000	Which, you know, honestly, Journey is one of the greatest PS3 games, so I don't care what.
7550000	7558000	AAA, single A, double Ds, killer Cs, whatever it is, I don't care. Just, you know, that game is fantastic.
7558000	7562000	I wonder if, now here's the second way I could interpret that comment.
7562000	7566000	Does this mean that they're contracting other people to do the first party games for them?
7566000	7568000	I think that could be it.
7568000	7572000	That works so well for the Vita and early life cycle list.
7572000	7579000	Well, I'm just saying, whether it worked or not, have they hired third parties to truly do the first party software?
7580000	7587000	I think that's an option that I kind of read between the lines and I kind of think that could be where it is.
7587000	7589000	So, we'll see.
7589000	7596000	Anyhow, speaking of studios and the things that they are creating, you know, there's a lot of speculation around what Retro Studios is up to.
7596000	7601000	Of course, Retro Studios, the company behind the great Metroid Prime series.
7601000	7607000	And their last big release was Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, but that was what, like late 2013?
7607000	7609000	So, what the hell are they working on now?
7609000	7614000	Tropical Freeze came out in the beginning of the year. It was like a February release.
7614000	7618000	Sorry, they finished it in 2013. It went gold and then it came out in the beginning of the year.
7618000	7624000	So, anyhow, apparently the latest rumor is that it could be a new IP.
7624000	7627000	So, something new. Which, you know, new stuff is exciting, right?
7627000	7633000	And apparently they pitched this in 2014. This is just, you know, some rumors going on.
7634000	7640000	And what's interesting about this is that the rumor goes on to say, I don't think Retro wants to do Metroid Prime 4.
7640000	7644000	I'd be surprised if Retro pitched that. I think they've had their fill of Metroid.
7644000	7650000	And if it is Metroid, then it would be something different, like maybe a 2D one or something different from Prime.
7650000	7653000	Yeah, that would be awesome. Let's do a 2D Metroid.
7653000	7656000	So, interesting.
7657000	7661000	I'm all for original stuff, though. I mean, Splatoon was completely original.
7661000	7664000	And that's like kind of a must-have Wii U game at this point.
7664000	7671000	I'm all for another sprite-based Zelda, you know, Link to the Past style game for Zelda.
7671000	7673000	That would be great, except why does that need to be on the Wii U?
7673000	7679000	Because it can be huge. Imagine making like the game like really large.
7679000	7680000	Yeah, we'll see.
7680000	7681000	Huge map.
7681000	7686000	Maybe a Metroid game from the top down like that. That would be weird, though. I don't know.
7686000	7689000	There was a Contra game that kind of worked like that, though.
7689000	7694000	But anyway, let's move on. Because that's all rumors, so what else can you say about that?
7694000	7697000	They'll show it when they're ready to show it. In the meantime, Dark Sakura.
7697000	7707000	Well, while we were all busy looking at presidential elections and other loudness, I'd say, in the news,
7707000	7714000	the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act passed Senate 74-21.
7714000	7720000	Which, before we were really paying attention to a lot of this, and then they just sort of snuck on through.
7720000	7732000	Basically, it's just the whole thing is crappy because they don't understand what information is,
7732000	7739000	how it affects everybody, the way the Internet works.
7739000	7748000	It actually was, and I'm trying to get the rest of the information on this, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, EFF, issued a statement.
7748000	7754000	I'm just going to read this one as it is because it sums it up perfectly.
7754000	7764000	The passage of CESA reflects the misunderstanding many lawmakers have about technology and security.
7764000	7767000	Computer security engineers were against it. Academics were against it.
7767000	7773000	Technology companies, including some of Silicon Valley's biggest, like Twitter and Salesforce, were against it.
7773000	7782000	Civil society organizations were against it. And constituents sent over one million faxes opposing the senators.
7782000	7790000	So, it's passed Senate. It has a different version passed the House.
7790000	7796000	And so, they're now going to need to have a big debate between the two to get a final version running.
7796000	7806000	But, right now, it's just really, really shady, I'd say, all this going on.
7806000	7812000	And I will be posting a link in the chat room to the list of people who voted for and against,
7812000	7820000	so that you can let certain people who are in charge of making laws in your state know that they're assholes.
7820000	7827000	Real quick, because a lot of people are comparing this to the whole SOPA, PIPA thing that happened a couple of years ago.
7827000	7835000	How is this, like, you know, because it would blow my mind that they essentially passed the same thing when they retreated last time.
7835000	7839000	So, how are they saying this is different? Like, how are they justifying it?
7839000	7846000	Well, what they said in here that they had, they actually changed a lot of the wording in it.
7846000	7854000	Let me see. There was a little bit more about it. I'm trying to see if I can find where it said that.
7854000	7859000	So, they were supposed to have tightened the definition of cybersecurity threats.
7859000	7867000	And that they needed to be aware that, and this is a quote, made it reasonably likely to cause damage, as opposed to may cause damage.
7867000	7877000	It's all verbiage, is all it is. So, I'd have to make sure that we have a little bit more information, I think, posted publicly on it.
7877000	7885000	But, basically, any other amendments that were introduced to protect citizen privacy were shut down by the Senate.
7886000	7891000	So, they don't care what our privacy is. They just want to know what we're doing.
7891000	7897000	Scary times in the future. Alright, but I'm sure, you know.
7897000	7899000	That's okay. Big Brother will always be watching.
7899000	7902000	But I'll be watching Big Brother, because that's a trashy great show.
7902000	7905000	Alright, moving on. Loki.
7905000	7907000	Thank you for ruining my 1984 reference.
7907000	7911000	No, I enhanced it. Loki.
7912000	7915000	Sorry, I had a hamburger in my hands.
7915000	7926000	So, this is kind of neat. Apparently, they're going to be allowing DRM circumvention for abandoned video games.
7926000	7935000	And the Library of Congress has issued exemptions to section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
7935000	7945000	That makes it slightly easier to legally circumvent different aspects of DRM for lawful fair use, such as preservation of old video games.
7945000	7957000	So, the exemption basically allows them to remove server authentication of the game's original server if it's shut down.
7957000	7960000	So, that's pretty cool.
7960000	7966000	So, Mario Kart Wii no longer works online, right? Because all the Nintendo Wii games got shut down.
7966000	7973000	Legally, I can, quote-unquote, hack my Wii to connect that game to a private server to continue to play that game.
7973000	7983000	No, it's online authentication. Like, say, for example, imagine if Steam went away and the game requires Steam to work, you know, you can circumvent it to allow the game to work without it.
7983000	7991000	Or, if it's a multiplayer-only game, like a mag or something like that, you could hack that to have your own private servers.
7991000	7996000	Got it. Okay, but in that case, you're talking about there with the whole online servers and Steam specifically,
7996000	8000000	Steam has made it well known that should they ever close, which seems so unlikely at this point,
8000000	8008000	but should they ever close, they have a button they can push that will get rid of DRM completely from all the games that you buy.
8008000	8013000	So, yeah, a big red button that says, do not push in case of bankruptcy.
8013000	8022000	Alright. Well, that's interesting. I'm curious to see what's going to come out of that there and what, you know,
8022000	8028000	especially some of the more questionable stuff that kind of walks the line, see what kind of comes with that.
8028000	8036000	Anyhow, speaking of old games and legal, it's completely legal, you can download every Tribe's game for free.
8036000	8046000	That's right, Hi-Rez Studios in the 21st anniversary celebration of the game is actually going to be releasing every game from the Tribe series,
8046000	8051000	and it's out now. If you go to tribesuniverse.com, you can download all the old games.
8051000	8057000	That includes the most recent game, Tribes Ascend, because that was a free-to-play game anyway.
8057000	8062000	So, there you go. Head on over before they decide to, you know, make those games pay again.
8062000	8065000	I know literally one person that would be excited about this.
8065000	8067000	One person. Who is the person?
8067000	8069000	Oh, my coworker who is like huge in the Tribes.
8069000	8073000	Well, guess what, Loki's coworker? Today is your special day.
8073000	8075000	Congrats. You're a winner.
8075000	8082000	Alright. Hey, I'll check it out. I mean, I know the most new game before, you know, the free-to-play one.
8082000	8086000	I think it was like from 2007, but I'll still check it out. Why not?
8087000	8091000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys e-mail us.
8091000	8095000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com. We pick some of our favorite e-mails.
8095000	8098000	And Dark Soccer reads them live on air for our enjoyment.
8099000	8100000	I don't play favorites, Rob.
8100000	8103000	Again, that's participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
8104000	8105000	Yeah.
8106000	8113000	Alright, first e-mail. Quick question. Have any of you tried the Minecraft minigame servers such as Miniplex, Hypixel, or the like?
8113000	8120000	Is it at all likely similar servers would be active for console players, or are Sony and Microsoft more locked down than that?
8121000	8131000	Also, I saw the latest RPG Maker MV, I guess it has to do with the Roman numerals anyway, is available for Windows and Mac.
8131000	8135000	Does this mean that we'll be seeing more RPG Maker games on Mac now?
8136000	8139000	Sorry, this is all too speculative. Robert M.
8139000	8143000	P.S., like Jim Sally, my primary support device is an iPod Touch 5G.
8144000	8148000	There were a lot of questions in there. RPG Maker on Mac.
8148000	8158000	I think there's a general trend that more stuff that does big business on Steam, which I think RPG Maker is one of them, should be releasing PC, Mac, Linux as much as possible.
8159000	8164000	So, I actually think, yeah, you probably will see more RPG Maker on Mac.
8164000	8168000	And, you know, hey, yay, more games for more people. That's a good thing.
8169000	8178000	Yeah, given that just, you know, practically every day I look at the App Store, and there are already big titles that are there.
8178000	8184000	I mean, like, if I were to open it up right now, which I just did, waiting for it to load.
8185000	8194000	Right on the top I have Doom 3. I have Reassembly. There's actually, it's got its whole game section, so.
8194000	8203000	Transistor. This War of Mine. I got Grim Fandango. All kinds of stuff.
8203000	8210000	Guitar Hero, funny enough, has a release like that, even though you don't necessarily have the controller. It's kind of interesting.
8210000	8217000	Yeah, you're getting a lot of major titles more often. As far as the Minecraft minigame thing, I don't know.
8217000	8221000	Yeah, I'm not too sure about that. I have not played on those servers that you mentioned.
8221000	8228000	I prefer to keep it kind of either a solo game or, like, when we had the VoG server where it was a really controlled environment.
8228000	8234000	Like, I thought that was kind of cool, too. As far as the console versus PC, and will the Mega servers come to console?
8234000	8239000	Probably not, because that's not usually in the vision of console. And especially now that Microsoft owns Minecraft,
8239000	8245000	I think you're going to see that they want to take the PC and the Xbox One versions in slightly different directions,
8245000	8252000	so that you'll have a reason to buy both. Isn't that what it's really all about? That's my thoughts, anyway.
8252000	8260000	Well, they already have, because the PC version, Windows 10, is based off of the mobile version of Minecraft.
8260000	8262000	Oh, interesting. I didn't even realize that.
8262000	8263000	But it runs so well.
8263000	8270000	Yeah, it does run really well. Anyhow, just a quick comment from chat, because I want to make sure over at live.vognetwork.com we get all our voices heard.
8271000	8276000	Dungeon Buster talking about tribes, saying tribes vengeance was pretty fun. At least the SP campaign was.
8276000	8280000	The MP not so much from what I heard from more die-hard tribes fans.
8280000	8286000	So, anyway, just a comment there from chat. No comments on that particular email, though, so we can go on to our next email.
8286000	8294000	I'd like to thank Tom for the pot roast recipe. Yeah, someone sent us a pot roast recipe, but he said don't read it on air.
8294000	8296000	You'll need one cup of meat.
8296000	8298000	It looks pretty freaking good.
8298000	8299000	Yeah.
8300000	8302000	We'll have to try making it on a later show.
8302000	8306000	Dang it, why do you people send me fucking novels? I mean, I love you. Bye.
8307000	8310000	Hello all, just a few random thoughts on last week's episode.
8310000	8318000	To Loki and anyone who might be thinking about playing a telltale game, such as Minecraft's story mode game of Thrones and Walking Dead, yes, that is how they play.
8318000	8327000	Completing them is rather easy. Each episode lasts two hours, about two hours, and the majority of the interactivity consists of dialogue choices.
8327000	8331000	I would say that they are more like interactive movies than traditional video games.
8331000	8340000	That being said, we recently completed the first season of Walking Dead, and it is one of the more memorable, moving, emotional gaming experiences I have had this year.
8340000	8347000	It kind of makes me think I have not, in fact, aged out of new games as I previously thought.
8347000	8353000	I won't spoil anything, but I'll just say pressing one button has never been so difficult as it is at the end of episode five.
8353000	8361000	The entire first season was recently given away for free on both 360 and Xbox One as part of Games with Gold,
8361000	8367000	but it's more than worth the asking price as long as you're not entirely turned off by the concept of playing an interactive movie.
8367000	8372000	Play it with someone you love with the lights off. If you can handle it, you won't regret it.
8373000	8380000	On the subject of Square Enix, possibly bringing back old franchises, I have just two things to say. Einhänder is the first.
8381000	8384000	But, I love, we just had Shane agree.
8385000	8386000	Yes, please.
8386000	8393000	Okay, wait, but to be fair, I just, devil's advocate here, you get Dissida, which is a fighting game.
8393000	8395000	No, Einhänder's not the fighting game.
8395000	8396000	No, it's Einhänder.
8396000	8397000	Einhänder's the shooter.
8397000	8401000	Oh, God, I always, never mind, never mind, I always get that and the, never mind, I get the name.
8401000	8404000	That is such a good game. I love that game so much.
8404000	8405000	Er, guys.
8405000	8408000	Yeah, that game's garbage. Einhänder's really good.
8408000	8409000	I was thinking of similar names.
8409000	8410000	No, they're not.
8410000	8412000	You know what? I have them both.
8412000	8415000	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I haven't played them since I was like 20.
8415000	8418000	The RPG mode in Er, guys, was pretty fun.
8419000	8423000	Anyway, but that's really unlikely, so the second is Bushido Blade.
8424000	8428000	So much could be done with that in the modern era. Come on, ScreenX, make it happen.
8429000	8434000	And if a true sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics is ever announced, nothing will be able to contain my glee.
8435000	8442000	Lastly, I will just mention that I am almost ready to launch my new website and release multitasking.
8442000	8447000	I always say that finishing is the hardest part and this time has been no different.
8447000	8453000	Thanks, as always, to both you guys and the listeners for all of the support.
8453000	8455000	Please look forward to it, smileface.
8455000	8460000	And to Loki, you haven't mentioned it lately, but I have not forgotten about time to car.
8460000	8463000	Yeah, it's been really hard to get back in the...
8463000	8466000	It's just kind of... I've been busy with the costume.
8467000	8469000	But Halloween's over now.
8469000	8472000	Yeah, exactly. I need to get back onto it.
8472000	8475000	The costume did look pretty kick-ass, I gotta say.
8475000	8480000	Yeah, it was pretty awesome. I was up for 36 hours on Thursday. I did not sleep.
8480000	8484000	I know the wife will never let you go to Dragon Con, but you would get so many pictures of that costume.
8484000	8486000	You would have had a great time.
8486000	8489000	For those who didn't know, or didn't see it, I was Lego Deadpool.
8489000	8493000	Hopefully you're still determined to complete and release it, and we'll all see it soon.
8493000	8496000	I'm waiting for you. Keep on moving, Aaron YYR.
8496000	8499000	I'm looking forward to multitasking by YYR.
8501000	8506000	I already told him I feel like this game deserves a much bigger fanfare release.
8506000	8511000	We'll do what we can to get the word out there.
8511000	8513000	Alright, last email.
8513000	8514000	Yay.
8514000	8517000	And who is this from? Oh, Ragenator.
8517000	8520000	Hi, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood Ragenator.
8520000	8522000	I have some good and bad news for everyone.
8522000	8527000	As everyone may have heard by now, the laptop that I've had since 2012 died at the beginning of October,
8527000	8529000	hence why I've been away from VoG.
8529000	8536000	I've temporarily borrowed a real POS 10 to 12 year old laptop to temporarily hold me over until I can go out and replace my computer,
8536000	8539000	but I can't do much of anything with it.
8539000	8545000	Now for the relatively good news, I have rearranged my budget significantly so I can go get a new computer somewhat quickly.
8545000	8551000	This does not mean that I'm temporarily shutting off my Time Warner services until May 1st, 2016,
8551000	8556000	and trying to live off of $75 a month until May 2016.
8556000	8557000	Okay.
8557000	8563000	Yeah, it'll be tough as balls to do, but with a little luck and perseverance, I will have enough money to replace my computer by then,
8563000	8568000	and hence be back to my usual norm of gaming, participating in VoG's live shows, telling bad jokes, etc.
8568000	8573000	Unfortunately, I'll miss the finale of Understation Live, but it can't be helped.
8573000	8574000	We'll record it for you.
8574000	8581000	Hopefully we get a podcast of it. Everybody poke Travis to make sure he doesn't get too caught up in Fallout 4. He'll post that.
8581000	8584000	Anywho, ultimately the point of my email is this.
8584000	8588000	No, I didn't fall off the face of the earth and nothing's physically wrong with me.
8588000	8594000	I figure that maybe some people might have been worried since it's highly unusual for me to be away from VoG,
8594000	8598000	and at one point I did disclose that I do suffer from depression. I'm sorry.
8598000	8601000	I actually hear from him all the time on Steam and haven't lately.
8602000	8605000	I am safe, albeit at best moody now.
8605000	8610000	Sadly, sometimes shit just happens. I will make every effort to be back ASAP.
8610000	8613000	In the meantime, my thoughts will be with the VoG community as a whole,
8613000	8618000	and I will look forward to participating with OLR, AJS, and Black Wolf Show once again.
8618000	8622000	Feel free to designate someone to tell bad jokes on my behalf during my absence.
8624000	8626000	I always read the P.
8626000	8631000	Anyway, I hope all is well with everyone, and I'll see you all virtually fairly soon. Take care.
8657000	8659000	...or some... I don't know why. I don't know why.
8659000	8660000	Learn macrame.
8660000	8665000	I think because I've been asked to join a bowling league, and it's on Sunday nights, and so I can't do it,
8665000	8669000	so that's probably why that came to mind. But, you know, people's lives changed or whatever.
8669000	8674000	But, glad to hear you okay. Sorry to hear about the computer, but life sucks, right? Things happen.
8674000	8678000	Make the best of it. When life hands you lemons, make lemonade.
8678000	8680000	You demand to see life's manager.
8680000	8682000	That's right. You demand to see life's manager.
8682000	8684000	I don't need your fucking lemons.
8686000	8690000	Or you serve that lemon with a nice shot of vodka.
8690000	8691000	That's tequila.
8691000	8693000	That's right. No, no, tequila. Gross.
8695000	8698000	I say the same about vodka, though. For the most part.
8698000	8699000	Tangent time.
8699000	8701000	Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
8702000	8704000	I need, like, a bumper noise of a train coming in.
8704000	8706000	Choo-choo! It's a tangent train!
8706000	8708000	I'll just go rip a Jim Sally sound clip.
8708000	8709000	Chugga-chugga.
8709000	8710000	Tangent train.
8710000	8712000	I made lemonhead vodka.
8712000	8714000	Yeah? How was it?
8714000	8715000	Fucking amazing.
8715000	8716000	Yeah?
8716000	8718000	That sounds fantastic, actually.
8718000	8720000	It turned out really well, but we had to filter it.
8720000	8724000	But we found out that it's actually amazingly delicious in orange soda.
8724000	8728000	So when life gives you lemonheads, infuse it in vodka.
8730000	8732000	Mr. Candy Corn Vodka.
8732000	8736000	I gotta say, I had some of that pumpkin spice candy corn vodka that you made.
8736000	8739000	And, uh, you know, we had that at the show a little bit.
8739000	8742000	Super syrupy, but great. Delicious.
8742000	8746000	Because it's basically drinking a candy bar that's gonna get you smashed.
8746000	8749000	Those candy corns weren't that bad, actually.
8749000	8750000	Yeah, they were good.
8750000	8752000	I wonder how it would be poured over ice cream.
8752000	8753000	Mmm.
8753000	8754000	Oh my.
8754000	8758000	I wish I hadn't eaten my entire blizzard already, but it was so good.
8758000	8760000	So, alright.
8760000	8763000	Why don't they have alcoholic sundaes?
8763000	8767000	I'm sure they do. They just, you know, you have to carry a liquor license when you wanna do that stuff.
8767000	8768000	And things get complicated.
8768000	8771000	There's lots of, like, bars and, like, restaurants.
8771000	8773000	Children, ice cream.
8773000	8774000	Yeah.
8774000	8779000	Also, I don't think dairy and vodka mix too well. Very few situations.
8779000	8781000	You can get, like, yours.
8781000	8782000	You know.
8782000	8783000	Yeah, I guess that could work.
8783000	8785000	I have pumpkin spice kalua at home.
8785000	8786000	Yummy!
8786000	8789000	Cause I'm totally being...
8789000	8792000	That's, like, my one nod to basic bitchiness.
8792000	8795000	Is pumpkin spice kalua.
8795000	8796000	Alright.
8796000	8798000	Tangent train's pulling out of the station.
8798000	8800000	The mailbag segment is done.
8800000	8804000	But if you wanna send us emails, participate at orangelauntrader.com is the place to do it.
8804000	8812000	Well, now that the mailbag is closed, it's time to unleash our anger upon the world in another tangency segment we do on the show every week called the FUs of the Week.
8812000	8817000	It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with gaming, but we've maintained this tradition for 620 weeks.
8817000	8819000	And we're sure as fuck not stopping now.
8829000	8832000	Here is punishment.
8832000	8834000	This is fucked up.
8834000	8837000	Fuck you to there not being any more of my blizzard.
8837000	8841000	And that I had to sit looking at my blizzard while I read through all those damn emails.
8841000	8844000	And everyone's like, I've got my blizzard.
8844000	8847000	Around me like, oh, fuck you, I wanna eat my blizzard.
8847000	8848000	Sorry about it.
8848000	8849000	Uh-uh, you're not.
8849000	8852000	Alright, you're right, I'm not.
8852000	8856000	Also, um...
8856000	8866000	Just fuck you to one of my pieces of medication I'm on for making me feel really fucking weird until I adjust to it.
8866000	8869000	I feel really freaking weird.
8869000	8880000	Like, not in a happy, oh, I'm weird in a quirky way in the, hi, I'm your brain and I'm going to fuck with you for like three weeks until you get used to this shit.
8880000	8882000	That's all it is.
8882000	8883000	So, that's all.
8883000	8886000	Alright, um...
8886000	8888000	I don't really have a lot of FUs.
8888000	8891000	FU to the fact I have to get up early tomorrow.
8891000	8892000	That's all.
8892000	8894000	I like my sleep, I don't like getting up early.
8894000	8896000	Loki.
8896000	8901000	Um, FU to myself for staying up for 36 hours on Thursday for working on the damn costume.
8901000	8902000	Oh my god.
8902000	8905000	And, uh, my face has felt like on fire since then.
8905000	8908000	I hope, I think it's from the spray paint.
8908000	8915000	Because my laptop has a nice coat of spray paint on it too, like a dusting of it, as well as everything else, as well as my lungs did.
8915000	8919000	So maybe I have like a slight chemical burn in my face.
8919000	8920000	I'm not really sure yet.
8920000	8924000	But all my fingers and stuff are really like dry and everything as well.
8924000	8929000	You might need to see a doctor and just have some lab work done just to make sure you didn't have to...
8929000	8930000	Nah, I'm fine. I'm sure.
8930000	8931000	Alright.
8931000	8933000	It's poor ventilation, yeah.
8933000	8935000	Fair enough. Who's got the mic over there?
8935000	8937000	Mike, do you have any FUs of the week?
8937000	8943000	Oh, an FU to whoever put together my basketball roster that I coach.
8943000	8945000	I've got the smallest team in the league.
8945000	8949000	I've got 5th and 6th graders going against mostly 7th graders.
8949000	8950000	That doesn't really work out.
8950000	8956000	You know what though, in the movies, that scrawny misfit team is the one that wins the championship at the end.
8956000	8961000	Not when your team is like 4 and a half feet tall and everybody else is like at least 5'6".
8961000	8964000	Oh, I see. You've got the pre-growth spurt kids.
8964000	8966000	Yeah, it's horrible.
8966000	8969000	Cause you can't say anything to a mother when you've tried.
8969000	8975000	And then you're trying to coach the kids as they're getting their growth spurts and I'm sure that is just a hoot and a holler.
8975000	8981000	A lot easier than trying to teach someone small to get bigger, I guess.
8981000	8984000	Somehow, that doesn't work like that.
8984000	8986000	Grow, damn you!
8986000	8989000	Dan, how about you? Your FU of the week.
8990000	8997000	I'd say fuck you to this Blizzard that I am not going to be able to finish because it is just too rich for my taste.
8997000	8999000	Jamie will finish it for you. If she doesn't, I will.
8999000	9001000	No, is it the pumpkin?
9001000	9005000	No, it's the caramel truffle and I thought the truffles are just too much.
9005000	9007000	I'm like ugh.
9007000	9010000	I didn't like the pumpkin one very much.
9010000	9014000	And I don't like caramel or else I actually probably would take you up on that.
9014000	9016000	I gotta be honest, I've never had a Blizzard.
9016000	9019000	I thought it was more of like a milkshake thing that you drink.
9019000	9022000	It's just ice cream that they blended shit in.
9022000	9024000	It's all it is.
9024000	9026000	It's like a McFlurry, except it came before.
9026000	9030000	And they have their little picture where you can turn it upside down and it doesn't come out. I don't think that would actually work.
9030000	9033000	Not when they've been sitting in the car for fifteen minutes on their way over here.
9033000	9040000	But I did try every single one holding it upside down as we drove back and every single one of them was sticky enough to not fall apart.
9040000	9042000	Alright, fair enough.
9042000	9044000	Last but certainly not least, Shane.
9045000	9051000	F you to Nintendo and the way they handle Splatoon and how they try to make this game not fun.
9051000	9061000	Because, like, they penalize and Splatfest the more popular team and they upped the percent or the multiplier for wins.
9061000	9065000	So like, this has just been in my gaming week but I forgot but I'm mad about this.
9065000	9068000	So I played about ten times this weekend for Splatfest.
9068000	9070000	I was on Ninjas. We lost.
9070000	9081000	We had a seventy percent or like almost seventy something percent popularity versus the twenty something percent pirates.
9081000	9087000	But because of the way they do their online matching, out of those ten games I only fought pirates twice.
9087000	9089000	All the other times I fought Ninjas.
9089000	9095000	And when you're one team versus your same team, it doesn't count towards the results at all. It's a wash.
9095000	9101000	So all my time playing Splatfest, I don't think I'm a bad player. I feel like I'm pretty decent at the game.
9101000	9104000	I wasn't really contributing to my team trying to win.
9104000	9111000	So we got killed because it was sixty percent wins for pirates and forty percent for us.
9111000	9116000	But there was a six times multiplier on that. You can't overcome that. It's stupid.
9116000	9120000	And Nintendo, you just made Splatoon my number three game of the year because of that.
9120000	9121000	Oh no.
9121000	9123000	Yeah, it dropped from number two.
9123000	9124000	Uh oh, downgrade.
9124000	9128000	Yup. You better watch it because it might drop to four if you keep this up.
9128000	9130000	You're on notice.
9130000	9134000	Also, we got Pirates versus Ninja for our Halloween event.
9134000	9139000	Europe, this next weekend, gets Zombies versus Ghosts even though Halloween's over.
9139000	9142000	And Japan for their Halloween was Money versus Love.
9142000	9145000	So I don't understand.
9145000	9148000	Wow, that's Money versus Love.
9148000	9153000	Love won overall, but Money was more popular.
9154000	9159000	But every single Splatfest, every single one of them, the least popular team has won.
9159000	9161000	Yeah, and that's not how it should be.
9161000	9165000	I mean, they should change the multipliers.
9165000	9170000	Because I think in the beginning it was times two for popularity and times four for wins.
9170000	9175000	But now it's times nothing for popularity and times six for wins.
9175000	9177000	And it doesn't seem right.
9177000	9182000	Yeah, but it was kind of screwed up when a team won by one percent just because they were more popular.
9182000	9185000	It should be wins. Period. Wins. Period. That's it.
9185000	9188000	But the online matchmaking maybe needs to be a little different.
9188000	9190000	Yeah. I would rather wait.
9190000	9193000	ActDeft is pointing out Splatoon is still fun and it's fair.
9193000	9195000	It's not fair.
9195000	9196000	He was also Team Pirates.
9196000	9198000	Yeah, it's not fair at all.
9198000	9201000	That sounds like somebody that's always on the winning side is something they would say.
9201000	9203000	Do you know what team I played on?
9203000	9204000	Ninjas.
9204000	9206000	No, the team I forgot to play on was Splatoon.
9206000	9208000	Oh yeah, that's right. You did.
9208000	9211000	I guess I was playing the game wrong because I was Team Pirates so I was stealing stuff off the internet.
9211000	9216000	But, I mean, I guess I just don't get how this works.
9216000	9221000	Alright. And ActDeft is pointing out he's lost three SplatFests in a row.
9221000	9222000	It's still not fair.
9222000	9223000	You need to let him have his moment.
9223000	9227000	It's still not fair. Yeah, he can have his moment but to claim it's fair is wrong.
9227000	9229000	Alright, moving on.
9229000	9232000	We just got a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to your calls.
9232000	9237000	1877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.
9237000	9238000	But first, Loki.
9238000	9242000	Yes, so let's talk about another Kickstarter but this one is actually pretty interesting.
9242000	9247000	Don Bluth. He's trying to Kickstarter a Dragons Lair animated film.
9247000	9249000	I'm down with that.
9249000	9258000	He needs $550,000 to create a teaser that he can shop to financers to create a full film.
9258000	9262000	And so far, let's see what he's raised here.
9262000	9264000	Health.
9264000	9271000	He's raised $114,000 and he's got 24 days to go so I'm pretty sure he's going to make it.
9271000	9274000	And then let's see if he's got stretch goals here.
9274000	9279000	You can win all sorts of animation stuff.
9279000	9282000	But we can't forget the biggest contribution Don Bluth ever made.
9282000	9284000	If you're going to say Xanadu, so help me God.
9284000	9286000	Who is he? I've never heard of this person.
9286000	9288000	The animated scene in Xanadu.
9288000	9289000	I've never heard of this person.
9289000	9290000	Did an American Tail?
9290000	9291000	I know Fievel.
9291000	9292000	Anastasia.
9292000	9293000	Anastasia.
9293000	9297000	I was going to say, is it this busty maquette that I'm looking at?
9297000	9299000	Because that's a pretty big contribution.
9299000	9302000	Until he goes west. I don't know if Fievel goes west.
9302000	9305000	Don Bluth is pretty rad. I wish him success in this.
9305000	9309000	There's a part of me though that kind of thinks the ship has sailed on Dragons Lair.
9309000	9313000	It's like, how many times have we re-released Dragons Lair?
9313000	9319000	It's been out on, with the arcade version came out on, it was on the DVD to play thing.
9319000	9323000	And it was on Xbox. They've just released it a million times.
9323000	9326000	I kind of think the time to make a movie has kind of passed.
9326000	9327000	Really?
9327000	9333000	But at the same time, and I'm going to argue with myself, at the same time, I'm all for introducing it to a new generation.
9333000	9339000	I was just going to say, because they've already tried to shove shit down a new generation's throats that don't probably give a shit about it.
9339000	9342000	Peanuts the movie. Smurfs the movie.
9342000	9344000	The Jem and the Holograms.
9344000	9345000	Jem and the Holograms.
9345000	9347000	The fucking Alvin and the Chipmunks.
9347000	9354000	I mean, no one gave a shit about all those properties. I mean, yeah, it's like, ooh, I love those as kids, but oh God, what have you done to them now?
9354000	9357000	But what's happened in a lot of those cases that somebody new got the rights.
9357000	9361000	Like the Jem and the Holograms movie, that wasn't, that was not a Jem script.
9361000	9368000	That was some other little teeny feel good movie, family film that they fucking just squished, yeah, Jem into.
9368000	9371000	And then like all of our childhoods are weeping.
9372000	9378000	I really would love to see like a franchise like that, just from a movie that's based completely nothing on the franchise at all.
9378000	9384000	Like have like a fucking just like Dolph Lundgren, you know, action film, Jem and the Holograms.
9384000	9386000	You know, it just makes no fucking sense.
9386000	9388000	But it would be entertaining because of that.
9388000	9396000	So at least, at least I will say this, Don Bluth is still involved and that means it'll be better for the wear.
9396000	9399000	Because that means it'll still be his vision, so that's good.
9399000	9403000	I just can't imagine that they can't do like, I mean, is he trying to do like hand drawn animation?
9403000	9407000	I mean, why can't they do just computer animation? That's just like fucking cheap.
9407000	9409000	Well, some people like the hand drawn stuff.
9409000	9413000	I understand that, but like, I don't know. I think people could do it.
9413000	9417000	Maybe they'll have a blend. We'll see. Alright.
9417000	9421000	Like I thought I wouldn't like the Disney animated stuff that was, you know, Disney not Pixar.
9421000	9424000	But I mean, it looks like the same style.
9424000	9425000	Yeah, Tangled was fucking great.
9425000	9429000	Tangled was okay. Frozen was alright. I mean, I don't know.
9429000	9432000	And Dungeon Buster pointing out it's hand drawn animation he's doing.
9432000	9434000	But you know, there's a place for the hand drawn animation too.
9434000	9438000	That's cool, I guess. I hope he makes it. I just, I don't know.
9438000	9439000	I think he will. We'll see.
9439000	9445000	Alright, well lastly, speaking of blasts from the past, who remembers the Dizzy series?
9445000	9447000	Anybody ever played the Dizzy games?
9447000	9450000	Yeah, well, god, they go all the way back to the ZX Spectrum.
9450000	9452000	There were some Dizzy games on Commodore 64.
9452000	9458000	And the last Dizzy game actually came out in 1992.
9458000	9463000	Well apparently, the creators, the Oliver Twins, they were going through some old stuff.
9463000	9470000	And they found the design documents and files to an unreleased NES title called Wonderland Dizzy.
9470000	9474000	Well, they actually went through and worked on it.
9474000	9477000	And now this ROM is running in a browser emulator.
9478000	9484000	So that's right, all these years after 1992 when Wonderland Dizzy was originally conceived,
9484000	9488000	it is now out for free for you to play and catch up on.
9488000	9494000	So you can check that out at wonderlanddizzy.com and you can play that.
9494000	9498000	That's pretty rad that an old treasure like that has been rediscovered.
9498000	9504000	Especially for a series like Dizzy that was, those games, there was quite a few of those games on the NES.
9504000	9506000	And I remember those from the early 80's computing days.
9506000	9509000	So that's pretty rad that there's a new game in that series.
9509000	9513000	So always nice to see those little gems unearthed.
9513000	9518000	Well, that is going to do it for our mainline news tonight.
9518000	9521000	So we're going to open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR.
9521000	9527000	Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight.
9527000	9529000	Or maybe we missed something.
9529000	9531000	Maybe you want to ask our guests a question.
9531000	9533000	I don't know, but you never know.
9533000	9537000	Mike, did you just roll your eyes? I said ask the guests a question.
9537000	9540000	You did this to me at Rocky the other night already.
9540000	9542000	We won't talk about that.
9542000	9544000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR.
9544000	9546000	Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9546000	9548000	And guess what? It's already lighting up.
9548000	9550000	So let's get to it with this first call.
9550000	9552000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9552000	9553000	Hey everybody, it's Rama.
9553000	9555000	Hey Rama, how you doing?
9555000	9557000	I'm pretty good. How about you?
9557000	9560000	I'm super. Thanks for asking. What's on your mind?
9560000	9562000	I knew you was going to do that.
9563000	9564000	What's up?
9564000	9566000	Not much. I want to say a couple of quick things.
9566000	9572000	First off, I remember playing The Living Daylights out of the Fantastic Adventures of Disney for NES. Loved it.
9572000	9576000	Those games were kind of like, I think they were much bigger overseas, like in Europe.
9576000	9581000	I think that was a really big series in Europe than it was here, but certainly it had its following over here.
9581000	9587000	Yeah, but it didn't help the fact that they came up through, I think, Codemasters and Comerica.
9587000	9593000	And they were unlicensed, so they came in special gold-type style cartridges.
9593000	9598000	That's right. I remember that. They were kind of the Renegade games, some of them.
9598000	9605000	Along with Tengen games, like, was Gauntlet in one of those cartridges? No, I think Gauntlet was on a regular cart.
9605000	9609000	Klax, and then Tetris, of course, and so on.
9609000	9618000	Yeah, I mean Gauntlet did come out as an original cartridge, then it came in the alternate cartridge format, you know?
9619000	9620000	Totally.
9620000	9621000	Yes.
9621000	9622000	So what else is on your mind?
9622000	9630000	Well, I want to talk about something really cool, really exciting, something that I've been helping with for the last couple of weeks.
9631000	9633000	May I take the floor?
9633000	9635000	The floor is yours, my friend.
9635000	9644000	Thank you, thank you. Well, I've been kind of cryptic on my Facebook, personal Facebook, about a project I'm helping with at my job.
9644000	9649000	And for those who don't know, I work at Microsoft. I'm in their flagship retail store.
9649000	9659000	And one day, one of the community leaders was asking in the break room if anybody knew any bloggers, cosplayers, gamers.
9659000	9663000	And I raised my hand and I'm like, I know people.
9663000	9665000	All of the above.
9665000	9666000	Yeah.
9667000	9672000	So, she clues me in on Extra Life, and we all know what Extra Life is.
9672000	9682000	Sure, of course, the gaming marathon. It's funny because we started the show talking about Twitch, but broadcasting has really helped the Extra Life marathon gain a lot of visibility.
9682000	9685000	And a lot of people participate in that from all over the world.
9685000	9693000	Definitely. And it seems that Saturday, November 7th is Extra Life game day 2015.
9693000	9696000	And I believe it's going to be a 24 hour stream.
9696000	9710000	And what's happening is from 1 to 7pm at Microsoft's flagship store in New York City, I will be helping with Extra Life and we'll be doing our part in fundraising for Children's Miracle Network.
9710000	9711000	Hey, that's awesome.
9711000	9712000	Yeah.
9712000	9719000	Now, I wish I could fly out there and be there, but realistically that can't happen because of money and all that.
9719000	9726000	But can I see it online? Because I know a big thing about Extra Life is streaming. Is that a possibility or not this time?
9726000	9731000	Yes. We will be streaming through Twitch.tv on Extra Life's channel.
9731000	9732000	Nice.
9733000	9743000	We'll start at 1 and at our location we'll have some DJs and we'll have some DC cosplayers and we'll be doing some gaming tournaments and it's going to be pretty fun.
9743000	9748000	Well, I get to see you on the stream. Can I go in the chat room and make fun of you when I see you on stream?
9748000	9753000	Sure, sure, sure. But if you do that, I might have to send a signal to lock down your Xbox One.
9753000	9757000	Alright. You're going to push the button to brick my console?
9757000	9759000	No, I'll just lock it down. I just won't brick it.
9759000	9765000	Can you push the button to make Rock Band 4 work? No, I'm just kidding. Low blow, I'm kidding.
9765000	9768000	I'll get a 404 redirect to another company.
9768000	9776000	Alright, that's fair, that's fair. Alright. No, I think that's great. And yeah, I really wish we could participate in that a little more.
9776000	9781000	But maybe next year, you never know, never say never. I am way overdue for a trip to New York City.
9781000	9785000	It's been like 8 years since I've been out there. I really need to get out there.
9785000	9786000	You definitely got to come out.
9786000	9792000	Alright. Well, I will be, for what it's worth, I will be in DC for MAGFest. That is happening, for sure.
9792000	9796000	AKA VOGCON WINTER 2016.
9796000	9804000	Kinda. Kinda. It actually, and isn't, yeah, February would be 6 months away from then Atlanta and Dragon Con.
9804000	9810000	So yeah, I guess that works. So yeah, you got your Winter VOG and your Fall VOG.
9810000	9815000	We're crashing your cons because, you know, we're too broke to throw our own.
9815000	9816000	Woohoo!
9816000	9821000	Alright, well best of luck with Extra Life. That is, wait, November 7th would be next Saturday, right?
9821000	9829000	This coming Saturday, it'll be on Twitch.tv slash Extra Life NYC. Tickets are still available through Eventbrite.com.
9829000	9835000	Just look up Extra Life Game Day 2015 and you'll find all the information there. And kids under 10, get in for free.
9835000	9839000	Alright. We want selfies with Rama if you make it out there. Send them to our Twitter at OLR.
9839000	9843000	Yeah, I'll probably be running around wearing my volunteer shirt.
9843000	9847000	Nice. Alright. Well Rama, thanks so much and best of luck to you guys. Hope you raise a lot of money.
9847000	9853000	We will. And you know what, thank you. Thank you for allowing me to come on and just spread the word at us.
9853000	9858000	Because I've been so excited to be a part of this and help promote something this awesome.
9858000	9864000	You're welcome. Like, half the things we let get promoted on this show have nothing to do with such a great charity.
9864000	9867000	So this is even like double awesome. It's a win-win for everybody.
9867000	9868000	Woohoo!
9868000	9871000	Alright. Best of luck. Let us know how it goes.
9871000	9872000	Hey, thank you. I will.
9872000	9873000	Alright. Take care. Bye.
9873000	9874000	Bye.
9874000	9880000	Alright. Very cool. Extra Life. I'm sure a lot of folks are going to be doing streams to support that in the coming weeks.
9880000	9886000	I wish, you know, unfortunately I take a lot of energy and put it into this show that we do every Sunday.
9886000	9892000	So I don't usually participate with my own stream in Extra Life. Not that, you know, never say never.
9892000	9899000	But I think I'm just going to support other people, I think, for this one. And I think that's how I'm going to prefer to do it.
9899000	9903000	Alright. We got another call coming in though. Let's get to it. Hi. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
9903000	9905000	Hey. This is Agdef.
9905000	9906000	Hey, Agdef. How you doing?
9906000	9912000	Pretty good. Pretty good. You said we could ask questions to your guests.
9912000	9914000	Of course you can ask questions to the guests. What's up?
9914000	9917000	Why do you hate football? Soccer?
9917000	9923000	What? Why do you hate football? Because the rest of the world calls it football. You call it soccer.
9923000	9931000	I don't hate football that much. It's just not on my preferred list, I should say.
9931000	9937000	It just doesn't grab my attention as much as basketball.
9937000	9946000	It's like this, Agdef. Some people prefer shooter games. Some people prefer RPGs. Some people prefer platformers.
9946000	9948000	Some people prefer to date pigeons.
9948000	9952000	It does. It doesn't in Dark Soccer Raises Your Hand.
9952000	9961000	But that doesn't mean you hate all video games. It's just, you know, dating pigeons is just not the game I'm choosing to play right now.
9961000	9966000	Yeah, definitely. And I understand now. He likes basketball.
9966000	9972000	I like seeing people score. That's kind of what it is.
9972000	9979000	Did you hear what he said? I like seeing people score. That's why he watches basketball.
9979000	9981000	Me too. Me too.
9981000	9988000	Me too. It has nothing to do with sports. But there are balls involved.
9988000	9990000	Definitely.
9990000	9995000	I have a healthy respect for it. It's just not for me.
9995000	9999000	Alright, fair enough. We'll agree to disagree. What else? What else is on your mind tonight, Agdef?
10000000	10011000	Well, I wanted to talk about something about localization and it was done in the new Zelda game, Triforce Heroes.
10011000	10014000	Oh, yeah. Have you been playing Triforce Heroes?
10014000	10020000	No, I haven't actually. I haven't gotten the game. I really want to try it because it looks fun, though.
10020000	10025000	I don't think it would be a great single player. It's more like a multiplayer game.
10025000	10037000	But aside from that, some people were complaining about the addition of memes in the game's text or in the dialogues.
10037000	10042000	Oh, yeah. Don't they reference, like, Doge?
10042000	10053000	Yeah, I was seeing an image with the Dodge meme with such something. I can't remember exactly what it said.
10053000	10060000	I think it's funny when that shit turns up in games. Why is Zelda so sacred?
10060000	10071000	And not necessarily because it's Zelda. Because Nintendo has done this since the DS era.
10071000	10080000	If I remember correctly, I think one of the Mario and Luigi games, the RPGs, had memes on it.
10080000	10091000	And even then, people praised Nintendo for doing that. And we have seen a lot of memes in Nintendo games throughout the years.
10091000	10099000	Just watch a Splatoon. It's filled with puns and all that. And even Animal Crossing, too.
10099000	10106000	And people haven't complained about them, but they did it to Zelda.
10106000	10115000	And oh my god, Nintendo's treehouse are a bunch of idiots, etc.
10115000	10125000	And it's about localization. Here's Nintendo Treehouse trying to do something fun.
10125000	10128000	So people in general can enjoy it.
10129000	10133000	Earlier in the show, Dan was talking about his gaming week, and he mentioned he was playing Guacamelee.
10133000	10139000	And I remember one thing that really struck me about that game was that it has all these meme references in it.
10139000	10145000	There's all these references. There's Grumpy Cat, there's Mario Brothers.
10145000	10153000	And I thought it was funny. It would be cause for me to explore more areas to try and find all the funny jokes.
10153000	10154000	What game?
10154000	10155000	Guacamelee.
10155000	10161000	Yeah, that game is filled with a lot of references. And it's a really great game, and it's really fun.
10161000	10168000	And all the visuals, and especially what they did with all the references, it's fantastic.
10168000	10175000	But again, they did this with Zelda, and I don't know if it's filled with things like that.
10175000	10179000	I have only seen that one image, so I don't know.
10180000	10182000	And people need to lighten up a little bit.
10182000	10187000	It's like, oh my god, it's filled with idiotic memes or something like that.
10187000	10189000	People need to lighten up a little bit.
10189000	10192000	You know what else is interesting is that some of these other games you talk about,
10192000	10196000	and you mentioned going way, way back to other, way older games.
10196000	10198000	Well, we didn't have Twitter then.
10198000	10205000	So that's how sometimes some of these complainers you didn't really see before, and now you can see it.
10205000	10211000	And I'm all for everybody getting their voice, but there are some voices I'm going to look at and go,
10211000	10215000	okay, well, you said what you have to say, but I really think you just need to get over it.
10215000	10223000	And my point is that people need to learn that when a company or anyone translates a game,
10223000	10228000	it's not only the translation. You don't have to just translate the words.
10228000	10235000	You have to know who's going to play the game, who's going to be watching it,
10235000	10239000	and try to capture, because it's not only, oh, it's going to be players.
10239000	10241000	You have to sell the game.
10241000	10248000	You have to know how it's going to capture the audience.
10248000	10257000	So I know this because I have a bachelor's degree in translation, so I'm speaking of experience and all that.
10257000	10268000	And I know it's not necessarily the greatest thing or the best thing, actually, but it's not really a bad thing either.
10268000	10275000	So I know that people complaining, yeah, it's probably not the best thing, again.
10275000	10284000	But you have to understand the localization of some things, like in this case, this game.
10285000	10288000	Let me get a quick comment out from our chat room over at live.voguenetwork.com.
10288000	10292000	As 2100matt says, to play Devil's Advocate, why does everything got to be a meme?
10292000	10295000	Maybe people just feel we're a little inundated by memes.
10295000	10300000	Well, but to be fair, I mean, it's not like, and he does say, to be clear, I understand both sides.
10300000	10305000	But I mean, it's not like Zelda, Triforce Heroes is, you know, meme the game.
10305000	10310000	I think they tried that and it was horrible. It was some third-party game on Wii U.
10310000	10315000	It's like, okay, it's a little joke or one little costume that's cute.
10315000	10323000	They took fucking selfies in the remake of Wind Waker. I mean, come on, who cares?
10323000	10327000	But you can do some really cute stuff with that, you know?
10327000	10331000	Hey, taking a selfie with Ganondorf, it's the awesomest thing ever.
10331000	10334000	Yeah, and selfies in WoW. Mike mentions you can do selfies in WoW.
10334000	10338000	That was a big thing, was when they put that camera in the game, people could take their selfies.
10339000	10344000	Alright, ActDeft, I gotta let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, but thank you for the feedback.
10344000	10349000	And let us know if you end up getting Triforce Heroes and what you think of the memes.
10349000	10350000	Hey, thanks for having me.
10350000	10352000	Alright, take care, my friend.
10352000	10354000	Alright, we're gonna give time for one more call to try to fit in.
10354000	10358000	1877gameOLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10358000	10361000	While we wait for that call, Loki, I don't know if you have any last-minute stories.
10361000	10363000	Yes, I have excellent news.
10363000	10368000	Dead or Alive Extreme 3, we'll be getting English subs since it's probably not gonna get released over here.
10368000	10371000	So you can import those buoys right away.
10371000	10373000	Yay!
10373000	10379000	Yes, and that'll be coming out in Japan, across Asia, February 25th.
10379000	10382000	Darsaga, Darsaga, Darsaga, we need to get this game and do a livestream.
10382000	10383000	Okay.
10383000	10385000	Yay! That'll be fun.
10385000	10387000	We need to have the bounce-o-meter.
10387000	10388000	For the volleyball.
10388000	10389000	Exactly.
10389000	10391000	Oh, boy.
10391000	10393000	Anything else to share?
10393000	10398000	Yeah, I was gonna say that along with the fact that they're not gonna be allowing you to change your names,
10398000	10401000	there's also still no plans for backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 4,
10401000	10404000	so that's also something else to look forward to.
10404000	10411000	Game Center CX levels are coming to Super Mario Maker in all regions now.
10411000	10413000	So that'd be cool.
10413000	10418000	Does that mean we get to also play as the arena character?
10419000	10420000	I don't know.
10420000	10425000	I really just, sorry, not to beat a dead horse,
10425000	10430000	but I really have to express irritation, strong irritation,
10430000	10434000	that at least PlayStation 1 and 2 games are not playable on PlayStation 4.
10434000	10436000	I mean, I get PlayStation 3 a little bit.
10436000	10440000	You can play the tech challenge card on PlayStation 3 a little bit,
10440000	10446000	even though you have the fucking streaming video stuff, but whatever, we won't go there.
10446000	10449000	But PlayStation 1 and 2 not playable on 4, give me a fucking break.
10449000	10450000	Give me a fucking break.
10450000	10453000	Yeah, PlayStation 1's playable on a PSP.
10453000	10454000	Come on.
10454000	10455000	Yeah.
10455000	10456000	It's playable on my phone.
10456000	10457000	My old-ass phone.
10457000	10458000	Yeah.
10458000	10459000	I don't believe it.
10459000	10464000	I don't believe that it's not possible and you don't want to try and you don't have the resources in it.
10464000	10466000	So just say, you know.
10466000	10470000	Because imagine, think about this, PlayStation Plus, the offerings that they've been giving you,
10470000	10472000	they haven't been this great lately.
10472000	10475000	Imagine if you could dip into that old PlayStation 1 catalog.
10475000	10479000	Hey, you get Twisted Metal or hey, you get Vibriven or something like that.
10479000	10481000	That would be awesome.
10481000	10486000	Or Final Fantasy 6, because that was on, you know, PlayStation, so that would be pretty epic.
10486000	10487000	Yeah, I mean, just dip into that shit.
10487000	10488000	Jet Moto.
10488000	10489000	Yeah.
10489000	10490000	I don't know.
10490000	10491000	All right, one last call.
10491000	10493000	This is the last chance to get in on tonight's show.
10493000	10495000	1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype.
10495000	10497000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
10497000	10499000	Anything else for our listeners tonight?
10499000	10500000	Yeah, this is kind of unusual.
10500000	10509000	There's a rumor that SNK Play More is leaving the pachinko business as opposed to joining it or getting more into it.
10509000	10511000	Well, what a refreshing story.
10513000	10514000	Yes.
10514000	10516000	After a lot of news recently.
10516000	10517000	You know what?
10517000	10518000	Where did I see this?
10518000	10519000	Was it on Twitter?
10519000	10520000	Was it something somebody said in chat?
10520000	10523000	I'm so sorry, I cannot tie this comment to who said it.
10523000	10525000	I'm so sorry who said this in the moment.
10525000	10530000	But somebody was saying the reason why Konami is making these pachinko machines.
10530000	10532000	Maybe this was something Dark Tetsuya said. Was it you?
10532000	10534000	About Silent Hill?
10534000	10535000	Yes.
10535000	10536000	Repeat that comment.
10536000	10545000	The kind of conspiracy theory I have regarding why they're doing the Silent Hill pachinko machine is so that they can show that they're using the IP.
10545000	10554000	And so no one else can come in and try to claim that IP accusing them of forfeiting it through not use.
10554000	10565000	Because I'm not sure of the exact legality, but if you don't utilize an IP, you essentially forfeit the rights to it and someone else can pick it up and take it to make a game.
10565000	10574000	So they don't want to lose the IP, but they don't want to actually make anything, so just slap on it on a pachinko machine and there you go.
10574000	10575000	Thank you.
10575000	10579000	Yeah, but it hasn't been that long since they made a Silent Hill game. It's only been like a couple years.
10580000	10589000	Yeah, but still just buy some more time and maybe there will be a mobile phone game and I'm sure that's inevitable too. So they'll keep that trademark alive and well.
10589000	10594000	They have a new gameplay trailer for 90's Arcade Racer which looks fantastic.
10594000	10595000	I want to check that out.
10595000	10598000	That's something that's coming to Wii U I think soon.
10598000	10603000	Well, it looks like no more calls are coming in tonight, so I'm going to go ahead and shut down the Skype line.
10603000	10606000	If you think of something after the fact, go ahead and send us an email.
10606000	10611000	Participate at orangeontruday.com or you can always tweet us twitter.com slash o-l-r.
10611000	10616000	Some people send us Facebook messages too and I must admit, I know that's how a lot of people talk today.
10616000	10622000	I'm not so good at checking those, but I do read them and I'm sorry if I don't reply timely, but that's usually the last thing I check.
10622000	10625000	But I'll get to it eventually if you send a Facebook message.
10626000	10629000	Alright, is that it for stories too then?
10629000	10630000	Uh, yes.
10630000	10633000	Alright, well then I think we're going to go around and wrap things up.
10633000	10637000	It is 9.15 here on the west coast, 15 after midnight on the east coast after all.
10637000	10643000	Hey, I want to thank our guests for being here tonight, especially our newbies to the show here, Dan and Mike.
10643000	10646000	I hope you guys had a good time and had fun being on this side of OLR.
10646000	10652000	So, I don't know if you have anything you want to plug, I don't know if you have a twitch channel or twitter you want to plug while you're here.
10652000	10656000	But please plug away before we say bye. So, Dan?
10656000	10660000	Nothing specific, I'll just plug my twitter handle I guess.
10660000	10664000	It's gaming underscore hipster and you can go ahead and follow me.
10664000	10673000	I talk mostly about video games and to everyone else who I'm following, it's nothing really super specific.
10673000	10675000	But yeah, that's all I really have.
10675000	10677000	Alright, awesome. And Mike?
10677000	10684000	If you like sports I guess, basketball in particular, football, American football, sorry.
10684000	10698000	And the occasional gaming stuff, it's not even anywhere near focused but you can follow me on twitter at mnev3. That's it.
10698000	10703000	Awesome. And now of course we always go around at the end of the show and get everybody's final thought.
10704000	10709000	Shane, I always ask you if you want to plug something, you never have anything to plug. But I'll get your final thought.
10709000	10713000	You're so rude. This is the second time tonight.
10713000	10714000	What would you like to plug?
10714000	10719000	I was just going to say that, well I don't have anything to plug.
10719000	10721000	How could you quit Ingress?
10721000	10726000	Because he was going to quit and I was like okay I'm going to delete it from my phone. Delete? There, it's easy.
10726000	10730000	It was super easy. That's all.
10731000	10734000	That's what you guys would do. You get me into it and then you all quit.
10734000	10736000	It's all server side anyway.
10736000	10740000	I'm not quitting but I'm dialing it back.
10740000	10746000	I'll do my final thought since you still didn't ask me before you were so rude anyway about plugging stuff.
10746000	10755000	My final thought is if you show up to my Toys R Us this Sunday and you try to get a villager and I don't get one, I will cut you.
10755000	10757000	Because I will.
10757000	10758000	Thank you for that.
10758000	10763000	Before I actually invite people to give their final thoughts, even though Shane decided to give them anyway,
10763000	10766000	I want to quickly say, as I do at the end of every show,
10766000	10773000	we don't have a big multi-million dollar budget behind our show or a way to spread the word about our show.
10773000	10776000	So if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, please help us spread the word.
10776000	10782000	Tell a friend or five or twenty-five about the show and help spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice.
10782000	10786000	Because if the voices aren't listening and using those voices, then we can't hear them.
10786000	10790000	A five-star review wherever you found this show goes a very long way.
10790000	10795000	So thank you to everybody giving five-star reviews on iTunes, Stitcher Radio, wherever it is.
10795000	10797000	Soon, I guess now, Google Play.
10797000	10803000	I just submitted the show to that because I don't know if you guys heard but the Google Play is going to be launching podcasting.
10803000	10807000	And so they were accepting shows and I'm like, hooray, another place to list OLR.
10807000	10808000	Sign me up.
10808000	10809000	So we'll be on that.
10809000	10811000	And I got the email back that we got accepted.
10811000	10813000	So we'll be in that whenever it launches.
10813000	10814000	So that's exciting.
10814000	10818000	And if they have reviews, we need five-star reviews there too.
10818000	10820000	I would appreciate it.
10820000	10822000	Not if they're out of ten.
10822000	10823000	Then it should be ten.
10823000	10826000	Yes, if it's ten, then please ten out of ten.
10826000	10829000	Don't leave a five-star review out of ten saying Rob said five stars.
10829000	10830000	You know what I mean.
10830000	10831000	You know what I mean.
10831000	10832000	You're smart people.
10832000	10837000	Now we can go around to everybody's final thought for the night.
10837000	10840000	Shane, you're hereby cordially invited to give your final thought for the night.
10840000	10844000	I need time to think of another one.
10844000	10846000	So come back to me.
10846000	10847000	All right.
10847000	10849000	Dan, your final thought for the night.
10849000	10855000	My thought is I need to take out a loan so I can purchase 90 villager amiibos from a certain Toys R Us.
10855000	10857000	I like you.
10857000	10859000	You come back any time.
10859000	10860000	All right, Mike, your final thought.
10860000	10863000	I really hope I can hit Legend this month in Hearthstone.
10863000	10864000	Good luck to you.
10864000	10865000	God damn it.
10865000	10867000	I want to see you on the stage at BlizzCon someday.
10867000	10873000	Oh, dear God, that would be too much, but got to hit Legend first.
10873000	10874000	Got to hit Legend first.
10874000	10875000	Sounds good.
10875000	10876000	All right, let's see.
10876000	10879000	My final thought for the day is I'm not quitting.
10879000	10880000	I'm just dialing it back.
10880000	10884000	There's a big difference, although, yes, I did use the word quit quite frequently,
10884000	10887000	but we all get frustrated sometimes a little bit.
10887000	10889000	Just because there's so many blues in the area, right?
10889000	10893000	No, it actually has nothing to do with that because actually I like being on the underdog team
10893000	10895000	because you know you're kind of...
10895000	10896000	You're waiting for Pokemon Go.
10896000	10897000	That's what it is.
10897000	10899000	That's actually super true.
10899000	10901000	But anyway, it has nothing to do with that.
10901000	10904000	But anyway, all right, Shane's back with his real final thought.
10904000	10905000	Here it is.
10905000	10910000	I have to go buy a knife apparently to cut Dan with for this weekend.
10910000	10911000	All right.
10911000	10912000	Good luck with that.
10912000	10914000	I'll be his bodyguard.
10914000	10915000	Cut two people.
10915000	10916000	Good luck.
10916000	10917000	He'll cut two people.
10917000	10918000	All right, let's see.
10918000	10920000	Loki, your final thought for the night.
10920000	10921000	All right.
10921000	10924000	So this guy took the portal that I took on the way over here back,
10924000	10926000	but dumbass only left like four resonators on there,
10926000	10929000	so I'm just going to have to spend five seconds to blow it up.
10929000	10933000	Oh, that guy is always around here, and he's...
10933000	10934000	He'll be fine.
10934000	10935000	That's fine.
10935000	10936000	I'll blow it up.
10936000	10937000	Go teach him a lesson.
10937000	10938000	All right.
10938000	10939000	It's more points for me.
10939000	10940000	That's right, more points.
10940000	10941000	That's how you have to look at it.
10941000	10942000	When you're on the underdog team, it's easier to get XP.
10942000	10943000	I just don't care.
10943000	10944000	I don't care.
10944000	10945000	That's right.
10945000	10946000	It's a fucking game, and I don't care.
10946000	10948000	That's what I had to say earlier this week.
10948000	10949000	All right.
10949000	10951000	Last, but certainly not least, dark soccer.
10951000	10955000	Your final thought tonight.
10955000	10956000	How appropriate.
10956000	10961000	What we should do is just drive down to that park down the street and blow that one up.
10961000	10964000	Okay, you got to be careful when you talk about blow...
10964000	10966000	Let's go to the park and blow it up.
10966000	10967000	Blow up some notes.
10967000	10974000	Yes, he means with pew pew imaginary laser beams in an imaginary game that is not real.
10974000	10976000	We need to preface by saying that.
10976000	10977000	All right.
10978000	10979000	Hello, NSA.
10979000	10980000	Yeah, right?
10980000	10981000	Oh, boy.
10981000	10982000	All right.
10982000	10985000	And then Loki's going to be left saying something like this.
10985000	10986000	Oh, wait.
10986000	10987000	Damn it.
10987000	10988000	Oh, wait.
10988000	10989000	Damn it.
10989000	10990000	Yes.
10990000	10991000	That'll be...
10991000	10992000	I miscued the sound clip.
10992000	10993000	Loki would say something like this.
10993000	10994000	God damn.
10994000	10995000	Ow, my foot.
10995000	10996000	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
10996000	10997000	Oh, my God.
10997000	10998000	It hurts so bad.
10998000	10999000	All right.
10999000	11006000	Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11007000	11010000	We will see you next time in seven days to do it all again.
11010000	11012000	Have a great week at gaming, everybody.
11037000	11040000	But you know they were all still true.
11042000	11044000	See you next week.
11066000	11076000	Thanks for watching.
