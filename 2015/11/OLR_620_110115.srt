Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This week, Twitch breathes new life into art with the resurgence of infamous big-haired painter Bob Ross, while new life was also given to some DRM-laden plastic games.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Raise your Bob Ross kappas, zappas, and join us in our happy little Studio N7 on this week's show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 620 for this November the 1st of 2015.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I hope all you guys that celebrated Halloween yesterday had a happy and safe one and are on Candy OD today.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So, you know, you can sit around and eat Snickers bars and play video games and listen to us talk about games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Myself here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, Rob Roberts, joined by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Boar.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How are you?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Um, yeah.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yeah?

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yeah.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm fantastic.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Is that fantastic?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm glad you are.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm glad you're fantastic.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Are you not fantastic?

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't know.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You're so difficult to get emotion out of sometimes.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I know. That's what I do.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you were an NPC in a video game, you'd be the one that you walk up to and you press A and the character pops up and just says dot, dot, dot.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'd be the Tsundere.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Is that what they're called?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I guess.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Alright. Also, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hi.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm doing fine.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So, not that I'm nosy, but I'm totally nosy and I notice you're on the Humble Bundle website right now.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I got like four emails from them and I was like, is there anything good on here?

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Nope.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You are being tempted by Humble Bundles, I thought.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No, I'm not.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not because I don't have the money for it right now and there's something I really want, so.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They still the Capcom Bundle or is that done now?

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's done.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's the Humble Jumbo Bundle 5 now or something like that.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Gotcha.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Doesn't have any games I want.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
At least it's, you know, all charity and all that.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, hell, there's games I didn't even realize that were in my library.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Like, I just saw Command & Conquer Red Alert 3.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm like, wait, I thought I had that like little like teaser thing that they had as part of the EA Bundle, but I don't remember getting the full game, but apparently it's there.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So, somewhere I bought that.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Alright.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't even remember anymore.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We are joined in studio tonight with some special guests, but I do also want to give a shout out to the other ever present fourth guest on our show, the Chat Room.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If you are listening live to our program, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And if you are listening live, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Black Wolf, and you can chat along with the show live, live.vognetwork.com.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And over in chat, Tiger Claw says, we didn't have any trick-or-treaters show up, so we had all the candy to ourselves.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yeah, I noticed like less and less trick-or-treaters are actually out there and it's probably because, you know, people are crazy and, you know.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But actually I found in our neighborhood, Alan actually went out and bought like candy at the dollar store or whatever, so he'd have something to give away.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Because last year he got caught without candy and he answered the door and there were some kids there and he had that awkward moment of uh.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And like luckily we had like an emergency supply of Smarties, because who actually eats Smarties, right?

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So we had an emergency supply as we gave it to the kids.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But this year he was better prepared and we actually had the light on.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Apparently he gave it all away.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And I was like, wow, we had enough kids show up in the neighborhood.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, that reminds me.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah?

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is it candy?

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It must be candy.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Shut up.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yay.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Trick-or-treat.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Smell my feet.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I was gonna say there was always that Japanese candy if you had any more of that left.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Fucking yes.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There's this uh.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She got my favorite.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's the little.

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And clearly she has picked them all out of the bag.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes I did.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She got me the vanilla Tootsie Rolls, which are my favorite.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I picked them out of the bag for you.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yeah.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Actually I picked them out for me and then I decided I wouldn't eat them so that I gave them to you.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now I feel like a true rock star.

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Because, you know, like those uh.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I only want the green M&Ms.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You have to pick out all the green M&Ms from the bag.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They taste different.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's right.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The green ones make you horny.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Uh, let's see.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Go into our chat over at live.vognotework.com.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
ActDeaf says, I want to get Undertale on Steam.

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The soundtrack is pretty good.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You know, I've heard a lot of good things about that game.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I haven't picked it up myself yet, but I hear a lot of comparisons to like Earthbound and that it's like a love letter to video games.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So I'm very curious about it.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I watched a YouTuber play part of it.

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It looked okay.

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, it looked alright.

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll have to check that out.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you want to recommend some games, join our chat room over at live.vognotework.com.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But we do have some friends in studio.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
These are actually some new friends to OLR.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
These guys have not been on the show before.

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
But there's some guys that I've known for a little while.

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So I'm going to let them introduce themselves.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Because I don't know if they want to use their real name on the show.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But first off, joining us tonight we have.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hi, I'm Mike.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hi Mike, how are you?

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm good.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Good.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Make sure when you talk in the mic, get real close to the mic.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Make sweet love to the mic.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Otherwise they can't hear you.

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay.

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You have to practically deep throat the mic.

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You do.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You do.

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You do a little bit.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Should not be that challenging.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Alright.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
How are you doing?

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Doing good.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Good.

126
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Welcome.

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Welcome to the show.

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So you've listened to OLR before.

129
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know what you're getting into, right?

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yeah.

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah.

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And you and I have played Final Fantasy XIV online together before, right?

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes.

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What do you play in XIV?

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm in Ora.

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
A male Ora.

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah.

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The new race.

139
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The Ora.

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, I started up when it came out for Mac.

141
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So I was interested in playing with a controller.

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And the Mac client's not as bad now.

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It was awful at first.

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Gotcha.

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And folks that are listening live, I am trying to get his voice up a little bit.

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So sometimes we have to adjust.

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll talk a little louder.

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Talk a little louder.

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you.

150
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Perfect.

151
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Sounds good.

152
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And in chat they say, Mike sounds just like Shane.

153
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No.

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay.

155
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll spice it up a little.

156
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
There you go.

157
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There you go.

158
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Which is funny because Shane is actually here in the studio.

159
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And it's not like there's this weird like twin identity thing.

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But I don't know if Shane's actually.

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Shane just wants to play on his cell phone tonight.

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
They could do that though.

163
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We'll see.

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'll speak with some excitement.

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There you go.

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
A little more enthusiasm than what Shane usually gives us.

167
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Appreciate it.

168
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
All right.

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What other games do you play besides XIV?

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm pretty much addicted to Hearthstone right now.

171
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Last month I spent pretty much the whole month.

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I took a break from XIV because we're in the lull of waiting for the patch.

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And so I decided to try to push for Legend in Hearthstone.

174
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Which is the top ranks and stuff.

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And I didn't quite make it to my goal.

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But I peaked at rank 4.

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And it's a ladder system.

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So up to rank 1.

179
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
After rank 1 it's a legend pool.

180
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So made it up to rank 4.

181
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And then I don't know what happened.

182
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But slipped all the way back down.

183
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And boo.

184
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now Blizzcon is obviously a pretty big deal in the Hearthstone community.

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And that's happening this weekend.

186
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And I'm kind of bummed out that I don't get to go after all.

187
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Even though I'm a Diablo player.

188
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And I feel like we're getting the short end of the stick.

189
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Or no end of the stick this year at Blizzcon.

190
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But whatever.

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But I know they do a lot of big Hearthstone stuff there.

192
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
With the tournaments and everything.

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Are you going to have your big popcorn watching the Blizzcon at home game?

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Depending on what I'm doing.

195
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll keep up with it.

196
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But otherwise I'll probably be...

197
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If I'm doing something else I'll probably just try to keep up as best I can on my phone or Twitter or whatever.

198
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But looking forward to all the stuff they're going to announce.

199
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Supposedly supposed to be a new expansion or adventure coming out.

200
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So new stuff. Yay.

201
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Nice.

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Is that free still or are they still doing that stupid pay per view bullshit?

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's pay per view but it's all...

204
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh come on.

205
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's not through DirecTV I don't think.

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you Activision. You're awesome.

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Pay per view to view stupid fucking conferences.

208
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You get a digital pet and I think some other things.

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ah fuck them. Seriously.

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If all you want is news, that's what Twitter's for.

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And that's probably what I'll end up doing honestly.

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And if any big moments come up like the red shirt guy asks a question or something, it'll be on YouTube.

213
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
As much as they want to get it taken down. It'll be on YouTube.

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Once it's on the internet you can't take it off, right?

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I know you have some other passions that aren't just video games.

216
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I want to give you a chance to give a cheap plug.

217
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I know you've done some other work with podcasting.

218
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't know if you want to give it a cheap plug here.

219
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, just like talking about sports pretty much.

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't have anything really to plug at the moment because I'm not really tied with anything specifically.

221
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But trying to do something on my own eventually.

222
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
See what I can do with the podcasting actually.

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What sports ball is your favorite sports ball?

224
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I really, really, really love basketball.

225
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Basketball? Then who's your team?

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't have a team. I actually just like watching basketball.

227
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're a free agent right now?

228
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes, pretty much.

229
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I thought you were going to say football.

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm cheap. Just entertain me.

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I know you have a team for football.

232
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, let's not. No, I'm just kidding.

233
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
San Diego, sadly.

234
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Aw, everybody feels sorry for Mike.

235
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Just kidding.

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Whatever.

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But you're from San Diego, so you have to have a little loyalty there, I understand.

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What about sports video games?

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Obviously that's a little...

240
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
We don't usually get into that topic a lot here on OLR.

241
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But do you play them at all?

242
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Do you dabble in that?

243
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Or no, it's just not the same experience for you?

244
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Not at all, because I'd rather...

245
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Usually when it comes to sports, if I'm watching a game,

246
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I really get the itch to actually go out and play, especially basketball.

247
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm like, oh my god, I can't wait to go out and play.

248
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I want to just mess around and imitate some players.

249
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Just mess around. Not even imitate, imitate, but just screw around, basically.

250
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
So when you're there playing video games and one of the parents is yelling,

251
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
why don't you go outside and actually play that game?

252
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're one of those people that will actually go outside and play the game.

253
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Kind of. I was forced to.

254
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I was forced to as a kid to go out and play basketball, and then it ended up sticking.

255
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Alright.

256
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Alright, mom. Thank you.

257
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
There you go.

258
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Also joining us tonight, we have another guest.

259
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Another guy that I've played Final Fantasy XIV with.

260
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He sends a pattern here.

261
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We're having a little free company IRL meetup this weekend.

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Sort of. Mini thing.

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But why don't you introduce yourself?

264
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Hi, I'm Daniel.

265
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Hi, Daniel. How are you?

266
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm doing great.

267
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Great.

268
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I feel that coffee kicking in, so my heart's palpitating right now.

269
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And with you and Michael sharing a mic tonight, this is going to be very interesting,

270
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
because you're much louder, but you're in a good place.

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
How are you? So you play XIV as well.

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes.

273
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's how we sort of know each other.

274
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What do you play in XIV?

275
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I play a...

276
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh, great. I'm going to blank out. What are the cat people called again?

277
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Mikote.

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes, Mikote.

279
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Mythra?

280
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I was thinking Mythra. That's what I was thinking of from XI.

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I mean, really, they're just the same races, but they have to change the names for some stupid reason.

282
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
A Mikote, I think they're called.

283
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yeah.

284
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
A Coyote Mikote.

285
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Mikote.

286
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Now that 3.0's come out, I've been put back to Summoner as my main, which I'm loving.

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
For a while, I was really hating the endgame with the Summoner, so I switched to the Black Mage,

288
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
but now with all the new rotations and everything coming out, I really enjoy Summoner a lot with Heavensward.

289
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Awesome. What other games are you into besides just XIV?

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I also play Hearthstone as well with Michael, and for this last month I haven't played too much,

291
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
but I did end up playing Guacamelee, the Super Turbo Championship Edition.

292
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, yeah. That's a fun game.

293
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah. I've been watching a lot of Let's Plays of Mario Maker, and I don't own a Wii U,

294
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
so I was like, I need to get my platforming fixed somehow.

295
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And I looked through my whole PS4 library, and I happen to have Guacamelee from PlayStation Plus,

296
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
so I was like, hey, let's give this a shot, and it managed to scratch that itch well enough.

297
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Good. But we have a Wii U here at Studio N7, so were you checking out Mario Maker earlier?

298
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I did. I did finally get a chance to play it, and it seems the controls are slippery.

299
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I didn't expect that.

300
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
At least with a lot of the levels I tried were the original Super Mario Brothers-style level,

301
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and I don't know if it's just that particular style, but the controls are a lot more slippery than I remember.

302
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
So I don't know if that's something that they did on purpose, or if that is actually how it was, or if I'm remembering wrong.

303
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Our mind plays interesting tricks on us, but I'm sure some of the physics have changed,

304
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
because obviously, well, and what's funny is that I saw you just before playing Mario Maker,

305
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
you were playing NES Remix, which actually uses the ROMs, and it's the smaller screen.

306
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So in Mario Maker, they had to basically go back and reinvent the wheel, because everything's rendered for widescreen now,

307
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
which, you know, remember folks, Super Mario Brothers was not widescreen.

308
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yeah, and I commented on that.

309
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It was not HD, yeah, so they did have to remake everything, so if the physics are a little different...

310
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And having that Super Mario Brothers graphics, but on a full screen, you're just like, whoa!

311
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah, right?

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Giant.

313
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's a little jarring at first, but I think that's part of the reason, too, that you don't just have World 1-1,

314
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
at least not endorsed by Nintendo, I'm sure it's been done 5,000 times over by Mario level makers,

315
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
but that's why they didn't have an official World 1-1, because people that remember how to do it,

316
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
you know, with their hands tied behind their back and blindfolded, or whatever,

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
With their toes.

318
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Whatever it was Jamie could do on World 8-1 or 8-2, which still blows my mind.

319
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I can't do it anymore, but the whole level was all timing.

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah, but I bet if you were to, you could even go, like, essentially pixel perfect or object perfect in Mario Maker with that same level,

321
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and you would not do it, because just that slight difference in the mechanics when things go to HD.

322
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We talked about this just a little bit last week, we were talking about that Mega Man remake in Unity,

323
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
and how it looks great, but it's probably, if the physics are even slightly different,

324
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the purists are going to have a big problem with it, because I can't speedrun this the way I used to.

325
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, just food for thought. Food for thought.

326
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Let's see, going over to our chatroom over at live.vog.network.com.

327
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
ActDef saying Guacamelee is freaking awesome.

328
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It is. Let's see, USS Rover says just added OLR to list.

329
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Now 194 shows in spreadsheet.

330
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Awesome, well I hope that's a good list, and not like list of shows to send flaming bag of poo to.

331
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I hope that's, of course 194 would be a lot of bags, so no, I appreciate you being here in chat and checking us out.

332
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And VXJ6V, I love this answer in chat over at live.vog.network.com, says,

333
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
My favorite sports ball is Rocket League.

334
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Hell to the yes, that game is awesome.

335
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Mike, can you check out Rocket League? Have you seen Rocket League?

336
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
No, I haven't. I've heard you guys talk about it.

337
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I know what we're doing after the show.

338
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I know you guys have like an hour drive home, but you have to see Rocket League, it's a lot of fun.

339
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's like, it's soccer meets, okay, you just made a face when I said soccer.

340
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Are you one of those guys?

341
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm one of those guys.

342
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay, well try to...

343
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Soccer's like, I don't know, they're just...

344
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You're going to start a fight here on OLR that I don't need.

345
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's fine.

346
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Will you at least do Mega Man soccer? Because Mega Man soccer is rad.

347
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But it's still soccer.

348
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Ah, you're hopeless. Alright, it's soccer meets like Mario Kart.

349
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Which is awesome, I don't know.

350
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I've heard good things about it, so I'll check it out.

351
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I mean, the second I start seeing it as, this is just soccer, it's going to be awful.

352
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Let me break it down into mic terms then. It's soccer if soccer was cool.

353
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
No, I've heard nothing but good things about it, like across from everyone that's on the podcast I listen to.

354
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's been nothing but good things.

355
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So, eh, I want to check it out.

356
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But, the soccer comparison is probably...

357
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How about air hockey?

358
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Sure.

359
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's worlds better than soccer.

360
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
At least people can't flop on air hockey.

361
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Wait, what's that Dan? We can't hear you.

362
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry non-Americans, but I can't do soccer.

363
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Alright, whatever.

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
At least people can't flop on air hockey.

365
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's true, that's true.

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Alright, alright. Let's see.

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Act Deft in our chatroom, who by the way, he's from Mexico, if you guys didn't know, listens to the show.

368
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Act Deft says, why are you laughing at that? Because you know you're about to get some big shit, aren't you?

369
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
He's about to get red.

370
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He's about to get red.

371
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I know what I said.

372
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You are about to get red.

373
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's fine.

374
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The library is open. Here it is.

375
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Act Deft says, soccer is awesome. You're just American and you're built to hate it.

376
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's what I know. I know.

377
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I played soccer for five years when I was a kid. Did you know that?

378
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Sorry.

379
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I played soccer.

380
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Why do you think I'm so skinny?

381
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
For the record, Manchester United all the way.

382
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I like soccer. The views and opinions expressed by that guy...

383
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Are wrong.

384
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Do not reflect those of Orange Line.

385
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I watched soccer before I watched baseball.

386
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Uh oh, uh oh.

387
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No, no, no. Hold on, hold on.

388
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Shane is gonna wreck you.

389
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Let me explain for a second.

390
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's because baseball, like I've tried so hard for like several times to get into baseball.

391
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And I end up flat out falling asleep.

392
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Like during the games on the TV, on TV.

393
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Going to a game is different.

394
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can already see the comments to this episode.

395
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Never invite that guy again.

396
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

397
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Soccer is worlds better.

398
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Somebody's gotta have the opinion that other people don't want to hear.

399
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's what we're about.

400
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I hate all sports. They all fucking suck.

401
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
All of them. Every single one of them.

402
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Especially baseball.

403
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
From fucking ballet to fucking ice hockey to football.

404
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It all fucking sucks.

405
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
There, done.

406
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So what do you do in sports?

407
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What about esports?

408
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You have to get the puck into the cup and then someone vomits.

409
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Is that how sports ball works?

410
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, as long as there's cheerleaders.

411
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Alright, back to video games, people.

412
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Blades of Steel.

413
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes, let's all agree. Blades of Steel is awesome.

414
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Daniel, what else? What's your favorite video game of all time?

415
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I always ask new people this to the show.

416
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What is your favorite video game of all time?

417
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And I'm only taking your first answer.

418
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Final Fantasy IX.

419
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Really? Nine of the whole series?

420
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, VIII has a special place in my heart because that's what I started with.

421
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But IX, I replayed it in 2011 and after really being able to appreciate the writing and the character development in it and the music,

422
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I was just like, nope, this is my favorite. This is it. Got it.

423
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, you sweet, sad summer child.

424
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Wait, am I wrong?

425
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You need to go back and play the classics.

426
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, I think IX is one of the better ones. I will give you that, but it doesn't hold a candle to VI.

427
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
True.

428
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Let me ask this question.

429
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I can't have that opinion yet because I haven't finished VI.

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I know you're a younger guy than me. We were having this conversation about how old you guys were when OLR started earlier and I wanted to cry.

431
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I wanted to fucking cry.

432
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
How old were you when Final Fantasy IX came out?

433
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Oh, god, I remember playing it, but I'm trying to remember the freaking year. What was it, 1999?

434
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
1999 was eight, so nine was...

435
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So 2000 it came out.

436
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
About 2000, 2001, yeah.

437
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay, if it came out in 2000, then I was just going into like sixth grade.

438
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Okay, because I don't know if it was Bobby who said this or somebody else, but it's always your favorite Final Fantasy game is the one that came out when you were 12 years old.

439
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That is going to be your favorite Final Fantasy game, always.

440
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Well, it was my favorite for a long time because I was about that age.

441
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But they were close.

442
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, they were one year apart, really.

443
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And so I feel like after getting older and being able to appreciate some of those more eccentric parts to the storyline and everything, IX kind of won my heart over.

444
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Alright, fair enough, fair enough. No, I like IX.

445
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
IX had that fan service that people wanted to see that VII and VIII didn't have because VII and VIII were so like...

446
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Especially VII was just a radically different setting compared to like IV or V and VI, right?

447
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So IX kind of gave a taste of that classic Final Fantasy.

448
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It began to set the trend that VIII followed and so did X and then you see it again in XIII where it's that futuristic kind of neo-science fantasy that you see in a lot of Final Fantasies now.

449
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That thankfully XIV kind of went backwards a little bit and is incorporating more of the fantasy aspect.

450
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay, fair enough. Mike, since I didn't ask you this same question about favorite video game of all time, what's your answer?

451
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Any of the Metal Gears, except for like Peace Walker.

452
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So any Metal Gear game?

453
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Metal Gear 1, of course, is gonna be my... or Metal Gear Solid 1.

454
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So not Metal Gear NES, but Metal Gear... because I love Metal Gear NES. The truck have started to move.

455
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's one of my favorites.

456
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But you were probably too young. Were you even born yet when that game came out? Probably not.

457
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Probably not.

458
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Snake's Revenge doesn't count.

459
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes, no, Snake's Revenge wasn't a real Metal Gear game anyway.

460
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And Snake Rattle and Roll just was a really weird departure of the series.

461
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Snake Rattle and Roll was like what happened when he took LSD.

462
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So Metal Gear Solid 1, we'll say.

463
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yeah.

464
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And why?

465
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Just holds nostalgia purposes, but I mean I think it was...

466
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh god, I don't want to say how old I was.

467
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Just say it. Fine, I'm over it already.

468
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I was younger than 10 when I started playing it.

469
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And I don't know what it was. I just thought it was super cool.

470
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And then I've gone back and kind of replayed some of the earlier games in the series.

471
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And I've got a better appreciation for the plotline and stuff.

472
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
As convoluted as it is, I'll be the first to tell you.

473
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yeah, it's a clusterfuck and a half.

474
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But if you've stuck with it from one all the way through, it makes a bit more sense.

475
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You can't just jump into four or five and be like...

476
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And really give it a fair judgment because it's like, what is this shit?

477
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Tell me, do you believe love can bloom on a battlefield?

478
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I love that song, Love is a Battlefield.

479
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Thank you, Pat.

480
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And then Jordan Sparks sang about a battlefield too.

481
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh no. I'll take it back three.

482
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Snake Eater was my favorite.

483
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Was it the song? Because the song was pretty great.

484
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It was the music and the fact that you go back and it finally clears up some things that you've been waiting on for a while.

485
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And just the origin of it, basically. It was really, really great.

486
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I remember with that one E3 where they gave away the Snake Eater on vinyl.

487
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Do you know how much that must be worth these days?

488
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I've got two of them.

489
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Oh my god, you should look them up on eBay.

490
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
They're probably worth the money.

491
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
No.

492
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Anyway, out of curiosity, have you played Phantom Pain yet?

493
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I have not. It's on my list to pick up things. I'm always really slow on picking up games.

494
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's fine.

495
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But I played, what was it, the Ground Zeroes?

496
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yeah.

497
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yeah. I played that and that was cool, I guess.

498
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It didn't quite scratch that Metal Gear itch for me, but it's essentially a demo, so you can't ask for too much out of a demo.

499
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
So obviously, if you like Metal Gear, you must be a bit of a Kojima fan, so what do you think about all this fuckery between Kojima and Konami?

500
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Sad face.

501
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I think that's the only way to describe it.

502
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
That's like when your computer crashes in Windows 10.

503
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
They got rid of the blue screen to death, now it literally just puts up a sad face.

504
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm sad. They took a cue out of Apple's playbook. That's what the Mac always did, right? Like a little sad computer.

505
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So they have a little sad face that comes up now.

506
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It was just really shitty to see how that all ended because it's just, especially for me, being a big Metal Gear fan and seeing Kojima's name on all the titles.

507
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's like, man, this guy's done quite a bit with Konami, and then it was just, nah, fuck you.

508
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
They have it all be over.

509
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yeah, it was just like a shitty breakup. It was almost like watching a friend go through a horrible breakup.

510
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It is.

511
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
It's just disgusting and awkward and sad.

512
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Yeah, they ran away from home to join a soccer league.

513
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yes, or a baseball team.

514
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Anyhow, I want to introduce him real fast. He is here in studio. Hand the mic over to Shane. Hi, Shane, how are you?

515
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Hi.

516
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Do you want to say anything about baseball and how Mike's wrong?

517
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I want to go into the other room with this mic so I don't have to be in the same room with him.

518
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
How are you doing this week?

519
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Fine.

520
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
How's Power Rangers toy hunting?

521
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm technically done.

522
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Alright. Congrats.

523
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Thank you.

524
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Good job on that.

525
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
It'll never end, though, for real.

526
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Tell us the latest and greatest in amiibo hunting because you're kind of our amiibo expert here.

527
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
There's no hunting really going on right now. The 3-pack came out today for the fighters and I picked that up and they're not bad looking.

528
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The end.

529
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
The end.

530
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I'm going to be very mean here and spoil a little bit of what I know Loki's going to talk about in the opening here, but I know you love right now this year.

531
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
You talk non-stop about Until Dawn.

532
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Because it's so good. It's the best game this year.

533
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Alright. Well, what did you think when the Sony thing happened this week?

534
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I already heard about that.

535
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Until Dawn in VR.

536
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I heard about that before they announced it and it doesn't look great, but, you know, if it gives them a little more money to make a real game, then that's fine.

537
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Do you think that they just took this existing idea and just slapped Until Dawn's name on it?

538
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Possibly, but I also think Sony made them make this before they found out Until Dawn was actually successful.

539
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Interesting. Is it the same studio doing it?

540
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah.

541
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Huh. Interesting. Did you want to comment on that, Dan?

542
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
No.

543
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Oh, I saw you, like, pointing. Alright.

544
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I think that's a good point.

545
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah. That's a good point. Alright.

546
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Let's see. Anything else to check in on Shane with? Let's see.

547
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I got an epitome, though, also from my non-girlfriend at Toys R Us.

548
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Okay. Can you tell us about your girlfriend at Toys R Us?

549
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
There's this girl that I always talk to at Toys R Us.

550
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And I'm using girlfriend in my quotey fingers.

551
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I even met her.

552
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Yeah. Yeah, Jamie met her.

553
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Completely independently of Shane being there.

554
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Does she listen to OLR? Because if not, you need to go take the show information.

555
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Anyway. Anyway. So there's this girl at Toys R Us that always helps me with Power Rangers and amiibo stuff.

556
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And I always go, because Toys R Us' layout, Power Rangers is really close to amiibo.

557
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So I just head straight back there, look at my Power Rangers, go look at amiibo, and then I'm done.

558
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
And I talk to her a little bit, and she helps me find things.

559
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Like, that's how I found a lot of the stuff that I've been looking for.

560
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And then I guess her coworkers keep asking her if I am her boyfriend, because I always go back there and talk to her.

561
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
So it got me a pit amiibo.

562
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
So there it is.

563
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Best relationship ever.

564
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Shane goes shopping for amiibo so much that Toys R Us employees think he's in a relationship with the girl.

565
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Mostly Power Ranger toys, let's be honest, because amiibo only happened when I couldn't find Power Ranger toys.

566
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
All right. Fair enough. Fair enough.

567
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
All right. Maybe we'll hear from Shane again later in the show. Maybe we won't. I don't know.

568
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
But I do want to talk a little bit here, get into a kickoff topic for tonight.

569
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,000
And I want to talk about, this is interesting because this doesn't really have to do with video gaming, but it totally does.

570
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And if you've been watching your blogs and your social media feed this week,

571
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,000
then I'm sure you have inevitably seen that all your friends are watching on Twitch, Bob Ross.

572
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Yes, that's right. The painter from the 70s is now streaming on Twitch TV, the network dedicated to video games and streaming gameplay.

573
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And you might be wondering, what the hell? Like, what does Bob Ross have to do with video games?

574
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That's what I'm wondering.

575
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Because, well, I know there was supposed to be a Bob Ross game on the Wii like years and years ago, but I think it got canceled.

576
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Like it didn't actually end up happening. I just remember a story on that a long time ago, which would have been awesome.

577
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I just want to preface with this. Bob Ross is fucking rad. And like, when this happened this week, this actually kind of made me giddy.

578
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
I was like, Bob Ross is streaming on Twitch? I'm like, I don't even need to know the reason.

579
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Like, just, it's fine. Just, you know, that's it. Like, I don't need to know. But here is the reason.

580
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
So, Twitch is starting to open up a little more and they released this blog post about Twitch Creative.

581
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Now, Twitch was already running creative streams. And by creative streams meaning people doing artwork, maybe that's game inspired.

582
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
People doing music that's game inspired or just, you know, kind of adjacent.

583
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
It's a really weird gray area because it doesn't have to be about games.

584
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I know they do, like, live podcasts would sometimes stream through Twitch as well.

585
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's a little different. That's considered a gaming talk show. That's not a part of this.

586
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
But that is another, like, non-gaming thing that's there.

587
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
So, let's see. Part of the blog post here.

588
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,000
The Twitch community has included a determined community of artists, crafters, and builders who have been using Twitch to broadcast their creative processes.

589
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
These creative broadcasters share many of the same characteristics as all Twitch broadcasters.

590
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Passion, engagement, and a community-centric world view.

591
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Today we're happy to announce our official support for the Twitch creative community.

592
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
There are a few things that make the creative category unlike anything else on Twitch.

593
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So, we along with our launch partner Adobe are excited to see what you can dream up.

594
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Obviously Adobe, you know, Photoshop, pretty big deal.

595
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And all the other illustrator and all the other tools they make.

596
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So, they have a new landing page for the creative category to highlight specifically creative broadcasts and so forth.

597
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
And then at the end of this they just say, thanks to our friends at Janssen Media and Bob Ross Inc.

598
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We'll broadcast every episode of the original Bob Ross show, The Joy of Painting, in an epic marathon starting at 2 p.m. Pacific.

599
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:02,000
That's 403 episodes of Bob Ross that will play over the course of 8.5 days.

600
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And there's a special Bob Ross Kappa emote, too.

601
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So, the Bob Ross tie-in is to celebrate, basically.

602
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I mean, even though Twitch already had this creative side, now we're embracing it and taking the next step with it.

603
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Which is so interesting to me because Twitch started as a spinoff of Justin TV, which was more about life casting and so forth.

604
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
But I would have expected that most of this stuff, if Justin TV was still around, would be on Justin TV.

605
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So, it's almost like they're bringing back a little piece of that.

606
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Because there's nothing that says that the music, the art, and all this stuff you do has to be games, necessarily.

607
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I could be drawing, I don't know, the Golden Girls tattoo I'm going to get for my birthday.

608
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And that would be art, right?

609
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
But I guess because I'm still a gamer in the gaming community, it counts.

610
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
But I mean, I'm not slamming it by any means. I think it's really cool.

611
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And I know, DarkSakura, you're a creative individual.

612
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Because then I say, and I'm not, but these sorts of things I know are things that you have done.

613
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You've done broadcasting of art and so forth.

614
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:18,000
When I was doing all that Mass Effect artwork, like just the Let Me Draw Your Shepherd thing was going on.

615
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I think I did like 24 different femsheps.

616
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And I streamed almost all of the artwork I did, either on Twitch or livestream when I moved to livestream.

617
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Because livestream I thought was a little bit better for that audience.

618
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Well yeah, and I think you hit the nail on the head what Twitch is trying to say.

619
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Is they're basically, they're literally rolling out the red carpet saying, you are welcome here with this.

620
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:54,000
It was easier streaming on Twitch. Livestream was kind of not exactly easy, but Twitch was super easy.

621
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,000
So I would be more than happy to go back and do the next artwork if I ever have time to do it on Twitch.

622
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I actually didn't even know Twitch had stuff other than games.

623
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I mean that's just me not really exploring Twitch.

624
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Because for the most part all I've been doing is watching people play Hearthstone.

625
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Or watch the tournaments and stuff like that.

626
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Because Blizzard doesn't do too many tournaments throughout the year.

627
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So it's a bunch of other people doing their own League Championships and all that other jazz.

628
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But that's pretty cool.

629
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I think it's probably a lot easier to get into that than what YouTube is trying to do.

630
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Trying to get into the streaming with the gaming thing.

631
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because trying to get people to switch from Twitch where it seems really easy and everybody's already invested in it.

632
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:57,000
It's going to be a lot harder for them to do that than people wanting to get into streaming creative stuff.

633
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Like the drawings and all that other stuff.

634
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And what you just said I think hits the nail on the head of why I think this move on Twitch is part.

635
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And I've been critical of Twitch in the past when necessary.

636
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I've been complimentary of Twitch in the past when necessary.

637
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I think this move that they did with the Bob Ross stream is genius.

638
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It just shows that they're not just gaming and that, hey by the way you can do other things on here as opposed to...

639
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
It got your attention.

640
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Like what the hell is Bob Ross, who is awesome by the way, doing on Twitch TV?

641
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That's the reaction I think every person's having this week, right?

642
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So I don't know. Shane, you're shaking your head. You don't agree?

643
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I gotta hear this. I gotta hear this.

644
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Why are you shaking your head no over there?

645
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Because I watch a lot of Twitch. Let's get that out of the way.

646
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's more entertaining than Netflix and Hulu most of the time.

647
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But good on them for opening it up. I don't want to watch Bob Ross.

648
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I guess you don't have to.

649
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But Bob Ross is awesome.

650
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
That's why I'm shaking my head too. I just don't care about him.

651
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I think Bob Ross is awesome.

652
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Here's why I think the Bob Ross stuff is awesome.

653
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Why did live streaming, and this is again why I use that word genius.

654
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,000
And I don't know if this is one of those idiot savant things where they didn't even know how genius this was and they signed the deal.

655
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But I'm gonna tell you why this is genius.

656
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Why is live streaming of video games popular in the first place?

657
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Because I like watching Until Dawn. That's why.

658
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
What made live streaming break through? Anybody in the room.

659
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What was the game and why did live streaming really break through?

660
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Wouldn't it have been like League of Legends or Dota in that instance?

661
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I would say that's kind of like one half of the coin, but there's another big half of the coin.

662
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
What's the other game?

663
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Anybody. Anybody.

664
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Anybody. It's got the word craft in it.

665
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Warcraft.

666
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Minecraft.

667
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Minecraft.

668
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Crafty craft.

669
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Minecraft is one of the big reasons.

670
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Craft cheese.

671
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Why streaming is popular.

672
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And you may not totally agree with what I'm saying, but hear me out here.

673
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Why do people watch Minecraft streams?

674
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Because they're on drugs.

675
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Shane says because they're on drugs.

676
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Well, it's the same reason you sit and play it for mindless hours of doing nothing.

677
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Creating. You're creating, right?

678
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I destroy.

679
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
How many times were we seeing news posts on game blogs?

680
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Somebody made a video game sprite in Minecraft.

681
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Somebody made this amazing roller coaster in Minecraft.

682
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Somebody created this whole little universe.

683
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Somebody recreated Disneyland in Minecraft.

684
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And it was like, you see all these things that people painted in Minecraft.

685
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Minecraft was the canvas.

686
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
That's why the Bob Ross tie-in is genius.

687
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Because it's so, everything that Bob Ross says in a lot of these things, in his art and about expression,

688
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
applies to these creative gaming streams like Minecraft, I think.

689
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I don't know.

690
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Again, maybe I'm giving it too much credit.

691
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,000
But that was kind of what I saw in it, where I was like, wow, that is a really subtly awesome connection.

692
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Not bad for a former drill sergeant.

693
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Was Bob Ross a drill sergeant?

694
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Yep.

695
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Get out.

696
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Also, the fro was all branding.

697
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Oh, I'm sure.

698
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
He apparently hated it.

699
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Oh, really?

700
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Yep.

701
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But the hair was recognizable.

702
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And if you want to see something funny, you should see the guy he replaced on The Joy of Painting.

703
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Something Alexander.

704
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
This kind of bitter German guy.

705
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It was really funny.

706
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Gotcha.

707
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Doesn't sound very joyous.

708
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
No.

709
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
All right.

710
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Well, going back to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

711
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
actdef says, I haven't seen Bob Ross' stream.

712
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
It's just twitch.tv slash bobross, and I think the marathon should be going for another couple days.

713
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
So, after tonight's show, you can go check that out for a little bit.

714
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But do remember, it's a 1970s TV show, so don't expect it to be like, you know, but this was the stuff.

715
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I remember from when I was a kid, because if I got up really, really early on a Saturday,

716
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
this is what was on before like square one television and the stuff I was really trying to watch was Bob Ross.

717
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Bob Ross, for me, I forever associate him with watching Doctor Who in the early 80s.

718
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Got it.

719
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I watch both of them on PBS like the same, you know.

720
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And Jason in our chat, vxjasonxv, our announcer says, what Twitch's creative program means is also partnering creative broadcasters.

721
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
A few friends of mine I met in September have already been partnered since this program started.

722
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So, that's an important little footnote too is that now Twitch is actually partnering with some of those groups as well.

723
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I thought they already had some partnerships with like, you know, celebrities like Darude was obviously the big like kind of tongue-in-cheek one.

724
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Doesn't Skrillex have a stream on there? Am I crazy? I thought that was a thing.

725
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,000
There was some other electronic musician who had a random stream on there that would do random stuff.

726
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Maybe I'm blurring the lines here a little bit. I apologize.

727
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
A Minecraft stream?

728
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Maybe, maybe.

729
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:22,000
No, I'm thinking, not Skrillex, I'm thinking of, what's his name, Deadmau5.

730
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
That's it. It's Deadmau5, not Skrillex.

731
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That makes sense.

732
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
My bad.

733
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Caijuto in chat says, Bob Ross was on until the 90s, so it's not just 70s stuff.

734
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah, but I don't think a single thing changed on that set in the 20 years the show was on.

735
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So, yes, it was on in the 90s, but it was still the same damn show they were making in the 70s.

736
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Alright.

737
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Anyhow, there it is.

738
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Bob Ross on Twitch, and again, I gotta hand it to him.

739
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You know, credit where credit is due.

740
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
That was a great move to bring exposure to this side of things.

741
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Alright, we're going to start off now after our kickoff topic, getting into our gaming weeks

742
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

743
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So, let's go around the room real quick and check out what games have you been playing this week?

744
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Darzaka.

745
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer, because it's cool.

746
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
You can design their yards and pick the house.

747
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,000
And I had to design a schoolroom because Isabel told me to.

748
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I love Isabel.

749
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
And it's just really fun.

750
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
And it's not like you have to do it every day, like all the stuff in Animal Crossing.

751
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You can just do it as you want to, and it's not on the clock like that.

752
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So, it's really fun.

753
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I've played a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition because I have new mods.

754
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Because it's you.

755
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Shut up.

756
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I say that with love.

757
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Girl.

758
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Also, Dan and I are going through Super Metroid.

759
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
He has learned that he hates playing it with the Wii U controller.

760
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
So, we're using our Wii Classic controller.

761
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And we just beat Ridley before the show.

762
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
And we're trying to get the last reserve tank.

763
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
We have all the E tanks and all the stuff.

764
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
So, we're going to get the last reserve tank and then go after Mother Brain to Torian.

765
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Awesome. Well, good luck.

766
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Well, it's Dan playing, so it'll be fine.

767
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I suck at Super Metroid.

768
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Aren't you still there guiding him through?

769
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Surely, I know you and Dan, and you're sitting there telling him what to do.

770
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I know that's the case.

771
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
We've actually discovered a trope.

772
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
I guide him onto spikes.

773
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm like, no, you're going the wrong way.

774
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I go down, so he'll just jump and land on spikes.

775
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I'm like, husband.

776
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
So, finally, I led him into this one room.

777
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And lo and behold, there are spikes.

778
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And it's the room on the wrecked ship where you jump on the Chozo statue.

779
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And it carries you down through the spikes and into the ground.

780
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Yes, I remember that.

781
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And Dan's like, we did this.

782
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
We did this.

783
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I was like, yeah, but did you see that there's a pipe leading under the Chozo statue?

784
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Oh, so, yeah, we're playing together.

785
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
We're playing together.

786
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Good.

787
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And so, next we are going to be doing...

788
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Crap, what was the one?

789
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Not Zero Mission, because that was the first one.

790
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
The one that was on Game Boy Advance.

791
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Oh, God.

792
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion.

793
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Metroid Fusion.

794
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
So, we're going to be, I think, doing that one next.

795
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I know Prime was GameCube, but I know they came out at the same time.

796
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
And you know the whole Prime trilogy is on the Wii U store for like 20 bucks.

797
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Not bad.

798
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Although, we already have three and haven't touched it.

799
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
But, yeah, that's going to be next.

800
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
And then we're going to be doing Earthbound Zero.

801
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Nice.

802
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
So, we bought that right quick.

803
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Great.

804
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Sounds like you've had a fun week.

805
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

806
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I didn't play a whole lot because I was working on my costume.

807
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But I did play a little bit of Minecraft Windows 10 Edition.

808
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
And, I don't know.

809
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I keep playing it, but there's like no point to it, it seems like.

810
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I just, I don't know.

811
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
The survival is super easy.

812
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And I just don't feel motivated to do anything in it.

813
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's definitely a lot more fun with other people.

814
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I'm actually thinking about going back to the PC version to play with all the mods on there.

815
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
But, it runs so well in Windows 10.

816
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I was like, why can't you just add mods to this one?

817
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Because this client runs so much better than your other one.

818
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
But no, they don't want mods on this one, so it's fucking annoying.

819
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
So I did that, and then I played a little bit of Ingress.

820
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:39,000
And, I reinstalled Burnout Paradise, the box thing or whatever.

821
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Because I thought I had it on my PC, but I don't.

822
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And I want to play some more of that.

823
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And then, apparently I have Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, which I was unaware of.

824
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So, I'll try that too.

825
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Also, I think I downloaded it on Origin for Command & Conquer Red Alert 2, because that's free.

826
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I'll double check that.

827
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That's it.

828
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Alright. Fair enough.

829
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
My Gaming Week.

830
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
We had a conversation on last week's show about Minecraft, Windows 10 edition.

831
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I actually did install that and get it all up and running after last week's show.

832
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
So I was playing that for a little bit.

833
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I was enjoying it.

834
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,000
It's interesting how you get achievements in that game that are actually tied to your Xbox gamer score.

835
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Which I realize is a thing in Windows 10, but it's just kind of weird how that works now.

836
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
The achievements are on your PC and your Xbox 360.

837
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It kind of annoys me though that they don't have the interface like the Xbox 360 one.

838
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Where if you have the parts, it shows you what you can make.

839
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah, that I don't like.

840
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
That I don't like.

841
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I guess that's kind of the point you're supposed to discover recipes and stuff.

842
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
No one fucking does that. They just look up that shit on the internet.

843
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
No one does that.

844
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It's easy. Game facts on the second monitor.

845
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Alright. Let's see. Other stuff I played this week.

846
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Honestly, more stuff I've talked about before.

847
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
More Diablo 3. More Final Fantasy XIV.

848
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,000
So really as far as new stuff, I only did some demos.

849
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So I'm just going to talk really quick.

850
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Because I don't like to give full impression on games based on demos.

851
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
But you know we all do it.

852
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So Guitar Hero Live.

853
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I played one of the in-store demos.

854
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And I actually thought it was kind of rad.

855
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
It's kind of different than the music games from a few years ago.

856
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Just in its formula where now you have the buttons for down and the buttons for up.

857
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Or sometimes you push them at the same time or whatever.

858
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And the full motion video I thought was kind of funny.

859
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Even though it's so 1990s with the video that changes depending on how well you're doing.

860
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,000
But the attention to detail and the filming and all the extras and stuff is done so well.

861
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I was actually laughing and I was enjoying failing a song.

862
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Because the reactions that people have are so funny.

863
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Like the camera will pan down and it shows the audience.

864
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
And there'll be a girl who's looking up really blankly at you.

865
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And then she'll just stick her tongue out at you.

866
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And I don't know why but that just made me die laughing.

867
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It was so funny.

868
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
And then just the expression on the drummer's face.

869
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Like, dude, what are you doing?

870
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
It's so hilarious.

871
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So yeah, I just thought it was more interesting to look at than the characters we've been used to in music games for a while.

872
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
So Alan Alchemy also putting out a chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

873
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
It's in HD and it's obvious it had good production values.

874
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Full motion video stuff in the 90s was cheap, cheap, cheap.

875
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Yeah, no, this had some good production values to it.

876
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
So I gotta give credit where credit's due.

877
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I'm very enticed by the fact that they have this whole MTV side of things.

878
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Where you can basically play along to an MTV style network.

879
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And it's like we're bringing MTV back.

880
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Now it's like GHTV or whatever.

881
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
It's very interesting to me.

882
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:49,000
But then I think, God, I have to spend $80 on another plastic guitar when I just bought Rock Band 4.

883
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I don't know.

884
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You know, Shane tried though.

885
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Shane tried really hard to get me to get...

886
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
I did not try really hard.

887
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Wait, hand him the mic here real quick.

888
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You kept saying...

889
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I didn't try hard at all. That was my passive trying.

890
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You said, and I quote,

891
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Look Rob, here's that Guitar Hero game you're gonna go home with.

892
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
No, no, but that's passively.

893
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
This is the Guitar Hero you're looking for.

894
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
You will buy this Guitar Hero.

895
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And then you were so proud you said that you deserved a medal.

896
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I was like, well, it's in the Guitar Hero box. You have to go back and get it.

897
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Anyway, so there was that.

898
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
The other demo I played this week was Yo-kai Watch on the 3DS.

899
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And Shane's shaking his head because he knows we disagree on this.

900
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I think Shane did two battles and said this is stupid.

901
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Yup.

902
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But I thought it was a lot of fun.

903
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Here's the thing, I get why the battle system in Yo-kai Watch is different.

904
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Because it's not like, you know, fight, magic, run type of thing.

905
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
You know, press A to do whatever.

906
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
But the characters auto attack.

907
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And what you do is that you have this wheel of six characters.

908
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,000
So you have a line of, you know, three that are in the front and three that are in the back.

909
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
So the three in the front are consistently attacking.

910
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And they build up their little meters and they can do a super move.

911
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
So then you can tap your little thing to do a super move.

912
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,000
And you play like a WarioWare style game for five seconds to do like a big attack of some sort.

913
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
And then if they get knocked out, you cycle them to the back row.

914
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And then you can do like a WarioWare style game to revive them.

915
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
And I don't know, I thought it was kind of fast paced and different.

916
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Like a WarioWare battle style system. I thought it was kind of cool.

917
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So, I don't know. I don't know why Shane didn't like it.

918
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I just thought the demo was too short. That was my only problem with it.

919
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But it interested me enough to get the full game.

920
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So I probably will get Yo-kai Watch when it comes out.

921
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
So, there you go. That was the other game I played this week.

922
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Let's go to our guest this week. Who has the microphone?

923
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Alright, Dan, do you want to tell us about your gaming week?

924
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Sure. I was, you know, played Hearthstone a bit.

925
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Tried to do that for a little bit.

926
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Nothing as serious as Michael's been trying to do.

927
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
But just my own little thing.

928
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:05,000
I did log on to Final Fantasy XIV after being off and on very sporadically throughout the month.

929
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Because of the Halloween event, which is fantastic.

930
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Anyone listening who hasn't done that event yet but has a subscription needs to tune in and do that.

931
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Because that broom mount that you can get at the end of the event is magical.

932
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And I want everyone to have it.

933
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I love that mount too.

934
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
But, you know, if you're too lazy to log in, they'll probably sell it for $5 in the store after the holiday's over.

935
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
But it won't be until next year.

936
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Because that seems to be the trend they're doing.

937
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Is they'll wait until the next year's holiday before they release it on the store.

938
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So you've got 365 days where you can brag that you got that mount and everyone else can just cry.

939
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Alright. Is that it? Final Fantasy XIV?

940
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Well, if we're going back further in the month, we did play Until Dawn.

941
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Both myself, Michael, and our friend Aaron, who you know.

942
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The listeners don't, so it's alright.

943
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
There's another guy that you don't know.

944
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Yes, another guy that no one else knows.

945
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
We did play Until Dawn over the weekend.

946
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And it was a lot of fun.

947
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I mean, we love those 90s horrible horror movies.

948
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I love Nightmare on Elm Street.

949
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
And for some reason, this month...

950
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That wasn't the 90s. It was the 80s.

951
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Well, Scream. That's what I'm thinking.

952
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm thinking Scream was 90s. Yeah, Nightmare on Elm Street was 80s.

953
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
But still, love those kind of horror slasher fics.

954
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Until Dawn was a great way to kind of reinvigorate that.

955
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
And I actually ended up watching a lot of horror movies following that.

956
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Because it kind of just spurred us on.

957
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And it's very heavy rain.

958
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Very, very similar to heavy rain.

959
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
In terms of how you make the decisions and everything.

960
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
But it's a lot of fun.

961
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Especially to play that with friends who are also into horror movies.

962
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
And really bad tropes and everything.

963
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Sorry, I love this comment in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

964
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Tigerclaw says,

965
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Scream were horror movies for hipsters.

966
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Isn't your Twitter handle gaming hipster?

967
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It is. It is.

968
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
So, you got me.

969
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I'm not going to try to get out of that one.

970
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
But what's funny though is that even though I don't usually like horror movies.

971
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Gore is what I have a big problem with. I don't like that stuff.

972
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
But I thought the Scream movies were funny.

973
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
They're supposed to be.

974
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I like that they were tongue in cheek.

975
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
So it made it more entertaining.

976
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah, it's supposed to be a satire. So that's what's hilarious about it.

977
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Yeah. Alright, cool.

978
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I bet Shane's very happy to hear that you have a lot of Until Dawn timing under your belt.

979
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:41,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Undrated with vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, CAMEL.

980
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Alright, how about you, Mike? What have you been up to? How was your gaming week?

981
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Let's see, I played...

982
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Don't forget that mic.

983
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Like I said, I played a lot of...

984
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Real close.

985
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I know.

986
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I played a lot of Hearthstone this week.

987
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
This month, really.

988
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Actually logged into 14 for the first time all month.

989
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Like two days ago.

990
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
To get that, yeah.

991
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:07,000
For that broom mount and all that fabulous Halloween gear.

992
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It was awesome.

993
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
And promptly dyed it because that purple was hideous.

994
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Other than that, I just decided to brush off some old games on my phone.

995
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I started playing, or tried to replay some Sword and Sorcery, Monument Valley.

996
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Those are some pretty good, beautiful games.

997
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
I'm the gaming hipster.

998
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Sorry, I found them on the App Store.

999
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Like, just one day.

1000
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And I was like, ooh, let's try this.

1001
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Monument Valley is really gorgeous, and everyone should play that one.

1002
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I forgot to mention, I actually played Hearthstone for the first time in probably like a year today,

1003
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
thanks to your guys' influence.

1004
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Because you were like, oh, you should check it out.

1005
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
And then I actually beat Dan, which I wasn't expecting to happen.

1006
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
So I don't know if he just let me win to boost my ego a little bit.

1007
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
He didn't let you win, but you guys played with similar level decks.

1008
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
I see.

1009
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
So it was a fair fight.

1010
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yeah, it was a fair fight.

1011
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
So it wasn't like a deck he built or anything like that.

1012
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Fair enough.

1013
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Well, I might have to play a little more.

1014
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So that was good.

1015
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Proud of you.

1016
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Thank you.

1017
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Thank you.

1018
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
All right.

1019
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Well, I think that's going to do it.

1020
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Unless Shane wants to jump in with his gaming week, but I'm thinking, I don't know.

1021
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Shane, what do you want to say about your gaming week?

1022
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Do I not play video games?

1023
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Why were you going to skip me?

1024
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
That's really rude.

1025
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,000
I don't know if you want to.

1026
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Really rude.

1027
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Fine.

1028
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Well, how was your game?

1029
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I want an apology first.

1030
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Shane, I am so sorry that you don't like candy corn.

1031
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
How was your game week?

1032
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I played 14 for the first time in months and months and months.

1033
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
And then got yourself locked out.

1034
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Then I got myself locked out because I had to get a new phone and I attached my authenticator.

1035
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,000
But when I got back, my Pokemon shuffle data, which is very important, was not on my phone.

1036
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
So I restored it from a backup and that put a different authenticator on.

1037
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So now I'm locked out, which is funny.

1038
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
But I got my Pokemon shuffle data back because I play that all the time.

1039
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah.

1040
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Priorities for sure.

1041
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It's not hard to fix it though.

1042
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
What?

1043
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Your authenticator stuff.

1044
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Oh, I have to contact Square.

1045
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I never had to do that.

1046
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
I don't have the recovery key because I've had like three different ones now.

1047
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Oh, fun.

1048
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:38,000
And I played and am in the process of playing the download case for the Ace Attorney game on 3DS because I hadn't done it yet.

1049
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
And I've been watching a guy stream the entire series and it made me want to go back and play.

1050
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And I'm having such a blast.

1051
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Your defendant that you're defending is an Orca.

1052
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
It's amazing.

1053
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Wow.

1054
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Yes.

1055
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
It's so good.

1056
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
It's so good.

1057
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
All right.

1058
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
No one till dawn this week?

1059
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I watched people play it and then one guy got really mad because on Twitch they were telling him what to do.

1060
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And he stopped playing for like ten minutes and went off on his chat room and was like, you're boring.

1061
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I just want to see people happen.

1062
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Why are you streaming your game?

1063
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Why are you streaming your game if that's the reaction you're going to have?

1064
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Don't stream your fucking game.

1065
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I don't know.

1066
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
You should ask him.

1067
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I'm sorry.

1068
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I find that really gross.

1069
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
I don't know.

1070
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Anyway.

1071
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Yeah.

1072
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Just don't look at your chat room.

1073
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It's weird.

1074
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Weird, weird, weird.

1075
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
All right.

1076
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Anyhow, anything else, Shane?

1077
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I gave the mic away.

1078
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
You are accordingly invited to share the rest of your week.

1079
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
All right.

1080
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You gave the mic away.

1081
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
All right.

1082
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Let's get into some housekeeping for this week.

1083
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:43,000
And I don't have a whole lot to say except now that we're in November, I will say that we are not going to have a show the week of Thanksgiving here in the States.

1084
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So we will not be having a show on Sunday the, I think it's the 29th?

1085
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
That's my hubby's birthday.

1086
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Yep.

1087
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I think just with Thanksgiving.

1088
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Which is an important holiday.

1089
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I think some people might go out of town and stuff and I doubt many of our listeners will be around either.

1090
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So we just won't be here that weekend.

1091
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
So I have the best idea because Dan's going to turn 40.

1092
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Oh yeah.

1093
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Wow.

1094
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I'm going to get him a bunch of 40s.

1095
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,000
You should.

1096
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
He's going to drink a 40 when he turns 40 because that's so meta.

1097
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Yo dog.

1098
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I heard you like 40s.

1099
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
So here's a 40 while you're turning 40.

1100
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I like it.

1101
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
There you go.

1102
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Great.

1103
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,000
40 40s.

1104
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
All right.

1105
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So yeah.

1106
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So we will not be here that week, but we'll remind you as that gets a little bit closer here.

1107
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Otherwise follow us on Twitter.

1108
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Twitter dot com slash o l r.

1109
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
We're also on Facebook.

1110
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Facebook dot com slash Orange launch radio.

1111
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Also very important.

1112
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
One of our friends shows.

1113
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
One of our friendly shows.

1114
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Another network show here at the voice network celebrating a big milestone this week.

1115
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
So I want to give a big congratulations to Girls Gone Wow.

1116
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And Raven and EJ over at Girls Gone Wow hit 200 episodes.

1117
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
They recorded it today.

1118
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Y'all at VOG will hear that on Wednesday.

1119
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And how apropro that this week is BlizzCon.

1120
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I don't know how they timed that so perfectly, but they did.

1121
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And I thought it was really cute because Raven and EJ were like taking selfies together today and putting it on Twitter.

1122
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And I don't think they're usually in the same place when they record, but they kind of came together for their 200th episode.

1123
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So if you have even a passing interest in World of Warcraft, I really urge you to go visit the gals over at Girls Gone Wow in celebration of their 200th episode.

1124
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,000
And big congratulations to everybody that's involved with that show now, has been involved with that show in the past.

1125
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
And just able to keep a topic about one game for so long going.

1126
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I couldn't do it.

1127
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I tried. We couldn't do it.

1128
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Good job ladies. You did something we couldn't do.

1129
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So there it is.

1130
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Thank gosh there's this general gaming show where we can always change and talk about whatever we want.

1131
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Because that's how we made it as far as we did.

1132
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
In all seriousness, big congratulations to Girls Gone Wow. 200 episodes.

1133
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Okay, let's get into this week's gaming news.

1134
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
We'll start off with Loki.

1135
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Yeah, so they have this big Sony Paris event where they announced a bunch of shit.

1136
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Mostly just kind of updates on things that have already been announced.

1137
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,000
So for example, they talked a little bit about Uncharted 4, like it's going to have multiplayer now.

1138
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Which I kind of have to say, wow that's news.

1139
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
I mean, kind of figured that it would have multiplayer. Most games do now, even if it's shoehorned in there.

1140
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But it does.

1141
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
A release date for No Man's Sky, tentatively.

1142
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It's supposed to be June 2016.

1143
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Yay, another game for 2016 that I thought we were getting this year. Joy.

1144
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Well, whatever, it's fine. I'll wait longer.

1145
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,000
They will have explained the game by that point, right? No, I'm kidding. I know they've done a better job of that recently.

1146
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I'm interested, I'm interested.

1147
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:57,000
New quadratic dream game was Detroit Become Human, I guess.

1148
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Or Carrot in Detroit.

1149
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
So it's kind of, I don't know, a quadratic dream game, I guess.

1150
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Lots of fangasms over that.

1151
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
David Cage, yeah.

1152
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Shane's nodding his head over there.

1153
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I love Quantic Dream, they're the best.

1154
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And that Detroit trailer I've watched so many times, I'm so pumped up for that game.

1155
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I want it like last month, or the month before.

1156
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Here's the question I always ask, why?

1157
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Because it looks like, I don't care what people say about Quantic Dream games.

1158
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Like, oh, you know the writing's not good, the voice acting's not good, whatever.

1159
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I love Indigo Prophecy, I love Heavy Rain, I love Beyond Two Souls.

1160
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:45,000
The storytelling I actually like, and they're always like, the stories are really good, and this one doesn't look like it's not gonna be good also.

1161
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
You know what it really is? It's because he likes Until Dawn.

1162
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I think he likes Quick Time Events. He is a huge fan, huge boner for Quick Time Events.

1163
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I don't like Quick Time Events so much, but I always think, even with the crap that happened at the end of Indigo Prophecy,

1164
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
and basically all of the games always have really bad endings for some reason,

1165
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
they're so good, and I can just sit there and play them all the way through.

1166
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I can't think of a Quantic Dream game I didn't just sit down and play from start to finish.

1167
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Because I did that with all three of their other games.

1168
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Alrighty then. And I can't believe it's been like, how many years?

1169
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Like when they showed that first demo of, was it Carrow? That was 2012 I guess.

1170
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Yeah, but that was, I think that was before Beyond Two Souls, and it was just supposed to be like,

1171
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
because they do little tech demos to show off their stuff.

1172
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Like the old guy.

1173
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Yeah, like the wizard in the studio that was just like a TV set or something.

1174
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:56,000
But I don't think, even at the time I thought that Android robot thing demo was going to amount to anything.

1175
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
But I'm glad it did, because even the trailer tugged at my heart a little bit. It was really good.

1176
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Some other things that they announced, they talked a little bit more about, was it the Horizon Zero Dawn,

1177
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
which looks pretty awesome, they showed some more gameplay from that, still looking pretty cool.

1178
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So I definitely want to check that out whenever the hell that comes out, probably 2016 at this point.

1179
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
2017, who knows.

1180
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Gravity Rush 2 is supposed to be coming out over here, as well as the remaster for Playstation 4.

1181
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
So that's pretty cool.

1182
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
They showed off a little bit more of Dreams, which is that new media molecule game,

1183
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
which I still don't have any fucking clue what the fuck you're supposed to be doing in that,

1184
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
but whatever, it's going to be kind of creative and shit.

1185
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
So that'll be coming out.

1186
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Drive Club is getting bikes, so if you're still interested in that game, cool.

1187
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,000
They'll be having some motorcycle content soon.

1188
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Let's see here, also Gran Turismo Sport.

1189
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So they're going to be doing a new racing game in typical Gran Turismo fashion.

1190
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It'll be coming out someday, because they're going to be working on it until it's right.

1191
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So we'll just wait a little longer for that.

1192
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:12,000
They have this Minecraft-looking thing called Boundless that was shown off.

1193
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,000
It's like a mythical Minecraft thing with these different portals that could take you to other worlds and stuff.

1194
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
So that'll look kind of neat.

1195
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:23,000
No real details on that, though.

1196
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And then they were showing off some VR stuff as well.

1197
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I like the whole Battlezone reboot.

1198
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That looked pretty sweet.

1199
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
So they've got that from Rebellion.

1200
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,000
They are talking about Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, which is going to be another VR game.

1201
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Riggs, which was the one that they showed off at E3.

1202
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Or was it Tokyo Game Show? One of those.

1203
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:50,000
And then they have this game Robinson, The Journey, which is from Crytek.

1204
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So all different things.

1205
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Still no mention of when the fuck we should expect PlayStation VR.

1206
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
So 2016, I guess.

1207
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Hadn't they quoted the 2016 timeframe previously, though?

1208
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I think, well, everything's kind of VR for 2016, but I don't know if it's early 2016 or holiday 2016.

1209
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I kind of feel like if they haven't dated it now, I know they spoke about early 2016 before,

1210
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
but I really just feel like it's going to be holiday at this point.

1211
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
They're going to keep it in their pants until the holiday, and then they'll have something to blow all over Christmas.

1212
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Maybe to see what the NX is, and then kind of combat that.

1213
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Maybe, but there's a lot of buzz that NX is basically a Wii U with a detachable gamepad that you can take wherever.

1214
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So I don't know how true or to what extent that ends up being.

1215
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Well, the other thing I would think is releasing the latter half of the year anyways would be a good idea,

1216
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
because you're going to have at least people releasing stuff for Oculus when that comes out, I think in the beginning of 2016.

1217
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,000
And then there'll be more content that can be ported over to PlayStation VR,

1218
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,000
so it'd make more sense to have a platform with more content available instead of,

1219
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
oh, here's a few games, and all right, let's wait until some more stuff comes out. I don't know.

1220
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
All right. Anything else to share from Sony Paris Games Week?

1221
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,000
They had a game called Vector that's a rhythm game. That looked pretty cool.

1222
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It's with a collaboration of an artist, Avicii.

1223
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Funny you mentioned that, because that was actually what I was about to mention,

1224
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:25,000
was that particular game that, yeah, Avicii is collaborating for this PlayStation 4 game, Vector.

1225
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:31,000
And they have this whole little preview video for it, but it looks like they have a very social kind of edge to this,

1226
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
because you can actually design your own levels and then play against other people's levels.

1227
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
So I'm assuming it's kind of like the thing where you can kind of make your own music tracks,

1228
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
and then other people can actually play those tracks.

1229
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
That's pretty cool.

1230
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So I guess it's like Mario Maker with music, and Avicii just kind of is there.

1231
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And then, last thing I want to add, they have a release date now for Street Fighter V,

1232
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,000
which is supposed to be February 16th, and they announced Dalzim.

1233
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
That seems kind of early in the year for such a huge game, but I guess...

1234
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
No, they've been releasing a lot of fighting games around that time, in fact.

1235
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I mean, there's got to be something out for people to use their Christmas gift certificates on, right?

1236
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
February gets a little busier in March. It's pretty good. I don't know.

1237
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
I guess that's true. That's true.

1238
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Dark Sakura, next. I think we might have touched on this a little bit last week,

1239
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
but we have some clarity on this, what you're about to talk about now.

1240
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yeah, so Batman Arkham Knight is supposed to be...

1241
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Well, it was pretty disappointing, for lack of a better description.

1242
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I mean, so bad that Steam was offering refunds right away.

1243
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I'm sure we recall that, right?

1244
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:46,000
So, they actually have relaunched Arkham Knight, and had a bunch of free goodies.

1245
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:58,000
So, anyone who purchased the PC version before 11.59 Pacific Time on November 16th, 2015,

1246
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
will receive free digital copies of the entire series.

1247
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:06,000
So, that's going to be Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition,

1248
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Arkham City Game of the Year Edition, Batman Arkham Origins, and Blackgate.

1249
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
So, you will be getting all of these goodies in your Steam library.

1250
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
And there will also be the Community Challenge Pack, but that's coming out in January,

1251
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
and no one knows what it is.

1252
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
And WB is working with Valve for a Team Fortress 2 cross-promotion,

1253
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:31,000
so that they're going to be doing Batman-themed items for Team Fortress 2.

1254
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
And Valve will pick the best one and, I guess, put them in the game.

1255
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So, however, as far as what is said, for the relaunch, there are no improvements from the patch back in September,

1256
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
other than adding support for add-on and season pass content.

1257
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Oh, that's important, of course.

1258
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
It might be.

1259
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,000
I forget fixing the game, but hey, as long as you can buy DLC, we're happy.

1260
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
As long as you can spend more money.

1261
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
However, the game's really not going to be getting any better.

1262
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
So, get your money back while you can while Steam is offering refunds.

1263
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Let's be clear, everybody. The game's not going to be better. It's just going to work.

1264
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,000
So, this whole thing has really tarnished what otherwise has been such a fantastic series.

1265
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
It's just kind of depressing.

1266
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
You know what would have made the game infinitely better already?

1267
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Less Batmobile.

1268
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Less remote-controlled Batmobile.

1269
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,000
That is true.

1270
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
That was, like, the worst.

1271
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah.

1272
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Alright.

1273
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Well, let's move on. Loki, some big news from another company this week, right?

1274
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Yes. Nintendo's finally announced what their successor to Club Nintendo will be, which is my Nintendo.

1275
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
And my Nintendo's kind of a move towards an account-based system.

1276
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,000
They're going to allow you to be able to create new logins for this and be able to tie it with your social media accounts.

1277
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Right now, they don't really have a system to tie your purchases to your actual account.

1278
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
It's really just tied to your consoles.

1279
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:15,000
So, it kind of makes it a little bit difficult if your console breaks or if you buy a new 3DS or something like that and you want to transfer your content.

1280
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
It's a big convoluted system to do that.

1281
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:25,000
So, hopefully, this will kind of allow for better connection between your consoles that you own and be able to transfer that content.

1282
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Or, hey, maybe even, you know, those games where you purchase one version of the game, you get the other version of the game for free or something like that.

1283
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
So, that would be kind of nice.

1284
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,000
And then, along with that, they also announced their first mobile game, which is called Miitomo.

1285
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
And what is Miitomo?

1286
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Well, it's some weird fucking game that looks...

1287
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:52,000
It kind of reminds me, like, what's the one that came out back in June where you had all the Miis doing shit?

1288
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Tomodachi Life?

1289
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Yeah, Tomodachi Life.

1290
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
With that same kind of root word in it?

1291
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Yeah, pretty much.

1292
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:04,000
So, interesting, because I think a lot of people were expecting, you know, Mario, maybe not so much Pokemon.

1293
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Because if you think about it, Pokemon is technically with another company that just works very closely with Nintendo.

1294
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Or Zelda, you know, one of the big franchises.

1295
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
They're just going to keep shoving Miis down your throat until you accept it.

1296
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Well, I'm willing to suspend disbelief a little bit and see what it really is.

1297
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Because I didn't want them to just make Mario Brothers on the phone.

1298
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Because the phone does not have a tangible controller.

1299
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So, I think they need to do something maybe a little different.

1300
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
So, I'm open to this.

1301
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
I mean, it's way too early to judge it.

1302
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
We don't know what it is.

1303
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
But, Dan, do you have any thoughts on Miitomo?

1304
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Yeah, I mean, because Nintendo's known to be very protective of the brands and all of their, you know, Mario, Kirby and everything.

1305
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:51,000
I don't think that their first dip into the mobile market would be something with one of their biggest IPs.

1306
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,000
They'd want to play with something like Miis, which, you know, if it ends up flopping, then...

1307
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
That's okay, because it's just you.

1308
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Yeah, it's just you.

1309
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
You're the horrible person.

1310
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
This is your fault that the game did that.

1311
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Not our fault.

1312
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Exactly.

1313
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
It's your fault. You're ugly.

1314
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
They should have just done, like, Nintendogs.

1315
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Actually, that would have been cute.

1316
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
That would be brilliant.

1317
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
That would be so smart if they went with that.

1318
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I'm just saying, I mean, imagine all the fucking microtransactions you could have for all the, like, pet accessories and shit.

1319
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:28,000
That's really not a bad idea for a mobile phone type game from Nintendo is to really expand on the Nintendogs plus cats.

1320
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Let's not forget cats.

1321
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Even though the cat owns you.

1322
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:39,000
And, you know, they could probably make a pretty penny off of, like, dippy accessories and things to dress your doggies with, because...

1323
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Or even breeds. Like, you want dalmatians? $4.99.

1324
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Yeah, exactly. Throw all your money at the street.

1325
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Yes, all your money. Just throw it.

1326
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I wouldn't be surprised if that's something in the pipeline for later on.

1327
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
It's been a while.

1328
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Yeah.

1329
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
And DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1330
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
It looks like a social app more than anything else.

1331
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
At least there are four more games after that to see what else Nintendo and DNA have in store.

1332
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
They're probably testing to see how this does and will go from there.

1333
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
So, yeah, I think this probably is a little bit of a test.

1334
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,000
But it also looks like it's not just a platformer.

1335
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,000
So that means, you know, there's probably going to be something a little more to it.

1336
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
And I'm kind of curious to see where Nintendo goes with this social element.

1337
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Because I know I've been somewhat critical of Nintendo's online presence in the past.

1338
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
But this seems to be something that could really kind of break those walls down a little bit.

1339
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,000
So it's a little exciting. I have reserved caution about this.

1340
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
But that's all I can really think of for now, because it's way too early.

1341
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Do you know if it's going to have any functionality with the My Nintendo thing that they're launching?

1342
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
They're supposed to have some sort of functionality with it, but they really go into detail.

1343
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
They didn't say a lot. They had this whole press conference to basically say,

1344
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,000
So, our mobile phone game that y'all have been waiting for is going to be delayed.

1345
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Thank you for coming.

1346
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Please understand.

1347
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Please understand. Thank you very much. Have a good night.

1348
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So, oh yeah, okay, here's some slides to hold you over.

1349
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
So it was kind of interesting. And then their stock kind of went...

1350
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
You know, because people were expecting that game to come out this year.

1351
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,000
But, you know, stock is stock. It'll recover.

1352
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I wouldn't read too much into it.

1353
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:23,000
But at the same time, God, some of the Nintendo apologists were out in force on the social media talking about,

1354
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
It's okay, Nintendo, you know, they can do it.

1355
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And I'm just kind of like, alright, look, can we just say Nintendo is having kind of a mediocre holiday?

1356
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
They've got one huge game, Super Mario Maker.

1357
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I mean, in props, it's probably going to be one of the greatest games of the year.

1358
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Hope you like tennis.

1359
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:47,000
You know, it's not really where they should have been here in 2015.

1360
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:52,000
But they can still, like, the stock can come up. 2016 can be a big year for Nintendo.

1361
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
It could be a big year. We'll release all of our great games in 2016.

1362
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Then 2016, we'll announce all those great games to push to 2017.

1363
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And 2017, yeah, you get where it's happening here.

1364
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Crackdown, are you ever going to come out? Seriously?

1365
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
You have me waiting until 2015.

1366
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
I'm not buying your system until it comes out.

1367
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
And probably even at that point, we probably won't even see the need to that.

1368
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Alright, well let's move on and talk a little bit about another series.

1369
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
And I know this is a series that's very popular with some people here in the room.

1370
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
But it's going to be taking a very different turn.

1371
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
The first footage was shown from the next Five Nights at Freddy's game.

1372
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,000
But it's not, like, Five Nights at Freddy's 5. No, no, no.

1373
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
It's going to be Five Nights at Freddy's World.

1374
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
And you probably heard that they were going the direction of Scott Cawthon,

1375
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
who creates the game, is going a different direction with it,

1376
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,000
where it's more of a, like, cutesy RPG.

1377
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
And, yeah, when you see it, it is more of a cutesy RPG.

1378
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Pretty much every character that's ever been even obscurely referenced in a previous game,

1379
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
and then some, are teased to be in the game.

1380
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Also, it will be out for PC, iOS, Android.

1381
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
And there will be a demo for the game, they're saying.

1382
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
And it looks kind of like a classic sort of JRPG Super Nintendo type game.

1383
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:15,000
So, there you go. I'm curious what our Five Nights fans...

1384
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:19,000
It was stupidly cute.

1385
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Yeah. No, we got to keep it moving.

1386
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I'm going to play it.

1387
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Shayne, what were your thoughts of the trailer that you saw?

1388
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
It's adorable.

1389
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Yeah?

1390
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Mangle at the end with a little ball and paddle is so cute.

1391
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
But isn't Five Nights supposed to be scary?

1392
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Well, sometimes.

1393
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Do you think there will be jump scares?

1394
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Do you think it's going to be, like, one of those, like, twisted things,

1395
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
where at the end everybody goes to hell or something, you know?

1396
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
That would be okay. That would be fun.

1397
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I just want the movie to come out.

1398
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
The Inevitable Movie.

1399
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Yeah. I thought they already said that they sold the rights to that.

1400
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I feel like they did sell the rights, yeah.

1401
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
We'll see.

1402
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.

1403
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Oh, wait. Dan, did you want to say something on this?

1404
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I just wanted to say, this guy is known for messing with his fans

1405
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
for Five Nights at Freddy's.

1406
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Like, he loves to play tricks on his fans

1407
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
and put all these little hints into all of his stuff.

1408
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
So I'm not going to be surprised at all if this comes out.

1409
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
And it starts out as cutesy in the beginning,

1410
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
and then it takes a really dark turn, like, halfway through.

1411
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
But then maybe the joke will be it stays cute the entire time.

1412
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
You know, we had you on edge the whole time.

1413
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I don't know. I don't know. Who knows?

1414
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.

1415
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I was in charge of, like, a Hatoful Boyfriend reboot.

1416
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I'd play it.

1417
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
So, um, this isn't the first time in Nintendo's long history

1418
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
that they have censored content for Western audiences.

1419
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
There is more censorship on its way.

1420
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Actually, for Xenoblade Chronicles X,

1421
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
they already showed in the European release

1422
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
that this, uh, actually a couple of, like, very, like,

1423
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
uh, bikini outfits, very skin-oriented,

1424
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,000
have been changed to, like, weird bikini tops with shorts.

1425
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Um, and I think that part of it was just because

1426
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
they're for younger characters.

1427
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
But still, uh, I don't know.

1428
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Nintendo's been doing this for a while.

1429
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Um, they also did the same thing, um,

1430
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
with, uh, Fatal Frame Maiden of Blackwater

1431
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
when that came out. So, it's not surprising.

1432
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It's fine for the Xenoblade Chronicles game

1433
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
because that character is 13.

1434
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
So do you need to see her in a skimpy bathing suit?

1435
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Because if you do, you're a pedophile.

1436
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Why don't you have a seat over here?

1437
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
What? Are you a pedophile?

1438
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
No! Why didn't you ever see the To Catch a Predator series

1439
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
where the guy goes, why don't you take a seat over there?

1440
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,000
No.

1441
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I'm sorry you didn't get me.

1442
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
But that's not how you did it.

1443
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
You're like, why don't you take a seat right here?

1444
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
I thought you was talking.

1445
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Then I will, I will say this.

1446
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,000
If you think that the outfit is unnecessary in a video game,

1447
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,000
then you need to be also petitioning, uh,

1448
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
major clothing chains to stop providing

1449
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
bikinis for young children starting

1450
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
three years old and up.

1451
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Just saying.

1452
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
They make bikinis for toddlers.

1453
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
But if we don't have that, then we don't get a new season

1454
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
of toddlers and tiaras.

1455
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
So we need that to happen.

1456
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It is a complex question.

1457
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
But, then would you say that that, by the same token,

1458
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
would also lead to pedophilia?

1459
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Oh, I'm sure it does.

1460
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
I saw an episode of Always Sunny in Philadelphia about that.

1461
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Okay, this is going to a dark place,

1462
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
so we're going to keep them moving on to a new topic.

1463
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Hey, I'm just pointing out some double standards here.

1464
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
We're going to travel around the world and check out some

1465
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
release dates and find some things coming.

1466
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I need release from this episode.

1467
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
A lot sooner than a new season of toddlers and tiaras.

1468
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Loki, US.

1469
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Yes, we're getting into the thick of it now.

1470
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
So, we've got Need for Speed coming out.

1471
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

1472
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Also, Snoopy's Grand Adventure on 3DS and Wii U.

1473
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Air Conflict Pacific Carriers on PlayStation 4.

1474
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
The Jackbox Party Pack coming out on PlayStation 3,

1475
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360.

1476
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
That's been out, or is this like a disc release?

1477
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
It's a disc release.

1478
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Totally forgot to mention during our gaming week that

1479
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
we did do some Quiplash and Fibbage yesterday.

1480
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Good times.

1481
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
That's always a...

1482
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Man, they do such good party game work over there.

1483
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And Game of the Year contender,

1484
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Barbie and Her Sister's Puppy Rescue,

1485
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:38,000
also coming out on PlayStation 3, 3DS, Wii U, and Xbox 360.

1486
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Shane, have you reserved your copy?

1487
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I think he, I don't know.

1488
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Did he reserve his copy?

1489
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Hopefully.

1490
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Barbie and the Puppy Rescue.

1491
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I love puppies.

1492
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I would rescue puppies with Barbie.

1493
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
There you go.

1494
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
But no, I didn't reserve my copy.

1495
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
All right.

1496
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
We've got Shovel Knight, the disc version,

1497
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,000
coming out on Wii U, 3DS, and it looks like PlayStation 4.

1498
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,000
They're doing like a re-release of some of the old Ninja Turtles

1499
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
games on 3DS.

1500
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Master Splinter's Training Pack.

1501
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
It's just old shit.

1502
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Evolve Ultimate Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1503
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Yes, that's the old DLC included edition.

1504
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Same with Lords of the Fallen Complete Edition.

1505
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
That's also coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360.

1506
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1507
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Tiny Troopers Joint Ops on PlayStation 4.

1508
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
World Poker Championship on PlayStation 4.

1509
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And then finally on Friday, because god dammit,

1510
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I hate companies that have to release everything

1511
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
on different days of the week, but Call of Duty Black Ops 3

1512
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4,

1513
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Xbox One, and PC.

1514
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
That's somewhat of a big deal.

1515
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Somewhat of a big deal.

1516
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,000
For retailers, yeah.

1517
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
And then Yokai Watch also coming out on 3DS.

1518
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Boom.

1519
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Yay, I'm going to be buying that one.

1520
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
And then I'm going to tell Shane how awesome it is.

1521
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
And then PlayStation 4 is also getting Awesome Knots Assemble

1522
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
on the disc version of that.

1523
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Wait, Darsakha, you want to interject something there

1524
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
at our screening match?

1525
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
No, that's why I shook my head before.

1526
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Oh.

1527
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And then, hold on.

1528
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Still not done yet, because we got to release shit.

1529
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Oh, wait, no.

1530
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Yeah, one on the weekend, so Skylander Supercharger

1531
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Starter Pack is getting a release for iPad.

1532
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
That's it.

1533
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,000
All right, let's head over to Japan

1534
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
and check out the releases over there.

1535
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Fairy Fencer F, Advent Dark Force,

1536
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
is out on the PlayStation 4 this week

1537
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
in regular and limited edition.

1538
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
And LEGO Jurassic World also getting its release

1539
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
in Japan this week.

1540
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And a game getting a price reduction from Sega.

1541
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Ryu Ga Gotoku Isshin gets a new price version out this week.

1542
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Traveling over to the Wii U.

1543
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
LEGO Jurassic World is out on the Wii U this week as well.

1544
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Hey, it's a game release on the Wii U.

1545
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Everybody, pay attention.

1546
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
On the Vita this week,

1547
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
To Love Ryu, Trouble Darkness, True Princess,

1548
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
comes out in regular and limited edition on the Vita.

1549
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,000
And all I can say is there are girls holding hands on the cover,

1550
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
and I don't know, Jamie may take issue with that.

1551
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I don't know.

1552
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
But it looks like some type of...

1553
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I don't even know if it's a dating sim or what.

1554
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Whatever.

1555
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Yeah, that's pretty much what I have to say about it, too.

1556
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
How about the 3DS?

1557
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Looking over on the 3DS real quick

1558
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
to see what's releasing there.

1559
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
We have Disney Magic Castle,

1560
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
My Happy Life 2,

1561
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
as well as LEGO Jurassic World,

1562
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,000
and Seikaiju no Miku 4,

1563
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Denshu no Kyojin,

1564
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
and that gets a price reduction.

1565
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
That is from Atlus.

1566
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I'm curious what this Disney Magic Castle,

1567
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
My Happy Life 2 game is.

1568
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
And it looks like you actually get to exist

1569
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
with your little Mii with Disney characters.

1570
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And that actually looks super cute.

1571
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
That's kind of adorable.

1572
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
I don't know, I think I might actually play that.

1573
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
I mean, I can't understand the Japanese,

1574
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
but it looks super...

1575
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Oh, look, the three little pigs are in it.

1576
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
It's kind of cute.

1577
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I don't know, I might have to get that one.

1578
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I'm sure they have it over here under a different name.

1579
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Disney Games.

1580
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Pretty universal.

1581
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
It's Disney Buy Our Stuff edition.

1582
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Of course.

1583
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
How about Europe, DarkSaga?

1584
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Some stuff's coming out.

1585
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
That's all you need to know.

1586
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
No, on the second, we have Sonic Lost World for PC.

1587
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And on the sixth, we have Call of Duty Black Ops 3 for Xbox 360,

1588
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,000
PlayStation 3, PS4, Xbox One, blah, blah, blah, PC,

1589
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,000
a need for speed on all the same blah, blah, blah systems,

1590
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:29,000
and the Peanuts movie Snoopy's Grand Adventure on everything else,

1591
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
and the major blah, blah, blah systems.

1592
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I don't know if it's just my brain or something,

1593
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,000
but I swear to God, you just said Peanuts.

1594
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
I heard that too.

1595
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I heard that too.

1596
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,000
But you all are hellbound, all of you going to hell.

1597
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
I heard Peanuts.

1598
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
You know what? Hell doesn't exist in my religion.

1599
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Fair enough.

1600
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
All right.

1601
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
By the way, it's being clarified for us in chat.

1602
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Act Def says, it's the Disney magical world game

1603
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
that was like Disney's Animal Crossing.

1604
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
I remember that from a couple of years ago.

1605
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Why do I not own this?

1606
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
That's a very good question.

1607
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Why don't you own it?

1608
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
BRB going to Target.

1609
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
I don't know if you can find it now.

1610
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
You know what? BRB going to Amazon right now.

1611
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
All right.

1612
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Meanwhile, we have a couple more stories for you guys,

1613
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
and then the classic game of the week,

1614
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
and it's a real good one this week, but I'm being biased.

1615
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,000
All right, Loki.

1616
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Oh my God, it's totally time to jump in on that Kinect action.

1617
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Yes, you can get a brand new Kinect for $50 cheaper.

1618
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
That's right, for a limited time.

1619
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Microsoft is taking that integral part of the Xbox One,

1620
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,000
and they're reducing its price by $50.

1621
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
I think now to what, $100?

1622
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Yeah, $100 maybe?

1623
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Yes, $100.

1624
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,000
And you can play all these wonderful games on it.

1625
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,000
And yeah, it's a limited time offer though.

1626
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
So that integral piece of the Xbox One

1627
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
can continue to be ignored.

1628
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Yes.

1629
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Mike, you want to say something on this?

1630
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
That thing cost $150 fucking dollars.

1631
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Are you shitting me?

1632
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Yeah, as standalone it did.

1633
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
$150.

1634
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Oh my God.

1635
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Oh my God.

1636
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
It came with Dance Central.

1637
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
It's $30 on Amazon.

1638
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Uh-oh.

1639
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Yeah, but it came with Dance Central,

1640
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,000
the fucking Xbox Live game,

1641
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,000
not like a disc-based game that had a lot of songs in it.

1642
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,000
It was the piecemeal buy-all-of-our-DLC game.

1643
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I know.

1644
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
$150 for your Xbox to keep tabs on you.

1645
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Yeah, to listen in on you and shit.

1646
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
That's...

1647
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Oh, come on.

1648
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Come on.

1649
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Come on.

1650
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
But you can play such wonderful games like...

1651
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
If I want pizza, I will text Domino's the emoji.

1652
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Like Zoo Tycoon, or Kinect Sports Rivals,

1653
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
or Rapids Invasion, or Fantasia.

1654
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Here's the reality.

1655
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I'm happy the Kinect is lower priced,

1656
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
where it's now in line of where it was on the 360.

1657
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
That's good news.

1658
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,000
What's not so good news is I still don't understand

1659
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
why I need one.

1660
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Yeah, exactly.

1661
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
What games are they releasing that are Kinect games,

1662
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
that are Kinect games that are coming out?

1663
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
I will give it this.

1664
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I really want to play that Fantasia game.

1665
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
But I'm like, it's one game.

1666
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
You know what I mean?

1667
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,000
The only Fantasia game I want to play has to have Fantasia in it.

1668
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I think this one does.

1669
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
As in, not the movie, but Fantasia.

1670
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Does the Xbox have any streaming, built-in streaming?

1671
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Oh yeah, and you can use X to for streams.

1672
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,000
Well, don't they have the Xbox 360 version?

1673
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Don't you have the Kinect for 360?

1674
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Yeah, I have the Kinect for 360.

1675
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Get that on 360, then.

1676
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:35,000
Maybe I will. I don't know.

1677
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So, by the way, an Xbox One might be happening at my house.

1678
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Finally.

1679
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Hey.

1680
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
It goes down with Forza.

1681
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Well, there you go.

1682
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Forza's a pretty good game.

1683
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
I will say this, though.

1684
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
I do own a PlayStation camera.

1685
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I will say that.

1686
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
And it's just about equally as useless.

1687
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Yeah, I bought one to do live streaming with.

1688
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Outside of that, it's also fucking useless.

1689
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
And that's why I don't want to make the same mistake twice.

1690
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Yeah, that's what I was about to say.

1691
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I know for sure that the PlayStation has streaming built-in.

1692
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
And at least you can make the excuse of,

1693
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
if you're going to get the camera, and you intend on streaming your shit,

1694
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
that it at least serves some purpose.

1695
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:18,000
But I don't know anything really about Xbox, because I'm a Sony fanboy.

1696
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Playroom was fun, and that was free.

1697
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
So that was kind of cool.

1698
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Although some of the best games on it don't actually use the camera.

1699
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,000
So I'm not really sure why they're on Playroom, but, you know, okay.

1700
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
All right.

1701
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
SHU100Matt in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com,

1702
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
pointing out that Just Dance, that series,

1703
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,000
they don't require the Kinect anymore either.

1704
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,000
You can use your mobile device camera.

1705
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
And that's the way a lot of these peripheral games are going.

1706
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:49,000
SingStar on Sony, you don't need the mics anymore.

1707
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Use an iPhone app.

1708
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
There's an app for that.

1709
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
And that's where a lot of, you know, if they can build a controller into the phone,

1710
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,000
you know, Jackbox Party Pack, we've talked a lot about on this show,

1711
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
because, you know, we had Jackbox games on a couple weeks ago.

1712
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
The phones are an integral part of those games.

1713
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
That's how you control them.

1714
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:12,000
For Android, at least, you can stream to Twitch from your phone now.

1715
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
You can, with the new Twitch app.

1716
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Which, you know, that's kind of one of the bummers right now

1717
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:19,000
about the locked ecosystem of Apple.

1718
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Some people can look up your nostrils when you play Hearthstone,

1719
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
or whatever the hell you're going to be playing.

1720
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
They don't need to see that.

1721
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
They do not need to see that.

1722
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
All right.

1723
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Well, it's only fair we take a moment, you know,

1724
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
to be a little critical of something in Sony's world too,

1725
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
because this is one of those things where we kind of keep looking at this going.

1726
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
This just doesn't make sense.

1727
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And so apparently what happened this week,

1728
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yoshida was doing like a Q&A on Twitter,

1729
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
answering some different questions.

1730
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
And one of the questions that was asked was,

1731
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
when are we going to be able to change our PlayStation Network names?

1732
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
You know, this is something that's been asked for for a long time.

1733
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Can we change our PSN names?

1734
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And the response that came back was,

1735
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
we're not sure if we can do it.

1736
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
We don't know if we can ever do it.

1737
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:07,000
And, yeah, that has a lot of people kind of going,

1738
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Why?

1739
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Why?

1740
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:13,000
What's the, like, it's really a technical challenge to say,

1741
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
like, if A, it's now B, like a search and replace,

1742
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
which is in the most basic word processing is not,

1743
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I mean, I don't, again, I don't do the tech stuff as well,

1744
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
that I would make games and not talk about them if I, you know,

1745
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:31,000
was more tech savvy, but I just can't fathom why this is such a stinking challenge.

1746
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
But they're changing their answer.

1747
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,000
That's what irritates me so much.

1748
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Their previous excuse was that they didn't want people to abuse the system

1749
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
and change their user tags so that they could continue to harass people

1750
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
that previously blocked them.

1751
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Now it seems like they're shifting their position.

1752
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
So it's like, okay, why wasn't this your answer in the first place?

1753
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Oh, my God, Dan, do you mean that sometimes in the industry,

1754
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:58,000
companies make things up about some sort of what consumers want

1755
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
to hide a technical challenge?

1756
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Oh, my, that, lying in my industry?

1757
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Oh, my, never, never.

1758
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,000
No, I know, I know.

1759
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Cover-ups in gaming?

1760
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Do you wish to take the technical challenge?

1761
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Yes, Mark Summers, I will.

1762
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Double dare.

1763
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,000
It just, it pisses me off so much because I don't know,

1764
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:29,000
my PSN name is from way back in 2011, and by God, I wish I could change it.

1765
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:35,000
And it just, it's frustrating to see them shimmy like this.

1766
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:39,000
I don't know why now they're coming out with this,

1767
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
and I don't understand it either.

1768
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
But as a reminder, PlayStation Plus is available for just, you know, this,

1769
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,000
now I'm going for a low blow, but I just, it is one of those weird things.

1770
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,000
You kind of have to wonder, like, obviously the technical challenge

1771
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
dates all the way back to when they first implemented it,

1772
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
or it would not be going on this long.

1773
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
So I don't know.

1774
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
We had issues with the calendar one time that rendered the system

1775
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
kind of stupid for a little bit.

1776
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Well, maybe they'll be able to do something in the PlayStation 5.

1777
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Or they'll just come out with a new network like Nintendo's doing.

1778
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Oh, well, you know, we're going to throw away PlayStation Network

1779
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
and come out with something new, or you can actually change your name

1780
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,000
and all these other features too. Who knows? Who knows?

1781
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:31,000
But guess what? The best part about that is you get to buy all your apps again.

1782
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Fuck you guys.

1783
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Except I don't know that's the case.

1784
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,000
All right. I can see them.

1785
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Well, we have no way to tie those old purchases to this new console.

1786
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,000
And you're fucked.

1787
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Well, let's take a trip down memory lane.

1788
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:48,000
You know what? We need to go back to a time when you didn't sign into your console.

1789
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Do you know how you said hello to your console?

1790
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
You blew on the cartridge and then blew inside the Nintendo

1791
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,000
hoping that the two would connect and miraculously work.

1792
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
We're going to take a step.

1793
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
That was the technical challenge was that the cartridges would just stop

1794
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
fucking working at some point.

1795
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
We're going to take a step into Dark Sakura's gaming vault

1796
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
where she's going to find a game and she says,

1797
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Hey, you ungrateful little shits.

1798
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I just made that up. I don't know if she does say that.

1799
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:20,000
But you should play this video game right now, Dark Sakura.

1800
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:24,000
What is it? What is the classic game of the week?

1801
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Did you not see where I said play the sound first?

1802
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Let's get to it.

1803
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Let people guess.

1804
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
How can you not know this? How do you not know it?

1805
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
It's because you talk over it, Rob.

1806
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
The game is Metroid.

1807
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
No shit.

1808
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Hell, I've done Super Metroid, but I've not done Metroid.

1809
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Hearts.

1810
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
It needed to be done.

1811
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
It was the first of a long line of Metroid games

1812
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
and arguably the second best.

1813
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,000
It was co-developed by Nintendo's Research and Development 1 Division

1814
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
and Intelligent Systems and came out for the Famicom Disk System

1815
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
on August 6, 1986, and for the Nintendo Entertainment System

1816
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:17,000
in North America, August 1987, and in Europe, January 1988.

1817
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
It had a re-release for Game Boy Advance in 2004

1818
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
and Wii Virtual Console in 2007.

1819
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:33,000
It was also produced by the late Gunpei Yokoi, who we lost tragically,

1820
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:38,000
also by Okada Satoru and Sakamoto Yoshio,

1821
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:41,000
and the music was done by Tanaka Hirokazu,

1822
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:47,000
which is some of the best video game music ever of the 8-bit era, so to say.

1823
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
So basically, you land on the planet Zebes

1824
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:57,000
and you play as Samus Aran, who tries to go basically retrieving the Metroids.

1825
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
They were stolen by space pirates who were big lizard people.

1826
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Damn you, pirates!

1827
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Yeah.

1828
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:08,000
And it's basically just an exploration game.

1829
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
It's a very difficult exploration game in some places.

1830
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,000
You know, it requires on different tricks and things,

1831
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
some things invented by just people playing the game normally

1832
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
that ended up making it into being required pieces of,

1833
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,000
required skill sets, I should say, for the later Metroid games.

1834
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,000
And it's in a power-ranked Metroid as number 11 on their list of best video games.

1835
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Not high enough.

1836
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Game Informer listed, it is number 7, and then it was 69th by EGM.

1837
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,000
What does EGM know?

1838
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Nothing.

1839
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Nothing.

1840
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Clearly.

1841
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,000
We sure say some ballsy things on this show sometimes that we have no business saying.

1842
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
We have all the business saying.

1843
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:02,000
So the neat thing about this game is that really your path to exploration

1844
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,000
is gained not just by the act of exploration,

1845
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,000
but by the certain tools and weapons that you pick up on the way.

1846
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
You start off with a very weak power beam and all you can do is jump.

1847
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
You immediately get the morph ball, which, um,

1848
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,000
I mean basically you can't play the game without the morph ball anyway.

1849
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,000
It's like, uh, how do I get into this really low thing?

1850
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Uh, if only there were a way I could turn into a little ball and roll under it.

1851
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Yeah.

1852
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
So, um, other power-ups that you get, you can drop bombs as the morph ball,

1853
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
which you can also learn how to do the bomb jump,

1854
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:43,000
which was a way to get sneakily into some other places in the game.

1855
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Um, you could get the, uh, the screw attack, which is basically like,

1856
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I'm invincible, bitches.

1857
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Get out of the way.

1858
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Screw it.

1859
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Screw you, screw you, screw you, and especially screw you.

1860
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
I could just imagine Samus saying that.

1861
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Um, and so you get, you know, like the freeze beam and rockets and all kinds of shit.

1862
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:12,000
So, um, this game also introduced us to some of the, uh,

1863
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,000
most hardcore of enemies, including, uh, Kraid and Ridley,

1864
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,000
because there's a guy at my work.

1865
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Ridley for Smash Bros.

1866
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:28,000
There was a guy at work who had like a huge perler of Ridley,

1867
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Super Metroid Ridley.

1868
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I was like, I have to make that.

1869
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I think when you get into the perler bead thing,

1870
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
which every gamer does at some point in their life,

1871
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
you're like required to make a Metroid sprite.

1872
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Like it's just, you have to.

1873
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
You know the first one I made was though.

1874
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
What's that?

1875
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
The Guardian Legend.

1876
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I made the Guardian.

1877
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,000
Of course.

1878
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Because the Guardian Legend is the best Nintendo game of all time.

1879
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
I would say Metroid inspired the Guardian a little bit.

1880
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Didn't it come out earlier than Metroid?

1881
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Um, I don't think so.

1882
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Okay, field time for me.

1883
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Guardic did, but the original Guardian Legend, which would be Guardic 2,

1884
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
wouldn't have come out.

1885
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Guardic Gaiden came out in 1988.

1886
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
So, you're right.

1887
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Okay, but Guardic.

1888
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
My favorite words in the Ingress language.

1889
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,000
Shut up.

1890
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
But Guardic came out in 1986.

1891
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
So, anyway.

1892
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Guardic Gaiden was fun.

1893
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Anyway, so basically it's really just going around.

1894
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
He finally, finally, finally reached the Mother Brain,

1895
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
who was also the main bad guy of Captain and the Game Master.

1896
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
And we forget that that series existed because it was mega bad.

1897
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Mega bad.

1898
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Anyway, so after you destroy Mother Brain, you get a bomb set for 999 seconds,

1899
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
and you have to escape and fly away with the little Metroid baby.

1900
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
The last Metroid is in captivity.

1901
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
The galaxy is at peace.

1902
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Not for long, bitches.

1903
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
So, anyway.

1904
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:06,000
This was basically green-lighted because of all of the games that had just been so successful for Nintendo,

1905
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,000
including here goes Donkey Kong from 81, Ice Climber in 85, Super Mario Bros.,

1906
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
and then The Legend of Zelda, which came out right before this.

1907
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
So, it gave, it opened up for an adventure game to come out.

1908
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And Metroid was a, the name came across as a portmanteau of Metro and Android.

1909
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
And I guess it evolved from there.

1910
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,000
So, the game was, I mean, it took a lot of development.

1911
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
A lot of people were involved in it.

1912
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Big names in Nintendo and, of course, the late Yokoi.

1913
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:48,000
So, the particular game was also meant to be one of the first non-linear, non-RPG games.

1914
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Which, I mean, if you look at it, yeah, it is completely non-linear.

1915
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,000
You can play anything in any order, provided you have the materials to get there.

1916
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,000
So, and it requires a lot of creativity to make your way through the game.

1917
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I mean, I was no good at it because I was kind of uncoordinated.

1918
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,000
But, you know, that's another story.

1919
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:16,000
You also, there's, this was one of the early games to use a password system

1920
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:25,000
because the Famicon disc version had, you could save up to three save files on the disc.

1921
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Which, of course, there was no battery built into the game for the US release.

1922
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,000
So, they had the password system.

1923
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,000
But the password system gave us two particular special codes.

1924
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:44,000
One of them was Justin Bailey, where Samus would run around in a bathing suit.

1925
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:48,000
And then you had a Narpa sword.

1926
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Which, it gives you infinite ammunition, health, power-ups, and a modified ice beam.

1927
01:37:55,000 --> 01:38:01,000
What Dan and I discovered is that if you do the Narpa sword and do the quick beat,

1928
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:08,000
where you can skip right to the Mother Brain level, it's like some trick where you freeze something and jump off of it and make it into the little deal thing.

1929
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Then you can go back and play in the bathing suit with the Narpa sword power-up.

1930
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
So, we called it Narpus Bailey.

1931
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:23,000
So, you also had up to five endings available.

1932
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,000
And the third, fourth, and fifth endings, Samus would appear without her suit.

1933
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:32,000
So, it was also where you found out that you were playing a female character the whole time.

1934
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Which, me being a kid, I was like, oh shit. It was so cool.

1935
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I think this really was, as far as I can think of, and I'm sure on some of the older systems like Atari I'm neglecting something in the moment,

1936
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:54,000
but really the first big twist ending that shouldn't be such a big deal, but it is.

1937
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
It was important.

1938
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,000
And now, thankfully, this has paved the way for today where it's really not so much of a big deal.

1939
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Right. Because now we look back at it and go, was it really such a big deal? Yes, it was.

1940
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Yes, it really was. Which is now why it's also paved the way for us to look at Ubisoft, for example.

1941
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Well, yeah, you can have a female protagonist get on it for Assassin's Creed.

1942
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Although, from what I understand, they are barely catching up in the terms of the sexism market in that series.

1943
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:31,000
So, basically, with the music, now, I mentioned the music and how awesome it was.

1944
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:39,000
The sound designer, Tanaka, said that he wanted to make the players feel like they were entering a living organism,

1945
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:43,000
so there was no distinction between music and sound effect.

1946
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:51,000
So the only melodic theme that you hear is when the mother brain is defeated, so you get that.

1947
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:59,000
But the rest of it is supposed to be more like it's part of your whole experience.

1948
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:01,000
So I thought that was pretty cool.

1949
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:10,000
And they also acknowledged, the creators did, that the movie Alien influenced the game quite a bit.

1950
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I mean, because you've got the character Ripley, and that Samus herself was inspired by Ellen Ripley of Alien.

1951
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Also, that the background music, the score itself, was inspired by the score for Alien as well.

1952
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:45,000
So, it has sold 2.73 million units worldwide, and it spawned so many different, I'd say, sequels, an entire mythos.

1953
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
It has a manga series. It's pretty amazing.

1954
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:56,000
And on top of that, this game is one of the ones that is credited with creating the speedrunning genre.

1955
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Because of the multiple endings that were based on how quickly you beat the game.

1956
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
So, let's see what we've got.

1957
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Yeah, and of course it also influenced Castlevania Symphony of the Night, so that's awesome.

1958
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:23,000
The game Metroid Zero Mission is a re-imaging of this game, with more backstory, enhanced graphics, but it has the same game layout.

1959
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Now there was another thing that, I didn't see a mention of this anywhere, and I've been trying to find it again.

1960
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:43,000
The hubby was playing, it had to be like 10 something years ago, but it was called the Metroid Maker, which was a ROM editor for Metroid.

1961
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:51,000
And there's a few people out there who have done custom Metroid games that you play via emulator or via ROM players.

1962
01:41:51,000 --> 01:42:01,000
So, those are out there and definitely worth it, but I would say the only game that has surpassed the original Metroid would be Super Metroid.

1963
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
And that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.

1964
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Fair enough. I can agree with it.

1965
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
And that's it.

1966
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
There it is. Your classic game of the week. Really, truly. I mean, they're all classics.

1967
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Why haven't I done this yet?

1968
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Yeah, right?

1969
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I've done like three games in a row that I'm like, what? I didn't know.

1970
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I mean, but what a testament to, there are so many great games in the world that here we are, you've been doing this, you haven't done this every week, because we didn't start this segment until about episode 250.

1971
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I've named how many hundred games?

1972
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:38,000
That's still about 350 games that, you know, are just classics that are games you should check out at some point.

1973
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Even though admittedly a few of them were pretty terrible.

1974
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
And I'll admit, I suck at Metroid.

1975
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Flat out suck at it.

1976
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,000
That's okay.

1977
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I love, I mean, it's like you were talking about what we're doing with Super Metroid, me and the hubby, just, you know, me doing the guide, him doing the playing.

1978
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,000
But I like when you can do stuff like that when there's things that you can find.

1979
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Yeah.

1980
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:04,000
And have more about the memories or what it did for future games or like I remember a few weeks ago, you did that LSD game on the PlayStation.

1981
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:09,000
It's like that game actually isn't very good, but it's just kind of like it was something very different.

1982
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
It was different.

1983
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I like to, I like to, I still am trying to find the name of the game that you played with nothing but sound that came on the Sega Saturn and it came with seeds.

1984
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Do you remember?

1985
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
Maybe somebody in chat knows.

1986
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:26,000
What was the store that was in Burlingame that had all the imports where it got?

1987
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Oh, I remember the place. I don't remember the name of the place.

1988
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:37,000
But, um, I know it was Game Masters was the one that was in, um, uh, Citrus Heights.

1989
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:43,000
But, um, but they had that game there and I was like, get it and play the weird Japanese game that you had to grow seeds.

1990
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:49,000
But yeah, I, I like the obscure, but you can't go without mentioning Metroid.

1991
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:57,000
So, you know, Tiger Claw points out talking about like alien and all that in Metroid, one of the bad guys is named Ridley, which I'm sure was named after Ridley Scott, the director.

1992
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Indeed.

1993
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Yeah.

1994
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Very cool.

1995
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,000
All right.

1996
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
Well, anyhow, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

1997
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:08,000
We're having a long show tonight, but with good reason because we've got friends joining us here in studio.

1998
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,000
We're going to take a break.

1999
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

2000
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Don't go anywhere.

2001
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

2002
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:29,000
Live tonight with episode number 620 of our show for November the first of 2015.

2003
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
And if you're just joining us, you missed a pretty exciting first part of the show.

2004
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,000
We were talking about Bob Ross and a lot of news out of Sony as well as Nintendo.

2005
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:48,000
We have some guests in studio tonight, although some of them actually stepped out for a minute, doing the all-important ice cream run that we need this time of year.

2006
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
So, or this time of the show.

2007
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Well, I mean, you know, this time of year, you start to crave ice cream even more and more with all the holiday treats and things going on.

2008
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:01,000
But a mic is still here. Dan and Shane ran out on the air, and so Mike's still here joining us, of course.

2009
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Having a good time so far, being here on the show?

2010
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Yeah.

2011
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Is it weird to, like, listen to it and then now you're here and seeing it all play out?

2012
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Yeah.

2013
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Yeah?

2014
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:15,000
What do you think the listeners miss by not being here?

2015
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
What do you think they'd be surprised to know about the studio?

2016
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Oh, your lovely faces.

2017
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
Me rolling my eyes at you.

2018
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Yeah, that too.

2019
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Yeah.

2020
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Cool posters.

2021
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Yeah?

2022
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I'm surprised there's Konami stuff in here, because I know recently, at least.

2023
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Well, you know, we started as a show about, you know, DDR.

2024
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,000
So, you know, Konami's still always going to hold a special place in our heart.

2025
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
But now it's like, god damn it.

2026
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Exactly. It's the old Konami that, you know, we really love.

2027
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:53,000
And, you know, I've used this metaphor to death, so I apologize for bringing it up again, but it's the old Tyra Banks thing.

2028
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
We were rooting for you. We were all rooting, you know.

2029
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
To see Konami keep going down that path is frustrating.

2030
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:03,000
But I love this, this DDR second mix marquee with the Konami seal that is official.

2031
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I love this. It's one of my favorites.

2032
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
And sadly, it doesn't translate well to radio.

2033
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,000
There have been a lot of people always asking, are you ever going to do the live stream thing?

2034
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
People live stream on Twitch TV.

2035
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
Why don't you guys do live stream?

2036
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
But I'm always like, it's Orange Lounge Radio.

2037
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:21,000
It's like, all you would see is our faces buried in the computers.

2038
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:25,000
And once in a while, there might be a thing where we look up and throw something at each other.

2039
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Maybe a special occasion, but probably not like a permanent thing.

2040
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. That's how I feel anyway.

2041
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Maybe.

2042
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
A lot of things that I watch, too, are just like big talking heads on webcams.

2043
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:41,000
And it's like, this isn't, you know, it's not really, with all due respect, it's not a compelling video.

2044
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I could just look the other way and just listen to the audio, which is far more compelling.

2045
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
So, anyway. Little side tangent.

2046
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:50,000
But let's get back into some gaming news, because we still have a lot of ground to cover.

2047
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:55,000
We've been running long, and we want to make sure we have time for some of your calls over at 1877 Game OLR.

2048
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2049
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
So, let's get to some rapid fire news. Loki, start us off.

2050
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,000
So, Criterion has basically said, hey, guess what?

2051
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:09,000
We are working to make Burnout Paradise backwards compatible on Xbox One.

2052
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Which has everybody, I'm sure, excited, because that game is fucking amazing.

2053
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
No surprise whatsoever.

2054
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Really, they should just make a new Burnout game.

2055
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I mean, I know they're making some sports game, or it's like some extreme sports type thing.

2056
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:25,000
But I'd rather them make a new Burnout game.

2057
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Because that would be goddamn amazing.

2058
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
But hey, that's something at least.

2059
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:36,000
To go along with that, also, Rocket League is going to be getting a free November update.

2060
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
And they're going to add some mutators to the mix.

2061
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:42,000
So, different things that you can have in the game.

2062
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Include the size and shape and weight of the ball. Gravitational effects.

2063
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,000
If you want the ball to be a cube, you can do that.

2064
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
It should make games a little bit more interesting.

2065
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:57,000
And also, more opportunities to live stream and stuff.

2066
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Because you're going to have weird parameters.

2067
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Balls that dwarf the cars.

2068
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
That would be kind of funny.

2069
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
Yeah, looking forward to that.

2070
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,000
And then, Fallout 4 is just a couple weeks away.

2071
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:20,000
And if you want to get hyped up about it, you can check out the Nuka Cola Quantum.

2072
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
Which is being put out by Jones Soda.

2073
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:31,000
And they've got this. It's going to be sold exclusively at Target stores starting November 10th.

2074
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
So, I don't know.

2075
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
But I want to know, what does it taste like?

2076
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
It's blue. Is it radiation?

2077
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Punch.

2078
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I thought the flavor was out there. I thought I remember reading about it, but I don't remember what it was.

2079
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Maybe somebody in chat knows.

2080
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It's just Jones Soda, right?

2081
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Yeah, it says...

2082
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Is it pomegranate, maybe? I don't know.

2083
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Pomegranate. Pome wonderful.

2084
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, bubble gum or punch?

2085
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Ew.

2086
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Ew. I will not drink it if it is remotely gum related flavors whatsoever.

2087
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
That is a Nuka Jamie Cola.

2088
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
Yuck. Just disgusting.

2089
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Or cotton candy or some nonsense like that.

2090
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Cotton candy would be fine.

2091
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Gum is nasty.

2092
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Gum is just gross.

2093
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
She feels about that how I feel about mayonnaise.

2094
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
It's like shitty medicine flavor.

2095
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,000
I will drink a bottle of Robitussin before I will smell gum.

2096
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Alright.

2097
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Anyway, I know a lot of people are very excited about Fallout 4 and are literally saying goodbye to their life for November.

2098
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
I do want to play that game.

2099
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
I will work and then I will Fallout 4 and that is that.

2100
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
I will play Fallout 4 for most of November.

2101
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I actually thought my game Call of Duty, but I'm like, eh, I don't have the money right now.

2102
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
So I will wait until Fallout 4 comes out, maybe, and spend money on that.

2103
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Alright.

2104
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Alright, well, hopping around for some other news.

2105
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:00,000
The late Satoru Iwata to be honored with a lifetime achievement at the Golden Joystick Awards.

2106
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Actually, I apologize. That actually already happened.

2107
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:08,000
That was at the O2 Arena in London and it was the 33rd annual event for games and people in the industry.

2108
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:14,000
He was honored with the lifetime achievement award for, obviously, everything he's done with Nintendo and for gaming as a whole.

2109
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:23,000
So he was given that award and, you know, I'm sure this is the first of many memorial awards to be given.

2110
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Let's see.

2111
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Going over to PlayStation Plus and the releases for November.

2112
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:34,000
PlayStation 4 will be getting Dragon Fin Soup, Magica 2, and The Walking Dead Season 2.

2113
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:39,000
PlayStation 3, Beyond Good and Evil, Dragon Fin Soup, and Mass Effect 2.

2114
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Interesting. I know they had already given away Mass Effect 3, so it's interesting they're going back there.

2115
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:47,000
And on the Vita, Dragon Fin Soup is there as well, and Invisimals.

2116
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:51,000
So those games will be out on November 3rd.

2117
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:56,000
Xbox, not to be missed, will also have their free games with gold.

2118
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:01,000
On Xbox One, you get Numa, I think is what it's called, Breath of Life.

2119
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:04,000
It's a first-person puzzle game adventure.

2120
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,000
And then on the 16th, you'll be able to get Night Squad, which is a throwback party game type of thing.

2121
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:14,000
On the Xbox 360, Dirt 3, and then Dungeon Siege 3.

2122
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:19,000
By the way, don't forget that the Xbox compatibility backwards stuff happens.

2123
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:27,000
So these two games expected to be backwards compatible, because they said that all the Xbox 360 games would be backwards compatible.

2124
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I wish they had that on PlayStation 4, like where the games are backwards compatible.

2125
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Wouldn't that be nice? Wouldn't that be nice? But sadly, I don't think that's the case.

2126
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Also, last but not least, this really shouldn't be too much of a surprise,

2127
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:48,000
but Sega is going to be looking at re-releasing the first two Shenmue games.

2128
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Which, with all the hype trained for the third game and all the money they made on Kickstarter,

2129
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:59,000
no surprise here that Sega Europe marketing director John Rook, in talking with Marketing Week,

2130
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:04,000
said that Sega is, quote, exploring ways to re-release the original two Shenmue titles.

2131
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Quote, we want to innovate and back smartphones and virtual reality,

2132
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
but our key purpose is to go back to what the brand used to stand for.

2133
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:16,000
And I think the buzz around Shenmue 3 shows that people love our legacy.

2134
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:21,000
So you can expect those games will turn up at some point along the way to Shenmue 3.

2135
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
You alright?

2136
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Yeah, we love their legacy, not the new fucking Sonic games.

2137
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

2138
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Well, it's finally happening. There's going to be a Portal board game.

2139
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I need to have this. I can't help, but this must be mine.

2140
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Oh, and it has GLaDOS in it too.

2141
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,000
No, Jamie, you don't need it. You need water and a roof over your head.

2142
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
She gave me the same lecture like two weeks ago. You don't need it.

2143
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
No, you're correct. I want it.

2144
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
I want it very badly to the point that I can confuse it with a need.

2145
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Fair enough. I had to. I had to. You left me no choice.

2146
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
You had a choice. You always had a choice.

2147
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Okay, but it was an easy choice.

2148
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
You're number one.

2149
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Alright, I got one finger being shown at me right now. Alright.

2150
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Hearts, hearts, hearts.

2151
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:24,000
So anyway, it's going to be 50 bucks, and you can get it from the Cryptozoic, or buy it at other places.

2152
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
You monster.

2153
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Also, Mario Maker has more updates coming out very soon.

2154
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:39,000
You'll be able to add checkpoints to existing levels, or to create new ones that include them.

2155
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:46,000
For you people that like to make Satan levels that are just ass hard, then you can finally put some goddamn checkpoints in them.

2156
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Ass hard.

2157
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,000
They won't.

2158
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Yeah, except you won't because you're a dick, and you like to make your levels hard.

2159
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Speaking of hard.

2160
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
But they can clear it. Why can't you?

2161
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
They probably can't.

2162
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Because they probably only clear it because they put a little cheat in the beginning, like invisible blocks that lead up to a warp pipe that just drops them on the flag at the end.

2163
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Bitches.

2164
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:11,000
So anyway, you can also add status-dependent power-ups.

2165
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:16,000
For example, if you put a fire flower block, it can eject a super mushroom if you're small instead.

2166
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,000
You know what's funny? I criticized the game for that in the very beginning.

2167
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
I said it doesn't work like Mario Brothers works.

2168
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Yeah.

2169
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Yeah, so it's kind of funny they went back and fixed that. That's interesting.

2170
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Well, and there's also going to be more Nintendo-designed courses.

2171
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:36,000
So it'll have the winning level from the partnership with Facebook, but you have to use your real name on it.

2172
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:44,000
And then you can tackle the level that was in the final round of the PAX Prime Omega-thon.

2173
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
And it's got some official makers. More things will be coming out.

2174
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Yes, and the Facebook level will just autoplay, even though you didn't really want to see it on your screen.

2175
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
And then you have to install a plugin.

2176
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Yep.

2177
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Also happening is the SSSW.

2178
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
South by Southwest.

2179
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Whatever.

2180
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
What?

2181
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
It's South by Southwest.

2182
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Okay, fine. I don't keep up with those things.

2183
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:21,000
But they did have to cancel two panels they were going to have in response to threats of online...

2184
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Sorry, on-site violence that were set around online harassment.

2185
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Ironic, right?

2186
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
But their director, Hugh Forrest, said,

2187
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:41,000
By canceling two sessions, we sent an unintended message that they not only tolerate online harassment, but condones it.

2188
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
And for that, we are truly sorry.

2189
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:54,000
So, on Saturday, March 12th, they're hosting an online harassment summit that will be taking place in the 2016 event.

2190
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
And livestreamed to the public for free.

2191
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:03,000
They are going to have a large number of speakers, including Wendy Davis.

2192
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Who, I don't know if people remember, she did the filibuster for...

2193
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't remember what it was. I remember she was there on the floor for hours and hours.

2194
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Although I'm very disappointed that she's a Hillary supporter, and I like Bernie.

2195
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Get out of the politics. This is video games.

2196
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
It's all wrapped up together.

2197
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
And also, Brianna Wu's going to be there.

2198
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
A few other people.

2199
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Actually, from all over the political and industry spectrum. So, pretty neat.

2200
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:42,000
This whole thing was a bit of a shitstorm online, and if you didn't see any of it, you're honestly for the better.

2201
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Because every time I think, I'm not going to see this ever again, hooray!

2202
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I'm just like, I'm done with it. It's a big ol' fucking circle jerk. I just don't give a shit anymore.

2203
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
It's like...

2204
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:01,000
You're right. This panel will totally solve online harassment forever. It will do nothing.

2205
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
It will not bring more awareness to it. It will do nothing.

2206
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:16,000
No, no, no. The thing is that by saying something is going to do nothing and immediately dismissing any attempts to rectify it, all that does is perpetuate the same thing over and over.

2207
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:23,000
The more exposure something like that gets, the more people willing to stand up and do something about it, the better chance there is of having something being done.

2208
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:27,000
By more exposure, I'm sure you mean more exposure for Brianna Wu, because that's really what she wants.

2209
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Hold on, hold on. Let me say it this way, because I'm all for intelligent people speaking, but the problem is, nobody's...

2210
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I shouldn't say nobody. That's not true. The people that need to hear it are not going to be listening.

2211
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:50,000
However, what I would like to see is a summit discuss on what to do to retaliate. As in, hold the people who pull the shit accountable.

2212
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,000
You can only anonymize yourself so much online. There's a way to find most of these people.

2213
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
That's why I find Wendy Davis...

2214
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
That's why you can dox everybody, because that's what they like, right?

2215
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:13,000
But that's why we need to have politicians, and that's why it's encouraging that Wendy Davis is participating, because what legally can we do to hold these doxers and these people who do this shit and get away with it because they can, what can we do to hold them accountable?

2216
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:16,000
That's a discussion that needs to happen.

2217
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:26,000
And see, what my thought is, is that if you find people like this, even just saying... Well, do you remember when I was being harassed, what was it about?

2218
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:31,000
God, it was a while back, and it was one friend of Timmy. Do you remember Timmy, right?

2219
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
No, vaguely, vaguely.

2220
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:41,000
But it was one of his buddies, and so I just basically responded back with it, here's your IP address, and here is your physical address. Are you going to stop now?

2221
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Yeah.

2222
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:50,000
And it stopped. But the thing is that the moment that you expose who it is to say, I know who you are, and I know how to find you.

2223
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Basically cut their balls off.

2224
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Exactly.

2225
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Well, that's more like accountability. Like, I'm going to make you accountable.

2226
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,000
That's what I want. I want accountability.

2227
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:04,000
You know, even if it's, I know who you are, it will stop more often than not.

2228
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Once they realize that, yes, you can do something about it, too, you know who they are, it's that whole anonymous having no face to it.

2229
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I mean, that's the reason why the KKK freaking wears sheets on their faces.

2230
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:26,000
You know, it's the same thing. By being an anonymous, no name, no face person, you can get away in some cases literally with murder.

2231
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:37,000
And if you hold them accountable, you remove the masks so that people know who they are, then that removes the safety of being able to do it without, you know, having to deal with consequences.

2232
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:48,000
All right. Well, before we get to our FUGL question of the week, I got to roll it back a little bit here to address a comment on something I'd previously said about the whole fact that people are going to be giving up their months for Fallout.

2233
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Tigerclaw is pointing out, what about Battlefront? That's coming out in a few short weeks. So say goodbye to your Star Wars fans. They'll be busy playing that game all night.

2234
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Well, you know, you can listen to this show and play video games.

2235
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Especially if they want their collector's edition, which is $200, they're not going to have any money to purchase the rest of the games coming out in the fourth quarter.

2236
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:10,000
If I can contribute to the show and write fan fiction, then you can listen and play.

2237
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:14,000
All right. Let's get to our FUGL question of the week.

2238
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and we ask a question and we read some of our favorite answers here from you guys, the folks participating with the program.

2239
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:39,000
So let's get to this week's question, which this week was about Kinect, the article we talked about.

2240
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I think Loki brought up in the first half of the show tonight.

2241
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Microsoft has cut the price of the Kinect by $50 and reinforced its commitment to the device.

2242
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Do you have an Xbox One with Kinect? If yes, do you think it's worth it for the rest of us to spend the money?

2243
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:56,000
If no, does this recent price drop interest you? What would it take to get you interested if not?

2244
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:01,000
So kind of a multi-part question, but I really want to know where people's heads was at where if you have one, why?

2245
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:04,000
If you don't have one, why? And what's going to get you there?

2246
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Tigerclaw starts us off on Facebook saying, I don't have a Kinect and don't have any use for it since my room is too small for one.

2247
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:16,000
But I think some people may get one for the voice command features, Skype video chat, and as a mic for in-game voice chat.

2248
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:27,000
And I saw a little conversation going on there where it was pointed out that you can do like a little filter, like little thing you put on top of the Kinect to help make a small room bigger in the eyes of the Kinect.

2249
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:33,000
But I can also see that in certain spaces it's probably still not going to work. It's probably still not enough.

2250
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:41,000
But yeah, certainly if you don't have the adequate room for Kinect it may be more difficult, especially without an extra peripheral.

2251
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Brad from Pod Culture over on Facebook says, I got one and outside of the occasional voice command I don't use it. Had it been an option when I got my system I would have got the bundle without.

2252
02:01:51,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Mike C. replies on Facebook and says, I have an Xbox One with a Kinect. I keep it disconnected because voice commands don't work well for me and I don't want Phil Spencer to watch me walking around in my underwear.

2253
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:11,000
And lastly, Hitstun says, I don't have an Xbox One and I wouldn't want to use a Kinect as a game controller. I'd like to try one for motion capture for game development.

2254
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:18,000
That requires a $50 Windows adapter and a beefy PC, so I still won't get a Kinect until I know it'll do what I need.

2255
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:23,000
You know, Hitstun does bring up an important point though that didn't come up in the room when we were talking about this earlier and that was,

2256
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Kinect also has its purposes on PC and some of the greatest advances that Kinect has brought us, especially for science and everything,

2257
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:41,000
and I mean on like the 360, had nothing to do with gaming. Especially the fact that doctors can use them without having to touch anything is really kind of a cool use for that.

2258
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:47,000
So that is the fact that you bring up the whole fact of a PC adapter and using it that way to do motion capture for games.

2259
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:53,000
That kind of shows another side of Kinect where I go, okay, yeah, that's a really good use for Kinect.

2260
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:59,000
So my thing is like, if you want to do the voice commands and stuff like that, why doesn't it work with the headset?

2261
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:03,000
It's like, why do I need to have a fucking $150 peripheral to do that shit?

2262
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Like it doesn't, I don't think it processes any of that crap.

2263
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Give me your money.

2264
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:15,000
All right. Redertainment on Google Plus says, I have an Xbox One with Kinect and I use the Kinect nearly every day.

2265
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:23,000
The Kinect makes it easy to switch from playing games to watching TV or WWE. I definitely recommend the Kinect to anybody.

2266
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Xbox wrestling.

2267
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Xbox wrestling. I love it.

2268
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Lastly, Act Def says, I don't have a Kinect, but I would like to get one just to get the full Xbox One experience when I get the console.

2269
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Granted, I probably won't miss that much if I don't get it, so I'm not that excited over it either.

2270
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:49,000
So a very wide variety of answers to our question there over at Facebook and Google Plus. Thank you guys who participated tonight.

2271
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,000
All right, let's get back into some gaming news. Loki.

2272
02:03:53,000 --> 02:04:00,000
All right, so we kind of talked about this last week that Sony wasn't going to be making video games.

2273
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Just kidding. They say they still are going to make some video games.

2274
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Okay, what? What game are you making? Prove it. I want to see the receipts.

2275
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Well, they're saying that, let's see, I think what we said is that we're no longer in the business of AAA development of games for Vita, but there's still first party Vita content being worked on.

2276
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:27,000
What the fuck does that mean, though? That doesn't make any sense.

2277
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,000
That's so vague. Like, what the fuck does that mean?

2278
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Wait, say that again.

2279
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I think, okay, this is according to Jim Ryan, the Sony Computer Entertainment Europe president.

2280
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:46,000
He said, I think what was said is that we are no longer in the business of AAA development of games for the Vita.

2281
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Well, that seems pretty straightforward to me, but there's still first party Vita content being worked upon.

2282
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:58,000
So you're going to make AA games? I mean, I don't understand what...

2283
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:05,000
If you said, I think what we said is that we're not in the business of AAA development for the Vita, that's okay.

2284
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,000
I don't think you can get much more clear than that. So you're going to put out other things?

2285
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Two ways to read this comment. There's two answers, I think.

2286
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Do you remember last year at E3, not this year, but last year, and I just remember this because I was there.

2287
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,000
It was the conference that I saw from PlayStation.

2288
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:27,000
They started relatively early. They showed this game called Entwined that they were releasing on the store that day.

2289
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:35,000
That was a first party game. Sony made that, but it was a very small startup studio that was a lot of students within their company.

2290
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
So I would not call that AAA development, but that's still a first party game, if that makes sense.

2291
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
So a game like Entwined would count.

2292
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Maybe they're thinking more games like Journey and that type of thing.

2293
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Which, you know, honestly, Journey is one of the greatest PS3 games, so I don't care what.

2294
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:58,000
AAA, single A, double Ds, killer Cs, whatever it is, I don't care. Just, you know, that game is fantastic.

2295
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I wonder if, now here's the second way I could interpret that comment.

2296
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Does this mean that they're contracting other people to do the first party games for them?

2297
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I think that could be it.

2298
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,000
That works so well for the Vita and early life cycle list.

2299
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:19,000
Well, I'm just saying, whether it worked or not, have they hired third parties to truly do the first party software?

2300
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I think that's an option that I kind of read between the lines and I kind of think that could be where it is.

2301
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
So, we'll see.

2302
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Anyhow, speaking of studios and the things that they are creating, you know, there's a lot of speculation around what Retro Studios is up to.

2303
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Of course, Retro Studios, the company behind the great Metroid Prime series.

2304
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:47,000
And their last big release was Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, but that was what, like late 2013?

2305
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
So, what the hell are they working on now?

2306
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Tropical Freeze came out in the beginning of the year. It was like a February release.

2307
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Sorry, they finished it in 2013. It went gold and then it came out in the beginning of the year.

2308
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:04,000
So, anyhow, apparently the latest rumor is that it could be a new IP.

2309
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:07,000
So, something new. Which, you know, new stuff is exciting, right?

2310
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:13,000
And apparently they pitched this in 2014. This is just, you know, some rumors going on.

2311
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:20,000
And what's interesting about this is that the rumor goes on to say, I don't think Retro wants to do Metroid Prime 4.

2312
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
I'd be surprised if Retro pitched that. I think they've had their fill of Metroid.

2313
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:30,000
And if it is Metroid, then it would be something different, like maybe a 2D one or something different from Prime.

2314
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:33,000
Yeah, that would be awesome. Let's do a 2D Metroid.

2315
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:36,000
So, interesting.

2316
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:41,000
I'm all for original stuff, though. I mean, Splatoon was completely original.

2317
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,000
And that's like kind of a must-have Wii U game at this point.

2318
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:51,000
I'm all for another sprite-based Zelda, you know, Link to the Past style game for Zelda.

2319
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
That would be great, except why does that need to be on the Wii U?

2320
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Because it can be huge. Imagine making like the game like really large.

2321
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
Yeah, we'll see.

2322
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Huge map.

2323
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Maybe a Metroid game from the top down like that. That would be weird, though. I don't know.

2324
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:09,000
There was a Contra game that kind of worked like that, though.

2325
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:14,000
But anyway, let's move on. Because that's all rumors, so what else can you say about that?

2326
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:17,000
They'll show it when they're ready to show it. In the meantime, Dark Sakura.

2327
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Well, while we were all busy looking at presidential elections and other loudness, I'd say, in the news,

2328
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:34,000
the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act passed Senate 74-21.

2329
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Which, before we were really paying attention to a lot of this, and then they just sort of snuck on through.

2330
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:52,000
Basically, it's just the whole thing is crappy because they don't understand what information is,

2331
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:59,000
how it affects everybody, the way the Internet works.

2332
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:08,000
It actually was, and I'm trying to get the rest of the information on this, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, EFF, issued a statement.

2333
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:14,000
I'm just going to read this one as it is because it sums it up perfectly.

2334
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:24,000
The passage of CESA reflects the misunderstanding many lawmakers have about technology and security.

2335
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Computer security engineers were against it. Academics were against it.

2336
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Technology companies, including some of Silicon Valley's biggest, like Twitter and Salesforce, were against it.

2337
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Civil society organizations were against it. And constituents sent over one million faxes opposing the senators.

2338
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:50,000
So, it's passed Senate. It has a different version passed the House.

2339
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:56,000
And so, they're now going to need to have a big debate between the two to get a final version running.

2340
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:06,000
But, right now, it's just really, really shady, I'd say, all this going on.

2341
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:12,000
And I will be posting a link in the chat room to the list of people who voted for and against,

2342
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:20,000
so that you can let certain people who are in charge of making laws in your state know that they're assholes.

2343
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Real quick, because a lot of people are comparing this to the whole SOPA, PIPA thing that happened a couple of years ago.

2344
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:35,000
How is this, like, you know, because it would blow my mind that they essentially passed the same thing when they retreated last time.

2345
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
So, how are they saying this is different? Like, how are they justifying it?

2346
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Well, what they said in here that they had, they actually changed a lot of the wording in it.

2347
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:54,000
Let me see. There was a little bit more about it. I'm trying to see if I can find where it said that.

2348
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:59,000
So, they were supposed to have tightened the definition of cybersecurity threats.

2349
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:07,000
And that they needed to be aware that, and this is a quote, made it reasonably likely to cause damage, as opposed to may cause damage.

2350
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:17,000
It's all verbiage, is all it is. So, I'd have to make sure that we have a little bit more information, I think, posted publicly on it.

2351
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:25,000
But, basically, any other amendments that were introduced to protect citizen privacy were shut down by the Senate.

2352
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:31,000
So, they don't care what our privacy is. They just want to know what we're doing.

2353
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Scary times in the future. Alright, but I'm sure, you know.

2354
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
That's okay. Big Brother will always be watching.

2355
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
But I'll be watching Big Brother, because that's a trashy great show.

2356
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

2357
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Thank you for ruining my 1984 reference.

2358
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:51,000
No, I enhanced it. Loki.

2359
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Sorry, I had a hamburger in my hands.

2360
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:06,000
So, this is kind of neat. Apparently, they're going to be allowing DRM circumvention for abandoned video games.

2361
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:15,000
And the Library of Congress has issued exemptions to section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

2362
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:25,000
That makes it slightly easier to legally circumvent different aspects of DRM for lawful fair use, such as preservation of old video games.

2363
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:37,000
So, the exemption basically allows them to remove server authentication of the game's original server if it's shut down.

2364
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,000
So, that's pretty cool.

2365
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:46,000
So, Mario Kart Wii no longer works online, right? Because all the Nintendo Wii games got shut down.

2366
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Legally, I can, quote-unquote, hack my Wii to connect that game to a private server to continue to play that game.

2367
02:12:53,000 --> 02:13:03,000
No, it's online authentication. Like, say, for example, imagine if Steam went away and the game requires Steam to work, you know, you can circumvent it to allow the game to work without it.

2368
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Or, if it's a multiplayer-only game, like a mag or something like that, you could hack that to have your own private servers.

2369
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Got it. Okay, but in that case, you're talking about there with the whole online servers and Steam specifically,

2370
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Steam has made it well known that should they ever close, which seems so unlikely at this point,

2371
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:28,000
but should they ever close, they have a button they can push that will get rid of DRM completely from all the games that you buy.

2372
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:33,000
So, yeah, a big red button that says, do not push in case of bankruptcy.

2373
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Alright. Well, that's interesting. I'm curious to see what's going to come out of that there and what, you know,

2374
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:48,000
especially some of the more questionable stuff that kind of walks the line, see what kind of comes with that.

2375
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Anyhow, speaking of old games and legal, it's completely legal, you can download every Tribe's game for free.

2376
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:06,000
That's right, Hi-Rez Studios in the 21st anniversary celebration of the game is actually going to be releasing every game from the Tribe series,

2377
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:11,000
and it's out now. If you go to tribesuniverse.com, you can download all the old games.

2378
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:17,000
That includes the most recent game, Tribes Ascend, because that was a free-to-play game anyway.

2379
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:22,000
So, there you go. Head on over before they decide to, you know, make those games pay again.

2380
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:25,000
I know literally one person that would be excited about this.

2381
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
One person. Who is the person?

2382
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Oh, my coworker who is like huge in the Tribes.

2383
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Well, guess what, Loki's coworker? Today is your special day.

2384
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Congrats. You're a winner.

2385
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:42,000
Alright. Hey, I'll check it out. I mean, I know the most new game before, you know, the free-to-play one.

2386
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,000
I think it was like from 2007, but I'll still check it out. Why not?

2387
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys e-mail us.

2388
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com. We pick some of our favorite e-mails.

2389
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
And Dark Soccer reads them live on air for our enjoyment.

2390
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I don't play favorites, Rob.

2391
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Again, that's participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

2392
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Yeah.

2393
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Alright, first e-mail. Quick question. Have any of you tried the Minecraft minigame servers such as Miniplex, Hypixel, or the like?

2394
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Is it at all likely similar servers would be active for console players, or are Sony and Microsoft more locked down than that?

2395
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Also, I saw the latest RPG Maker MV, I guess it has to do with the Roman numerals anyway, is available for Windows and Mac.

2396
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Does this mean that we'll be seeing more RPG Maker games on Mac now?

2397
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Sorry, this is all too speculative. Robert M.

2398
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:43,000
P.S., like Jim Sally, my primary support device is an iPod Touch 5G.

2399
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:48,000
There were a lot of questions in there. RPG Maker on Mac.

2400
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:58,000
I think there's a general trend that more stuff that does big business on Steam, which I think RPG Maker is one of them, should be releasing PC, Mac, Linux as much as possible.

2401
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:04,000
So, I actually think, yeah, you probably will see more RPG Maker on Mac.

2402
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:08,000
And, you know, hey, yay, more games for more people. That's a good thing.

2403
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:18,000
Yeah, given that just, you know, practically every day I look at the App Store, and there are already big titles that are there.

2404
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:24,000
I mean, like, if I were to open it up right now, which I just did, waiting for it to load.

2405
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Right on the top I have Doom 3. I have Reassembly. There's actually, it's got its whole game section, so.

2406
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Transistor. This War of Mine. I got Grim Fandango. All kinds of stuff.

2407
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:50,000
Guitar Hero, funny enough, has a release like that, even though you don't necessarily have the controller. It's kind of interesting.

2408
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:57,000
Yeah, you're getting a lot of major titles more often. As far as the Minecraft minigame thing, I don't know.

2409
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:01,000
Yeah, I'm not too sure about that. I have not played on those servers that you mentioned.

2410
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:08,000
I prefer to keep it kind of either a solo game or, like, when we had the VoG server where it was a really controlled environment.

2411
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Like, I thought that was kind of cool, too. As far as the console versus PC, and will the Mega servers come to console?

2412
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Probably not, because that's not usually in the vision of console. And especially now that Microsoft owns Minecraft,

2413
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I think you're going to see that they want to take the PC and the Xbox One versions in slightly different directions,

2414
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:32,000
so that you'll have a reason to buy both. Isn't that what it's really all about? That's my thoughts, anyway.

2415
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Well, they already have, because the PC version, Windows 10, is based off of the mobile version of Minecraft.

2416
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Oh, interesting. I didn't even realize that.

2417
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,000
But it runs so well.

2418
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Yeah, it does run really well. Anyhow, just a quick comment from chat, because I want to make sure over at live.vognetwork.com we get all our voices heard.

2419
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Dungeon Buster talking about tribes, saying tribes vengeance was pretty fun. At least the SP campaign was.

2420
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:00,000
The MP not so much from what I heard from more die-hard tribes fans.

2421
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:06,000
So, anyway, just a comment there from chat. No comments on that particular email, though, so we can go on to our next email.

2422
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I'd like to thank Tom for the pot roast recipe. Yeah, someone sent us a pot roast recipe, but he said don't read it on air.

2423
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
You'll need one cup of meat.

2424
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
It looks pretty freaking good.

2425
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Yeah.

2426
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
We'll have to try making it on a later show.

2427
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Dang it, why do you people send me fucking novels? I mean, I love you. Bye.

2428
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Hello all, just a few random thoughts on last week's episode.

2429
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:38,000
To Loki and anyone who might be thinking about playing a telltale game, such as Minecraft's story mode game of Thrones and Walking Dead, yes, that is how they play.

2430
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Completing them is rather easy. Each episode lasts two hours, about two hours, and the majority of the interactivity consists of dialogue choices.

2431
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:51,000
I would say that they are more like interactive movies than traditional video games.

2432
02:18:51,000 --> 02:19:00,000
That being said, we recently completed the first season of Walking Dead, and it is one of the more memorable, moving, emotional gaming experiences I have had this year.

2433
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:07,000
It kind of makes me think I have not, in fact, aged out of new games as I previously thought.

2434
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:13,000
I won't spoil anything, but I'll just say pressing one button has never been so difficult as it is at the end of episode five.

2435
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:21,000
The entire first season was recently given away for free on both 360 and Xbox One as part of Games with Gold,

2436
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:27,000
but it's more than worth the asking price as long as you're not entirely turned off by the concept of playing an interactive movie.

2437
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Play it with someone you love with the lights off. If you can handle it, you won't regret it.

2438
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:40,000
On the subject of Square Enix, possibly bringing back old franchises, I have just two things to say. Einhänder is the first.

2439
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:44,000
But, I love, we just had Shane agree.

2440
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Yes, please.

2441
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Okay, wait, but to be fair, I just, devil's advocate here, you get Dissida, which is a fighting game.

2442
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:55,000
No, Einhänder's not the fighting game.

2443
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
No, it's Einhänder.

2444
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Einhänder's the shooter.

2445
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Oh, God, I always, never mind, never mind, I always get that and the, never mind, I get the name.

2446
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,000
That is such a good game. I love that game so much.

2447
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Er, guys.

2448
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Yeah, that game's garbage. Einhänder's really good.

2449
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
I was thinking of similar names.

2450
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:10,000
No, they're not.

2451
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
You know what? I have them both.

2452
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I haven't played them since I was like 20.

2453
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:18,000
The RPG mode in Er, guys, was pretty fun.

2454
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Anyway, but that's really unlikely, so the second is Bushido Blade.

2455
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,000
So much could be done with that in the modern era. Come on, ScreenX, make it happen.

2456
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:34,000
And if a true sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics is ever announced, nothing will be able to contain my glee.

2457
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Lastly, I will just mention that I am almost ready to launch my new website and release multitasking.

2458
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:47,000
I always say that finishing is the hardest part and this time has been no different.

2459
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Thanks, as always, to both you guys and the listeners for all of the support.

2460
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
Please look forward to it, smileface.

2461
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:00,000
And to Loki, you haven't mentioned it lately, but I have not forgotten about time to car.

2462
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Yeah, it's been really hard to get back in the...

2463
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:06,000
It's just kind of... I've been busy with the costume.

2464
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
But Halloween's over now.

2465
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Yeah, exactly. I need to get back onto it.

2466
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,000
The costume did look pretty kick-ass, I gotta say.

2467
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Yeah, it was pretty awesome. I was up for 36 hours on Thursday. I did not sleep.

2468
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:24,000
I know the wife will never let you go to Dragon Con, but you would get so many pictures of that costume.

2469
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
You would have had a great time.

2470
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:29,000
For those who didn't know, or didn't see it, I was Lego Deadpool.

2471
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Hopefully you're still determined to complete and release it, and we'll all see it soon.

2472
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:36,000
I'm waiting for you. Keep on moving, Aaron YYR.

2473
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,000
I'm looking forward to multitasking by YYR.

2474
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:46,000
I already told him I feel like this game deserves a much bigger fanfare release.

2475
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:51,000
We'll do what we can to get the word out there.

2476
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Alright, last email.

2477
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Yay.

2478
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:57,000
And who is this from? Oh, Ragenator.

2479
02:21:57,000 --> 02:22:00,000
Hi, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood Ragenator.

2480
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
I have some good and bad news for everyone.

2481
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:07,000
As everyone may have heard by now, the laptop that I've had since 2012 died at the beginning of October,

2482
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
hence why I've been away from VoG.

2483
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I've temporarily borrowed a real POS 10 to 12 year old laptop to temporarily hold me over until I can go out and replace my computer,

2484
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:19,000
but I can't do much of anything with it.

2485
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Now for the relatively good news, I have rearranged my budget significantly so I can go get a new computer somewhat quickly.

2486
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:31,000
This does not mean that I'm temporarily shutting off my Time Warner services until May 1st, 2016,

2487
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:36,000
and trying to live off of $75 a month until May 2016.

2488
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Okay.

2489
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Yeah, it'll be tough as balls to do, but with a little luck and perseverance, I will have enough money to replace my computer by then,

2490
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:48,000
and hence be back to my usual norm of gaming, participating in VoG's live shows, telling bad jokes, etc.

2491
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Unfortunately, I'll miss the finale of Understation Live, but it can't be helped.

2492
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
We'll record it for you.

2493
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:01,000
Hopefully we get a podcast of it. Everybody poke Travis to make sure he doesn't get too caught up in Fallout 4. He'll post that.

2494
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Anywho, ultimately the point of my email is this.

2495
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:08,000
No, I didn't fall off the face of the earth and nothing's physically wrong with me.

2496
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:14,000
I figure that maybe some people might have been worried since it's highly unusual for me to be away from VoG,

2497
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:18,000
and at one point I did disclose that I do suffer from depression. I'm sorry.

2498
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:21,000
I actually hear from him all the time on Steam and haven't lately.

2499
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:25,000
I am safe, albeit at best moody now.

2500
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Sadly, sometimes shit just happens. I will make every effort to be back ASAP.

2501
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:33,000
In the meantime, my thoughts will be with the VoG community as a whole,

2502
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:38,000
and I will look forward to participating with OLR, AJS, and Black Wolf Show once again.

2503
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:42,000
Feel free to designate someone to tell bad jokes on my behalf during my absence.

2504
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
I always read the P.

2505
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Anyway, I hope all is well with everyone, and I'll see you all virtually fairly soon. Take care.

2506
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
...or some... I don't know why. I don't know why.

2507
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Learn macrame.

2508
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:25,000
I think because I've been asked to join a bowling league, and it's on Sunday nights, and so I can't do it,

2509
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:29,000
so that's probably why that came to mind. But, you know, people's lives changed or whatever.

2510
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:34,000
But, glad to hear you okay. Sorry to hear about the computer, but life sucks, right? Things happen.

2511
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Make the best of it. When life hands you lemons, make lemonade.

2512
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
You demand to see life's manager.

2513
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
That's right. You demand to see life's manager.

2514
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
I don't need your fucking lemons.

2515
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Or you serve that lemon with a nice shot of vodka.

2516
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:51,000
That's tequila.

2517
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
That's right. No, no, tequila. Gross.

2518
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I say the same about vodka, though. For the most part.

2519
02:24:58,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Tangent time.

2520
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

2521
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
I need, like, a bumper noise of a train coming in.

2522
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Choo-choo! It's a tangent train!

2523
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
I'll just go rip a Jim Sally sound clip.

2524
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Chugga-chugga.

2525
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,000
Tangent train.

2526
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
I made lemonhead vodka.

2527
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Yeah? How was it?

2528
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Fucking amazing.

2529
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,000
Yeah?

2530
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
That sounds fantastic, actually.

2531
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
It turned out really well, but we had to filter it.

2532
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:24,000
But we found out that it's actually amazingly delicious in orange soda.

2533
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:28,000
So when life gives you lemonheads, infuse it in vodka.

2534
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Mr. Candy Corn Vodka.

2535
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:36,000
I gotta say, I had some of that pumpkin spice candy corn vodka that you made.

2536
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,000
And, uh, you know, we had that at the show a little bit.

2537
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Super syrupy, but great. Delicious.

2538
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Because it's basically drinking a candy bar that's gonna get you smashed.

2539
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Those candy corns weren't that bad, actually.

2540
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,000
Yeah, they were good.

2541
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
I wonder how it would be poured over ice cream.

2542
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Mmm.

2543
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Oh my.

2544
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:58,000
I wish I hadn't eaten my entire blizzard already, but it was so good.

2545
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
So, alright.

2546
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:03,000
Why don't they have alcoholic sundaes?

2547
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:07,000
I'm sure they do. They just, you know, you have to carry a liquor license when you wanna do that stuff.

2548
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,000
And things get complicated.

2549
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:11,000
There's lots of, like, bars and, like, restaurants.

2550
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Children, ice cream.

2551
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Yeah.

2552
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:19,000
Also, I don't think dairy and vodka mix too well. Very few situations.

2553
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
You can get, like, yours.

2554
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:22,000
You know.

2555
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Yeah, I guess that could work.

2556
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
I have pumpkin spice kalua at home.

2557
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Yummy!

2558
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:29,000
Cause I'm totally being...

2559
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:32,000
That's, like, my one nod to basic bitchiness.

2560
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Is pumpkin spice kalua.

2561
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:36,000
Alright.

2562
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
Tangent train's pulling out of the station.

2563
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
The mailbag segment is done.

2564
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:44,000
But if you wanna send us emails, participate at orangelauntrader.com is the place to do it.

2565
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Well, now that the mailbag is closed, it's time to unleash our anger upon the world in another tangency segment we do on the show every week called the FUs of the Week.

2566
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:57,000
It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with gaming, but we've maintained this tradition for 620 weeks.

2567
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
And we're sure as fuck not stopping now.

2568
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Here is punishment.

2569
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
This is fucked up.

2570
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Fuck you to there not being any more of my blizzard.

2571
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:21,000
And that I had to sit looking at my blizzard while I read through all those damn emails.

2572
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:24,000
And everyone's like, I've got my blizzard.

2573
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Around me like, oh, fuck you, I wanna eat my blizzard.

2574
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Sorry about it.

2575
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,000
Uh-uh, you're not.

2576
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Alright, you're right, I'm not.

2577
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Also, um...

2578
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Just fuck you to one of my pieces of medication I'm on for making me feel really fucking weird until I adjust to it.

2579
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
I feel really freaking weird.

2580
02:27:49,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Like, not in a happy, oh, I'm weird in a quirky way in the, hi, I'm your brain and I'm going to fuck with you for like three weeks until you get used to this shit.

2581
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
That's all it is.

2582
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:03,000
So, that's all.

2583
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:06,000
Alright, um...

2584
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
I don't really have a lot of FUs.

2585
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:11,000
FU to the fact I have to get up early tomorrow.

2586
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,000
That's all.

2587
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
I like my sleep, I don't like getting up early.

2588
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Loki.

2589
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Um, FU to myself for staying up for 36 hours on Thursday for working on the damn costume.

2590
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Oh my god.

2591
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:25,000
And, uh, my face has felt like on fire since then.

2592
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:28,000
I hope, I think it's from the spray paint.

2593
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:35,000
Because my laptop has a nice coat of spray paint on it too, like a dusting of it, as well as everything else, as well as my lungs did.

2594
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:39,000
So maybe I have like a slight chemical burn in my face.

2595
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:40,000
I'm not really sure yet.

2596
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:44,000
But all my fingers and stuff are really like dry and everything as well.

2597
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:49,000
You might need to see a doctor and just have some lab work done just to make sure you didn't have to...

2598
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:50,000
Nah, I'm fine. I'm sure.

2599
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Alright.

2600
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
It's poor ventilation, yeah.

2601
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Fair enough. Who's got the mic over there?

2602
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Mike, do you have any FUs of the week?

2603
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Oh, an FU to whoever put together my basketball roster that I coach.

2604
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
I've got the smallest team in the league.

2605
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I've got 5th and 6th graders going against mostly 7th graders.

2606
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,000
That doesn't really work out.

2607
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:16,000
You know what though, in the movies, that scrawny misfit team is the one that wins the championship at the end.

2608
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Not when your team is like 4 and a half feet tall and everybody else is like at least 5'6".

2609
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Oh, I see. You've got the pre-growth spurt kids.

2610
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
Yeah, it's horrible.

2611
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:29,000
Cause you can't say anything to a mother when you've tried.

2612
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:35,000
And then you're trying to coach the kids as they're getting their growth spurts and I'm sure that is just a hoot and a holler.

2613
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:41,000
A lot easier than trying to teach someone small to get bigger, I guess.

2614
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:44,000
Somehow, that doesn't work like that.

2615
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
Grow, damn you!

2616
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Dan, how about you? Your FU of the week.

2617
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:57,000
I'd say fuck you to this Blizzard that I am not going to be able to finish because it is just too rich for my taste.

2618
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
Jamie will finish it for you. If she doesn't, I will.

2619
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
No, is it the pumpkin?

2620
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:05,000
No, it's the caramel truffle and I thought the truffles are just too much.

2621
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
I'm like ugh.

2622
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:10,000
I didn't like the pumpkin one very much.

2623
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:14,000
And I don't like caramel or else I actually probably would take you up on that.

2624
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
I gotta be honest, I've never had a Blizzard.

2625
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:19,000
I thought it was more of like a milkshake thing that you drink.

2626
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:22,000
It's just ice cream that they blended shit in.

2627
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
It's all it is.

2628
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
It's like a McFlurry, except it came before.

2629
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:30,000
And they have their little picture where you can turn it upside down and it doesn't come out. I don't think that would actually work.

2630
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:33,000
Not when they've been sitting in the car for fifteen minutes on their way over here.

2631
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:40,000
But I did try every single one holding it upside down as we drove back and every single one of them was sticky enough to not fall apart.

2632
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Alright, fair enough.

2633
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Last but certainly not least, Shane.

2634
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:51,000
F you to Nintendo and the way they handle Splatoon and how they try to make this game not fun.

2635
02:30:51,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Because, like, they penalize and Splatfest the more popular team and they upped the percent or the multiplier for wins.

2636
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:05,000
So like, this has just been in my gaming week but I forgot but I'm mad about this.

2637
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:08,000
So I played about ten times this weekend for Splatfest.

2638
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
I was on Ninjas. We lost.

2639
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:21,000
We had a seventy percent or like almost seventy something percent popularity versus the twenty something percent pirates.

2640
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:27,000
But because of the way they do their online matching, out of those ten games I only fought pirates twice.

2641
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
All the other times I fought Ninjas.

2642
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:35,000
And when you're one team versus your same team, it doesn't count towards the results at all. It's a wash.

2643
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:41,000
So all my time playing Splatfest, I don't think I'm a bad player. I feel like I'm pretty decent at the game.

2644
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:44,000
I wasn't really contributing to my team trying to win.

2645
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:51,000
So we got killed because it was sixty percent wins for pirates and forty percent for us.

2646
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:56,000
But there was a six times multiplier on that. You can't overcome that. It's stupid.

2647
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:00,000
And Nintendo, you just made Splatoon my number three game of the year because of that.

2648
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:01,000
Oh no.

2649
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
Yeah, it dropped from number two.

2650
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,000
Uh oh, downgrade.

2651
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Yup. You better watch it because it might drop to four if you keep this up.

2652
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
You're on notice.

2653
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Also, we got Pirates versus Ninja for our Halloween event.

2654
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Europe, this next weekend, gets Zombies versus Ghosts even though Halloween's over.

2655
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:22,000
And Japan for their Halloween was Money versus Love.

2656
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:25,000
So I don't understand.

2657
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Wow, that's Money versus Love.

2658
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Love won overall, but Money was more popular.

2659
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:39,000
But every single Splatfest, every single one of them, the least popular team has won.

2660
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Yeah, and that's not how it should be.

2661
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:45,000
I mean, they should change the multipliers.

2662
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:50,000
Because I think in the beginning it was times two for popularity and times four for wins.

2663
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:55,000
But now it's times nothing for popularity and times six for wins.

2664
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
And it doesn't seem right.

2665
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Yeah, but it was kind of screwed up when a team won by one percent just because they were more popular.

2666
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:05,000
It should be wins. Period. Wins. Period. That's it.

2667
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:08,000
But the online matchmaking maybe needs to be a little different.

2668
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Yeah. I would rather wait.

2669
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:13,000
ActDeft is pointing out Splatoon is still fun and it's fair.

2670
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
It's not fair.

2671
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,000
He was also Team Pirates.

2672
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Yeah, it's not fair at all.

2673
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:21,000
That sounds like somebody that's always on the winning side is something they would say.

2674
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Do you know what team I played on?

2675
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:24,000
Ninjas.

2676
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
No, the team I forgot to play on was Splatoon.

2677
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Oh yeah, that's right. You did.

2678
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:31,000
I guess I was playing the game wrong because I was Team Pirates so I was stealing stuff off the internet.

2679
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:36,000
But, I mean, I guess I just don't get how this works.

2680
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Alright. And ActDeft is pointing out he's lost three SplatFests in a row.

2681
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:42,000
It's still not fair.

2682
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,000
You need to let him have his moment.

2683
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:47,000
It's still not fair. Yeah, he can have his moment but to claim it's fair is wrong.

2684
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Alright, moving on.

2685
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:52,000
We just got a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to your calls.

2686
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:57,000
1877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

2687
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:58,000
But first, Loki.

2688
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Yes, so let's talk about another Kickstarter but this one is actually pretty interesting.

2689
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Don Bluth. He's trying to Kickstarter a Dragons Lair animated film.

2690
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
I'm down with that.

2691
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:18,000
He needs $550,000 to create a teaser that he can shop to financers to create a full film.

2692
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:22,000
And so far, let's see what he's raised here.

2693
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Health.

2694
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:31,000
He's raised $114,000 and he's got 24 days to go so I'm pretty sure he's going to make it.

2695
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:34,000
And then let's see if he's got stretch goals here.

2696
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:39,000
You can win all sorts of animation stuff.

2697
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:42,000
But we can't forget the biggest contribution Don Bluth ever made.

2698
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
If you're going to say Xanadu, so help me God.

2699
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Who is he? I've never heard of this person.

2700
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
The animated scene in Xanadu.

2701
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:49,000
I've never heard of this person.

2702
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Did an American Tail?

2703
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
I know Fievel.

2704
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Anastasia.

2705
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Anastasia.

2706
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:57,000
I was going to say, is it this busty maquette that I'm looking at?

2707
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
Because that's a pretty big contribution.

2708
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Until he goes west. I don't know if Fievel goes west.

2709
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Don Bluth is pretty rad. I wish him success in this.

2710
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:09,000
There's a part of me though that kind of thinks the ship has sailed on Dragons Lair.

2711
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:13,000
It's like, how many times have we re-released Dragons Lair?

2712
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:19,000
It's been out on, with the arcade version came out on, it was on the DVD to play thing.

2713
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:23,000
And it was on Xbox. They've just released it a million times.

2714
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:26,000
I kind of think the time to make a movie has kind of passed.

2715
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Really?

2716
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:33,000
But at the same time, and I'm going to argue with myself, at the same time, I'm all for introducing it to a new generation.

2717
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:39,000
I was just going to say, because they've already tried to shove shit down a new generation's throats that don't probably give a shit about it.

2718
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Peanuts the movie. Smurfs the movie.

2719
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
The Jem and the Holograms.

2720
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:45,000
Jem and the Holograms.

2721
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
The fucking Alvin and the Chipmunks.

2722
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:54,000
I mean, no one gave a shit about all those properties. I mean, yeah, it's like, ooh, I love those as kids, but oh God, what have you done to them now?

2723
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:57,000
But what's happened in a lot of those cases that somebody new got the rights.

2724
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Like the Jem and the Holograms movie, that wasn't, that was not a Jem script.

2725
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:08,000
That was some other little teeny feel good movie, family film that they fucking just squished, yeah, Jem into.

2726
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:11,000
And then like all of our childhoods are weeping.

2727
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:18,000
I really would love to see like a franchise like that, just from a movie that's based completely nothing on the franchise at all.

2728
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:24,000
Like have like a fucking just like Dolph Lundgren, you know, action film, Jem and the Holograms.

2729
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
You know, it just makes no fucking sense.

2730
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
But it would be entertaining because of that.

2731
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:36,000
So at least, at least I will say this, Don Bluth is still involved and that means it'll be better for the wear.

2732
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Because that means it'll still be his vision, so that's good.

2733
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:43,000
I just can't imagine that they can't do like, I mean, is he trying to do like hand drawn animation?

2734
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:47,000
I mean, why can't they do just computer animation? That's just like fucking cheap.

2735
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Well, some people like the hand drawn stuff.

2736
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:53,000
I understand that, but like, I don't know. I think people could do it.

2737
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Maybe they'll have a blend. We'll see. Alright.

2738
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:01,000
Like I thought I wouldn't like the Disney animated stuff that was, you know, Disney not Pixar.

2739
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:04,000
But I mean, it looks like the same style.

2740
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Yeah, Tangled was fucking great.

2741
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Tangled was okay. Frozen was alright. I mean, I don't know.

2742
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:12,000
And Dungeon Buster pointing out it's hand drawn animation he's doing.

2743
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
But you know, there's a place for the hand drawn animation too.

2744
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,000
That's cool, I guess. I hope he makes it. I just, I don't know.

2745
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:19,000
I think he will. We'll see.

2746
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Alright, well lastly, speaking of blasts from the past, who remembers the Dizzy series?

2747
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Anybody ever played the Dizzy games?

2748
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Yeah, well, god, they go all the way back to the ZX Spectrum.

2749
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
There were some Dizzy games on Commodore 64.

2750
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:38,000
And the last Dizzy game actually came out in 1992.

2751
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Well apparently, the creators, the Oliver Twins, they were going through some old stuff.

2752
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:50,000
And they found the design documents and files to an unreleased NES title called Wonderland Dizzy.

2753
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Well, they actually went through and worked on it.

2754
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:57,000
And now this ROM is running in a browser emulator.

2755
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:04,000
So that's right, all these years after 1992 when Wonderland Dizzy was originally conceived,

2756
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:08,000
it is now out for free for you to play and catch up on.

2757
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:14,000
So you can check that out at wonderlanddizzy.com and you can play that.

2758
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:18,000
That's pretty rad that an old treasure like that has been rediscovered.

2759
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Especially for a series like Dizzy that was, those games, there was quite a few of those games on the NES.

2760
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
And I remember those from the early 80's computing days.

2761
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:29,000
So that's pretty rad that there's a new game in that series.

2762
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:33,000
So always nice to see those little gems unearthed.

2763
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Well, that is going to do it for our mainline news tonight.

2764
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,000
So we're going to open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR.

2765
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight.

2766
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Or maybe we missed something.

2767
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Maybe you want to ask our guests a question.

2768
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
I don't know, but you never know.

2769
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Mike, did you just roll your eyes? I said ask the guests a question.

2770
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:00,000
You did this to me at Rocky the other night already.

2771
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
We won't talk about that.

2772
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR.

2773
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2774
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
And guess what? It's already lighting up.

2775
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
So let's get to it with this first call.

2776
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2777
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Hey everybody, it's Rama.

2778
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
Hey Rama, how you doing?

2779
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
I'm pretty good. How about you?

2780
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:20,000
I'm super. Thanks for asking. What's on your mind?

2781
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
I knew you was going to do that.

2782
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:24,000
What's up?

2783
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Not much. I want to say a couple of quick things.

2784
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:32,000
First off, I remember playing The Living Daylights out of the Fantastic Adventures of Disney for NES. Loved it.

2785
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:36,000
Those games were kind of like, I think they were much bigger overseas, like in Europe.

2786
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:41,000
I think that was a really big series in Europe than it was here, but certainly it had its following over here.

2787
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Yeah, but it didn't help the fact that they came up through, I think, Codemasters and Comerica.

2788
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:53,000
And they were unlicensed, so they came in special gold-type style cartridges.

2789
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:58,000
That's right. I remember that. They were kind of the Renegade games, some of them.

2790
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Along with Tengen games, like, was Gauntlet in one of those cartridges? No, I think Gauntlet was on a regular cart.

2791
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:09,000
Klax, and then Tetris, of course, and so on.

2792
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Yeah, I mean Gauntlet did come out as an original cartridge, then it came in the alternate cartridge format, you know?

2793
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Totally.

2794
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Yes.

2795
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:22,000
So what else is on your mind?

2796
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Well, I want to talk about something really cool, really exciting, something that I've been helping with for the last couple of weeks.

2797
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
May I take the floor?

2798
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
The floor is yours, my friend.

2799
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Thank you, thank you. Well, I've been kind of cryptic on my Facebook, personal Facebook, about a project I'm helping with at my job.

2800
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:49,000
And for those who don't know, I work at Microsoft. I'm in their flagship retail store.

2801
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:59,000
And one day, one of the community leaders was asking in the break room if anybody knew any bloggers, cosplayers, gamers.

2802
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:03,000
And I raised my hand and I'm like, I know people.

2803
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
All of the above.

2804
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:06,000
Yeah.

2805
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:12,000
So, she clues me in on Extra Life, and we all know what Extra Life is.

2806
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Sure, of course, the gaming marathon. It's funny because we started the show talking about Twitch, but broadcasting has really helped the Extra Life marathon gain a lot of visibility.

2807
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:25,000
And a lot of people participate in that from all over the world.

2808
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:33,000
Definitely. And it seems that Saturday, November 7th is Extra Life game day 2015.

2809
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:36,000
And I believe it's going to be a 24 hour stream.

2810
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:50,000
And what's happening is from 1 to 7pm at Microsoft's flagship store in New York City, I will be helping with Extra Life and we'll be doing our part in fundraising for Children's Miracle Network.

2811
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Hey, that's awesome.

2812
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,000
Yeah.

2813
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Now, I wish I could fly out there and be there, but realistically that can't happen because of money and all that.

2814
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:06,000
But can I see it online? Because I know a big thing about Extra Life is streaming. Is that a possibility or not this time?

2815
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:11,000
Yes. We will be streaming through Twitch.tv on Extra Life's channel.

2816
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:12,000
Nice.

2817
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:23,000
We'll start at 1 and at our location we'll have some DJs and we'll have some DC cosplayers and we'll be doing some gaming tournaments and it's going to be pretty fun.

2818
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:28,000
Well, I get to see you on the stream. Can I go in the chat room and make fun of you when I see you on stream?

2819
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:33,000
Sure, sure, sure. But if you do that, I might have to send a signal to lock down your Xbox One.

2820
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Alright. You're going to push the button to brick my console?

2821
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
No, I'll just lock it down. I just won't brick it.

2822
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Can you push the button to make Rock Band 4 work? No, I'm just kidding. Low blow, I'm kidding.

2823
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:48,000
I'll get a 404 redirect to another company.

2824
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Alright, that's fair, that's fair. Alright. No, I think that's great. And yeah, I really wish we could participate in that a little more.

2825
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:01,000
But maybe next year, you never know, never say never. I am way overdue for a trip to New York City.

2826
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:05,000
It's been like 8 years since I've been out there. I really need to get out there.

2827
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:06,000
You definitely got to come out.

2828
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Alright. Well, I will be, for what it's worth, I will be in DC for MAGFest. That is happening, for sure.

2829
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:16,000
AKA VOGCON WINTER 2016.

2830
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:24,000
Kinda. Kinda. It actually, and isn't, yeah, February would be 6 months away from then Atlanta and Dragon Con.

2831
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:30,000
So yeah, I guess that works. So yeah, you got your Winter VOG and your Fall VOG.

2832
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:35,000
We're crashing your cons because, you know, we're too broke to throw our own.

2833
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:36,000
Woohoo!

2834
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Alright, well best of luck with Extra Life. That is, wait, November 7th would be next Saturday, right?

2835
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:49,000
This coming Saturday, it'll be on Twitch.tv slash Extra Life NYC. Tickets are still available through Eventbrite.com.

2836
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:55,000
Just look up Extra Life Game Day 2015 and you'll find all the information there. And kids under 10, get in for free.

2837
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:59,000
Alright. We want selfies with Rama if you make it out there. Send them to our Twitter at OLR.

2838
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:03,000
Yeah, I'll probably be running around wearing my volunteer shirt.

2839
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:07,000
Nice. Alright. Well Rama, thanks so much and best of luck to you guys. Hope you raise a lot of money.

2840
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:13,000
We will. And you know what, thank you. Thank you for allowing me to come on and just spread the word at us.

2841
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Because I've been so excited to be a part of this and help promote something this awesome.

2842
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:24,000
You're welcome. Like, half the things we let get promoted on this show have nothing to do with such a great charity.

2843
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:27,000
So this is even like double awesome. It's a win-win for everybody.

2844
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:28,000
Woohoo!

2845
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:31,000
Alright. Best of luck. Let us know how it goes.

2846
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Hey, thank you. I will.

2847
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Alright. Take care. Bye.

2848
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:34,000
Bye.

2849
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Alright. Very cool. Extra Life. I'm sure a lot of folks are going to be doing streams to support that in the coming weeks.

2850
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:46,000
I wish, you know, unfortunately I take a lot of energy and put it into this show that we do every Sunday.

2851
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:52,000
So I don't usually participate with my own stream in Extra Life. Not that, you know, never say never.

2852
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:59,000
But I think I'm just going to support other people, I think, for this one. And I think that's how I'm going to prefer to do it.

2853
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Alright. We got another call coming in though. Let's get to it. Hi. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2854
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Hey. This is Agdef.

2855
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Hey, Agdef. How you doing?

2856
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:12,000
Pretty good. Pretty good. You said we could ask questions to your guests.

2857
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
Of course you can ask questions to the guests. What's up?

2858
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Why do you hate football? Soccer?

2859
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:23,000
What? Why do you hate football? Because the rest of the world calls it football. You call it soccer.

2860
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:31,000
I don't hate football that much. It's just not on my preferred list, I should say.

2861
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:37,000
It just doesn't grab my attention as much as basketball.

2862
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:46,000
It's like this, Agdef. Some people prefer shooter games. Some people prefer RPGs. Some people prefer platformers.

2863
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
Some people prefer to date pigeons.

2864
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:52,000
It does. It doesn't in Dark Soccer Raises Your Hand.

2865
02:45:52,000 --> 02:46:01,000
But that doesn't mean you hate all video games. It's just, you know, dating pigeons is just not the game I'm choosing to play right now.

2866
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:06,000
Yeah, definitely. And I understand now. He likes basketball.

2867
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:12,000
I like seeing people score. That's kind of what it is.

2868
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Did you hear what he said? I like seeing people score. That's why he watches basketball.

2869
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
Me too. Me too.

2870
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:28,000
Me too. It has nothing to do with sports. But there are balls involved.

2871
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
Definitely.

2872
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:35,000
I have a healthy respect for it. It's just not for me.

2873
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Alright, fair enough. We'll agree to disagree. What else? What else is on your mind tonight, Agdef?

2874
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Well, I wanted to talk about something about localization and it was done in the new Zelda game, Triforce Heroes.

2875
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:54,000
Oh, yeah. Have you been playing Triforce Heroes?

2876
02:46:54,000 --> 02:47:00,000
No, I haven't actually. I haven't gotten the game. I really want to try it because it looks fun, though.

2877
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:05,000
I don't think it would be a great single player. It's more like a multiplayer game.

2878
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:17,000
But aside from that, some people were complaining about the addition of memes in the game's text or in the dialogues.

2879
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Oh, yeah. Don't they reference, like, Doge?

2880
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Yeah, I was seeing an image with the Dodge meme with such something. I can't remember exactly what it said.

2881
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:40,000
I think it's funny when that shit turns up in games. Why is Zelda so sacred?

2882
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:51,000
And not necessarily because it's Zelda. Because Nintendo has done this since the DS era.

2883
02:47:51,000 --> 02:48:00,000
If I remember correctly, I think one of the Mario and Luigi games, the RPGs, had memes on it.

2884
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:11,000
And even then, people praised Nintendo for doing that. And we have seen a lot of memes in Nintendo games throughout the years.

2885
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Just watch a Splatoon. It's filled with puns and all that. And even Animal Crossing, too.

2886
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:26,000
And people haven't complained about them, but they did it to Zelda.

2887
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:35,000
And oh my god, Nintendo's treehouse are a bunch of idiots, etc.

2888
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:45,000
And it's about localization. Here's Nintendo Treehouse trying to do something fun.

2889
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:48,000
So people in general can enjoy it.

2890
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:53,000
Earlier in the show, Dan was talking about his gaming week, and he mentioned he was playing Guacamelee.

2891
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:59,000
And I remember one thing that really struck me about that game was that it has all these meme references in it.

2892
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:05,000
There's all these references. There's Grumpy Cat, there's Mario Brothers.

2893
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:13,000
And I thought it was funny. It would be cause for me to explore more areas to try and find all the funny jokes.

2894
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:14,000
What game?

2895
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Guacamelee.

2896
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Yeah, that game is filled with a lot of references. And it's a really great game, and it's really fun.

2897
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:28,000
And all the visuals, and especially what they did with all the references, it's fantastic.

2898
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:35,000
But again, they did this with Zelda, and I don't know if it's filled with things like that.

2899
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:39,000
I have only seen that one image, so I don't know.

2900
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
And people need to lighten up a little bit.

2901
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:47,000
It's like, oh my god, it's filled with idiotic memes or something like that.

2902
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
People need to lighten up a little bit.

2903
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:52,000
You know what else is interesting is that some of these other games you talk about,

2904
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:56,000
and you mentioned going way, way back to other, way older games.

2905
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Well, we didn't have Twitter then.

2906
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:05,000
So that's how sometimes some of these complainers you didn't really see before, and now you can see it.

2907
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:11,000
And I'm all for everybody getting their voice, but there are some voices I'm going to look at and go,

2908
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:15,000
okay, well, you said what you have to say, but I really think you just need to get over it.

2909
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:23,000
And my point is that people need to learn that when a company or anyone translates a game,

2910
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:28,000
it's not only the translation. You don't have to just translate the words.

2911
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:35,000
You have to know who's going to play the game, who's going to be watching it,

2912
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:39,000
and try to capture, because it's not only, oh, it's going to be players.

2913
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
You have to sell the game.

2914
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:48,000
You have to know how it's going to capture the audience.

2915
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:57,000
So I know this because I have a bachelor's degree in translation, so I'm speaking of experience and all that.

2916
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:08,000
And I know it's not necessarily the greatest thing or the best thing, actually, but it's not really a bad thing either.

2917
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:15,000
So I know that people complaining, yeah, it's probably not the best thing, again.

2918
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:24,000
But you have to understand the localization of some things, like in this case, this game.

2919
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:28,000
Let me get a quick comment out from our chat room over at live.voguenetwork.com.

2920
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:32,000
As 2100matt says, to play Devil's Advocate, why does everything got to be a meme?

2921
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Maybe people just feel we're a little inundated by memes.

2922
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Well, but to be fair, I mean, it's not like, and he does say, to be clear, I understand both sides.

2923
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:45,000
But I mean, it's not like Zelda, Triforce Heroes is, you know, meme the game.

2924
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:50,000
I think they tried that and it was horrible. It was some third-party game on Wii U.

2925
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:55,000
It's like, okay, it's a little joke or one little costume that's cute.

2926
02:51:55,000 --> 02:52:03,000
They took fucking selfies in the remake of Wind Waker. I mean, come on, who cares?

2927
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:07,000
But you can do some really cute stuff with that, you know?

2928
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:11,000
Hey, taking a selfie with Ganondorf, it's the awesomest thing ever.

2929
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Yeah, and selfies in WoW. Mike mentions you can do selfies in WoW.

2930
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:18,000
That was a big thing, was when they put that camera in the game, people could take their selfies.

2931
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:24,000
Alright, ActDeft, I gotta let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, but thank you for the feedback.

2932
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:29,000
And let us know if you end up getting Triforce Heroes and what you think of the memes.

2933
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

2934
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Alright, take care, my friend.

2935
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
Alright, we're gonna give time for one more call to try to fit in.

2936
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:38,000
1877gameOLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2937
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:41,000
While we wait for that call, Loki, I don't know if you have any last-minute stories.

2938
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
Yes, I have excellent news.

2939
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Dead or Alive Extreme 3, we'll be getting English subs since it's probably not gonna get released over here.

2940
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:51,000
So you can import those buoys right away.

2941
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
Yay!

2942
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:59,000
Yes, and that'll be coming out in Japan, across Asia, February 25th.

2943
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Darsaga, Darsaga, Darsaga, we need to get this game and do a livestream.

2944
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Okay.

2945
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
Yay! That'll be fun.

2946
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
We need to have the bounce-o-meter.

2947
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:08,000
For the volleyball.

2948
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:09,000
Exactly.

2949
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Oh, boy.

2950
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
Anything else to share?

2951
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:18,000
Yeah, I was gonna say that along with the fact that they're not gonna be allowing you to change your names,

2952
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:21,000
there's also still no plans for backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 4,

2953
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:24,000
so that's also something else to look forward to.

2954
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Game Center CX levels are coming to Super Mario Maker in all regions now.

2955
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
So that'd be cool.

2956
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Does that mean we get to also play as the arena character?

2957
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:40,000
I don't know.

2958
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:45,000
I really just, sorry, not to beat a dead horse,

2959
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:50,000
but I really have to express irritation, strong irritation,

2960
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:54,000
that at least PlayStation 1 and 2 games are not playable on PlayStation 4.

2961
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
I mean, I get PlayStation 3 a little bit.

2962
02:53:56,000 --> 02:54:00,000
You can play the tech challenge card on PlayStation 3 a little bit,

2963
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:06,000
even though you have the fucking streaming video stuff, but whatever, we won't go there.

2964
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:09,000
But PlayStation 1 and 2 not playable on 4, give me a fucking break.

2965
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:10,000
Give me a fucking break.

2966
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Yeah, PlayStation 1's playable on a PSP.

2967
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:14,000
Come on.

2968
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:15,000
Yeah.

2969
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:16,000
It's playable on my phone.

2970
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:17,000
My old-ass phone.

2971
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Yeah.

2972
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:19,000
I don't believe it.

2973
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:24,000
I don't believe that it's not possible and you don't want to try and you don't have the resources in it.

2974
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
So just say, you know.

2975
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:30,000
Because imagine, think about this, PlayStation Plus, the offerings that they've been giving you,

2976
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
they haven't been this great lately.

2977
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:35,000
Imagine if you could dip into that old PlayStation 1 catalog.

2978
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Hey, you get Twisted Metal or hey, you get Vibriven or something like that.

2979
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
That would be awesome.

2980
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:46,000
Or Final Fantasy 6, because that was on, you know, PlayStation, so that would be pretty epic.

2981
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:47,000
Yeah, I mean, just dip into that shit.

2982
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Jet Moto.

2983
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:49,000
Yeah.

2984
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:50,000
I don't know.

2985
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:51,000
All right, one last call.

2986
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
This is the last chance to get in on tonight's show.

2987
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype.

2988
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2989
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
Anything else for our listeners tonight?

2990
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Yeah, this is kind of unusual.

2991
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:09,000
There's a rumor that SNK Play More is leaving the pachinko business as opposed to joining it or getting more into it.

2992
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
Well, what a refreshing story.

2993
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:14,000
Yes.

2994
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
After a lot of news recently.

2995
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:17,000
You know what?

2996
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:18,000
Where did I see this?

2997
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:19,000
Was it on Twitter?

2998
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Was it something somebody said in chat?

2999
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:23,000
I'm so sorry, I cannot tie this comment to who said it.

3000
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
I'm so sorry who said this in the moment.

3001
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:30,000
But somebody was saying the reason why Konami is making these pachinko machines.

3002
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
Maybe this was something Dark Tetsuya said. Was it you?

3003
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
About Silent Hill?

3004
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Yes.

3005
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:36,000
Repeat that comment.

3006
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:45,000
The kind of conspiracy theory I have regarding why they're doing the Silent Hill pachinko machine is so that they can show that they're using the IP.

3007
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:54,000
And so no one else can come in and try to claim that IP accusing them of forfeiting it through not use.

3008
02:55:54,000 --> 02:56:05,000
Because I'm not sure of the exact legality, but if you don't utilize an IP, you essentially forfeit the rights to it and someone else can pick it up and take it to make a game.

3009
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:14,000
So they don't want to lose the IP, but they don't want to actually make anything, so just slap on it on a pachinko machine and there you go.

3010
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Thank you.

3011
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:19,000
Yeah, but it hasn't been that long since they made a Silent Hill game. It's only been like a couple years.

3012
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:29,000
Yeah, but still just buy some more time and maybe there will be a mobile phone game and I'm sure that's inevitable too. So they'll keep that trademark alive and well.

3013
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:34,000
They have a new gameplay trailer for 90's Arcade Racer which looks fantastic.

3014
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:35,000
I want to check that out.

3015
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:38,000
That's something that's coming to Wii U I think soon.

3016
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:43,000
Well, it looks like no more calls are coming in tonight, so I'm going to go ahead and shut down the Skype line.

3017
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:46,000
If you think of something after the fact, go ahead and send us an email.

3018
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:51,000
Participate at orangeontruday.com or you can always tweet us twitter.com slash o-l-r.

3019
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:56,000
Some people send us Facebook messages too and I must admit, I know that's how a lot of people talk today.

3020
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:02,000
I'm not so good at checking those, but I do read them and I'm sorry if I don't reply timely, but that's usually the last thing I check.

3021
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:05,000
But I'll get to it eventually if you send a Facebook message.

3022
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:09,000
Alright, is that it for stories too then?

3023
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Uh, yes.

3024
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:13,000
Alright, well then I think we're going to go around and wrap things up.

3025
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:17,000
It is 9.15 here on the west coast, 15 after midnight on the east coast after all.

3026
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Hey, I want to thank our guests for being here tonight, especially our newbies to the show here, Dan and Mike.

3027
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:26,000
I hope you guys had a good time and had fun being on this side of OLR.

3028
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:32,000
So, I don't know if you have anything you want to plug, I don't know if you have a twitch channel or twitter you want to plug while you're here.

3029
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:36,000
But please plug away before we say bye. So, Dan?

3030
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Nothing specific, I'll just plug my twitter handle I guess.

3031
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:44,000
It's gaming underscore hipster and you can go ahead and follow me.

3032
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:53,000
I talk mostly about video games and to everyone else who I'm following, it's nothing really super specific.

3033
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
But yeah, that's all I really have.

3034
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Alright, awesome. And Mike?

3035
02:57:57,000 --> 02:58:04,000
If you like sports I guess, basketball in particular, football, American football, sorry.

3036
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:18,000
And the occasional gaming stuff, it's not even anywhere near focused but you can follow me on twitter at mnev3. That's it.

3037
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Awesome. And now of course we always go around at the end of the show and get everybody's final thought.

3038
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:29,000
Shane, I always ask you if you want to plug something, you never have anything to plug. But I'll get your final thought.

3039
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:33,000
You're so rude. This is the second time tonight.

3040
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:34,000
What would you like to plug?

3041
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:39,000
I was just going to say that, well I don't have anything to plug.

3042
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
How could you quit Ingress?

3043
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Because he was going to quit and I was like okay I'm going to delete it from my phone. Delete? There, it's easy.

3044
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:50,000
It was super easy. That's all.

3045
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:54,000
That's what you guys would do. You get me into it and then you all quit.

3046
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
It's all server side anyway.

3047
02:58:56,000 --> 02:59:00,000
I'm not quitting but I'm dialing it back.

3048
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:06,000
I'll do my final thought since you still didn't ask me before you were so rude anyway about plugging stuff.

3049
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:15,000
My final thought is if you show up to my Toys R Us this Sunday and you try to get a villager and I don't get one, I will cut you.

3050
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
Because I will.

3051
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:18,000
Thank you for that.

3052
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Before I actually invite people to give their final thoughts, even though Shane decided to give them anyway,

3053
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:26,000
I want to quickly say, as I do at the end of every show,

3054
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:33,000
we don't have a big multi-million dollar budget behind our show or a way to spread the word about our show.

3055
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:36,000
So if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, please help us spread the word.

3056
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:42,000
Tell a friend or five or twenty-five about the show and help spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice.

3057
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:46,000
Because if the voices aren't listening and using those voices, then we can't hear them.

3058
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:50,000
A five-star review wherever you found this show goes a very long way.

3059
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:55,000
So thank you to everybody giving five-star reviews on iTunes, Stitcher Radio, wherever it is.

3060
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
Soon, I guess now, Google Play.

3061
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:03,000
I just submitted the show to that because I don't know if you guys heard but the Google Play is going to be launching podcasting.

3062
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:07,000
And so they were accepting shows and I'm like, hooray, another place to list OLR.

3063
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:08,000
Sign me up.

3064
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:09,000
So we'll be on that.

3065
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
And I got the email back that we got accepted.

3066
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
So we'll be in that whenever it launches.

3067
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:14,000
So that's exciting.

3068
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:18,000
And if they have reviews, we need five-star reviews there too.

3069
03:00:18,000 --> 03:00:20,000
I would appreciate it.

3070
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Not if they're out of ten.

3071
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:23,000
Then it should be ten.

3072
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:26,000
Yes, if it's ten, then please ten out of ten.

3073
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:29,000
Don't leave a five-star review out of ten saying Rob said five stars.

3074
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:30,000
You know what I mean.

3075
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:31,000
You know what I mean.

3076
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:32,000
You're smart people.

3077
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:37,000
Now we can go around to everybody's final thought for the night.

3078
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:40,000
Shane, you're hereby cordially invited to give your final thought for the night.

3079
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:44,000
I need time to think of another one.

3080
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
So come back to me.

3081
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:47,000
All right.

3082
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
Dan, your final thought for the night.

3083
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:55,000
My thought is I need to take out a loan so I can purchase 90 villager amiibos from a certain Toys R Us.

3084
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
I like you.

3085
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
You come back any time.

3086
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:00,000
All right, Mike, your final thought.

3087
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:03,000
I really hope I can hit Legend this month in Hearthstone.

3088
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:04,000
Good luck to you.

3089
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:05,000
God damn it.

3090
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
I want to see you on the stage at BlizzCon someday.

3091
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:13,000
Oh, dear God, that would be too much, but got to hit Legend first.

3092
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Got to hit Legend first.

3093
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:15,000
Sounds good.

3094
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:16,000
All right, let's see.

3095
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:19,000
My final thought for the day is I'm not quitting.

3096
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:20,000
I'm just dialing it back.

3097
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:24,000
There's a big difference, although, yes, I did use the word quit quite frequently,

3098
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:27,000
but we all get frustrated sometimes a little bit.

3099
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
Just because there's so many blues in the area, right?

3100
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:33,000
No, it actually has nothing to do with that because actually I like being on the underdog team

3101
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
because you know you're kind of...

3102
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:36,000
You're waiting for Pokemon Go.

3103
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:37,000
That's what it is.

3104
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
That's actually super true.

3105
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
But anyway, it has nothing to do with that.

3106
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:44,000
But anyway, all right, Shane's back with his real final thought.

3107
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:45,000
Here it is.

3108
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:50,000
I have to go buy a knife apparently to cut Dan with for this weekend.

3109
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:51,000
All right.

3110
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:52,000
Good luck with that.

3111
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
I'll be his bodyguard.

3112
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:55,000
Cut two people.

3113
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:56,000
Good luck.

3114
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:57,000
He'll cut two people.

3115
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:58,000
All right, let's see.

3116
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
Loki, your final thought for the night.

3117
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:01,000
All right.

3118
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:04,000
So this guy took the portal that I took on the way over here back,

3119
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
but dumbass only left like four resonators on there,

3120
03:02:06,000 --> 03:02:09,000
so I'm just going to have to spend five seconds to blow it up.

3121
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:13,000
Oh, that guy is always around here, and he's...

3122
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:14,000
He'll be fine.

3123
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:15,000
That's fine.

3124
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:16,000
I'll blow it up.

3125
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:17,000
Go teach him a lesson.

3126
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:18,000
All right.

3127
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:19,000
It's more points for me.

3128
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:20,000
That's right, more points.

3129
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:21,000
That's how you have to look at it.

3130
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:22,000
When you're on the underdog team, it's easier to get XP.

3131
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:23,000
I just don't care.

3132
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:24,000
I don't care.

3133
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:25,000
That's right.

3134
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:26,000
It's a fucking game, and I don't care.

3135
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,000
That's what I had to say earlier this week.

3136
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:29,000
All right.

3137
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
Last, but certainly not least, dark soccer.

3138
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:35,000
Your final thought tonight.

3139
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:36,000
How appropriate.

3140
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:41,000
What we should do is just drive down to that park down the street and blow that one up.

3141
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:44,000
Okay, you got to be careful when you talk about blow...

3142
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Let's go to the park and blow it up.

3143
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:47,000
Blow up some notes.

3144
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:54,000
Yes, he means with pew pew imaginary laser beams in an imaginary game that is not real.

3145
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:56,000
We need to preface by saying that.

3146
03:02:56,000 --> 03:02:57,000
All right.

3147
03:02:58,000 --> 03:02:59,000
Hello, NSA.

3148
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:00,000
Yeah, right?

3149
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:01,000
Oh, boy.

3150
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:02,000
All right.

3151
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:05,000
And then Loki's going to be left saying something like this.

3152
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:06,000
Oh, wait.

3153
03:03:06,000 --> 03:03:07,000
Damn it.

3154
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:08,000
Oh, wait.

3155
03:03:08,000 --> 03:03:09,000
Damn it.

3156
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Yes.

3157
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:11,000
That'll be...

3158
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:12,000
I miscued the sound clip.

3159
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:13,000
Loki would say something like this.

3160
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:14,000
God damn.

3161
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:15,000
Ow, my foot.

3162
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:16,000
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

3163
03:03:16,000 --> 03:03:17,000
Oh, my God.

3164
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:18,000
It hurts so bad.

3165
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:19,000
All right.

3166
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:26,000
Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3167
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:30,000
We will see you next time in seven days to do it all again.

3168
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
Have a great week at gaming, everybody.

3169
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:00,000
But you know they were all still true.

3170
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
See you next week.

3171
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:36,000
Thanks for watching.
