00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
This week, Sony too revisits backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 emulation on the PlayStation 4.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Here's hoping classic Star Wars games help get us through to The Force Awakens.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
There's plenty more along with your calls and comments tonight on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:48.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this November the 22nd of 2015 with episode number 622 of our show.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Rob Roberts, but you can find me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E,

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
and I am joined here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California with my co-hosts.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
I like this coffee.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
You're having some coffee to help pick you up, give you a little energy?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
It's delicious.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah, I gotta say, I don't know who invented the Keurig. I'm assuming it was Keurig.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Is that the name of the company? I don't know, but anyway.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Whoever invented that, that thing is a lifesaver for...

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
But, so I don't sound like a free advertisement because we're not on the payroll.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
To hell with that 2.0 thing where it wouldn't do the cups that weren't first party. It was so weird.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
It was like an NES system that wouldn't play the third party cartridges.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
I never have that problem.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
Because when I buy a bag of coffee, it lasts about a month.

01:42.000 --> 01:51.000
And my filters cost $2, and I can make my cup flavored any way I want to by adding things to it.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
Can you make that cafe mocha right there?

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
I could buy that cafe mocha because they sell the grounds.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Oh, do they? Oh, that's something, I guess.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
This is just the Target brand.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.000
I thought there was something special because some of them now, they don't just put coffee in it, but they actually put cream.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
I have this one at work that actually has cream and sugar in the cup as well.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
So it's like a whole all-in-one thing.

02:11.000 --> 02:20.000
I enjoy that you share coffee with me, and I'm glad to buy you cups. I just wish that they were more biodegradable than they are.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
It seems like some other companies are coming out with solutions, so maybe everybody will switch to that.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
Because there's these other ones we get that are totally different, and they work, but they seem more out of materials that would biodegrade easy.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
These do make a lot of waste. However, delicious, and just exactly what I needed.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Hits the spot.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
I also have Kit Kats. I've been on a quest for all the different flavors of Kit Kats from Japan.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I finally got the cheesecake Kit Kats.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Oh, that sounds amazing.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
They're really good. I only have a few left from the package I bought yesterday.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
But I forgot to buy the strawberry cheesecake ones that they had at...

02:58.000 --> 03:08.000
In Japan Town in San Francisco, they have an omiyage store, which it's like the packaged omiyage that you get when you travel all over Japan and then you take them to all your friends.

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
But they had the strawberry cheesecake ones, and I almost bought that box, except I thought I already had strawberry cheesecake, but I just had regular cheesecake.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Still super good. And then I got blueberry cheesecake soft Oreos.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
That's a flavor?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
It's a flavor in Japan.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Ah, that sounds amazing.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
They're amazing. Green tea Oreos are also good.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I'm kind of glad you didn't bring all that to the show, though, because I've eaten enough this weekend.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
They also have heavy sweet cream Oreos.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
It tastes like condensed milk.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
This is kind of funny to me that this weekend you traveled to the West and went to San Francisco to spend the day.

03:41.000 --> 03:47.000
And I traveled to the East and I went to Reno and went to Wizard World this weekend on Saturday.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.000
And then, of course, we're in Reno. We got to go to a buffet.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
So we went to a buffet, and I am really not proud of how much I ate at that buffet, but it was pretty good.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
You know, I did have something dismaying happen.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
What's that?

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
One of the big reasons I went was to go to Soko Hardware and get a tatsunabe, an iron pot.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.000
And the one I wanted was like $130 for a wrought iron pot.

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
And they had cheaper ones, but I think I'm going to just look online because I really want a good tatsunabe for making sukiyaki and other things.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
I've started cooking a lot more.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
Let me ask you one other quick question, then I want to get to Techmaster Loki.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Because, obviously, this is a video game show and we do talk about gaming.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Did you go to that little arcade they have there with all the imports?

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
I stopped by there, but I had Becky with me, so I didn't play anything.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
Ah.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.000
But you could see it from a little place that you go to get taiyaki.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Alright.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Well, also joining us in the studio tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Hello.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Hey, Loki, how you doing?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Doing fine.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Good. Well, since Dark Soccer and I are kind of pooped from our trips, you're going to need to carry the energy on the show tonight.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
Because before you were here, Dark Soccer and I were like, can we maybe have like a nap segment?

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Like maybe like the official OLR siesta of the week?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
And then we just go silent for five minutes while we nap.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Or maybe 20. I guess 20 minutes is a much better nap than five.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
So you might have to pick up the energy a little bit on tonight's show, Loki.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Okay.

05:11.000 --> 05:21.000
So, one little storyline here on OLR I'm sure people have been following and kind of getting a chuckle out of over the past couple months.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
Was that you used to make fun of me for playing this cell phone game.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
I didn't make fun of you for playing Ingress. I didn't get it. It was like Minecraft.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
You know, where I didn't get Minecraft.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I think that's a good comparison. That's a fair comparison.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
Because when I first played Minecraft, I was like, I don't get it.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
I still don't get it, but I'm playing it anyway.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
So, but you've gone like full tilt boogie on Ingress.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
And right now they're doing a special event, which is like, it's for their third anniversary.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Double XP.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
I just call it XP because for all the role playing games, it's always experience.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
That's basically what it is, but they call it AP because they got to be different.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
So, but it's double that for like a week or two.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
So you've been taking big advantage of this, right?

06:00.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah. So I went from level seven to level nine.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
I'm not nine yet because once you get to past level eight, you have to have like certain amount of medals and stuff.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
It's like achievements.

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
So imagine like to get further in a game, you have to have achievements to unlock stuff.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
So I don't have the achievement yet.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
I don't have a gold medal to level up to nine, but I have the experience to do it.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I just don't have the medal yet.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
That's the only downside of the double AP because Alan gained a lot during that segment when they did it last year.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
And he was short on badges for a little bit as well.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
I think he just barely has the badges to get to 10 or whatever, which I think he's going to hit during this event.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
So kind of interesting.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
So anyway, I just thought the listeners to get a kick out of that, that you've been playing a lot more than that.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.000
I had, you know, some time to take because I had these like floating holidays I had to take before the end of the year.

06:54.000 --> 07:02.000
And I was just like, eh, if I tell my wife what I'm going to take time off or take time off, she's going to watch the kids.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
So I'm just not going to say that I am.

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
And so you better hope nobody plays this for you.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
I mean, it's fine. It's, um, it was only like a day or two.

07:14.000 --> 07:21.000
And it's, you know, I just got out of the house and I was playing that until like eight at night.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
You know what to get you out, get you moving.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.000
Yeah. I, my phone's been buzzing, you know, tell me, Hey, you've hit your walking, you know, thing for the day.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Hey, you've hit a new record of walking.

07:31.000 --> 07:38.000
And you know, so I did a lot of that and, um, I got to frack farm something with some people on Friday.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
So that was kind of fun. I bought my first in app purchase, which I didn't actually, I didn't actually pay for that.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
I answered free surveys through Google, you know, through the Android thing.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
And so I had like five dollars and I'm like, okay, I'm just going to buy some in app purchase for that.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
And I still have money left over. So no real money has actually been spent on it. Okay.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
Okay. Just time, just time. It's very little time.

07:58.000 --> 08:07.000
I mean, anyone has an Android phone and seriously do that because it's like one second surveys and you get like a few cents and they send it to you like a few a week.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
All right. Cool. All right. Well, I do want to also introduce the ever present fourth guest on our show.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
We don't have anybody in studio tonight, but we do have our live chat room and we always appreciate those folks that participate along with our show live.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
It's part of what makes our little gaming podcast.

08:21.000 --> 08:28.000
We have here a little bit special is that we are all in the same room here in the studio, but then we're also with you guys virtually via our chat room.

08:28.000 --> 08:38.000
We do tape live Sunday nights at the voice of geeks network, vog network.com, vog network.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

08:38.000 --> 08:43.000
And if you are listening live, you can always go to our chat room live dot vog network.com.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
We do read chat. We do.

08:45.000 --> 08:53.000
Sometimes if we are not, you know, we again, we don't have time to play every single game in the world because, you know, we all have day jobs and stuff.

08:53.000 --> 09:03.000
But, uh, sometimes you guys that have played games, maybe we haven't experienced, you will end your opinion on something or you might set us, like if we say, um, Oh, such and such game doesn't have this feature.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
You might correct us and say, yes, it does. Or in the case of what happened today.

09:08.000 --> 09:19.000
So to do a, do a small correction, the last week's episode, I suppose I get a message from Shane and he's like, I'm listening to last week's episode and he's like, nobody corrected you on how wrong you were.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
That Dragon Quest heroes is not on Xbox one. And you actually said it was, and now that I was kind of thinking back, I'm like, that's right.

09:25.000 --> 09:33.000
It was a PlayStation four exclusive, wasn't it? So, Hey, sometimes, sometimes even with the help of chatters, we might miss something accidentally, but, uh, it happens.

09:33.000 --> 09:43.000
But anyway, we do appreciate those. You guys that, uh, participate with our program and, uh, looking at the chat room, uh, some folks talking about coffee because dark soccer was talking about the coffee thing a little bit ago.

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
Uh, William murder face and chat says French press for life. Uh, Mr. Rizzo's agrees to the French press. I know Alan's a big fan of the French press.

09:51.000 --> 10:02.000
I have a French press. I also have a 1950s Pyrex percolator, which I love. Um, but Dan doesn't like the way the coffee turns out in it, but I love the sound. And then I have my drip cups.

10:02.000 --> 10:13.000
Um, dark to see in chat says, has Rob seen the Oreo churros? Yes, I have. They're only like one Oreo car in Disneyland. I think it's actually outside, um, in, uh, downtown Disney.

10:13.000 --> 10:23.000
But I, I, you guys, as much as we kind of always talked about Disneyland on the show, I haven't been in over a year now. The last time I went to Disneyland was last E3. I just, the prices have gone up so much. It's sad.

10:23.000 --> 10:38.000
So I've seen the Oreo churros. I have not experienced one yet. Um, let's see. Um, act deft in chat says we have some hazelnut spread Oreos in Mexico or Nutella Oreos, but not actually Nutella. That sounds kind of amazing.

10:38.000 --> 10:47.000
Actually. I told him if he sends me some, I'll send him a Kirby candies from the Japanese store. There you go. That sounds like a good exchange. Uh, let's see.

10:47.000 --> 11:01.000
Um, also going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Alan Alchemy, responding to the, uh, siesta we're threatening to take during the show says the ritual recording of part B will be an hour long. Deal with it. Z, Z, Z. New Adele album plays.

11:01.000 --> 11:18.000
Well, you know, we actually would not be able to stream the New Adele album because she put the kibosh on that. From my understanding, you cannot hear New Adele on Spotify because certain artists that can still sell millions of copies of their albums kind of just give the finger to streaming.

11:18.000 --> 11:32.000
Cause you know, they want to sell more copies of their albums at Target. I sort of say, you know, put it on a delay or people are going to turn to piracy anyway, but whatever. It's, it's an interesting, uh, decision that they make there.

11:32.000 --> 11:44.000
Uh, and blueberry in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says exotic limited edition snacks are the best. It's like finding shiny Pokemons in real life, but you can eat them too.

11:45.000 --> 11:58.000
Who says you can't eat Pokemons? Who says you can't cook a Pokemon? That's what Charmander's for. So if it's anything like, you know, uh, Ingress, you know, recycle. I want to convert this Pokemon into like, I don't know, something.

11:58.000 --> 12:08.000
Well, you, you, you joke about the Ingress comparison, but let us not forget. Those are the guys that are making Pokemon Go. That's why I made the comparison. So yeah, it may, it may, that may be a reality someday. We'll see.

12:08.000 --> 12:23.000
I have to say, just mildly speaking on Pokemon, the new Digimon series came out that's related to, uh, the first two series that came out in Japan and over here. Um, and it's amazing and it's on Crunchyroll.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Okay.

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
I have to say for any other people who were, did you, cause you know, I'm a, I was a big Digimon fan.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I know you were, you were like the only person I knew that watched it.

12:31.000 --> 12:39.000
And there, you know, I played the Digimon games and everything, so it's kind of video game related, but, um, it's on Crunchyroll and everyone owes it to themselves to watch it.

12:39.000 --> 12:51.000
Cool. And you know, um, as much as that Pokemon Go thing, as a, as a Ingress player over a year, as much as when they first announced that I was kind of like, what the fuck? Like I was just like, this doesn't make sense.

12:51.000 --> 13:01.000
The more I kind of think about it and I'm like, I am actually like really excited for that because I think it is going to be the Pokemon MMO we've always wanted, except it's going to be real.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
So are you supposed to like battle people with that or like?

13:04.000 --> 13:14.000
You know, everything is speculation at this point. They've shown one trailer, they've shown nothing on gameplay. Supposedly there was a beta test in 2015, but I kind of doubt that that's happening. I think, um.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
Why am I not hearing this from Kotaku yet?

13:19.000 --> 13:29.000
Maybe, maybe they got blacklisted by Niantic, I don't know. But to be fair, Loki, we haven't heard it either. So, we're just as much hot water as anybody else. So, anyway.

13:29.000 --> 13:40.000
I just, you know what's funny? I didn't even have any, I know this, getting into our kickoff topic tonight. I know that's the thing that like everybody's been talking about on blogs and everything and I know even Bobby was talking about it on his show tonight.

13:40.000 --> 13:49.000
And that's when I realized, when Bobby brought it up on his show, I was kind of looking at our show roll going, oh shit, I didn't put that anywhere on our show roll tonight, even though like that's a big thing.

13:49.000 --> 14:00.000
Because it's not fucking news, who cares if they, oh damn, a website that I don't care to read anymore because it's very sensational got blacklisted by two companies. Well, fuck them, who cares?

14:02.000 --> 14:11.000
I think it's more the precedent than anything else. What if it was a different site that you did like? Because there probably is going on with a site that you do like.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Okay, well if you violate your NDAs, then you're probably going to get blacklisted.

14:15.000 --> 14:23.000
But my understanding was they weren't under NDAs for anything that they spilled. NDAs are usually very specific to what you can and can't disclose.

14:23.000 --> 14:31.000
Because that's the weird thing about the industry is that they've got one arm that's the very public facing stuff and everything that they're pushing and promoting and then there's the other that's working on everything in secret.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
Well, if you do something that they don't like, if you're an entity that's doing something a company doesn't like, they don't have to do business with you.

14:39.000 --> 14:54.000
They don't have to share information with you because they don't see you as a trustworthy source anymore. It's like, well, I understand that you're not going to maybe follow our narrative or whatever as far as what we're putting out of PR and stuff.

14:54.000 --> 15:06.000
That's fine. If a company doesn't want to do that, like a media company, then that's cool. But it's like, hey, we had this big announcement planned and you guys went and fucked it up. We're kind of mad at you for that.

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
So we're just not going to give you the opportunity to do that anymore. I don't see a problem with that.

15:11.000 --> 15:30.000
My whole thing on it is that a lot of this I see parallels as to why I really don't enjoy E3 anymore. And that is that it's about the script and sticking to the script and nobody wants to go off the script and everything is just, okay, you can come spend five minutes with our very blah copy of the game.

15:30.000 --> 15:38.000
Or now it's about, you can come to our theater where you've waited in line for an hour to get in this theater where you can watch somebody else play the game for 20 minutes.

15:38.000 --> 15:50.000
You know, and it's just like, I just, I'm not an on the script kind of guy, but I also don't do this for a living. I don't get paid for OLR. Has anybody here been paid for this show at all?

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
I got a copy of Dragon's Lair once.

15:52.000 --> 16:07.000
Once in a while there might be like a fun little perk and we're always very thankful for that. We have some awesome listeners and all that. But as far as like, do we make $500 a show or something? No. God, no. In fact, we probably pay out more money than we're actually getting in perks.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
But this isn't, like we've been doing it for what? Like fucking 13 years, right? We wouldn't do it if we didn't have fun.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Orange Lounge who?

16:14.000 --> 16:25.000
Yeah, right? So, I mean, it is what it is. But my whole thing is that, and we talked about this when I talked about why I just don't really enjoy E3 as much anymore. I love the networking part of it.

16:25.000 --> 16:37.000
I love to meet people, talk to other people and so forth. But as far as like, it's kind of boring at this point. Like it's just not worth the money to go to LA or the time off work and all that.

16:37.000 --> 16:48.000
But what I love and my favorite part and what I've found has been like the most rewarding in the past year or two working with games is working with the developers who aren't on the A-list.

16:48.000 --> 16:58.000
You know, there's a lot of very hard working game makers out there who are on like the B-list. And there's nothing wrong with being on the B-list.

16:58.000 --> 17:10.000
We've had a lot of great people here on OLR who we've interviewed who are doing some great games, right? And even the indie level things. I love talking to indie people and about the games they're doing.

17:10.000 --> 17:21.000
So there's sort of that side of it where I'm like, okay, well, I think Kotaku in this case, they have a right to answer the question, why did you not review Fallout 4 when it came out like everybody else did?

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
I think they do have a right to say, here's why.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Totally do.

17:25.000 --> 17:33.000
But on the other hand, that doesn't mean I feel that Ubisoft and Bethesda should be strong armed into working with Kotaku.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
No.

17:34.000 --> 17:45.000
I don't actually believe that. I just think Kotaku will have to work better and smarter like the rest of us do who don't have these cushy partnerships with the developers.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Oh, boo hoo, you can't get your review copy. Where's my review copy?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.000
Yeah.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
I didn't get a review copy.

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
So, you know, it's just kind of one of those. And I kind of think, you know, well, then that website with their views.

17:58.000 --> 18:06.000
Okay, so they're not going to be running stories on Fallout 4. They're not going to be running stories on Assassin's Creed, as many maybe.

18:06.000 --> 18:12.000
That's more real estate for them to run stories on people who are probably really desperate for the coverage.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
And that's not going to be what's going to be run on their website. But yeah, I see what you're saying.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.000
Ideally, I mean, again, I very rarely, you know, I've had an issue with that website for some time.

18:24.000 --> 18:31.000
I think things have gotten a little better, but they're not, like, it's still just not a website that is in my rotation, really.

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
But obviously everybody was tweeting about that story. I had to go see what the fuck was going on with that.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
But anyway, that's just my thought on that whole thing.

18:38.000 --> 18:46.000
So going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, I was going to see if anybody was saying about, let's see, Mr. Rizos.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
I was like, everybody's talking about Digimon in chat, and I think that's DarkSaga's fault.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
But I do see some comments.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Hey, Digimon is great.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
No, there's nothing wrong with that, but Mr. Rizos in chat says,

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
I agree with Loki. Nobody who's looking for real info on gaming goes to Kotaku anymore.

19:00.000 --> 19:05.000
SHO100Matt says, I do think that Kotaku is doing their jobs as journalists and reporting news from sources.

19:05.000 --> 19:11.000
If Bethesda and Ubi is really mad about this information being leaked out, then maybe they should be mad at their own staff or clients.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I guess it kind of depends on how they got the information.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Let me finish. That leaked the information out.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
Plenty of companies have ways of locking down the information channels if they wanted to keep information quiet.

19:20.000 --> 19:28.000
I do think that is a valid point. Why are you not more mad at the people leaking the information?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
It's just that they don't know who's doing that.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And I don't know. What were you going to say?

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
I was going to say it depends on how they got the information too, of course.

19:35.000 --> 19:42.000
If they had talked with somebody and they're like, listen, this is under NDA, but here's what we're working on, blah, blah, blah.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
And then they went, oh, hey, here's the information we got from our source or whatever.

19:46.000 --> 19:52.000
And that's kind of fucked up. But if they have anonymous sources or whatever reporting this stuff to them, I mean, whatever, that's fine.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Once again, though, but they're well within the right to blacklist you, though.

19:56.000 --> 20:04.000
You know, especially in a big industry where there's hundreds of people, somebody gets fired or let go for a reason that they're not happy with.

20:04.000 --> 20:09.000
And so they turn to one of these sites and that's how they get back at their old company.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Come on, that has to happen. That has to happen.

20:12.000 --> 20:18.000
You know, and I'm sure that's probably a part of how some of these websites get their information is jaded former or current employees.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
Yeah.

20:19.000 --> 20:27.000
So, you know, anyway. I'm not saying that's okay or that's right or people should do it. I'm just saying that's what's happening.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
No, I want to talk to you. I want to talk to a Bethesda play tester.

20:31.000 --> 20:37.000
Because how how is this stuff like that's good.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
Good enough. I mean, because like I know it's such a double.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
It's such a double standard to be like, you know, oh, what's a Bethesda game? It's going to be buggy as hell.

20:48.000 --> 20:54.000
I mean, and that's why I enjoy those games, because it's like, hey, the dog is stuck under the table clipping through the ground.

20:54.000 --> 21:02.000
That's okay. Like the other day was that the dog was it was stuck in like an animation loop or something like that.

21:02.000 --> 21:09.000
So it kept like sneezing for like five minutes and then start like hacking up like a hairball for like five minutes.

21:09.000 --> 21:15.000
And it was scratching for five minutes. It kept getting stuck in these animation, these idle animations.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
It was kind of funny. Bobby Blackwell has a fair counterpoint here in chat saying,

21:20.000 --> 21:26.000
My response that I said was that the bugs are most likely found by QA, but that the devs didn't have time to fix it.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.000
Most of the bugs were probably reported. So blame the firm release date that they didn't want to delay.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
I think he makes a valid point, because I've definitely heard the story of the QA tells them there's a problem.

21:36.000 --> 21:43.000
And oh, we don't have some of these bugs that are like have been in Bethesda games like from like Fallout,

21:43.000 --> 21:50.000
you know, New Vegas, Fallout 3, you know, Skyrim. These are like bugs that have been in all of these games.

21:50.000 --> 21:57.000
And it's just not been fixed. I don't know. I mean, yeah, I understand that they're not being fixed by the devs,

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
but will they ever? They're not. I mean, honestly. And you know what?

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
At this point, I would be surprised if we see console mods, because they can't get their shit together with the way it is right now.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
I'm going to take one more comment on the Kotaku thing here, and then I want to move on.

22:13.000 --> 22:20.000
ActDeft in chat says both parties involved are in the right here. Kotaku is in the right to be pissed for being called out on doing their job.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
And I imagine he's probably finishing his thought right now. And I'm just reading this early.

22:24.000 --> 22:32.000
But my thought is the one more thing I want to get out here is that maybe it's time to just re-examine this whole process to begin with.

22:32.000 --> 22:41.000
And it's always interesting to me how secretive and how tight-lipped a lot of the gaming stuff is,

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
where they really don't talk about what they're doing in advance.

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
And we've talked and made a lot of comparisons to the movie industry before.

22:48.000 --> 22:53.000
I've always said on this show, game ratings should have the exact same ratings as movie ratings.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
I don't understand why the two are separate, right? We've made comparisons between the two industries before.

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
In the movie industry, they're usually a lot more forward with what they're working on.

23:02.000 --> 23:06.000
And that hasn't ruined anything in movies, as far as I know, right?

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
No, I mean, you get a lot of direction.

23:10.000 --> 23:18.000
I mean, okay, maybe people steal ideas and that's how you get those direct-to-video things like, what was it, like, instead of Snakes on a Plane, it was like...

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Yeah, Snakes on a Train.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Snakes on a Train.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
No, but...

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
I mean, come on.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
That company, that's all they do. They do those knock-off movies.

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
Exactly. I would actually maybe enjoy some knock-off games for parody purposes.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
But, like, I think, I don't know if you really have to worry about companies stealing each other's ideas.

23:34.000 --> 23:44.000
I guess you could say, like, you know, Titanfall, you know, had, like, the mechanics from Titanfall and Call of Duty kind of borrowed those for their last two games.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
So there's some stuff that's being taken from one another.

23:47.000 --> 23:56.000
But you can't copyright those mechanics, even though Konami would like to copyright, you know, arrows moving up a screen and you have to line it up with something.

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
So that's kind of fucked up, but you can't really copyright that stuff.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
So, I mean, I don't see the point.

24:04.000 --> 24:12.000
Maybe that they just changed their mind. You don't want to get people hyped up on stuff that's not going to come out like Prey 2 or Half-Life 3, you know, that type of stuff.

24:13.000 --> 24:20.000
Alright, I'll end with one more comment here from William Murderface in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com who says,

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
I think the main perp here is entitled shitlords on the internet.

24:24.000 --> 24:30.000
I can agree with that. DarkSaga, do you agree with that? The main problem here is entitled shitlords on the internet?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.000
Yeah.

24:31.000 --> 24:41.000
I just, like, you know, I hear Kotaku and I hear that there's something bad happening to them.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
And I'm just like, I just don't care.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
It's not as violent as the reaction I have to certain other gaming websites, but it's, you know.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
You know, it's just like, oh, they're blacklisted. Well, you know, they kind of had it coming.

24:51.000 --> 25:00.000
You know, that's kind of like the way I feel with that. It's just, you know, maybe they didn't, but I just don't fucking care anymore because of so much garbage that's been posted on the website.

25:00.000 --> 25:07.000
Loki's over there going, they had it coming. They had it coming. They only had themselves to blame.

25:07.000 --> 25:15.000
Alright, moving on. The thing I actually wanted to talk about with the kickoff topic tonight is that we have a lot of anniversaries going on in gaming right now.

25:15.000 --> 25:23.000
Which makes sense because this being that week leading into Black Friday and Thanksgiving, you know, this is a huge release window.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
And usually a lot of game systems come out in this timeframe, right?

25:26.000 --> 25:36.000
So, actually, believe it or not, yesterday, the 21st, was the 25th anniversary of the Super Famicom system.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
That's awesome. Were we getting any free virtual console games?

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
Probably not because I don't think there's an Nintendo Direct.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Ah, fuck them.

25:43.000 --> 25:49.000
But November 21st of 1990 was when the Super Famicom, which of course was the Japanese Super Nintendo, that's when that was released.

25:49.000 --> 25:53.000
So believe it or not, that system is 25 years old.

25:54.000 --> 26:05.000
And I think many people would say, I don't know if everybody would say, but many people, including myself, probably would say, probably the best video game console ever made.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
I kind of think. And maybe that's just because of my age.

26:08.000 --> 26:17.000
You know, maybe people who are a little bit older than me, like if you're, or I'm sorry, a little bit younger than me, if you're like 7 years younger than me, maybe you think the best console of all time was the PlayStation.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
Because that's what was out when you were that age.

26:20.000 --> 26:27.000
Or maybe if you're like 15 years younger than me, you probably think it's the PlayStation 2, you know, or something.

26:27.000 --> 26:35.000
Or the Xbox even. But yeah, that's, I think is probably the greatest console they ever did.

26:35.000 --> 26:41.000
Even if it's really funny to look at some of the old ads and magazines, this is something that's been circulating around the internet this week.

26:41.000 --> 26:48.000
Is some of these old ads and magazines that showed just how much those games cost because they were on cartridge.

26:48.000 --> 26:57.000
I mean, you know, I seem to recall, like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II, like at the time, were like $80 games, I think.

26:57.000 --> 27:03.000
Because they were on cartridge. And that was $80 in the 90s, which was a lot of money.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
But those games were hella badass and worth it.

27:08.000 --> 27:17.000
Any quick Super Nintendo memories or favorite Super Nintendo moments or like thing you most anticipated on Super Nintendo to kind of cap this together here?

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
I don't know. I mean, like a lot of the games were really cool.

27:20.000 --> 27:27.000
And I remember I sold my Nintendo to get a Super Nintendo and the first games I got for it were...

27:27.000 --> 27:36.000
I don't even remember what games I had. I know I had Roadrunner's Death Valley Rally, which is like Sonic the Hedgehog on Super Nintendo.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
And I played the shit out of that. I don't remember what other games I had. Probably Link to the Past was amazing.

27:43.000 --> 27:50.000
When we got my Super Nintendo, we got it with A Link to the Past. Of course Mario World came with it.

27:50.000 --> 27:59.000
We had Home Alone, which my brothers played obsessively, and we got the Super Scope 6, which was actually fun. Blastress was pretty fun.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
Tigerclaw on chat at live.fognetwork.com says,

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
I used to play a shit ton of Super Mario World. It was the game that came packed in the Super Nintendo.

28:08.000 --> 28:18.000
Oh yeah. I mean, Nintendo, man, they were masters of the...in some ways still are masters of the...well, they slipped a little bit on Wii U.

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
But they usually are masters of the must-have pack-in game, right?

28:23.000 --> 28:32.000
Think about it. Wii Sports sold that Wii. Super Nintendo was definitely bolstered by that Super Mario World.

28:32.000 --> 28:39.000
I mean, it's one of the best games they ever did on the console, and it was the first, if you think about it, being the pack-in game, right?

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000
And then, you know, Super Mario Brothers being a pack-in game for the original NES.

28:44.000 --> 28:50.000
Granted, depending on which configuration you bought, but for most people they got the Super Mario Kart.

28:50.000 --> 28:57.000
Yeah. Was an amazing Super Nintendo game. It was a pack-in game. Now, Nintendo may have slipped a little bit.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
I don't know if Nintendo Land is on the same level as those other games, but...

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Nope, it was shit.

29:01.000 --> 29:08.000
I wouldn't go that...I wouldn't go far to say it was shit, but it wasn't Wii Sports, and it definitely wasn't Super Mario World.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
No one was like, ooh, it's Wii Sports.

29:12.000 --> 29:19.000
Let's see. Act F says, speaking of anniversaries for Nintendo on November 21st, Amiibo, one year old.

29:19.000 --> 29:26.000
And that's how long it took for you to finally find them on shelves. There you go. One year out, and you can finally find the Amiibo on shelves.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
I bought one today because of Shane.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
Oh God, did he pressure you into Falco?

29:30.000 --> 29:40.000
He woke me up this morning by a text message and said, Lottie's out at Target. So I got Lottie.

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
He's such a little jerk. He was messaging me all day Friday.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.000
I need the 3-pack now.

29:47.000 --> 29:53.000
He was messaging me all day Friday going, you want to get a Falco? The Falco figure's so pretty. It's so blue, you should see it up close.

29:53.000 --> 30:01.000
I'm like, Shane, you are in the wrong line of work. You need to be a salesman. You need to be a salesman. This is what you do so well.

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
I want to get the 3-pack so I can get my DJKK.

30:07.000 --> 30:17.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I'm retired from Amiibo buying until the Cloud Strife Amiibo comes out. Then I will un-retire for one day only and then retire again.

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
I may have to get that. May. But then again, I don't have Smash so that's kind of pointless.

30:23.000 --> 30:30.000
If anybody from Nintendo is out there, seriously, do not make that fucking Cloud a retailer exclusive. Blood will be shed.

30:32.000 --> 30:38.000
That's not a threat against Nintendo. I'm saying, you know those Black Friday fights you see at Walmart? That's going to be nothing compared to those Cloud Amiibos.

30:38.000 --> 30:42.000
You better make sure plenty of those are available.

30:42.000 --> 30:50.000
Let's see. SHO 100 Matt says, Shane waking up Jamie on a Sunday. He clearly likes to live dangerously. That's a very fair point.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
I went back to sleep.

30:54.000 --> 31:04.000
Allen Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, 2014 Sky. Amiibos are trash pandering to hoarders and merch addicts. Manufactured supply shortages. Burn it all to the ground.

31:04.000 --> 31:12.000
2015 Sky. Amiibos cover my body with them and I'll roll around. They're pointy but I don't care. I have 80 of them. Money is no object.

31:12.000 --> 31:15.000
It's an accurate read. What can I say? Opinions change.

31:16.000 --> 31:24.000
No, I still think a lot of the retailer shit they do is bullshit. I don't understand. I don't understand.

31:24.000 --> 31:38.000
I don't understand why Nintendo does not have their own store online where you could just buy the Amiibo and then they know you could preorder them on their store and then they would know exactly how many to make.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.000
They could keep the money. I just don't understand why that's not a thing.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
But see, if they're not in crazy demand, you'll stop talking about them and therefore they don't get the coverage.

31:46.000 --> 31:50.000
They figured that out with the Wii and it's been like that ever since. These artificial shortages.

31:50.000 --> 32:02.000
Because no one is inept enough to be able to not predict their fucking amount of product that they need for their customers for how many years now? Almost ten fucking years.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
I mean, I'm sorry. They're not that stupid.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
This does not ever seem to be a problem with Disney Infinity or Skylanders.

32:09.000 --> 32:18.000
Well, Skylanders actually was a big problem and for Disney Infinity, though, they manufacture fucking toys and they still have those issues as well and they've done retailer exclusive things.

32:18.000 --> 32:27.000
Skylanders I don't think is so bad because at least with Skylanders, for the most part, it's not a franchise. I don't think that people are like,

32:27.000 --> 32:35.000
Oh my god, I gotta get a new one! Well, maybe it is, but at least with Disney, it's like, okay, recognizable characters.

32:35.000 --> 32:42.000
Skylanders, I'm like, who the fuck is this character? I don't fucking care. Where's Spyro? That's not fucking Spyro. What the fuck did they do to Spyro?

32:42.000 --> 32:45.000
My interest in this game is fucking up there.

32:45.000 --> 32:51.000
Let's see, Bobby goes on, he's kind of slamming amiibos a little bit, but then says,

32:51.000 --> 32:58.000
Lego dimensions don't have this problem. I haven't had a problem getting any Lego dimensions anything. Money is no object. Cover my body with Lego dimensions.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
Wouldn't that hurt, though? Have you ever stepped on a Lego? It fucking hurts.

33:02.000 --> 33:05.000
If you step on enough of them, though, it doesn't feel so bad.

33:05.000 --> 33:15.000
Wasn't there a thing circulating on Facebook where now Lego is selling Lego-branded slippers for you to walk around the living room so you don't step on your kids' Legos that they've left all over?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
I'm always positive that's a thing.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
You're telling them to fucking clean it up.

33:20.000 --> 33:39.000
Anyhow, I want to say one other anniversary. This one's a tough pill to swallow, because when we get on here and we say the NES is turning 30 years old and the Super Nintendo is turning 25 years old, we can kind of look at that and go, God, I feel old right now.

33:39.000 --> 34:02.000
But this is definitely one that's going to make you go, wow, time flies, life's short. Also celebrating an anniversary tomorrow, November 22, 2005, 10 years ago, the release of the Xbox 360. Ten years ago, if you can believe it. The Xbox 360 turns 10 years old tomorrow.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
Am I getting any free games out of this?

34:05.000 --> 34:15.000
No, you'll probably get a free avatar. I love how that's Loki's response to all these anniversaries. What free thing am I getting? Happy birthday to me. What am I getting for free?

34:15.000 --> 34:24.000
Well, if they're celebrating an anniversary, I'm not buying them anything, so what are they providing to me as a commemorative thing?

34:24.000 --> 34:47.000
Maybe they'll be a sale. Who knows? I don't know. Anyway. And actually, wow, why did I think today was the 21st? Probably because I was reading the Super Nintendo article. Good, the chair was correcting me. I was testing them. Today is November 22, so today is actually the 10 year anniversary of the Xbox 360. Sorry, my mind was still stuck on the Super Nintendo thing, which was yesterday.

34:47.000 --> 35:03.000
So it's actually today. But one day, differences aside, 10 years. I remember a time here on Orange Launch Radio when we were talking about the launch of the 360.

35:03.000 --> 35:17.000
And speaking of trash amiibo retail shortage, all this stuff, let us not forget the Xbox 360, that was a fucking mess when it launched. Remember that? It was impossible to find it.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.000
Oh yeah, I remember that.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
You had to check retailer stuff online. I remember the only way I was able to get it...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
You had to go buy them out of the back of a car.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
Yeah, I had to go buy... That's right, you bought yourself a... Oh my god, and then didn't it not work or something?

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
No, it worked perfectly fine.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Did it? Oh.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Yeah, it was good. I mean, it died eventually.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
What was the one where you got ripped off? You like went to Stockton or something?

35:37.000 --> 35:48.000
Oh, it was because I went to mod an Xbox 360. I went to mod one, and then they stole it or something. But, you know, whatever. Had like 12 more or so.

35:48.000 --> 35:55.000
So yeah, I had to get... I remember, in order to get one, I had to get the core system. Because Best Buy told me they got five in randomly one day.

35:55.000 --> 36:00.000
And I got the core system, and I had to buy that hard drive separately. But it was like, whatever, I'm gonna pay it.

36:00.000 --> 36:04.000
Because I want to play Final Fantasy 11 on this thing when it comes out for the 360.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
I bought like almost every launch game, and I was disappointed by most of them.

36:08.000 --> 36:15.000
But I did like... Why did I end up playing mostly? I played... I liked Amp 3, actually. That was pretty fun.

36:15.000 --> 36:26.000
I didn't like Perfect Dark because you can't jump. I'm like, dude, what fucking year is this that we can't jump in a game? That's kind of stupid. So, there's that.

36:26.000 --> 36:32.000
As ridiculous as it is, Xbox Live Arcade was really what sold me on an Xbox 360.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
I have way too many Xbox Live Arcade games.

36:34.000 --> 36:42.000
Geometry Wars was a fucking game changer. And if you think about it, a lot of where we're at today in the industry with digital distribution and everything else,

36:42.000 --> 36:47.000
I mean, Xbox Live Arcade was the start of that. So, you know, that's going back a good ten years or so.

36:47.000 --> 36:52.000
And there was a lot of, you know, shovel stuff that came out in those early days of 360.

36:52.000 --> 37:01.000
But you also had a lot of, for the first time, legally emulated versions of classics that included online leaderboards,

37:01.000 --> 37:10.000
sometimes online multiplayer, depending on the game, achievements, and things that kind of modernized these classic games.

37:10.000 --> 37:17.000
And Sneaking! Where are my Burger King games? I was promised a second set of Burger King games.

37:17.000 --> 37:22.000
And they're not here, and I am so sad that there's not more Burger King games.

37:22.000 --> 37:27.000
I understand that you'd probably put them out as an app now, but that's not what... I want a fucking console game.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.000
I'll take it from any fast food place.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
Some folks in chat talking about their best 360 moment. S200Matt says,

37:34.000 --> 37:42.000
The best 360 moment was getting the Orange Lounge radio and Bobby Black Wolf icons that I still have today on the Xbox One.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
Yes, we were fortunate enough. That was back in the days when we were on All Games Radio.

37:47.000 --> 37:54.000
And we were able to kind of group together, and I don't remember the specifics about this, sorry,

37:54.000 --> 38:02.000
but somebody over there, I don't remember if it was Bobby or Scott or whoever, got in touch with the folks at Microsoft,

38:02.000 --> 38:08.000
and yeah, we were able to get those gamer pics on the Xbox 360, which sadly you can no longer get.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
They were cleared off the store some time ago. Because, you know, everything kind of...

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
Microsoft shifted away from those gamer pics in favor of those avatars.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
Oh, that was a good choice.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
Well, you know. But it was certainly an honor to be included.

38:20.000 --> 38:26.000
I mean, think about it. How many gaming podcasts got to have an official icon on Xbox 360?

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
There was only ever two packs. There was, you know, the All Games Network pack that we were in,

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
and then there was the one before that, whatever gamer tag radio was on.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
I think they're the only show out of that group that's still on today. Please don't hate me if I'm wrong.

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
I just don't remember all the specifics. But whatever their network was at the time, I think they had it as well.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.000
So, what? That's maybe like 12 podcasts?

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Orange Lounge Radio Who?

38:51.000 --> 38:58.000
We had gamer pics on Xbox Live. I'm sorry. I don't know what you guys...

38:58.000 --> 39:03.000
Well, you know, Bobby had the most successful icon out of any of them.

39:03.000 --> 39:10.000
Because I believe he was the only one that didn't actually put letters or like the name of his show,

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
because he had his little logo, the little wolf outline thing.

39:13.000 --> 39:19.000
And because it didn't have letters on it or whatever, it can kind of be interpreted.

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
I think many people that were using it have no idea what the Bobby Black Wolf show is, unfortunately.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
But maybe it gave some awareness to him.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Hey, it's a furries icon.

39:28.000 --> 39:31.000
I don't know what the reason could be, but we'll see.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
So, certainly more people were using his than were using OLRs.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
But we were thankful to everybody that was using OLRs. That was pretty cool.

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
Alan Alchemy saying, best 360 gen memory.

39:43.000 --> 39:46.000
Sky, remember when Xbox Game Room was hype?

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Here we go.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
And they were like, we are absolutely supporting this.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
And then it was out for three days.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
And they went, everyone is fired and we're closing it down. Bye.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

39:55.000 --> 40:00.000
Not everything that has happened in the Xbox 360's time frame has been a good memory.

40:00.000 --> 40:04.000
We could also talk about 1 versus 100 again, because I think I bring that up every week.

40:04.000 --> 40:10.000
How I just love the concept of an online game show that's always kind of going.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
And 1 versus 100 was that.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
And when it shut down, I had a cry.

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
Now, thankfully, and granted we've had them on the show to talk about this.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
And you all know we love them over at Jackbox Games.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.000
But they're filling that void a bit with what they're doing.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
And they're kind of leveraging a lot of Twitch, I think too, to make that a little more current.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
But there's something about that 1 versus 100 era that I miss.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
I think the fact that it was live sometimes during the day.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
And you actually had a host who was talking and saying things that were current.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
And a lot of the questions would be about current pop culture stuff.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
And I thought that was really cool, actually.

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
My favorite moment? Grand Theft Auto IV.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
And maybe Saints Row.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
But mainly my modded games in Grand Theft Auto IV.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.000
That was the best gaming experience I've ever had.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
All right, so Xbox 360 has certainly brought us a lot.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I mean, if you think about it, my god.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
Achievements. That was new on the 360.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
And now that's like a standard. That's everywhere.

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
That's on... except Nintendo.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
But even within some Nintendo games.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Yeah, it's on Steam. It's on PlayStation.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
It's in some Nintendo games.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
But it's not system-wide yet.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
I'm assuming the NX will have to have it.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
It doesn't have to.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
I guess not. And I guess you don't have to do anything.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.000
It doesn't also have to have party chat or anything like that.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
Some people can motivate themselves without arbitrary goals.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
But arbitrary goals can be fun, too.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
If you give me donuts, I will take that.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Because it's not arbitrary. I can eat them and they're delicious.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
And then some folks talking about the Red Ring of Death in chat.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Tigerclaw saying,

41:46.000 --> 41:49.000
My first Xbox 360 Red Ringed during a session 1 versus 100.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
Yes, another dark spot in Microsoft's history there with the 360

41:53.000 --> 41:57.000
that cost them a lot of money when they had to extend that warranty.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
I remember my Xbox Red Ringed within that first week.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
You could probably still find that episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
I didn't end up getting my Xbox until, I think, February or March of 2006.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
I feel like it was around Valentine's Day.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
But I remember. And we talked about it on this show.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
Yeah, I got my Xbox. I had to play it for three days before it Red Ringed on me.

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
I had to send it back.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
I think our original never did, but we had another one that did.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
It's just so interesting.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
The second one I got never did. It's still down here.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
That's, you know, God.

42:25.000 --> 42:28.000
And I think about that thing is almost 10 years old then at this point.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
It's crazy.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Anyhow.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
All right.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
We've talked at length about some kickoff topics.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
I do want to get into our gaming week so we can get into the news tonight as well.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
We always like to talk about what we've been playing

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
and where our head is at when it comes to video games

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
going into the show this week.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
So let's talk about how was your gaming week?

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
My gaming week was…

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I'm still tangled over here.

42:52.000 --> 42:53.000
You're right there.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
No, it's the wires here are always tangled

42:56.000 --> 43:00.000
because there's this one that always is intersecting mine right here

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
that needs to not intersect my wire.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Is it the guest mic?

43:03.000 --> 43:04.000
Or is it my mic?

43:04.000 --> 43:05.000
Yep, it's the guest mic.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
It's the guest mic.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
All right. We'll work on that.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
Anyway, so what I've been playing is I played a little Final Fantasy XIV

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
but not for very long.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
because that game is super cute and super fun.

43:27.000 --> 43:30.000
I also played Wrecka today as in the Super Famicom game.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
Dan put in some Thunder Force IV which is pretty fun.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
It's a combination of retro gaming

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
but we also put in The Guardian Legend this morning

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
because we got our EverDrives

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
and so we wanted to see if there was any kind of play difference

43:56.000 --> 44:01.000
or any kind of difference on the intro screen for Gaiden.

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
So apparently we'd always seen no game by Compile and Irem.

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Apparently Irem was the publisher for Compile

44:10.000 --> 44:13.000
and it says that differently on the Japanese cartridge.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
So that was pretty cool.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Really? That's about it.

44:20.000 --> 44:26.000
Oh, and Dan was watching Pat the NES Punks marathon this weekend.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
So that was pretty neat.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
I played a whole shit ton of Ingress, so there's that.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
I'm kind of embarrassed about the amount of time they spent on it this week.

44:39.000 --> 44:47.000
But I did level up from 7 to 9 basically experience wise.

44:47.000 --> 44:53.000
I think on Friday I actually got 1 million AP in one day.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
So that was pretty massive.

44:56.000 --> 45:00.000
And I kind of learned a little bit more strategy with that and everything.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
So I'm enjoying it a little bit.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
It's tiring.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
God, I ate through so much data on my plan.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
It's ridiculous.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
In fact, I'm kind of scared to look at it right now

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
because just in one day I think I ate through about a quarter of my data,

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
which is ridiculous.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
Aside from Ingress, I did manage to get some Fallout 4 time in,

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
so I have my settlements going

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
and I've just been kind of exploiting the game a little bit.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
I played it a little bit last night and I'm still enjoying it.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
It's very Skyrim-ish to me.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
I'm not really into the Fallout series,

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
so I don't really know too much about the backstory and everything,

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
but I'm enjoying it, so looking forward to that a little bit more.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
I'll probably play some more tonight actually.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
And then I played a little bit of Minecraft,

45:50.000 --> 45:56.000
the Windows 10 edition and Xbox 360 edition

45:56.000 --> 46:00.000
because my son's been playing on my old game that I had done in Survival

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
and had a pretty nice map going there,

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
but he's really, really, really into that still.

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
And the Windows 10 one, I missed the update,

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
so I haven't gotten a chance to see they're updating it now.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
We're going to talk about that a little bit later.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
But there's a lot more stuff that they're adding

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
to kind of bring it up to speed with the PC version

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
because I've actually been thinking about going back to the PC version again

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
just for maybe single player play some of the mods

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
because my son watches, like I said, all those mod videos and stuff.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
I'm like, hey, that looks kind of fun. I want to play that.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
So I don't know.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
Okay. Well, that's it for your gaming week.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
Then my gaming week, not quite as active as my co-host

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
because, again, I was out of town for a few days.

46:41.000 --> 46:45.000
I went to Wizard World, which I had a good time there

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
and some fun celebrity sightings and all that, some good panels,

46:49.000 --> 46:53.000
but it actually didn't have anything to do with video games.

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
So except for the fact that I saw some cool video game stuff for sale,

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
I did end up getting a Tron shirt from one of the vendors

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
because, unfortunately, I'm starting to see less and less Tron stuff,

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
so I did get an actual, I think it's a fan, it's not an official shirt,

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
but still, it says Flynn's Arcade with a little disc on it,

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
so I was excited about that.

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
But as far as games, I've still been playing Final Fantasy XIV quite a bit

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
thanks to the new 3.1 patch.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.000
I've been leveling a DPS class up to 60.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
I've been working on Machinist because I already have the Astrologian,

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
who's my healer, it's kind of my main, already at 60,

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
but I want to be a little more versatile in what I can do

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
to help other friends of mine that play the game.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
It's good to have more than one class, so I've been working on that.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
Otherwise, the only really new thing I played this weekend,

47:40.000 --> 47:46.000
they actually had the Overwatch beta open up to a lot more people,

47:46.000 --> 47:51.000
and I was fortunate enough that I was able to check that out.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
I didn't really play against real people

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
because everything I'm hearing online is that it's still kind of a toxic trash environment,

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
which is really unfortunate.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
But I did play a little bit with bots,

48:02.000 --> 48:06.000
and I've got to say, I do really enjoy the different characters

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
and how there's so much variety.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
It's kind of fun to just go through the different characters

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
and see the types of moves that they have.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
I really liked, I think her name was Mei.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
She's the one that uses freeze things.

48:18.000 --> 48:23.000
She can freeze people with a ray, she can drop a block of ice,

48:23.000 --> 48:26.000
she can encase herself in ice and heal herself.

48:26.000 --> 48:29.000
I kind of liked playing with her.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.000
Yeah, I think there's a lot of great character design in that game.

48:32.000 --> 48:38.000
I hope they can do something about removing some of the junk stuff that's online.

48:38.000 --> 48:43.000
And I also really hope that there's some type of single-player mode in the game.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
And in kind of thinking about it, I'm like,

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
you know, there probably won't really be a single-player mode.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
And I've got to be honest, if all it is is multiplayer,

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I don't know if I'll end up getting it.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
I've got to be honest.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
I mean, it would be cool to play with friends and other people from VoG

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
and people that I know aren't going to be dirtbags online.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
But I don't know if I'm really interested in playing a game

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
with nothing but strangers all the time

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
and dropping that kind of money on the game.

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
So I really hope there's some type of single-player experience in Overwatch

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
or I might end up passing on it.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
That's the one thing that kind of concerns me.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
But I mean, the game does look really good

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
and I love the way it runs on my machine.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
It's very smooth.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Pretty awesome.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
ActDeftInChat says,

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
it can't be more toxic than Team Fortress 2, can it?

49:31.000 --> 49:35.000
Well, it's a lot like Team Fortress 2.

49:35.000 --> 49:38.000
The game itself is a lot like Team Fortress 2

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
but with just some very different characters.

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
So I don't know.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.000
William Murderface says,

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
I bet Overwatch will have some sort of grouping system.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
I hope they at least ask some type of question in the beginning.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Like, are you an asshole? Yes or no?

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
And then they put all the yes people by themselves.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
Okay, well obviously a question like that won't work.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
Well, you know what's funny?

49:59.000 --> 50:02.000
On the 360, I remember this was a thing,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
because we were talking about anniversaries, right?

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
The Xbox 360 and stuff they did online.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
I remember when you would first sign up,

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
you would pick, like, which group do you want to be put in?

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Yeah, I remember that.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
And one of them was, like, family-friendly.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
One of them was hardcore,

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
which we all knew was where the dirtbags would go.

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
And then there was another one that was kind of, like, casual or something.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.000
I don't know.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
But they have, like, their four different...

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
I don't know if that ever really was utilized.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Oh, fuck no.

50:29.000 --> 50:32.000
Yeah, I kind of feel like that really did nothing.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
So I wonder if maybe that wouldn't be a bad idea

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
worth approaching in Overwatch.

50:37.000 --> 50:40.000
But I guess if they have maybe, like, ranked mode versus casual

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
or, you know, for fun or something,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
maybe they'll help separate that out a bit.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
But I don't know.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
I mean, I remember doing that.

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
Of course I was in hardcore because, jeez, there's no more hardcore than me.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
And I just want to make sure I make this clear

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
because I can already see this email coming in about,

50:58.000 --> 51:06.000
well, you know, why do you razz Overwatch for having all this online communication

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
but then say Splatoon sucks because it doesn't have it?

51:09.000 --> 51:14.000
The main difference is that when I want to be able to talk to friends,

51:14.000 --> 51:17.000
like, if friends and I are playing, that's a nice thing to have.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
We kind of work around it on the Wii U by using Skype.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
I did play Splatoon. I don't remember if that was last week.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.000
Maybe it was, like, Monday or something, so I forgot to mention it just now.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
But I was playing a little Splatoon online,

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
and we were using Skype to communicate on that.

51:30.000 --> 51:33.000
But it would be nice if that could just be done natively through the Wii U

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
for when I'm playing with friends.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
I did notice Overwatch seems to have a built-in voice chat,

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
which I don't think you get online when you play with strangers,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
and let's all be thankful for that.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
But it is an option when you're playing with friends,

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
so that's kind of cool that that's embedded like a console version of the game would be.

51:53.000 --> 51:57.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with vognetwork.com,

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
use the passphrase TEETH.

52:00.000 --> 52:01.000
Let's see.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says that's a horrible comparison

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
because Overwatch right now is on the PC platform,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
which allows layering background third-party apps.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
Splatoon is what you see is what you get.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I'm not really trying to compare the two games,

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
but I can just kind of see that coming,

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
like, why are you saying this on this game and this on this game?

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
I just want to make that clear what the difference is.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
All right, so that's it for my game week.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
Getting into housekeeping tonight.

52:26.000 --> 52:30.000
There is sadly going to be no OLR this next Sunday

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
due to the holiday weekend,

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
and I know Dark Soccer is doing something else.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
I feel like you said you were doing something else, Loki, but even if you're not,

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
well, oh well.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
You're ingressing.

52:38.000 --> 52:41.000
But many of our listeners will be out doing other stuff, too,

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
so with the Thanksgiving holiday this weekend,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
we will not be doing a show on Sunday.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.000
We could go do that.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
What?

52:48.000 --> 52:49.000
Ingressing.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.000
We'll see.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
I don't know if I'm going to end up out of town or not.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
That's the other thing.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
I'm kind of on the fence on if I'll be out of town or not.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
All right, we'll see.

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
So we'll play up here.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.000
So there's that next Sunday,

53:00.000 --> 53:03.000
and we're still going to try to make it work,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
but I do want to remind everybody,

53:05.000 --> 53:09.000
GamerX is coming up, or GX as they're calling it this year,

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
and VOG Network will be there,

53:11.000 --> 53:14.000
although I just found out we're not going to have electricity at our table

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
because we have to pay for that,

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
and it's going to be too much money,

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
so I have to figure out what we're going to do.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
It's a standby, but Dark Soccer and I were talking before the show.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
We think we have some good ideas,

53:23.000 --> 53:28.000
but we will be there having a good time with the people and the event itself.

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
There's going to be a lot of great panels.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.000
I know there will be some good cosplay and some fun things to see,

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
so we will be at GX in San Jose,

53:35.000 --> 53:38.000
and that's going to be the weekend of the 11th, 12th, and 13th,

53:38.000 --> 53:41.000
which means we may not have a show the 13th.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.000
We may have a short show because the only problem is

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
if we don't do a show the 13th,

53:46.000 --> 53:49.000
we're going to have no show this Sunday, show, no show again,

53:49.000 --> 53:53.000
and especially with me having been sick a couple weeks ago,

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I really don't like missing that many shows.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I know y'all are understanding and so forth,

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
but I don't want to fall out of your rotation on your podcast app

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
or however you listen to this show,

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
so I do want to try and maybe get a short show,

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
maybe right as we get back from GX,

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
because I feel like we did that last year, didn't we, Dark Sakura?

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
We came back, and didn't we start a show at 7 o'clock?

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
Yeah, I thought we did.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
I feel like we did something like that, so we may do that again.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
So, Loki can go ingress for an hour and then come to the show.

54:17.000 --> 54:22.000
I'd be playing more Fallout if my wife would get off the TV.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
I mean, honestly.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
Maybe that'll happen.

54:24.000 --> 54:29.000
Okay, seriously, if she watches TV,

54:29.000 --> 54:32.000
I have to figure out whatever the hell I'm going to do to entertain myself.

54:32.000 --> 54:37.000
If I want to use the TV, I have to find things to entertain her with.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
Like, I have to have a book for her or something, which is fucked up.

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Vidpower in chat says,

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Oh, hey, Jennifer Hale will be at GamerX.

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Yes, that's true, Jennifer Hale will be there.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
Dark Sakura.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I'm going to follow her around like a lost puppy.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
I can't imagine.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
Dark Sakura will meet Jennifer Hale in a couple weeks,

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
and that's going to be an amazing meeting.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
Yes, that'll be great.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.000
Very excited for her.

54:56.000 --> 55:00.000
And there's going to be a lot of interesting, diverse people there.

55:00.000 --> 55:05.000
So, I'm a little sad that the Ellen McClain, John Patrick Lowry thing

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
didn't end up panning out because I think they ended up having a conflict.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
I'm a little sad about that, but I understand these things happen.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Some celebs always have to cancel the con.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
It's not anybody's fault. It just happens.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Same thing happened last year, too.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
I know, right?

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
That's kind of unfortunate.

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
But there'll be a lot of other fun guests there, so I'm excited to do that.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
And you know what?

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
Dark Sakura and I will be there.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.000
And hopefully you guys will be there.

55:26.000 --> 55:29.000
Some of you out there, at least in the area, will be there as well.

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
And we're going to have a good time.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
We'll play some Jenga.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
Sounds good?

55:32.000 --> 55:35.000
Bobby says don't break the ice.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
Don't break the ice.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Bobby says that LuckyWish is falling forward on the Wii U

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
so he can play it on the GamePad.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.000
Yes, I actually do wish that I could play it on the GamePad.

55:42.000 --> 55:48.000
But oddly enough, I actually have the components to build a GamePad-type device

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
for other systems.

55:50.000 --> 55:53.000
I actually had planned on doing it at one time and purchased everything.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
Just never got around to making it because I would have had to 3D print a case

55:57.000 --> 55:58.000
and I don't have that.

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
But I might be able to work something with duct tape.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
All right.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Let's get into some gaming news.

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
We're only, what, an hour into the show?

56:07.000 --> 56:08.000
I haven't touched a bit.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
Well, maybe a little news.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
But we're going to get into the bulk of our gaming news tonight right now.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Loki.

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
So hey, Sony has actually confirmed that they're going to be working on

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
utilizing PlayStation 2 and emulation.

56:19.000 --> 56:23.000
So they're trying to get that technology to work on the PlayStation 4

56:23.000 --> 56:28.000
to be able to bring PlayStation 2 games to the current generation consoles.

56:28.000 --> 56:31.000
And of course, they have nothing further to say at this time.

56:31.000 --> 56:40.000
I still don't understand how it's not possible that the system can't emulate PlayStation 2 games

56:40.000 --> 56:44.000
because, hell, a PC can emulate PlayStation 2 games.

56:44.000 --> 56:47.000
And I'm not even talking about a really powerful PC.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
A PlayStation 3 can emulate PlayStation 2 games.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
And I'm not talking about the ones with the backwards compatibility.

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
So I would assume that a PlayStation 4 can do that.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
Hell, let's not even worry about PlayStation 2 games right now.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.000
PlayStation 1 games.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
A fucking PSP can run PlayStation 1 games.

57:09.000 --> 57:13.000
Why is that not a thing already on PlayStation 4?

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
To be fair, and I'm sure somebody's yelling that back at us

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
as they listen to this show, wasn't there the whole major chipset change

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
that came between the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4,

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
that they changed that type of graphics chip?

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
I understand that, but it's a PlayStation 1.

57:25.000 --> 57:29.000
My old phone could emulate a PlayStation 1 game.

57:29.000 --> 57:32.000
I kind of feel like, okay, and that was kind of a question I have,

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
is that, okay, if they're going to get the PlayStation 2 games playable,

57:36.000 --> 57:39.000
then PlayStation 1 would just be a given with that, right?

57:39.000 --> 57:43.000
Because didn't the PlayStation 2 just natively play the PS1?

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
And it wasn't even like when the 3s were first out,

57:47.000 --> 57:50.000
because the PlayStation 3s had a 2 in them, basically.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
They were like 3s and 2s in the same box.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
That's how the emulation worked.

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
I think they still have the chipset from the 1 in there as well, but...

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Yeah, because the 3s played the 1 game. I don't know.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
So I feel like...

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
They had the chipset there at one time,

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
and then they went and software emulated everything,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
because on the PSP you could do it.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
But that's my thing.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
The PSP can run it.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
The PlayStation 4 can definitely run it.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
You can't tell me there's something that the PSP can run that the PlayStation 4 can't run.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
I'm assuming it must be compatibility stuff,

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
because at this point, since the hardware's not in there,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
they're having to turn to software emulation.

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
You're right, you can do it through software on the PC,

58:24.000 --> 58:27.000
but if they're going to be selling these games at whatever price,

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
they've got to be able to do it.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
You know what?

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
You know what? I'd love to see, actually,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
because we're getting into that whole Windows 10 thing

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
where you can use a lot of the Windows 10 apps and stuff,

58:35.000 --> 58:39.000
cross and play with Xbox One and stuff like that.

58:40.000 --> 58:44.000
I would love to see a bleem situation where you're having, you know,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
someone can easily build an emulator, hide it somewhere,

58:46.000 --> 58:50.000
and just, oh hey, they can play PlayStation 1 games on your Xbox One.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Who knows?

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
One other thing I kind of want to ask with this whole thing, too,

58:56.000 --> 58:59.000
is I'm curious to see if they're going to allow it

58:59.000 --> 59:04.000
where you can put the PlayStation 2 disc in the PlayStation 4,

59:04.000 --> 59:05.000
and it'll work.

59:05.000 --> 59:08.000
Because now they're getting a little bit,

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
this is where the competition is a healthy thing,

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
because Microsoft is now really needling PlayStation.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.000
I think in their latest ad, at least the one out of the UK,

59:18.000 --> 59:23.000
they even did a riff on, you remember that PlayStation 4 video

59:23.000 --> 59:26.000
that they showed at E3 that had everybody screaming

59:26.000 --> 59:31.000
when they said, look how easy it is to play used games on your PlayStation 4.

59:31.000 --> 59:35.000
And it was like one of the executives handing the game to another one.

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
How to play your friends' games or something.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
And they kind of smiled, and it's just that easy.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
I remember they showed that at E3 and everybody was just screaming laughing

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
because it was such an amazing shade throw at Microsoft.

59:46.000 --> 59:51.000
Well, I want to say, Microsoft UK released some video this week

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
that was a parody of that, but it was backwards compatibility,

59:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
and they even say in it, you don't have to rebuy your old games.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
You own them. They're yours. That's stupid.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I feel like they even said language that was kind of like,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
you shouldn't have to buy your games again.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
So they're kind of putting baby in a corner here with PlayStation 2.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
And I 100% agree, you shouldn't have to rebuy your games.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:22.000
I think it is stupid, Nintendo, that you have to buy those virtual console games again.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
And that they're tied to a console, which I don't have anymore because it broke.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
So maybe, question mark, that's the slow down,

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
is that what they're trying to do is instead of being able to offer

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
select titles for download on the PlayStation 4,

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
they're going to open it up so all of them work on the PlayStation 4.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Because then the shade throw, now what they can do

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
is they can throw shade right back at Microsoft and be all,

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
and it's not just some PlayStation 2 games.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
It's not just 104 games. It's all the games.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Well, that's cool that they can say that.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
It's all the games except for the PlayStation 3 games,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
which you don't play on this because if we're comparing generations,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
it's totally different.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And that's fair and that is still something I think all of us want to see.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
But it's a start. It's better than where we're at now.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I just want something. I mean, it would be nice to have this

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
because I did buy some PlayStation 1 games,

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000
and I just don't feel like hooking up my PlayStation 3 to play them.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:28.000
And I think there's just so much worth revisiting classic shit

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
that so many people didn't play.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I want them to play Import.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Yeah, that would be great too.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Then I don't have to dig out my JPS 2.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Well, and then there's things out there now like VibRibbon

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
that they finally officially released in the U.S., even if digitally.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000
But that would be cool that you could play that on the PlayStation 4.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Didn't they say when they released that at E3 or whenever that was

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
that they actually said we're working on the PlayStation 4 stuff?

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000
How long has it been? It's been a little while now.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Well, I think it would make sense that I have Norwegian Lock

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
because that's how they were with PS1 games on Xbox.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Not Xbox, what I'm saying. On PS3.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
My assumption is this is imminent with the PlayStation experience.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000
The PlayStation experience is in two weeks.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
It's the week before GamerX in San Francisco.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Maybe they have nothing to announce right now

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
because they're going to announce it in two weeks.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000
I kind of feel like if you don't hear it out of that,

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
then I don't know what they're planning to do with this,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
but I really feel like this is coming out of PlayStation experience.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
And just, again, to tinfoil hat this a little bit,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000
didn't they say a long time ago,

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
we want to enhance the PlayStation games on PlayStation 4,

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
meaning we want trophies.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
We want basically more support of those games.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000
So, I mean, if they come out with that at PlayStation experience

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and say not only can you emulate the PlayStation 2 games,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
but they have more than they had before,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
that's going to be a really, I think, cool addition to the PlayStation 4

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
that's going to have a lot of people perking up a little bit.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Even if they don't have the three games.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I mean, yes, I want to see the three games as well.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
You do. We all want to see the three games.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000
But, I mean, there's still a lot of places where you can get PS1 and PS2 games.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Go to any garage sale or flea market.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
There's a ton of them out there, so we'll see what'll happen.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
All right.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Anyhow, let's move on with some more news,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
and I want to talk a little bit about the Xbox One in all this.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.000
And the Xbox One getting a feature that was on the PlayStation 4,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
and that is now you can remap buttons on the Xbox One controller.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
It's not quite the same as it is on the Elite controller,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000
but it's a lot more than what was there before.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000
So now there's a centralized way through the Xbox Accessories app

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
that launched as part of the whole UI overhaul

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
where you can actually swap buttons.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
So you can have one button do the function of another.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
So X can do what LB did and so forth.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
However, you cannot remove button functions entirely

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
or allow multiple buttons to one function.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
That is still on the Elite controller.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.000
But still, it's a pretty big step for people that need that button remapping in their games.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:17.000
So that is now available on the Xbox One where it was not before.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Even though it wasn't a part of this story,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
we were talking a little bit with our pal Bobby Blackwolf

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
before we went live with our show tonight

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
about some of the accessibility changes and so on.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
And something else that came out with this was more narration on Xbox One

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
where it now is reading more to you about basically what's going on.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Not that it's going to read for you what's going on in the game,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
but it's telling you a little bit more about what buttons are being pressed and so forth.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000
And funny enough, we were wondering if one of our blind listeners was listening

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
because he's called into this show before, Sturlock,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
and he's talked about that experience and so forth

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.000
so that additional narration would kind of enhance that, I would assume.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And Bobby did let me know in private message.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:09.000
He did hear back from Sturlock after he ended his show who said,

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
It's pretty amazing. It's leaps and bounds ahead of what Sony has at the moment.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
You can actually do most things, even buying games.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
PlayStation 4 is still extremely limited.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
So that's really rad for accessibility

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
and allowing more people to be able to enjoy video games.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000
So good move on Microsoft's part.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
All right, let's move on. Darcyra.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Well, we have had a lot of discussion about YouTube

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000
and how, well, really the discussion has been more complaining,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000
which is very us to complain on this show.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.000
You know what? Yes. Yes, we do.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000
So they have finally listened or at least responded to the complaints

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000
about various fair use videos being taken down.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
And so they released this statement.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
YouTube receives a lot of takedown requests under copyright law

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
asking us to remove videos, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Sometimes those request target videos that are clear examples of fair use,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So they are really working on trying to analyze if they are legitimate or not

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:31.000
by continuing to say that they've set up an initiative.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
And I'm going to continue.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
YouTube indemnifies creators whose fair use videos have been subject

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
to takedown notices for up to one million of legal costs

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
in the event that takedown results in a lawsuit for copyright infringement.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
This ensures those creators have a chance to protect their work

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000
and makes the entire creative world better by educating people

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:58.000
on both the importance and limits of fair use doctrine.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:05.000
However, this is only available to some people and not all people.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I guess maybe they're taking their biggest, most high-profile users

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
and offering them this kind of protection.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000
So this would prevent the takedown requests from going through.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And if they are sued, then YouTube's going to cover the legal costs.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
That's great.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
And that's one thing I've bitched about for the longest time on this show

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:37.000
is where is the fucking accountability of the people filing these copyright takedowns wrongfully?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And why does YouTube not side with the people that are basically giving them the money,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
which is their content creators?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Finally, we're seeing that happen, at least in some capacity.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And I'm willing to give YouTube the benefit of the doubt

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
that they need to test this with a small group before they open it up to more people.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And I would imagine, especially what they're offering to do there with legal coverage and so forth,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
you may have to meet a certain threshold of subscribers to qualify for it and so forth, which is fine.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.000
But I'm so glad that they're putting this accountability in there for the people issuing the takedowns.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:16.000
On the page about the details for this, they give examples of what fair use are using user-created video content.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
It's only US videos for right now.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And overall, really, the hope with this, I think, is that by showing an example of how fair use is,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:38.000
and giving an alternative, that this could spread and give copyright holders a little bit more of an idea of how they should be acting.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
And also, this relates to gaming, certainly for Let's Play and so forth.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:50.000
But I believe one of the people that YouTube is backing right now is, and god, I forget his name at the moment,

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
but he's a huge commenter on...

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Jim Sterling.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000
That's it. And he actually had the bits and pieces of Metal Gear.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Wasn't it like a read on Konami and then Konami pulled the video?

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.000
No. Well, I mean, that was, you're thinking of Angry Joe, then he had...

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Oh, I got my wires crossed.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I remember the Metal Gear one where he was talking about Kojima and stuff, and they had pulled down a video.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Or no, it wasn't him, actually. There was some other dude that did that. I'm sorry, I can't remember who now.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.000
There was somebody that was talking about the whole thing, and then they got their video pulled, and then they got reinstated by YouTube.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Jim Sterling had some other ones. He normally gets stuff, because he does his best of Steam Greenlight trailers,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:38.000
and he'll make fun of terrible-looking games, and he gets some of these small indie developers that'll pull that on him.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Even the way he's doing his fair use, they just don't like it.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:48.000
He did a video on his thoughts on that. Of course, I haven't watched it yet, but I will link it in the chatroom to watch during the break.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I did, because I follow him and I watch that stuff.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:57.000
He basically talked about that process that he was actually contacted by YouTube about this,

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:03.000
and they kind of went through and how that's going to work with these different types of videos, and they're using that point.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Well, he sure raised a fuss when it happened, as he should.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I've also raised a fuss, but I don't have the YouTube following he does.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000
He's had several small studios do that to him, too. They'll pull a copyright strike and threaten him,

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
and make all these threats against him and his family, and stuff like that.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:29.000
It's ridiculous, because if you don't like it, it's criticism, and he's a critic, and too fucking bad.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.000
So, good. I'm glad to see YouTube is taking steps in that direction. Hooray.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000
So, that makes me feel a lot better. It's not 100% better, but it's a huge step in the right direction, that's for sure.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
I'm excited to see how that plays out. Let's move on. Logie.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Alright. So, along with that, this is kind of another company that I haven't really bought from them before,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
but I'm aware of them, and the company is called Green Man Gaming.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
It's one of the Steam outlets that you can purchase Steam keys from. There's a lot of different ones out there.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:12.000
But, I guess they've been running into a problem with different publishers saying that they're not an authorized reseller for their keys.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:20.000
So, for example, Witcher 3, the Wild Hunt, when it was coming out, apparently some of the keys, they weren't acquiring them legitimately,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:29.000
and some were not guaranteed to work. Also, with different new releases like Call of Duty, Black Ops 3, or South of the Screed Syndicate,

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:38.000
both Activision and Ubisoft have contacted them and said that they are a non-authorized reseller,

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:46.000
and some of the DLC that was supposed to be with those games weren't included with it, because they were getting them through some other means.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And, apparently, Activision and Ubisoft, they're saying that they're not authorized to sell EA, Bethesda, Warner Brothers, and Devolver Digital and ArenaNet games.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000
So, I don't know. It's interesting. I guess just be careful who you buy from.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
But, I thought they were pretty legit. I mean, I know they do sales and everything.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:18.000
I still think it's a good thing that the Steam Marketplace does have multiple locations that you can buy things from,

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:26.000
so there's a little bit of competition there, as opposed to some of the other companies out there, or even the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Some comments from Chad on this over at live.vognetwork.com. William Murderface says,

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000
There's been murmurs about them since word leaked that there were Witcher 3 keys may have been unauthorized.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.000
And Bobby Blackwell says, These are the guys buying Humble Bundles for a dollar and reselling the keys.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Which is, obviously, extremely tacky behavior.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I don't remember them exactly being that part of that, but if they are doing that, that's not a good thing to be a part of.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:04.000
No. Absolutely not. I should say allegedly. I don't know where the story is to back that up, but Bobby doesn't usually throw stuff out there.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000
I know there's other sites that did that, but yeah, I don't remember them doing that specifically.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster adding to the Witcher 3 thing says, CD Projekt essentially came out and said they didn't get the keys from them,

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
so I have no idea where they came from because it was a launch title for their GOG Galaxy.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Well, and the other thing too about their keys, too, is some of them were for other regions, too, so they were sending the SO.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Who knows where they're getting them? Yeah. Somewhere.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And I've heard of that, too, where some websites will sell Russian keys for games and they sell them way cheaper because...

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Piracy is an issue or something. Yeah. Unfortunately.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Alright, well, let's move on. Let's talk about Dark Souls 3. I know people are looking forward to that game.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:02.000
That's a series that's been going on for a while, but the director of the game, Hidetaki Miyazaki, says he doesn't expect that he'll be continuing to make these Dark Souls games.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:09.000
In an interview with GameSpot, he says that Dark Souls 3 will be the last in the series, or at least that's what he considers.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:15.000
In the quote, quote, I don't think it'd be the right choice to continue indefinitely creating Souls and Bloodborne games.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:25.000
I'm considering Dark Souls 3 to be the big closure on the series. That's not just limited to me, but FromSoftware and myself together want to aggressively make new things in the future.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I believe that FromSoftware has to create new things. There will be new types of games coming from us, and Dark Souls 3 is an important marker in the evolution of FromSoftware.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Can one of those be another ChromeHounds game? I don't think they made ChromeHounds, but maybe they did. I don't remember who made that. I know it was published by Sega.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:49.000
But I know they do Armored Core, and I love Armored Core, although I haven't bought the last few games from them. But I'd love a new Armored Core game. We can make it super hard, too.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:02.000
It's a tricky situation, because I'm one of those people that's like, yeah, I want Bioware to make Mass Effect games forever, or at least as long as they're still good.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000
And Dragon Age.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:14.000
When they start being bad. But I also can kind of respect when he's like, I don't want to do these games forever, and maybe there's a point where I want to end the story, or what have you.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.000
I sort of think maybe just because he doesn't want to do it doesn't mean somebody else will pick up the rights.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:30.000
You know, like maybe, who knows, throwing crazy talk out there, like maybe Sony picks up the rights and has one of their in-house people do it or something.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
You know, it doesn't mean these games will stop forever, but I can understand why he doesn't want to be involved with it anymore.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
So, maybe Konami will pick up the rights and make a pachinko machine out of it.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Who knows? Anything is possible.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And Bobby Blackwolf is confirming FromSoftware developed ChromeHounds.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Alright, I just couldn't remember. But yes, new ChromeHounds game.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.000
And Dungeon Buster says, if Dark Souls 3 is the last one, I'm okay with that. Love the series, but I'd love to see what else they can do.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Yeah, and I think there's a lot of people that are kind of, I think it would be okay to give the series a break.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Go work on something else for a little while and then maybe revisit Dark Souls on the Playstation 5 or something, if you want.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
You know, if the fans are really clamoring for that or what have you.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Alright, and William Murderface says, can we get a PC port of Bloodborne, please, and an Xbox One port too?

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000
I think there was some type of deal though with Sony on that, because Sony has been putting their promotion dollars in it.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:30.000
So, I don't know. Maybe it's a timed window thing, kind of like Rise of the Tomb Raider, but we'll see.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Well, this is an interesting one, although it's kind of a big duh as well.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:47.000
But there is research. They analyzed 500,000 data points for League of Legends players.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:56.000
That the usernames are reflective of the type of behavior that people show in game.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Meaning that usually players who are a bit more profane or antisocial also have usernames that reflect those same type of traits.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:19.000
Whereas, you know, people who are kinder and more positive, those who are team builders or leaders, usually have the names that reflect positive traits.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Kind of a big duh, but at the same time it's just, it's leaning, it's giving an idea of more what to look for, ways to kind of, you know, play safely online.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:44.000
And they are actually now looking into using these data sets that they've gathered as methods for studying human psychology.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Ways to find people with clinical disorders who are playing games and whatnot. So, pretty interesting.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.000
The whole study's been published online. Put out by, looks like the University of York.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:09.000
So, I mean, even though you kind of say it's a duh, it is kind of an interesting stopping and thinking point about, you know, what is that username that you put out there maybe say about you.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And we'll get into this a little bit later with the FUGU Question of the Week and so forth.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:25.000
But I guess it's probably not a big surprise to hear that if somebody has a big name that's like the mixed caps, that's like, you know, Sephiroth misspelled 666.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:32.000
That person's, maybe, maybe they'll be cool. Actually, we used to have a listener that was like Sephiroth something with numbers. He was cool.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:38.000
But like, usually there's a lot of guys that use those names and like, you know, devil.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
They're also using those to determine age as well.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Because some of those have to, are more having to do with age and maturity level.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:55.000
But my thought is people that have those names with the mixed case and the punctuation and all that and the leet speak, those are usually the ones that are dirt bags in chat.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Whereas, you know, if you have somebody that's like cat loving grandma 123, probably not the person that's going to be as aggressive. You know what I mean?

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I mean, I realize some people are always going to be ironic and there's that. That doesn't always work 100% of the time and I wouldn't want to make assumptions.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:20.000
But I can certainly see where, okay, a good majority of the time, what you kind of put out there is going to be reflective of that a little bit.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
But it kind of makes me stop and think about, I wonder what my username says about me.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Like when somebody goes into a match and sees my name, like what they must think about me.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:37.000
You guys kind of wonder that maybe like, what do you think your username says about you?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
He misspelled ski.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Probably on Twitter and stuff. Or yeah, a lot of people say that. Which is, it's actually funny.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
It's very lighthearted name.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:55.000
It's funny you bring that up. Where that comes from, and I haven't told this in a long time on the show, is that I had the name Green Sky years and years and years ago.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:03.000
And the whole point behind that was, if the sky was green, which I love green, if the sky was green, that would be different but cool.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
And that's me. I'm different but I'm cool.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Like that was, I don't know, everybody has a weird story behind their name, but in my mind that's where I got the name from.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.000
But then I found out, that name apparently is really popular. And so it's taken on a lot of sites.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.000
So a lot of places I have green s-k-i-e, because I would spell it wrong so I could actually get the name.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
That's where my gamer tag comes from and all that, right?

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.000
But then at one point I was just like, it's a long name and I don't have to be green. So I was just Sky.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:39.000
But now, honestly, I'm kind of like, I actually kind of want to change. I don't think I really want that name anymore.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I'm always like, I'm Rob Roberts, but I'm Sky.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Rob Roberts is my online identity at this point.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:54.000
So I would like to change my Twitter, if I could, to Rob Roberts, but a spam account has it.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
So I can't change it.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
I can't change mine to Jamie Summers because it's a porn star.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
You could.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Well, and then there's a part of me that's like, should you let go of a four character Twitter name?

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Nope.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.000
That's some rare real estate. And there's a part of me that's like, maybe I shouldn't actually let go of a four character Twitter name.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I got hate because someone else wanted Dark Sakura.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Oh, too bad, so sad.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Oh, well, there's places that have taken that one as well.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So I use my fallback, which is Kuro Tsubasa.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:29.000
And I have a Gmail name all the time. I'm getting stuff that is not for me.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Like, and just like, and I get a lot because it's one of those things where it's like a very simple name.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
And I know Bobby has talked about this on his show, too.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:42.000
I'm bringing Bobby up a lot tonight. I should have just had him on Skype as a host tonight.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
But Bobby, I know he gets that a lot with his name, too, because he's Black Wolf.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And I think a lot of people, you know, that's a very, you know, it's kind of like Green Sky.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:57.000
It's a color object. It's kind of like a very, a thing that people want to grab.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
So it's interesting to me.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Loki, what do you think your name might say about you when you play online?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I don't know.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Doesn't say much about me until I play with somebody and they're like, I hate that guy.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.000
They probably think of the Thor movies.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Yeah, probably. It wasn't from that, though. It was from The Mask, because I was a big Jim Carrey fan.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:24.000
But I like Loki from the Thor movies as well.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:31.000
But you know what's funny is that when I play other stuff, like Ingress, I have a very not-so-serious name that I use in Ingress.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And it's one of those things where it's because I just think, I just think it's funny.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And it's one of those things where video games aren't serious and it's just a video game.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:48.000
And so, you know, when it says my name is blowing up your portal, I just want people to kind of chuckle because it's not fucking serious, you know what I mean?

01:22:48.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Yes, and then there's people like, also real player in the area, Phillip gets them wet, that, you know, that is a legit player that happens to be on our side.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Woo!

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Yeah, there's a lot of people that use the names like 6ix9ine and 666 and, you know, all that stuff. Whatever. It's a video game. It's not that serious.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Let's see, going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Dungeonbuster says, I love the really creative ones. One of the neatest ones I've seen for a cleric was Blessedabon.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I do love a good, funny name. And I, you know, not to toot my own horn, but when I was playing World of Warcraft, I played a monk, a Tauren monk in the Pandaria. I played a Tauren monk named Calmane. And I, you know, usually got a chuckle out of that.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
I loved making fun names like that. Remember I had Rebecca Black?

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I do, I do.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000
I found quotes that I say for the person who was following me around singing.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.000
But I had Mookal, remember?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Yeah, I do.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
M-U-U-C-A-U.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Mhm.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.000
And, god, those are fun. And then, of course, the whole RIP characters.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000
PrincePeachFuzz in our chatroom says Blaze420.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Seriously, with a name like that, what do you think most people are going to assume?

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:16.000
When you play a person named Blaze420 on Xbox, what are you going to assume about that person?

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
They're going to be easy to beat because they're high. That's what you're going to assume.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
They're hot and they're a Taurus.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:30.000
That's going to be my new online name, HotTaurus, which is funny because I'm actually not a Taurus.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.000
But, why not?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Alright, let's see. And TigerClaw says,

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.000
For years, I wasn't happy with how Google forces your real-life name to show up in your YouTube account

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.000
until they changed the rules and I was able to put in my nickname so that it shows up instead of the real life.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I found out you can put your nickname in first, then put a dot on last name since the dot will be invisible.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Yeah, the Google forcing your real name thing, that was kind of a mess as well.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000
But I think they did kind of go back on that a little bit.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Anyhow, moving on. Let's talk release dates. We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Let's start with Loki in the US.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:16.000
So there's nothing coming out this week, surprise, because it's Black Friday week and everything.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
But, since we're not going to be here next week, I'm going to go ahead and talk about what's coming out in the first,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:29.000
which of course includes the next purchase I will be making, Just Cause 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as well as PC.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Also coming out, and I didn't realize this was even coming out now,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:38.000
but Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, that's coming out on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Also they have a Kung Fu Panda game, Kung Fu Panda Showdown of Legendary Legends for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, 3DS, and I'm assuming on Wii U even though you don't see it on there.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Well, for some reason they're re-releasing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas yet again on PlayStation 3,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
so that's also something else to look forward to.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Xenoblade Chronicles X coming out on Wii U on the Friday, on the 4th.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000
And that's it, although looking at the following week, I can't believe that Devil's Third is coming out.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
I didn't even realize that was coming out. Not that I even give a shit.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.000
Presumably Chronicles looks good. I'm not sure if I'll pick that up though. Maybe.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out some releases over there,

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:30.000
such as Blade Arcus from Shiny EX is on the PlayStation 4 from Sega on the 26th of November.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000
Farming Simulator 15 is also out for you farmers.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Also, God Eater Offshot is like a twin pack. Volume 2 is being released on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:48.000
And Mato Kironai Yugi Itai Daybreak Special Gigs comes out in Japan this week.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
All of that on the 26th.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Checking out the Wii U, we do have a release on the Wii U this week. It's Taiko no Tatujin.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Atsumete Tomodachi Dai Sakusen comes out this week in Japan,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
so I wish we got those Taiko games here in the US,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:08.000
but I understand when they tried it, it didn't sell very well, so it is what it is.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:11.000
On the Vita, lots of stuff on the Vita this week,

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.000
because Vita games in Japan is actually a thing, unlike it is here.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Criminal Girls 2 in regular and limited edition.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
The God Eater Offshot I mentioned before is also on the Vita.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
Goze comes out in regular and limited edition this week.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Kasato in regular and limited edition.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:36.000
Net High Ryuyoku no Melodia Diva with the Blessed Dragonol comes out this week on the Vita as well.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
And Shin Sankoku Musou 7.5 Empires.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Also, one more.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Jaigen Taisen Neptune vs. Sega Hard Girls You May Know Gatai Special comes out as well this week.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
I have no idea what this game is. It looks like some type of role-playing game.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And I don't know if Sega characters are in it or something,

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
or why it has the word Sega in the title, but I'm not seeing that in the graphics.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
So, hmm.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
But there you go.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Maybe it is Sega characters, because it does say on the Sega logos on there,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Idea Factory and Compile Heart are all contributing to this game,

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
so maybe there are some Sega-related characters in this.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
They've had a few of those RPGs that were crossovers between three of those.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Yeah, and they get more of the crossovers over there than we do here.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
We don't always get them over here.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Had them before, I just don't remember when the last one came out.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
It was like 3DS or DS.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Right.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:37.000
This week in Japan on November the 26th, Ikatsu, my number one stage in regular and limited edition.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:43.000
But, probably more people looking forward to a huge release on November the 28th.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Monster Hunter X is out on 3DS.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.000
That is going to be a pretty big deal.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
So, that's on the 3DS this week.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
And that is it for Japanese release dates.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
We have a few things in the UK.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Let me make sure I have the right date.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.000
On the 24th, we have The Whispered World for iOS.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:12.000
For the 26th, we have TrackMania Turbo on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And on December 1st, I'll go ahead and extend out a bit,

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.000
we have Just Cause 3 and Rainbow Six Siege.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
That's it.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
But, Dungeon Buster, talking about the Sega game.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Saying, haha, Sega Hard Girls.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000
It's an anime with personified consoles.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Terrible animation, but it has its fans.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
There you go.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
I thought that was...

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Maybe I'm confusing it with the other...

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
What was it?

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Of course, now I can't think of the goddamn name of it.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Hyperdimension Neptunia?

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000
That's what I always think when talking about, like,

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
consoleized girls.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Because, I mean, they're supposed to represent the different game consoles and stuff.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
But, maybe that's a different series all the other.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Well, now I'm trying to go back and actually look at the artwork

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
to see if maybe I can see, like, the consoles.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
That could be, well, I don't know.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
Let's see, I'm trying to bring it up here.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Of course, I had closed it when I was done reading the dates.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
But, that's some good insight from Dungeon Buster there.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
So, I'm actually looking at the artwork.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
I mean, is...

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Oh, that's a Dreamcast controller on her head.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Okay.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
That is... I see it now.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
So, she's got a Dreamcast controller on her head.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
This one's a Genesis controller.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
So, okay. I see it now.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
So, it's consoles as anime ladies.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
I see now.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
They did Hyperdimension Neptunia with the original Xbox.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000
They have a really, really plus-sized woman as the Xbox.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
The original one.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Oh, because that thing was...

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
The size of a house.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Let's move on, Loki.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:55.000
So, apparently EA has confirmed that they're working on a new Assassin's Creed-type game.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And, this is, of course, because, hey, guess what?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
They've got, you know, Jade Raymond, you know, joining EA.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
And...

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
I mean, it just makes sense.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000
They said, we've never really operated in the largest genre of gaming.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
That's the action genre.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I mean, I don't know.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
They've had other action games.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
They've tried to have action games.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.000
I mean, I guess they consider a lot of their games shooters.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000
But, they're trying to make, like, an Assassin's Creed-type game.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:30.000
So, more open-world, more single-play versus multiplayer.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
Hmm.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Which, I like single-player games.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
I don't like Assassin's Creed, but...

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
I don't know.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
So, maybe this is something that we could see at E3 next year.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000
I just don't like stealth action games, is my thing.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.000
And, maybe you don't have to play Assassin's Creed stealth-ly.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000
But, I just don't really like stealth games.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Like, if my Assassin guy would be just kind of like Leroy Jenkins,

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.000
just kicking down the crowd and shooting people in the face.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
That's not really stealthy, so...

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
He breaks down the door with a ham-sar voice.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.000
I'm the best Assassin ever!

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Can we just get, like, I mean, here's what I would like to see, okay?

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Let's just back up here.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I would like to see, like, a Deadpool through time game.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
You know, if you want an Assassin game, I want a fucking Deadpool game.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Like, and you can set them in, like, every single genre that Assassin's Creed's been in,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
as a pirate back in the, you know, the American Revolution days.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
I'm down with that.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.000
As long as Deadpool's in the game.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
He's trying to seduce Bea Arthur.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
I think it would be amazing.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Alright, I got one more story for you guys, so we're gonna get to the classic game.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.000
And speaking of classic games, appropriately,

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:43.000
there's apparently a quest, so to speak, going on right now to bring back Bubsy.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Do you guys remember Bubsy?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Yes, I do.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Yes, I rented that game.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000
Yes, the Bubsy Two-fer, which is two of Bubsy's classic adventures,

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Bubsy Two-fer is on Steam Greenlight.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Oh, man, you can't even get that instantly published?

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Yeah, it's kind of weird that it can't just get instantly published,

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.000
but for whatever reason, yeah, they want to bring back these classic Bubsy games,

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
and they have this whole hashtag campaign going and so forth,

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
so it'll be interesting to see how the Steam Greenlight goes.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
It'll get in, because it'll ironically get in.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
It's getting a lot of coverage as well.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
There's really terrible games that get, you know, put in there,

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:24.000
and this is a legitimately old game that's not that great, but it was okay.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Can we bring back Gex while we're at it?

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Because Gex was pretty fun.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000
And by the way, those two games that are a part of this collection,

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000
we have Bubsy in Claw's Encounter of the Ferdkind,

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000
which I believe was the first game, and then Bubsy Two, which has no title.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
Bubsy Two, we're not creative enough for a subtitle.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:47.000
So I guess the last update, this is pretty high up on the Steam Greenlight chart,

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
so it seems like a given that this will end up getting greenlit,

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
but I'm kind of with you, I'm kind of surprised it didn't just automatically get put through.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
So, weird.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
And then folks in chat saying, Alan Alchemy says,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
Bubsy One was amazing, but wasn't the second one shit?

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
And then goes on to correct himself, okay, Bubsy 3D was the bad one.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000
Yeah, Bubsy 3D was...

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000
Bubsy 3D was what pretty much killed the entire franchise.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:14.000
So, yeah, hopefully the original...

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
It was an awkward time, it's like puberty,

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
like everybody was getting into the 3D games,

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.000
they didn't quite know what to do with it,

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.000
and then unfortunately they just shit out Bubsy 3D.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
And there's a lot of really bad 3D games that came out around that time.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000
It was an awkward stage of gaming.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Kaijuto in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
I remember Bubsy and the only thing that was good about that game was

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000
he tapped the TV screen if you let him stand too long.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Other than that, the game sucked ass.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000
I didn't think it was that bad, unless it was Bubsy 3D.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.000
But I do remember, the standing still animations are always

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
some of my favorite in games, that's for sure.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Let's see.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
And bobbyblackwolf with a reality check saying,

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Just because a game is old, it doesn't mean people will re-buy it on Steam,

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
hence the green light.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
I just kinda, I don't know, I guess I thought people had

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
fonder memories of Bubsy, but maybe,

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
maybe Bubsy 3D has still tainted people to this day,

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
because even Alan was like,

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000
it wasn't one of those games, real shit.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Let's see, and tigerclaw is asking,

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000
you guys remember the Bubsy animated cartoon?

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
No, didn't that not become a thing?

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
I remember there was one, but I don't think I ever watched it.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Whenever I think of an animated cartoon like Bubsy,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I would think like, what was that, was it Bonkers or something?

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
It was something that was part of the Disney lineup or whatever.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Alan Alchemy in chat at live.fognetwork.com saying,

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:45.000
King's Quest VIII equals worst game to come out of the proto-3D-as-the-norm

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Quake Half-Life 3D Awkward Puberty era.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Yes, talk about a franchise killer.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I mean, King's Quest VIII pretty much killed that franchise until like,

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
just recently they did the whole, you know,

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000
kinda re-imagining of the series on consoles,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000
but those games play very differently.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
What about like Dragon's Lair 3D?

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Didn't they do like a 3D Dragon Lair game that wasn't very good either?

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:09.000
I feel like they did like a real Dragon's Lair, something that was on like Xbox,

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000
like original Xbox or something.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
So, anyway, let's move on.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
We would need to get into the classic game of the week.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
We're running kinda long tonight, believe it or not,

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
but we do need to step into the vault where every week

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000
hey, play some cute music and put on this game.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
And this game is one with cute music,

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000
actually we're gonna talk about it tonight.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.000
Dark Sakura, taking us to Japan tonight to visit the classic game of the week, right?

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Classic game of the week is Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Yes, I'm doing this one.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000
And I realize I've already done Super Mario 2 or Super Mario USA.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I am specifically doing Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Because I want to go into this for a particular reason.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Nintendo has sold out.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000
They've done it several times in the past.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.000
You know, two of the times that they did this,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000
and this is of course going back to the 80s,

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:22.000
and yes, Garris makes my heart go Doki Doki, thank you, Alan.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000
But three times in the past, and this is one of those times,

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000
did Nintendo sell out.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:35.000
One of them was with Kete Kita Mario Brothers,

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.000
where they just were advertising stuff the whole time by reskinning Mario Brothers.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
There was On Night Nippon Super Mario Brothers,

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000
which was another reskinning of Super Mario Brothers.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.000
And then there was this.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.000
This among those was the first time that it was a full game meant to advertise.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
I was gonna say the real big time that they sold out was probably the CDI games.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
I'm talking about for advertising.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000
So anyway, Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic,

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000
which will translate to Dream Factory Heart Pounding Panic,

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:22.000
was released in conjunction with a very limited event that happened in Japan.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:28.000
It was for the Yume Kojo 87, which was a carnival done by Fuji TV

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:33.000
to promote its fall lineup of shows.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.000
It was a big carnival, and one of the things that they had going on

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:47.000
was a sort of dedicated Rio de Janeiro style carnival with masks and everything,

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
which of course was also mildly influenced by Marty Roth.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000
This only happened for about a month and twelve days.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000
It lasted from July 18th to August 30th, 1987.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000
So it wasn't very long.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:08.000
And a lot of the ads for this were masks.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Just all these masks.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:16.000
And a lot of the styles of the masks showed up in the Japanese version of the game.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:25.000
So how the shy guy and the little bird hopper guy and all of these things were wearing the masks.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.000
And you had a mask motif in the background.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:35.000
What for us were the mushroom blocks were actually different types of masks.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
One of them looking very much like Gene Simmons, I must say.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000
The characters in the game were the mascots from the carnival,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000
which had sort of an Arabian Nights kind of theme.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:59.000
So you had the main character who was Imogene, and then Mama, Lina, and Papa.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:05.000
And they were going into a bedtime story where Wart was a character in the story

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000
and he kidnapped their children Pokey and Peaky.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000
So there was...

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.000
It was really in its core advertising.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.000
However, we got a really good game out of it.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.000
Kind of a confusing game at first, but a really good game.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000
And I really more wanted to go into the backstory of how this came into play.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Because not too many people...

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I mean, people know that, yeah, it was the You Make Hojo game,

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:47.000
but they don't really know how it came about or what You Make Hojo was or any of this other stuff going on.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.000
So other things this game had in it, as far as big differences,

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000
is that you had to beat it with all four characters to get the ending.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Oh my god. Can you imagine beating Super Mario Brothers 2 with Toad?

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Yes.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Not for me, no thank you.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Peach or Luigi all the way.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
It's funny, Luigi was Mama.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And Luigi actually has a higher jump than Mama did.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
So some of those were changes.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
You could not run.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:24.000
The run feature was something that had been a Mario thing,

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:29.000
so they didn't implement it until they put the Mario stuff on it.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
In the Japanese version, you could kill Wart in four moves.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:37.000
They bumped it up to two in Super Mario 2.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000
But in the prototype, it was four.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Bumped it up to six.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Yeah, bumped it up to six, sorry.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
They bumped it up by two.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Sound effects change, like the little creatures don't scream when you kill them.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
The Fanto actually was also redesigned.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
You had different masks as well.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
And it wasn't as...

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:09.000
It wasn't as, I'd say, aggressive as it is in Super Mario Brothers 2.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:14.000
The White Mouser was changed because he was actually super hard and very erratic,

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
so they put in Claw Grip, who was not in the original version at all.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
The sound effects are the big thing I noticed.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
You can even hear it in this Birdo fight.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Let me turn it up a little bit.

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Yep, it's screeching.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000
What's the mask? Look at the gate.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
The gate's a masked bird instead of the, sort of, falcon-looking thing.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:48.000
The Gray Sniffit is in the manual for it, but didn't show up in the Japanese version.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.000
The musical score shortened a little bit.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:57.000
The Subspace music was its own. It was sort of an Arabian theme.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
Oh, here it is.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Dammit, it just passed by.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:04.000
You could hear it in the background for a little bit there.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
The character playing this just went into Subspace.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
The Starman is in there, but a different music plays.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000
Your mushrooms, where you go to gain extra life, are hearts.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Which makes sense that you have the hearts on the side.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
You have a save feature in the game.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Some of the sound effects actually had to do with the fact that it was the disk system versus the NESP,

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.000
so it had different, with the different pin connectors.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Actually, you can go back and play this one, because that's a little bit longer of a theme.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Oh, they're already out of Subspace?

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Yeah.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000
That's a good one.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Um, anyway.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Some of the platforms were changed around.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Some of the artwork was different.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Okay, so here it is.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:14.000
The animations were, uh, they actually added animations for the US version,

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
so they improved upon that.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Which was really weird, because in some games, like Contra, they removed animations.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:30.000
The explosion blocks say bomb B-O-M instead of bomb, and the bomb thing was just for Super Mario Bros. 2.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Some of the vegetables looked different as well.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:37.000
The one up mushrooms were the heads of whatever character that you were controlling,

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
and the potions were actually lamps.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
They were magic lamps.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
One thing that was very big is that when you could pull up a shell in the US point,

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:50.000
in the Japanese one in Doki Doki Panic, it was actually a little head.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:57.000
And it was in the game called the Big Head, but it was actually a face in blackface.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:06.000
So, granted, that's a pretty good reason to get rid of that, given that's a very, I'd say, racially insensitive thing.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:10.000
So yeah, a few things were different about the ending.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:18.000
You, uh, instead of rescuing Subcons, you rescued Pokey and Peaky,

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000
and you're standing on their cage while they're still inside it.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
You know, you don't get the-

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Oh, here's the star music.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
It's different. It sounds like something out of Kid Icarus or something.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Yeah.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Another thing is that you don't get the who beat how many number of levels,

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:39.000
because, honestly enough, you have to play through the game with everyone.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.000
Yeah.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.000
So, there's a need.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
And so, that's it.

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:51.000
That is the differences with Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic and why the game exists.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
It's basically Nintendo giving advertising.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I like some of these comments in chat here over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.000
S2100matt saying,

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Seriously, Mouser doesn't get that much love in Mario games anymore.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:10.000
You know, a lot of the characters from Doki Doki that crossed over into the Mario universe,

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
you know, kind of retconned in, essentially,

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:16.000
you see Shy Guy a lot today, but that's really the only one.

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Like, you don't see a lot of the other Mario 2 mobs,

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
and it always kind of, you know, and I know I've said this on a show before,

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000
I'm always kind of surprised that Wart never came back as a villain in any other game.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Is he just, does he just suck compared to Bowser?

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Maybe he actually died.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Mario actually murdered him.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000
The sub-cons executed him, and Mario went back to the real fucking universe,

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
where somehow there are Shy Guys,

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:47.000
which my theory about the Shy Guys is that when they take off their masks,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:51.000
they're the big blue puffy things hanging around in Klonoa's universe.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Akdeft is screaming in chat because, in all caps,

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.000
because he was a dream, he never existed.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Okay, like, this is a fucking video game, people.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Like, that could stop the story from, I mean, come on.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.000
It doesn't matter. He could still, he could still be a villain in a game.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I'm linking a few of the posters for the game, the promotional art,

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.000
that, um, it's kind of interesting because it actually does show, um,

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:20.000
Mario and Peach with the characters that they replaced.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.000
Um, I just find it very interesting, you know, um,

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:31.000
it was really, I'd say, you know, and given, I mean,

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
now this is sort of common knowledge now,

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:37.000
the real reason why it became Super Mario Bros. 2 over here

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
is because the lost levels are fucking hard.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:43.000
What we got is the lost levels were hard, but that was Super Mario 2.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:48.000
And it was actually in that game that Luigi got his higher jump.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.000
So, since then, though, this game has had a big influence

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.000
on the rest of the Mario games, because you think about it,

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Peach has always had her floating in any game that she's played in.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Yeah, and Act Deft actually said,

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000
I like how they transferred the abilities in Super Mario Bros. 2

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
to Super Mario 3D World.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Well, now then, that part of the dream ended up working out, didn't it?

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
See what I mean? They can bring back what they want.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
It doesn't matter, it was a dream.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.000
And Toad was the fast puller, a little lighter on his feet.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
He knows how to pull out.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Mario was always the middle-of-the-road guy. He's the reliable one.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000
And Luigi has his weird floppy legs.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000
And I would always call him Crazy Legs Luigi,

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000
ever since I was a kid, ever since playing this game.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.000
DartTet Studio says,

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.000
I'm sure I mentioned it before,

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:39.000
but Video Game Historian did a thing on Super Mario Bros. 2 and Doki Doki Panic,

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
and seems like those characters were from Fuji TV,

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
so maybe that's part of why. I didn't realize that.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
No, they were mascots for this event.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000
For the Yume Kojo 87.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Because the theme of their carnival was an Arabian theme,

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
and they created the mascot.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000
I see.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:02.000
And his whole family and everything was specifically for that,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:03.000
but all the masks...

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
The family never came over.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
They were...

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
The family doesn't come over in Mario Bros. 2.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
They changed them to Mario and Luigi.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
Oh, well, yeah, all of them changed.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Even Ima Jean, the main character.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Mama was replaced by Luigi.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
What was the girl's name again?

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000
The dad is Toad.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Papa is Toad.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Yeah.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
And I'm trying to find the girl's name again,

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
because I had it a second ago.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Lina. Her name was Lina.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
That's it.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:39.000
And she got...

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
But yeah, that last picture they posted in chat room

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.000
was from a telephone card.

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000
They did a lot of promotion for the event and for the game,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000
and it really seems like a lot of work to go into this,

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
and that carnival thing was huge.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
It was a really big thing,

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
but it only happened for just over a month.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
So that's really the part that blows my mind.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000
It's like where the World's Fair used to be years and years ago.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
I guess, but this is really...

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
And I guess Nintendo is still doing it,

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
because they sold out with Mercedes.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
That's true.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:15.000
It hasn't ended. It hasn't ended.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Alright.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Yeah, but that's really it.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000
There it is.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000
It's basically Nintendo advertises for Fuji TV.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
There it is, your classic game of the week,

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.000
Doki Doki Panic,

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000
the game that would become the Super Mario Brothers 2

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000
that we know here in the US.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Alright, we are going to take a break.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
We're running long tonight, but that's good.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000
We're having some good discussion.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:38.000
We're going to have a little more.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
When we come back, after a quick break with you guys,

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000
your emails, your phone calls,

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000
the Fuqua Question of the Week,

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
and more news when Orange Lounge Radio returns,

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
right after this.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:00.000
live tonight with episode number 622 of our show

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.000
for November the 15th of 2015.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
We're having a pretty long show tonight.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:06.000
Funny how that works sometimes.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
We had a lot to talk about in the beginning of the show,

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000
a lot of anniversaries to celebrate in gaming with this,

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000
leading up to the big Thanksgiving holiday,

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
and of course, the shopping,

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000
and I'm using my quotey fingers,

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:21.000
holiday that comes with that Black Friday.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.000
I'm curious, anybody in here planning on venturing out

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000
on any of that Black Friday stuff?

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.000
I don't support it.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Yeah, it's not for me.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000
I can't deal with the crowds.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000
No.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
I actually have to work this year.

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I don't have Friday off,

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
which is a little different for me.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000
But, you know, there's a lot of people out there

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
working hard that work on Thanksgiving,

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
and not even just retail,

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.000
although certainly a lot of people in retail just get,

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
oh my God, they get put through the ringer this week,

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
so my prayers for you all.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Isn't there supposed to be some steam sale going on or something?

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
A lot of restaurants, movies.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Is there a steam sale?

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
There's a steam sale coming up.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
They're doing a fall one,

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.000
and then they're doing a winter one as well towards the new year,

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000
and then this time, I hope it's not a story they were going over.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000
No, this time they're doing, like, it's different.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
They're not going to have the flash sales or anything.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
It's just going to be a sale.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Here's the price.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000
That's it.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000
That's probably for the best.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000
They did a lot with the whole robot game last time.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Well, I don't know if you saw me.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.000
I was looking at Red Box

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
because they're selling off some of their games

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000
between now and Black Friday for like under $10.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Like they had Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and Ghosts.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:39.000
It's not my cup of tea, but Assassin's Creed Unity was like $9.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
I was trying to get Far Cry 4,

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.000
but yeah, good luck finding a kiosk that has a game from last year

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
still in their kiosks.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.000
And if you do buy it, good luck at being actually a diss.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:56.000
If there is a sale coming up, does that mean I can maybe get 10% off Fallout 4?

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Too early for that?

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
I don't know.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
You never know.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Maybe.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
You all right over there, Dark Sakura?

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Wasabi Kit-Kats.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Ugh, it's too spicy.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000
I want the Sakura Matcha Kit-Kats, but it's a little expensive.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000
Oh my gosh.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Someone send me some.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:12.000
You're going to be full of Kit-Kats.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000
You're going to turn into a Kit-Kat.

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000
You're going to eat so many of them.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.000
All right.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Let's give me a break.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
You mean to break you off a piece of that Kit-Kat bar?

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Yes.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000
I believe that was the joke, Loki.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Yes, I believe that was the joke.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:33.000
It's just a little bit of highbrow pun there, but I kind of gave her a dirty look for it

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:34.000
anyway.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
All right.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Let's please get back into some gaming news quick before Jamie tells another joke.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Get back into gaming news.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
So, let's see.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.000
So, for rapid fire news, we've got Telltale confirming that they are working on season

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
two of Game of Thrones.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Apparently the first one sold pretty well.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
So, hey, why not?

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
Because, you know, the fans are asking for it.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
So, let's keep it going.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
So, I'll have to look forward to that.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
I still have not played the first season, and I know I think I had the first episode

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:06.000
free, so I may have to check it out.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:12.000
So, with each Black Ops game that comes out, they have, like, of course, you know, the

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Nuketown map.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:19.000
And this time, and of course each one has a little Easter egg, usually involving the

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000
mannequins.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
This time they have some robot mannequins.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.000
If you shoot the arms off of them, it kind of, within two minutes, and that's off of

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:34.000
all the mannequins, it turns into this, like, I don't know, really crazy, like a creepy

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
weeping angel thing.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000
And if you don't know what the weeping angels are, those are basically like these monsters

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
that when you look at them, they're completely still.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000
You turn your back to them, they run up to you to try to kill you.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
And so, that's what happens in the game.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.000
And then when you do that, all the robots start chasing after you when you're not looking

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.000
at them, and you turn around and just like in mid-pose, like striking at you and stuff

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000
like that, and it's crazy.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000
But then they can actually hurt you in the game.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.000
So, that's something to check out if you decide you don't want to play multiplayer on Nuketown

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.000
and you want to kill two minutes by shooting all the arms off of the robots, then go right

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000
ahead and check out that Easter egg.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000
And speaking of kind of like a Silent Hill type of Easter egg, Norrin Reedus has come

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.000
out saying basically Silent Hills still needs to happen.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.000
And he's super bummed that the whole thing just kind of blew up.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Basically saying the internet buzz about Silent Hills happening was so huge.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.000
I've never seen anything like it, petitions with hundreds of thousands of people that

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000
signed it, petitions to please make it happen.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000
That's crazy.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
That's a crazy fan base for not just a video game, but also for people making that video

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
game.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:45.000
And for me to jump on that truck with him, I was like holy balls, it has to happen.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000
You need to do this.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
And then of course Konami said fuck that.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:58.000
We're just going to make a pachinko slot machine out of that.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Why is it like every week on this show we have a story about how Silent Hills is just

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000
continuing to disappoint us?

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Because it was like such an amazing thing.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Like the last few Silent Hill games have been kind of meh.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.000
And then they're like, hey guess what?

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
We're going to do this shit fucking right.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:17.000
And it's just like the way they announced it was right, the people behind it, it just

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000
felt so good.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.000
And then Konami's like, fuck it.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.000
It's like the greatest tease of them all.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Aside from Half-Life 3.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Alright.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Let's move on and talk about Rock Band.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
And guess what?

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Rock Band 4 is going to be getting an update.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Which is good because it kind of needed one.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:42.000
So it's getting an update on December 8th.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
And some of the features that will be going into the game.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Leaderboard and friend challenging.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
More detailed song results.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
In-depth statistics.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Improved calibration.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
More items in the rock shop.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:57.000
A mode that automatically plays the drums kick pedal for you.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:00.000
Which is something, you know, again we talked about accessibility earlier.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:01.000
People have been asking for that for a while.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000
So that's good that's there.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
And also I just suck at using the kick pedal.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
And there's that too.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:11.000
And a full combo tracker that marks which songs have been full comboed.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:14.000
And gives you an in-song indicator to show if you're doing it.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Or if you have actually broken your combo.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:23.000
And the tracks from Rock Band 3 will finally be able to be imported into Rock Band 4.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000
Not hearing anything about, I don't know if that includes Rock Band 2 and 1.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Because that's 3.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
But we'll see.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.000
So anyway it sounds like a lot more features coming out on December 8th.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000
Maybe what should have been there when the game came out.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
But I guess better late than never, right?

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
So there's that to look forward to.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Moving on, Don't Starve Shipwrecked.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000
Which, you know, if you played the original Don't Starve.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Which a lot of people have lost many hours to that game.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000
It was one of the early PlayStation 4 download games.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
And of course it's done very well on Steam as well.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
But Don't Starve is getting an expansion called Shipwrecked.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.000
And it's coming out on Steam early access on December 1st.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:08.000
New seasons, new creatures, new biomes, and many other new ways to die.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
Hooray!

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:16.000
Many different types of job classes to hopefully not die as you're playing Final Fantasy Explorers.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
That's right, 21 jobs announced for the game.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Which is weird to say that they've announced them because the game has been out in Japan for some time.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:29.000
But I guess it would be appropriate to say some of the PR push is starting now.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
And this is one of the early PR things that they're putting out there.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Is here are all the classes you can play in Final Fantasy Explorers.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Which include things that, you know, if you're playing Final Fantasy XIV or other Final Fantasy games.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:46.000
You probably are familiar with things like Machinist, White Mage, Black Mage, Dark Knight, Bard.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.000
You probably know all those classes.

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:51.000
But there are some other long time dormant Final Fantasy classes that are coming back.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Such as Sage, Alchemist, Blue Mage, Geomancer.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I know those were in Final Fantasy XI, but I haven't seen those otherwise.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Blue Mage.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.000
Yeah, lots of fun stuff coming to the game there.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
So I'm excited to pick that up.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Even if it is a little different than your normal Final Fantasy game.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Because it's a little more Monster Hunter.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000
I still want to check that out when it comes out in January here in the States.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
Dark Sakura.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Excitement!

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:22.000
There is, I didn't announce this to anybody.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:28.000
But I broke my, um, I popped my Kickstarter cherry.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
With this one.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:35.000
The Hot to Full Boyfriend plushie Kickstarter has passed $95,000.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:40.000
When I went to check on my contribution, it actually passed $100,000.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:43.000
So, um, all of the birds are unlocked.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
There's limited stock.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:51.000
For people who earlier pledged the $25 tier and up.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:58.000
You actually get to pick one more bird.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:01.000
You can add another one for $12 each one.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
I got emails on it.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:09.000
The $25 tier, by the way, gives you shoes so he can stab you in the back while you sleep.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
You get Ryota, who is adorable.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:14.000
And you get Okasan, who is really funny.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000
So, those are great.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:26.000
And then, um, Capcom has confirmed a second round of Street Fighter V characters.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Um, well, they've put out shadowy images of them.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:37.000
But the thought is that it's Alex, Guile, Ibuki, Balrog, Juri, and Urien.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
So, who knows.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:48.000
And then, um, last but not least, um, the Mega Man Legacy Collection will not have a physical release in Europe.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000
It looks like it's going to be, uh, download only.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.000
So you do not have a chance of getting the gold Mega Man amiibo.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Sorry.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
That's it.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Alright, let's go to the FUGL question of the week.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000
And we read some of our favorite answers on the air.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.000
And if you're not following us on Facebook, you should be our friend.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Be my friend on Facebook.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.000
You can also, if you're one of those that's like, oh, I don't do Facebook, then maybe you're on Google Plus.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:40.000
And you can add us over there at Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000
This week's FUGL question of the week is about a story that Dark Soccer was talking about earlier.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Uh, where, what does your username say about you?

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.000
So we asked our listeners tonight, what is your username when playing online games?

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.000
And what do you hope that says about you to the other people playing?

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.000
This is probably a tricky question because we didn't get as many responses as we usually do.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
But we did get a few good ones here.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Um, Brad's starting us off tonight over on Facebook saying, my username on just about every platform is Pod Culture.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000
What it says is that I am not above shameless plugging for my podcast.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:18.000
Excellent answer. Excellent answer.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
As you, as you shouldn't be. It's a great show too.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:26.000
Uh, Tiger Claw is responding to us on Facebook saying, my username has always been Tiger Claw since day one.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000
The name was taken from the video game Wing Commander, which had a ship called the Tiger Claw.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
You know, I don't think I ever realized that.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
And Wing Commander was an awesome game.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:38.000
He probably told this story at some point like six years ago, but I forgot.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:42.000
So that's a great, Wing Commander series is awesome.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
Um, so that's cool.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
Uh, it was a name that has stuck with me ever since.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
And what does it say about me? I don't really know.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:53.000
But recently there's a new character in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series on Nickelodeon called Tiger Claw as well.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Which is why I changed all my avatars to reflect that character.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.000
I never thought I'd see the day where a nickname I've been using for many years is also the name of a character.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
That just puts a smile on my face.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.000
They must have seen your tweets because you were a big supporter of the Ninja Turtles movie and all that stuff.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.000
That was a shout out to you, bro.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.000
That's, you never know. At least it's fun to think that, right?

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Alright, how about Redertainment who responds and says, I am Redertainment.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:22.000
What I hope my name says is that I am entertaining and red.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Also, names don't necessarily correlate with behavior.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
I mean, my real name is Hunter and I've never once hunted.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Rob doesn't rob people and Jamie doesn't, well, what is it to Jamie somebody? Is it dirty?

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.000
The name is the female version of James which means a supplanter.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Oh.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
I've looked it up.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Um, for the record, this is talking about nicknames.

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
So these are names that you would be choosing yourself.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000
I see.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:52.000
But do you celebrate Arbor Day, just out of curiosity?

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
That has nothing to do with planting.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000
With planting a tree.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:57.000
Subplanting.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
Oh, sorry, I heard planting.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Alright, moving on. Fat Cylon responded and said, fat because I'm fat, not p-h-a-t.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Cylon because, well, I have a plan.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
I have a plan.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000
I'm sorry, I love that answer.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
It's just, it's very direct.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:22.000
It's very, it's just very like, you know, hey, here it is.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:23.000
I have a plan.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Cyber Judge responds and says, I use Cyber Judge in games most of the time.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:37.000
However, since Blizzard's naming policy about no titles caused me to not be able to have Judge in my name back when I played WoW,

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.000
I now use names like C.Y. Jaden, I think is how you pronounce that. Sorry if I mispronounced that.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.000
I don't think my name says anything about me. Maybe seeing Cyber Judge, you think I'm a Judge. I'm not.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:53.000
I came up with that name because my real name was also a TV Judge's name, and co-workers started calling me Judge.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Judge was just too popular of a name, so I added Cyber to it.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:01.000
I figured you would just like, judge people on the internet or something.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Alright, anyhow.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:11.000
ActDeft responds to us over on Google+, saying, I've used Deft and many variations of it as my handle since I ever started using the internet,

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
and I keep using it just for recognition purposes.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:17.000
Usually most people don't know what it means and probably don't expect something about it.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:29.000
And lastly, PrincePeachFuzz responds to us on Google+, and says, I came up with PrincePeachFuzz because I was facially follicle challenged.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Again, another very honest, direct answer, but I actually love that name. PrincePeachFuzz is a pretty great name, I gotta say.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000
So there you go. Thank you guys for sharing those stories and answering. I know we didn't get a lot of answers tonight.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:48.000
Probably because I posted the question really late, because I got back from Reno like three hours before the show, so it was a little later than usual.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:53.000
But I appreciate the answers nonetheless. And I learned something about some of you this week, where your names come from.

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:54.000
I want to hear more stories.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Would you guys go answer the question anyway, even if I don't read them on air, just because I'm curious?

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I want to know where some of your names come from. I'd be curious.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.000
So just humor me and answer the question throughout the week.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Alright, let's get back into some longer news. Loki.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Alright, and I was actually just checking this out right now, although I didn't actually do anything.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
I may have to restart my level in order to get this to show.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:22.000
But there's been a new update to Minecraft Pocket Edition, or Windows 10.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:26.000
I'm still pissed off that it's the Pocket Edition that it's based off of.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.000
But they upgraded to 0.13. And what did they add with this?

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Well, they added some of the basic redstone mechanics.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:42.000
So they have the redstone torches, the redstone dust, also some of the pressure plates, buttons, that kind of thing.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:48.000
The Nether. I'm surprised they didn't have the Nether there, but the Nether's there now.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Enchanting and, I guess, brewing as well.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:57.000
And then also they've added rabbits to the game.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
And sandstone temples and desert bottoms.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Like seriously, it's been so long I've played the PC version, there was not rabbits in the fucking PC version.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.000
Like I need to go back to the PC version, it's probably going to be a completely different game for me when I see that.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I'd be like, what the fuck is all this shit going on?

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Like I see these videos, my son watches with puffer fish and shit, and I'm like, what the fuck is that?

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
I'm like, I don't know that character.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:25.000
But yeah, it's available as a free update, so if you haven't checked it out yet, you should definitely play it.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:34.000
But what's the most frustrating thing though is that this game runs so well on the Windows 10 edition, but it's just not up to the PC yet.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
And there's no mod support.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:39.000
I noticed you were playing Minecraft during the break, was that the Windows 10 version?

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Yeah, it was.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
But it's not, you don't have the updated one yet.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Oh you do?

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Yeah.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Is it getting better?

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Is it getting there?

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Yeah, it's getting better.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:52.000
I mean, I'm just playing the creative, or not creative, survival mode thing that's like wasting time now.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I may have to start over in order to get the rabbits and stuff, but I don't know.

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000
It's alright.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:01.000
I just am kind of bored because I'm playing by myself.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:06.000
That's why I kind of want to look into the mods so it's more of a challenge and stuff.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Alright.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Well, I need to check out the Windows 10 Minecraft updates.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:19.000
But yeah, I really wanted to get to where the original PC version was at, but with the graphics rendering of the Windows 10 version.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
The Windows 10 one runs awesome.

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:24.000
If they would just make a new client for the PC version, I'm fine with that.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:30.000
You just get it to run better because it doesn't run very well, and the Windows 10 one runs so well.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
And I think that's because it's based off the Pocket edition.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Alright.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Well, we're going to talk rumors, and I don't usually like to talk rumors on the show, but for two reasons I'm going to do it.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:45.000
One, it's about Mass Effect, so therefore I totally love this series, as is Dark Sakura.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Loki, we never did convert, but maybe next time.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:52.000
And two, this is something where it's on Reddit.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:58.000
Again, I know grain of salt, but the moderators of the Mass Effect Reddit basically said,

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:04.000
We have reason to believe that this is coming from an actual source. It's an internal source.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:09.000
So, again, take it with a grain of salt, but I don't know about you, Dark Sakura.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
I'm ready for some details on Mass Effect Andromeda.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000
I know.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
So, this is exciting.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:14.000
So, here's the deal.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:19.000
You will be accompanied by two AI squadmates, just like you were in previous Mass Effect games.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Two squadmates that came up, a blonde woman, and the krogan that's in the E3 trailer is one of the squadmates as well, it looks like.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Characters are equipped with jetpacks for environmental exploration.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
So, that could be interesting.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Add kind of a third dimension to that.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Don't know if jetpacks will be in combat.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Apparently they're saying the omni-tool, you'll be more of that, and you'll be able to create a shield with your omni-tool.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
And there'll be also more destructible cover.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Weapons otherwise will be the same as what you've seen before, but the ship is very different.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.000
The Mako is visible inside the ship.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:55.000
There's a meeting room with the squad members, which is kind of like the first game, or first trilogy.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:10:02.000
You can manually fly the ship from location to location in first person rather than going on the galaxy map,

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000
although you get a guide that you can use for rapid travel.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Waypoints and markers guide the player.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:10.000
That's going to be interesting if you actually fly the ship yourself.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
I wonder what you'll get from that.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:18.000
There's also a Pathfinder's Quarters, which refers to the N7 protagonist title of Pathfinder.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.000
They're on a quest to find a new world for humanity.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:26.000
Other species, who you might recognize from previous games, are also on the hunt for a new planet.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:31.000
There is a new enemy race, described as a cross between Vortia and Collectors,

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:37.000
which are two really nasty enemy types from the original trilogy.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000
And there's an antagonist the player can choose to kill or spare, which kind of seems like a duh.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:44.000
That's a very common thread in Mass Effect games.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Also, as far as the graphics go, supposedly the facial models have been improved drastically.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:53.000
Armor is customizable, but there's no further details than that.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.000
So that is what's all pouring out right now about the new game.

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000
Hopefully some official details from EA sooner rather than later,

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:05.000
but I'm going to guess they're going to keep it all under their hat until E3.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:11.000
And I remember there were some earlier leaks on an internet forum way before they announced Mass Effect Andromeda

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:15.000
that talked about that the game would take place in the Andromeda Galaxy.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:20.000
And so a lot of that is turning out to be seeing that too.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:26.000
So I don't know how much longer EA is going to be able to keep the secrets there, but we'll see.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
Well, they could always blacklist everyone who reports on it.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Right? Oh, I guess we got on the EA blacklist tonight because we opened our mouths and we talked about it.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Then again, I don't think we've ever had an EA person on this show or ever gotten.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:42.000
So I don't know. I guess you can't lose what you don't have, right?

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Whatever.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Well, there's harmonics, but...

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000
It is what it is.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.000
Anyway.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Yeah. Let's move on.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Well, the nominations for the game awards were announced.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:03.000
However, with the jury this year, Killscreen has decided not to participate

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:11.000
because it was noted that all but one of the members of the jury were male.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:21.000
And they basically stated out there that when they noticed the disparity on the jury, they decided not to participate.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:29.000
They're committed to doing things 50-50 when it comes to gender and will only involve itself with companies that do the same.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:45.000
One of the big things that was stated as well by the Polygon editor-in-chief is that, and this is just a quote,

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:51.000
it's not enough to simply acknowledge the gender imbalance while many editors on staff participated in selecting Polygon's nominations

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:55.000
and many will similarly participate in selecting our final vote in each category.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I've asked, and this is Jeff Keeley, moving forward, to replace Polygon's jury spot with, I can never pronounce this lady's name,

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Megan Farrokhmanesh, to participate.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:19.000
So, he's saying that basically you have to change it from within rather than without.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:25.000
But I think in sitting out is a pretty good course of action as well.

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:31.000
If you don't want to be a part of anything that acts that way, then pull yourself from it.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:34.000
I totally commend their action.

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Yeah, it is a little, and the thing that kind of is interesting about this is that the Game Awards were called out on this last year.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:50.000
And that's the part to me that kind of goes, they didn't really change anything from last year, did they?

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:55.000
So, I guess, yeah, now some people are going to get a little louder, and so that's what it takes.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Get really loud.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Yeah.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Make things change.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Also, I heard that they're going to scale down the show from three hours to two hours, and I'm kind of like, what the hell are they going to cut out?

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:13.000
Like, they were already cutting corners going, well, hey, since I'm interviewing you, why don't I just give you this award?

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Are they going to cut out, like, Geoff Keighley's interviews and some of that?

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Are they cutting out the Lifetime Achievement Award then, I guess?

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Maybe because we didn't hear who's getting it this year, right?

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Maybe they're cutting out music performances, which is okay, but...

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
I'm down with them cutting out music performances.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.000
Well, but if they're performing music from a video game, then I'm okay with it.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:36.000
But if it's just, like, random, like, hey, here's a metal band with a new single, then, you know, get out of here.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:41.000
But I want to say, didn't they do something last year where they actually played a bit from, like, Zelda or something?

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:47.000
And my memory's fuzzy, sorry, guys. But I thought they had, like, there was, like, a little interlude or something, so...

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:50.000
I thought there was something around that, so...

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:57.000
William Murderface in chat says, well, many of us cut out caring about that award show a long time ago, so...

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:05.000
I guess I'm curious, I do still feel like, all these criticisms aside where, you know, I just sound like that cynical guy,

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:12.000
I do feel like the Game Awards were better than anything that's come before it that was on Spike TV and all that,

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:17.000
so I feel like it's still progress, even if there's a long way to go.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:25.000
So I'll be interested to see if maybe they make positive steps in other places for this year's show. We'll see.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Moving on, Loki.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Alright, so, Fallout 4 has a game-breaking bug. I'm surprised it's just one.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.000
But anyways, this bug, it's popped up and it actually renamed to a little bit of it.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:50.000
The first place that they kind of noticed it was in Monsignor Plaza, and apparently when you try to travel in Monsignor Plaza,

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:58.000
it crashes to your desktop, and it affects both not only the PC players, but also PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.000
It doesn't happen to everybody, but some players are experiencing that.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Also, some players are experiencing that at other locations, and so basically you can't go to those locations.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:14.000
You can step right up to the border of them, and as soon as you step in, boom.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.000
So that kind of sucks. Haven't run into that yet.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.000
I'm a little surprised it took this long to come out.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Especially if it's part of the story.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:32.000
But it's not happening to everybody, and it's happening in different locations.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
So maybe it's like certain graphics cards.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
But it's happening on consoles, too.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Oh, shit.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:42.000
So, it's just, I mean, come on, that's ridiculous.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:50.000
And there's got to be something, these publishers, the software development companies, Sony and Microsoft,

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:53.000
have to do something to say, listen, this kind of shit is ridiculous.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
I mean, all these companies are doing it.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Maybe we just need to step up to all these game companies that are releasing this shit all fucking broken.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Warner Brothers, EA, fucking Bethesda, releasing these games completely broken and fixing them after the fact.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:15.000
There's got to be something that can be done.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:20.000
I mean, it's kind of shady saying, oh, yeah, the game's perfectly fine.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:24.000
And it's just like all fucked up in every single which way.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.000
I think some of the glitches are funny.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:30.000
But if it's breaking the game, then no, I don't think that's very funny.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:36.000
All right, well, we'll see how they get out of this one.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
I'm sure there'll just be a patch at some point.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Patches fix everything, right?

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:43.000
Well, the thing, though, is they're patching on PC first, and then they're going to do consoles.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.000
So it could take a while before we see that.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Because the patches go through some huge quality check, right?

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:55.000
Exactly. And then along with that, though, some modders discovered some unused weapons in the game,

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:59.000
including a harpoon gun that didn't make it in.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.000
Maybe it's going to be part of DLC or something like that.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:07.000
But you can check it out if you have the PC version.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000
You can download the mod to bring in the gun.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
All right.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Let's move on. Changing topics here to talk about Nintendo and something they've done this week.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:24.000
They have opened up an official eBay store.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.000
That's right. You can now shop for Nintendo products on eBay.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.000
But don't look for things like actual auctions.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:34.000
I don't know if you guys know, but eBay has a lot of the whole buy it now stuff.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
So it's not really like an auction.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:41.000
So they opened up a storefront where you can actually buy things like games and accessories.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:45.000
But you're not really going to find a whole lot of difference between what you find in stores.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Mario Party 10 is still going to be $49.99 on the store.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Wow, what a deal then.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:56.000
I guess Super Mario 3D World, they're showing us $30 US, where the list price is $59.99.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:01.000
But I seem to think a lot of retailers have probably already slashed the price on some of those.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Let's take a look at eBay. Let's see how competitive they are.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:11.000
I'm sorry. I just don't think that they're going to be offering great deals on that stuff.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Well, they're only selling 33 products in their store.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.000
But you know what they're not selling on the Nintendo eBay store?

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:19.000
Amiibos. There's none of them.

02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000
No amiibo on the Nintendo eBay store.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Remember I was just saying earlier, wouldn't it be something if Nintendo just had a place where they could see how much demand there was for it and be able to make everybody happy?

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:33.000
I guess it's not so fun if you just go on eBay.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.000
I guess they can't keep shelf space at GameStop if they turn to eBay and so forth.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
It's just a little silly.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:44.000
But anyway, I don't know. I've got to be honest. I'm looking through here. I don't see a lot of things where I'm like, ooh, I've got to get that.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:51.000
My thought is, the reason why this store exists is probably not for me or you.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:20:01.000
This is probably to catch some people, especially as the older generation, I think, turns more and more to online shopping to get around.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Honestly, now that I look at it, I do stand corrected. Their price is pretty good.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:12.000
I mean, out of all the Buy It Now pricing, they are the lowest. Bravo to them.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Well, they're charging retail price, though.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
$30. No, they're not charging retail price.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:19.000
Oh. For that one specifically.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:22.000
The retail price for Super Mario 3D World is still $60.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Interesting. Alright, so maybe you can catch a good deal.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:30.000
So props to them on that one. But if you want to buy used, you may be able to find it cheaper.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:37.000
And why couldn't maybe I get some classic Nintendo stuff? I guess they're pushing virtual consoles, so it does them no good to sell cartridges.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:43.000
But wouldn't it be cool if I gave... Like, that's the type of stuff I shop for on eBay, is the classic stuff, but I guess Nintendo is not as good.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:51.000
Yeah, I don't think I would buy, like, I don't know, from the actual publisher on eBay. I would think, okay, well, I'm going to look for the best deal.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:56.000
But hey, I mean, in this case, they do have a pretty nice deal, so let's go for it.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Why can't they offer that digitally instead of fucking just, like, discount... Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you do some sales like PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace does?

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:13.000
That'd be nice. Discount your games instead of having to charge $60 for a game that doesn't even come down in price.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:23.000
I feel like on Black Friday last year, they did do something like that. I mean, it's one day out of the year, but I feel like something will happen with that, so...

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:30.000
But anyway, the only thing, the thought I wanted to finish on the eBay thing is that, again, I don't think this storefront is for you or me.

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:40.000
I think it is for people who have turned online to doing shopping, where people are like, I want to get a 3DS for my granddaughter, because she's been talking about wanting Mario or whatever.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:48.000
So, I kind of think this is just for a different audience, and this is just Nintendo trying to get more market coverage. I really think is what this boils down to.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:57.000
I don't think it's really for the enthusiasts like you or me. But hey, if there's a deal in there once in a while, then what the hell? A deal's a deal, right?

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
So keep an eye on it.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Alright, let's move on. We're gonna get to the emails. Every week you guys email us.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com is our email address. If you want to participate with the email bag segment in the show, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I don't think we had a lot of emails this week, but Dark Soccer's gonna dive in.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.000
One long one.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:22.000
One long one, she says tonight in our mailbag. Let's get to it, Dark Soccer.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Hi everyone, it's your friendly neighborhood Raginator. I just wanted to say that despite not being able to participate live during shows like I normally do due to temporarily not having internet at home, I do manage to catch shows via podcast.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:39.000
I'm looking forward to seeing everyone again come May 2016.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Anywho, on to the meat and potatoes of my email. I was hoping to get your input in advance on my getting a new PC.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Excuse me.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Alright, now I'm contemplating between two retailers to go to for a gaming desktop PC.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:10.000
I was wondering which in your opinions I'm better off going to. In terms of traditional brick and mortar stores, I'm considering going to Best Buy.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:18.000
In terms of online retailers, I'm considering iBuyPower.com. Of the two, which am I better off going to?

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:28.000
When it comes to buy my new PC, I definitely want a gaming desktop. My spending limit will be $1350 including my sales tax, shipping, and handling if applicable.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:38.000
I definitely want to go get the most bang for my buck, get the most powerful PC I can afford with said budget. That way hopefully I don't have to upgrade my parts for a while.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:41.000
I'm gonna stop you right there. Build your own.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:53.000
Yeah, I would say neither of those. I mean, I don't know about iBuyPower, but Best Buy, you're not going to find gaming PCs. They're going to be very limited on what they offer gaming PC wise, and it's probably going to be expensive.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:57.000
Yeah. Build your own. Seriously?

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:02.000
But, I mean, if he doesn't know how to build his own, I would try even Newegg or something.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Yeah, Newegg is good. But, honestly enough, we built both mine and Dan's computers. Now, we already had our graphics card and power supplies, which would probably have been the most expensive parts.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:23.000
We still built our pair of computers for $900. And both of them are gaming computers.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:36.000
When I was mocking up a PC I was going to build for PC gaming and for the Oculus Rift, I think it was about $1300 that I was looking to spend.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:47.000
And that was just from Newegg and different locations. If you definitely know how to build a PC, do it that way. Don't buy retail if you can avoid it.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Even if, or if you're going to buy retail, buy from a company that's going to make custom PCs. Don't buy an Alienware PC because it's overpriced.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:00.000
And they're Dell.

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:05.000
And just, you know, maybe, I don't know.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:10.000
William Murderface had a good analogy. It's like grown up Legos.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:21.000
Yeah, I mean, half the fun is learning how to build that stuff. And it's not that hard. I mean, actually putting stuff together isn't hard. It's just figuring out what works together with each other and what you're going to need as far as spec-wise.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:32.000
And finding the best deals is kind of the tricky part. But the actual assembly is not that hard. I mean, you can find instructions online on how to do it. It's not like a daunting task or anything.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:49.000
And for the most part, it's you open it up, you punch out a little piece of perforated metal and stick your piece, the back end goes out, secure everything in, plug in some cables, you're done. It's easy.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Finally, Loki, I have an idea for you to use in Time to Car or any other game projects that you may work on. It's one of those so stupid it's actually brilliant ideas.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:10.000
How about a rocket launcher? But not any ordinary rocket launcher. No, no, no. Instead of shooting rockets, it'll shoot, wait for it, weasels. Fuck yeah.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:18.000
And these are no ordinary weasels either. These weasels will seek out human targets and summarily burrow up to the humans asses and then explode.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:24.000
What? Or should I say ass-plode over the top? Yes, weird. Yes, but that's why it's so brilliant.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000
That's a little too postal for me, unfortunately.

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Well, I will say, I can see them part way, but instead of a weasel, what about a ferret? Isn't that the OLR thing?

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:42.000
Yeah, I'm not going to put like rocket weasels or anything like that, although that sounds like an awesome name for a game.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Rocket weasel does sound like an awesome name for a game. We might have a dream game in the making here.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:52.000
With the sequel Fuck It Ferret? I don't know.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Maybe it's like a buddy game, kind of like Banjo Kazooie or something. It's like, you know, Rocket Weasel and Fuck It Ferret.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:05.000
I'm still waiting for someone to make Mortal Wombat. Anyhow.

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Anyways, I got to get off. I said get off this library computer now since my time is up, but I hope everyone is well and I'll see you all as soon as I can.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:22.000
One counterpoint I want to just offer real quick to the computer building thing, and I'm going to paint a lot of nerds with this, but I just want you to hear me out.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:30.000
If your goal is to get back online and just play casual games, I actually don't know if you need to do all this build your own computer stuff.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:36.000
I think it would be more fun, and if you are, you know, the nerdy type, you'd probably get more out of it for yourself.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:46.000
But I think if you're like, quote unquote, desperate for a computer and you just want to be able to play casual games, because I know you play a lot of Steam games and like Magic and all that stuff.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Like, maybe just look for Black Friday. And again, I don't know when your finances will turn around, but yeah, I say Black Friday, but when you are able to, just look at getting a cheap all-in-one solution that, you know, has the specs for what you need.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:09.000
And I know there's a lot of people that are going to disagree with me, but if you're not going to be doing the hardcore gaming, casual machine ought to do you just fine and get you back up and running.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:16.000
You might even get a decent, like, a decent laptop. Like, my laptop wasn't that expensive. It was like a few hundred dollars.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:30.000
And it's just, if you're looking for like a, I mean, desktop PC you're obviously going to get more out of, but if you're looking for like a laptop, anything with a dedicated graphics card and preferably not AMD, I got an AMD and it's okay.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:35.000
But, you know, the way they do their chips, the APUs and stuff is kind of annoying.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:42.000
But if you can find something like that, that would work out as well if you're not looking to play like, you know, really high-end games.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:52.000
But yeah, if you can build your own, you're going to save the most money that way, because they really do, they mark up everything to try to, I mean, they got to make their money somewhere, so, I don't know.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Ask yourself, though, what do you really need?

02:28:54.000 --> 02:29:00.000
I'm sure you've got a friend who's tech-savvy, if you're not, and just have them help you build a PC.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:05.000
And if you, like, seriously don't have friends, there's like a Reddit, I can't believe I'm endorsing Reddit, but I am.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:12.000
There's like a Reddit that's like, build me a PC, because I either, when I build, because I, well, I didn't build the PC.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:16.000
See, here's the trick, Raginator, if you can't do it, date someone who can.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
That's what I did.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:26.000
But Alan built my PC, but I, you know, kind of told him like the specs and all that stuff, and we were actually kind of looking at that Reddit, that build your PC.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:33.000
There's actually people out there, if you tell them the budget and all that, they'll come up with some ideas for you, so, there's a lot of online resources.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Alan is even chiming in here in chat, saying, pcpartpicker.com is a lifesaver, it deserves a shout-out.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Yeah, that was the site where you can actually, like, look at whatever parts you want to buy, and it finds what site has it cheapest, and it actually, like, monitors, like,

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:55.000
here's how much your computer would cost today, here's how much it was yesterday, here's how much it was a week ago, and it kind of, kind of, tracks that, which I think is good.

02:29:55.000 --> 02:30:03.000
By the way, a lot of talk on Rocket Ferret, by the way, Embryon in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, please shoot me with ferret cannons all day.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:10.000
I don't want them to crawl up my ass, but I would snuggle them forever. William Murderface asks, wouldn't Fuck It Ferret be a porn?

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:19.000
No. No, no, no. The word fuck is a very versatile word. In this case, fuck it doesn't mean, like, literally have sex with it, it just means, like, I'm done, fuck it.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.000
Ferret's just like, fuck it, and goes up.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:26.000
Yes. That is the ferret's special ability is to flip a table. Fuck it. And flips the table.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:29.000
The table just appears out of hammer space.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:33.000
And then the table smashes, the table smashes the enemy.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:36.000
And, like, it's a giant table that lands on everyone on the screen.

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:45.000
Yes. I love it. Perfect. And we may already have somebody working on it. Dark Tetsuya says, Rocket Weasel. Oh, I might have to try and make that game.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:55.000
So, there you go. And SSG100Matt, and I think ActDeft was saying this in another comment too, what I think you should do is buy a pre-built and upgrade it. It's the fastest and easiest solution for him.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:59.000
I don't know if there is a correct answer here.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:05.000
But you've got to be careful with buying pre-built and upgrading, because some of them you can't. I mean, you're limited on what you can. That's why building your own, so.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:13.000
So, ask lots of questions if you are going to go that route. Ask questions. Don't just buy it because it's the cheapest. Ask yourself why it's cheap.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Anyway, I think we've given you a lot of ideas. Hopefully we didn't just confuse you more, but there you go.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:28.000
That was it for emails, right? So, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you would like to submit an email for next time.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Meanwhile, it's time to get into the FUs of the week. It's time for us to get angsty. Why? Because...

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...

02:31:52.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I don't really have a legit FU. Except to just the problems I've had putting my staff play together.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:08.000
So, I had to go out and buy more tacky glue. I was trying to debate if I'd get gorilla glue or tacky glue, but I love tacky glue.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Cosplay. Cosplay problems.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Loki.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:23.000
I also don't really have an FU, I guess. I did want to take this point to say, they're making a sequel to Kung Pao finally, and I'm so excited about that.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
I've been waiting so long for that.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
FU to the fact that it took so long.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Yeah, FU to the fact that it took 13 years. You're wasting your fucking time with those stupid barnyard movies or whatever the fuck it was.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
God, I know.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:43.000
FU to the fact that I'm still coughing, like two weeks after I was sick. I'm still coughing, and it's really annoying.

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:49.000
And when I was up in Reno and it was a lot colder up there than it is here, like that cold just even irritated my cough worse.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:33:00.000
So, FU to that nasty flu I had two weeks ago that took me out of the show and has continued to annoy me as I will be mid-sentence and then feel the need to cough.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Doing radio sucks when you have a cough, just saying.

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:06.000
But I love you guys. That's why I'm still here.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:14.000
Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:20.000
Get on there and get ready to go, because I won't leave the Skype line open forever tonight, because we're already almost to 9 o'clock.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:24.000
But before we get there, I do want to get to a couple more stories. So first, Loki.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:29.000
So even though we haven't gotten to release stays for a couple weeks, I am looking forward to this.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Two Earth Defense Force games out on the same day, December 8th.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:42.000
We're getting Earth Defense Force 4.1 on PlayStation 4 and Earth Defense Force Portable 2 or Earth Defense Force 2.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:48.000
I'm not sure what the actual subtitle is on that, but those are both coming out.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:51.000
That one, the second one is on PS or the Vita.

02:33:51.000 --> 02:34:02.000
And yeah, so $50 for 4.1, which is kind of an expansion on 2025 that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:12.000
And then the Earth Defense Force 2 was a PlayStation 2 title that never came out over here.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:18.000
So, gonna have to pick up 4.1, though.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:24.000
I just figured we had to work. Any movement on Earth Defense Force is worthy of reporting on, right, Loki?

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:30.000
I would like to see a new game. Even like another Insect Armageddon game, I mean, it was okay.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:34.000
It wasn't great, but it was still interesting. I don't know.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Alright. Well, we're gonna end tonight with a story on Mark Cuban. Oh yeah, that guy.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:44.000
Well, you know, he's a very controversial owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Although, I gotta confess, I do like me some Shark Tank. That's a pretty good show. You guys ever watch Shark Tank?

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.000
I kind of like it. It's a guilty pleasure.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
They have a lot of spin-off shows now.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Yeah, well, it was one of those shows that was getting really horrible ratings, but then it just kind of grew and grew.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.000
But anyway, so Mark Cuban, you know, he's out there and he's a big business guy.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
And why am I talking about him on a video game podcast?

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Well, because he was in a charity event this week where he was playing League of Legends against the CEO of Intel.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:21.000
And there was an interview that he did where he said he was actually talking about Colin Cowherd,

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:26.000
who was the one that was throwing the fit about esports getting airtime on ESPN.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
And they ended up, like, I think he ended up leaving.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:34.000
So anyway, Mark Cuban said, I love Colin, but he's an idiot when it comes to esports.

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:39.000
Don't hold back. I'm a noob. I'm still getting into it, but I love it.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:42.000
It's like playing five-dimensional chess against the world.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:47.000
It is one of the smartest games I've ever played. You've got to have dexterity. You've got to be quick.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:52.000
This is a real sport. People are going to figure it out really, really quick.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Now, this man owns an NBA team.

02:35:55.000 --> 02:36:03.000
I find that to be newsworthy, that he's putting his support behind saying, yes, League of Legends is a sport.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:10.000
And I kind of really love that, how he calls it, five-dimensional chess.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:13.000
It's a very, I kind of like that.

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:21.000
Anyway, so also just kind of funny, he actually dropped the F-bomb in the interview.

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:27.000
And the host let him know that he's going to be fined $15,000 for dropping the F-bomb in the interview.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:32.000
But that was okay because all the fines were going to be donated to the CyberSmile Foundation charity.

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:39.000
So Cuban's response to the fine? Fuck it. And he ended up paying two fines to the charity.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
That's awesome.

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:47.000
That's pretty awesome. I don't always agree with him, but he has his moments where he's pretty awesome, I've got to say.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
So, there it is.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:52.000
All right, we're going to open up the phone lines right now.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:57.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:03.000
If you want to get through and talk to us about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe something we haven't talked about yet.

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:07.000
sj100matt saying he gets fined by the NBA all the time, so it's kind of an in-joke with him.

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:11.000
I see that. All right, anyway, the phones are lighting up already, so let's get to it.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Hey, it's Sterlok.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
Hey, I'm glad to hear from you, Sterlok. How you doing?

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Pretty good.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Not too much. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Xbox One.

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:34.000
I was hoping that was the case. Tell us a little bit about, from your perspective, what all's changed with Xbox One and why it's important.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Well, yeah, with the new Xbox experience thing, they added a bunch of access changes, and one of them was Narrator, which is pretty awesome.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:52.000
It's actually a lot better than what Sony did.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:56.000
What does the Narrator feature do for those that haven't experienced it?

02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:07.000
It's a screen reader, basically. It will say, you know, what you're highlighting and all that fun stuff, so you have a speech on your console.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
That's great.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:19.000
PS4 has this as well, but it's very, very, it's less bare bones than it was, but it's still not very good.

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Have you found that this has opened the door up to experience maybe something that you have yet to experience?

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:36.000
Yeah, actually. I mean, I had a 360 and I played the crap out of it.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:46.000
The reason I got the 360 over the PS3 was because of the web store.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:55.000
So you could buy games directly in your browser, and then next time you're sharing it on your console, it'll just download it.

02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Because narrators on the web browser, that's common.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Microsoft has that built into Internet Explorer as a part of Windows, right? That's very common.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:11.000
Yeah, well, actually, most blind people use external screen readers.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:25.000
Well, I kind of use a combination of Mac, which has a screen reader called VoiceOver, and a Windows screen reader called NVDA, Non-Visual Desktop Access.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:34.000
But yeah, no, it was just a web interface, so it was literally just a web page, so it made it really easy.

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:43.000
But now with this on the Xbox One, don't need all that. It will actually let you buy things from the console.

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:48.000
That's fantastic. I'm glad to hear about this progress.

02:39:48.000 --> 02:40:08.000
Yeah, well, the sad thing is it took, I don't know how many people knew this or if you guys knew this, but the reason they're doing this is because of a law that passed.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Oh, I didn't.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:35.000
It was, I forget the name of it now, but it was a ruling that was made several years ago that basically required devices, like entertainment devices, to be accessible, at least the communication side of it.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:51.000
That's kind of important because, well, games and consoles were granted a waiver for a few years, but that finally expired.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:41:11.000
So now they are required to have at least some functionality, like with the communication and stuff. Not everything is required.

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:18.000
I think especially with the PS4, they just kind of did the minimum of what they had to do.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:19.000
I gotcha.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:27.000
So Microsoft kind of, you know, they took their time and they added a little more maybe than what the law requires. I had no idea there was a lot more.

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:39.000
There was only, to my knowledge, there's only like two things that don't read all that well, which are achievements and the community section.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:40.000
Okay.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Everything else is, oh, and of course, like external apps. You know, like Hulu and WWE, that kind of stuff.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:42:03.000
Let me ask you this before I let you go. What do you think would be a great, like, you know, as a gamer who benefits from these accessibility enhancements, what would you like to see next?

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:13.000
What do you think should be next on the list for Microsoft or Sony to do to make the experience even better? What would help you out?

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Well, the ultimate thing is something that will never happen, sadly, and that is that, you know, game menus would read.

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:38.000
But there's no way they're going to, you know, be able to, unless they built an API, which they aren't going to, you know, like to have game menus read would be pretty sweet.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:49.000
You know what though, Sturlock? Never say never, because maybe some developer, you know, I do know we have some industry people that listen to this show, just a few, and not all of them are vocal.

02:42:49.000 --> 02:43:01.000
But this is, I think, sometimes a good thing for them to hear because, you know, maybe if even in the system themselves, they can't mandate that the menus are readable, maybe that developer who's making their game might think,

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:10.000
you know, it wouldn't really be that hard for me to go in and have a button that you hit, and then it will read the menu, and that will help more people enjoy my game. Maybe somebody will hear that.

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Yeah. I mean, I never thought that this was going to happen, honestly. So, yeah, you never know.

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:32.000
But I mean, I have now retracted my I will never get by an Xbox One statement.

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:33.000
It means a lot.

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:44.000
It took me four years, or however, no, it was three years. Whenever they made their stupid DRM announcement, that was just like, nope, I'm done.

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Which they're still trying to recover from in many ways.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:44:00.000
But, you know, they have really kind of gone above and beyond, and this is pretty awesome. So, I think I know which console I'm getting.

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:06.000
Alright. Well, Sturlock, thanks so much for the phone call. I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in some more calls, but have a good one, and it's great to hear from you.

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:07.000
Alright, you too.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:08.000
Alright, take care.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Yep. Bye.

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:16.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, if you'd like to give us a call.

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
And here we go. Phones are lighting up again. Let's get to it.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:21.000
Hey, it's Embryon.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
Hey, how you doing?

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:24.000
I am well.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:25.000
Great.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:28.000
I'm glad you're doing a little bit better, even though you're still coughing.

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Yeah, I know. I hate when somebody's probably sitting there at home going, get that guy some tea. I drank some coffee. That's my hot drink of choice. But, yeah, I probably need some tea with honey. Maybe I'll enjoy that after the show. We'll see.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Yeah, I suppose. Whatever works. It's all good.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
So, what's on your mind tonight?

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:57.000
I'm just calling to say hey. I played some Final Fantasy 14 tonight. I've been doing that, and I'm wrapping up the weekend with some Yokai Watch. Have you guys talked about that much?

02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:05.000
I did a little bit, because I was playing a little bit of Yokai Watch. I think I'm on Chapter 5, and there's, what, 11 chapters in the game? I think I'm on Chapter 5.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:17.000
But, yeah, I think a lot of people were really harsh on the demo, and I think the full game is a lot of fun. I like it. What are your thoughts on Yokai Watch?

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:24.000
Kind of the same. I wasn't super impressed by the demo, but I think the full version kind of opens up some of the breadth the game has to offer.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:34.000
I think that in typical Level 5 tradition, there are some parts of the game that are really focused and really good, and then other parts that are kind of head-scratchingly obtuse.

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:41.000
Because I think that it's a really pretty game. I love the designs of the Yokai. I love the animations, and I love the idea.

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:49.000
It's a really fun little town and world to wander around in, but there are some things like, I think the quest design could use some work.

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Like, I don't know, have you gotten to one of the points where you have to upgrade your Yokai Watch before you can enter an area?

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:59.000
Yeah, I had to get the grandpa's underpants.

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Yeah, so there's some parts where you have to go fight certain Yokai to upgrade your watch, but the current main story quest overwrites that as far as the markers on the map.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:17.000
So it's really hard to figure out where you're supposed to go, and I guess I could read the dialogue better.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:23.000
I don't know, but it feels like when you accept one of those quests, I wish they would just put the markers for the Yokai you need to fight on the map.

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:31.000
But other than that, I think it's really cute. I think it's a good example of a Pokemon clone quote-unquote game done right,

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:38.000
although it does seem kind of weird that they're shying away so much from taking away the Japanese-ness of it.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:42.000
Like, welcome to Springdale, USA. My name is Nate.

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:52.000
It's super obviously taking place in Japan, like Yokai or Japanese spirits, and even the bathhouse that you go to early in the game, right?

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Like, you're getting an old man's fundoshi.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:59.000
Yeah, I mean, it's funny because you do say that, and there are certain parts of the game that are very clearly translated over,

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:03.000
but there's other parts, like even very, very early in the game.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:06.000
I don't consider this a spoiler because you're going to get into this within the first hour of the game.

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:12.000
But, you know, you find out that there's this cat that, you know, you're trying to rescue, and then if you didn't already know,

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:18.000
Yokai is, because I didn't really realize this when I was first playing the game, Yokai is like dead spirits in Japan.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:24.000
So the cat talks about how he was run over by a car, and he's dead, and I'm like, this is a game for children.

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:25.000
Right?

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:26.000
Because it feels a little dark.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Like, surprisingly heartbreaking. I was like, oh, poor kitty.

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:34.000
I know, and me too, because I am, you know me, I'm a total cat person, so when I hear, like, cat getting hit by car,

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:39.000
I have that instant response of, oh, you know, like, it hurts my heart.

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
And so I'm like, this is for kids? I don't know.

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:48.000
But, you know, at the same time, kids are going to find out about that stuff eventually.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:55.000
I guess it's kind of the same if you think about Pokémon essentially being like humans trapping animals and forcing them to fight to the death.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:47:59.000
It's true.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:06.000
One other thing that people don't often talk about about the game that definitely caught my eye is the 3D in the 3DS.

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
We don't talk about that a lot anymore with games.

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:12.000
When you were talking about, like, the graphics, the 3D effects are really well done, I think.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
That was just something I picked up on.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:18.000
I realize most people have probably long since shut off the 3D, which is fair.

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:26.000
The game still looks fine without the 3D effects, but I was just, I was, like, the way the cloud bursts when you spot a Yokai is a really cool 3D effect, I think.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:30.000
Yeah. Every now and then there will be a time I turn the 3D back on for a game.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:35.000
Like, the most recent time I did that was with Legend of Legacy, because I really like the storybook pop-up effect in that.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:39.000
And then this is another one that I think actually makes really good use of it.

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Because, like you said, it's easy to forget about almost, because even though the system is called the 3DS, I think many of us just sort of forgo that.

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Because, at least for me, 3D hurts my eyes and gives me a headache after a little while, so I, like, tend to just kind of leave it off.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:53.000
But it works well in this.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:49:02.000
And the Yokai cam is pretty cute, too. If totally silly and superfluous, whatever, but it's still, it's fun to use that.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Have you found that Tumblr that has nothing but a collection of all the QR codes for Yokai Watch?

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:08.000
No, I haven't.

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:12.000
You need to check that out, because then you get all these coins to use in the little machine.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:18.000
And that's how I got, like, a B-rank Yokai, like, in Chapter 4. Like, when you haven't even upgraded your watch yet.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
I better do that then.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Exactly, right? It'll give you a little bit of an edge in the game. Awesome. Well, thanks for calling and talking to Yokai Watch with us. Appreciate it.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.000
For sure. Take care.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Alright, take care. Good to hear from you.

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:38.000
Alright, let's get to some more calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:43.000
It's not ringing right away again, so I think I have a moment to go to Loki and see if there's a last minute story.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:46.000
I think your mic might be off, Loki.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:53.000
Sorry, I can tell you that the PlayStation TV has come down in price even more. You can get it for $20 at Best Buy.

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:57.000
What? The PlayStation TV? That 3D TV thing?

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:00.000
No, the PlayStation TV as in the portable Vita.

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
Oh, God. Okay, so I'm...

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
The Vita for your TV.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:07.000
Okay, you know where my mind went, though, right? It was the actual TV.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Oh, shit. If it was $20, I'd be like, I'm sorry, I leave, gotta go get me a 3D TV.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:17.000
$20 for a 3D TV? I could use that as a computer monitor, right?

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:18.000
Yeah.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:21.000
I've always wanted to play triple screen Final Fantasy IV.

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:25.000
But seriously, you should pick $20. Come on, man. At the very least, it's a Vita you can play on TV.

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
You could probably use it as a PlayStation 1.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
That's not bad. That's really not a bad deal.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:35.000
That's not a bad deal. I don't use mine at all, but it was worth the $30 I paid for it.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
You can play the PSP games with it, right?

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:38.000
You play PSP games?

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:46.000
It would be worth $20 just to play the Final Fantasy IV remake that was on PSP. It was the 2D remake.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:52.000
Because there was one. Remember, the 3D remake is what's shown up on tablets and PC and 3DS.

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:58.000
No, the 2D remake, which is really good, is on PSP. I would pay the $20 for a Vita TV just to play that.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
Plus, I have pixel shits on there, so...

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:04.000
That's right. Pixel shits. If you got it when you still could.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:05.000
Yes.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:06.000
Because I don't think you can anymore.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
No. But it's preserved.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:11.000
It is. Unless maybe there's a mod way to do it.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:15.000
And I would hate to say piracy, especially for one of YYR's games.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:20.000
But maybe there's a way to do it, and maybe you could PayPal YYR a dollar and he'll be fine.

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:21.000
It's free on his website, too.

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Oh, is it? I don't know. We'll have to see what his opinion is on that.

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:28.000
If it's possible to backdoor the game into the Vita TV.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Let's see. ActDeftInChat says,

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:36.000
Until PSTV can play Taiko New Tatujin, I'll get one.

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:40.000
And bonds006 says, I was thinking the same thing, which I'm assuming is about the monitor.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:43.000
So I'm glad I'm not the only one that jumped to that conclusion.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
But also, what does that say about that device?

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:50.000
That when you said PlayStation TV, it was not the first thing that came to mind.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:53.000
It should have been just... What did they call it before?

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:57.000
It was the Vita TV or the... What did they call it before?

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
Like in Japan, it's the Vita TV.

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:03.000
But here, since the Vita is not really a thing, it's not the same thing.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:07.000
For $20, I mean, shit. Fucking get, like, Netflix works on it.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
Fucking get Hulu to work on it for 20 bucks and be like,

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:13.000
Hey dude, you can fucking stream shit with this for 20 bucks.

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:18.000
But my TV already has PlayStation 4 on it, so...

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:22.000
I understand that, but my boxing, my fucking old ass thing is falling apart.

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Like, it loses internet connection all the time.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:28.000
Like, shit. 20 bucks. Come on.

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Now, see, I'd get a PlayStation TV and bring it here in the studio on this TV.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
And then that would allow us to, if we wanted to, during the show.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:37.000
We never do this. We never play games during the show.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
But, anymore. We used to.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:40.000
But maybe if we had guests in the studio or whatever,

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:43.000
we could actually stream from the PlayStation 4 to this TV.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:46.000
So, there's still that part of me that's like,

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:51.000
Maybe I should bring the PS4 in here and then we can do a broadcast

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
with the PS camera during the show.

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
But then, you know, I'm always also, I'm like,

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:58.000
But this is Orange Lounge Radio, not Orange Lounge Video.

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
I don't think it's that exciting to watch. I really don't.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
So...

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
But some of our listeners seem to miss it, so I don't know.

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:05.000
I'm thinking about it.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
It's more exposure, though.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:11.000
That is true. That's honestly a big reason why I'm thinking about it.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:14.000
I'm like, Well, if we did put it on Twitch,

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:18.000
then that's gonna be potential way more exposure for the show.

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Even though I think this is super boring to watch.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:26.000
But there's a lot of gaming podcasts that are just talking heads on Twitch,

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:27.000
and they do very well.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:30.000
So, you know, and no shade against those shows.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
They're getting great numbers, so what can I do?

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
I just, I'm always kind of like,

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:37.000
But it's radio, not television. I don't know.

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
Anyway.

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:40.000
You all right?

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:41.000
Yeah.

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:42.000
Okay. Did you have a comment?

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:43.000
No.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Oh, okay.

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:45.000
You just picked up your mic suddenly.

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:46.000
I thought you were gonna say something.

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
Yeah, when I was about to sit on it.

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:51.000
Our username on-

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Most people wanna listen to my butt.

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Our username on Skype.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Last call for calls.

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
If we don't get any more, we'll shut it down,

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
and we will call it a night.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
And then we'll all go get cheesecake.

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Oh, my God.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
Did I tell you how much I ate this weekend?

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:06.000
I don't care.

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:07.000
Go eat cheesecake with me.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:08.000
No, seriously?

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:11.000
No, I can't, because yesterday I went to the buffet,

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
and my fat ass had two full plates at the buffet,

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:14.000
because it was good.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:15.000
It was good.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:16.000
Only two?

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:17.000
Only two.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:18.000
And then dessert.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:19.000
And then-

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:20.000
Girl.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:21.000
I went to-

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:24.000
And then my friend that I was with was like,

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
there's a hash house at Go-Go in Reno.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:27.000
We gotta go.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.000
So we ended up having a late night set.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
I couldn't eat more food.

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
I think I had half a side of fries.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:33.000
That's all I could even-

02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:36.000
And even that was like, oh, my God, I'm so fat.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:39.000
And then this morning, we had Steak and Shake,

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:42.000
because I can't go to Reno and not go to Steak and Shake,

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
because we don't have them here in California.

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
I'm telling Becky right now that I wanna go to Farrell's.

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:50.000
And again, I'm sure lots of people throughout the rest of the country are like,

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Steak and Shake is not that big a deal.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
Steak and Shake is that big a deal.

02:54:54.000 --> 02:55:00.000
Try not having it, and then realizing you can't get a birthday cake shake at McDonald's,

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:01.000
or whatever else.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:05.000
Or, everyone in the South, imagine no Waffle House.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
Waffle House does not exist here in California.

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:11.000
But I actually, you're the only one that sticks up for Waffle House.

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Most people tell me it's shit.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:17.000
Except the waffles are, like, which I would fucking hope,

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
if you were to call your place Waffle House,

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
your waffles fucking pass.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:22.000
The grits-

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:23.000
I've never been to one.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:26.000
I'm a lifelong Californian, I've never been to a Waffle House.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
The grits have to stick up.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
The spoon has to stick up in the grits.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Waffle House.

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
See, Brad says, told me to shut my mouth.

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
Well, don't you tell me what to do, first of all.

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:41.000
But, Waffle House is amazing, and their grits are amazing.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:44.000
Waffle House is amazing, and their grits are godly,

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:47.000
and I still have bags of grits from Waffle House in my cupboard.

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
I said imagine no Waffle House,

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:53.000
and that's what it's like for us not having steak and shake.

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:56.000
So you shut your whore mouth in return.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:59.000
I'm having an argument with someone typing, this is great.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:02.000
Imagine there's no waffles.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
No, I don't wanna.

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:07.000
But it makes me want to go back now and have Waffle House.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:10.000
At least have the grits at home, so that's good.

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
When are you gonna make me grits?

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:13.000
Come to my house.

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Kiss my grits.

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
I need you to make some grits.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
See, he told me he doesn't have a whore mouth.

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
He has a slut mouth because he's going to get paid.

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
Alright, the phones aren't lighting up,

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
and this is just descending into toilet bowl humor,

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
so I think it's time to wrap up the show.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Thanks to those that did get through tonight.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:34.000
If you want to participate with the show, but were too shy to call,

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
you can always consider sending us a tweet.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:39.000
I know I don't often go through and read the tweets verbatim on the show,

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
but I do read them all.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:46.000
You can always leave us feedback on the show postings at VOG Network.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
I love seeing those, too. V-O-G Network dot com.

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.000
And then, of course, you can always send us an email.

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:54.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:55.000
And I'm serious.

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
Go back and answer the Facebook and Google Plus,

02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:00.000
FUGL Question of the Week about your usernames,

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:01.000
because I want to know.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
Because some of you have some really weird usernames.

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:04.000
I want to know the story.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:07.000
So, but that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Thank you guys so much for downloading and checking out our show

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
or listening live, whatever the case may be.

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:13.000
Thank you for supporting independent radio.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
And you know what? If you thought this show was stupid,

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
I don't know how you made it all three hours,

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
but thank you for doing so.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:22.000
And check out another indie podcast, then,

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:23.000
if you didn't like what you heard here.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:26.000
Just support indie podcasting and the people that do this

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:27.000
just because they love it.

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
Spread indie podcasting like an STD.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:30.000
That's right.

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:31.000
With love.

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
Spread it with your whore mouth.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
Becky was listening.

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
Maybe that'll be on a future iTunes comment.

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
Spread it with your whore mouth.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:41.000
That'll be our new tagline.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
Anyway, maybe that can be on the shirt.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:44.000
O-L-R.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:45.000
Spread your mouth.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
O-L-R. Spread it with your...

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.000
Okay, now Jamie just convinced me maybe we do need video

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
because she made a face.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:56.000
You may have...

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
I've made Rob convulse.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
Damn this cough.

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:01.000
All right.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:02.000
All right.

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:03.000
We're definitely done.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Thank you guys for supporting the show.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:05.000
Please consider...

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:09.000
Tell a friend or two or five or 15, 25 about the show.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:10.000
Help us spread the word.

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:13.000
A five-star review on a place like iTunes, Stitcher Radio

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:17.000
or wherever you found this show goes a long way as well.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
Appreciate all of that.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:20.000
Thank you guys again.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
We will be back in two weeks.

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
Remember, we will not be here next week.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:28.000
Those of you in the States have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:32.000
Those of you overseas, have a great week.

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:33.000
Have some turkey.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
In honor of your American friends.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.000
That's right.

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:37.000
Have some pumpkin pie in honor of me.

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:40.000
In celebration of spreading death and disease.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Anyhow...

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:44.000
Small pox.

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:45.000
A gift from England.

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
Let's go ahead and wrap things up.

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:48.000
We're done.

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:49.000
We're definitely out of here.

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:50.000
Just kidding.

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:51.000
Hearts.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:54.000
Loki, how about you?

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:55.000
What's your final thought tonight?

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
At least it wasn't large pox.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:03.000
My final thought is that in two weeks I would like to be rid of this cough completely.

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:06.000
Let's all cross our fingers and our toes.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
Dark Sakura, last but not least.

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:09.000
Your final thought.

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:10.000
Drink half a bottle of bourbon.

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:11.000
You won't care.

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:15.000
I did have unlimited Jack and Cokes last night.

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:18.000
I didn't talk about my trip to a country bar here on the show.

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:20.000
I guess we'll have to save that for another week.

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:23.000
Have a wonderful week everybody.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:26.000
We'll see you in two weeks with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:27.000
Good night.
