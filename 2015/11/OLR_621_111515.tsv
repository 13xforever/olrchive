0	17440	This week Microsoft released the new Xbox experience to the world enabling you to relive
17440	21000	your fondest Xbox 360 memories as backwards compatibility begins again.
21000	23720	We'll catch up with this and last week's news along with your comments, calls and more
23720	31960	and it all starts right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.
31960	35440	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35440	37400	where every gamer has a voice.
37400	45220	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 621 for this November the 15th
45220	47460	of 2015.
47460	52080	My name is Rob Roberts but you might know me on Twitter at Skie S-K-I-E and joining
52080	56400	me as she always does, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
56400	57400	Yo.
57400	58400	Hey Jamie, how you doing?
58400	59400	I'm alright.
59400	60400	Yeah?
60400	63360	We were just kind of chilling here in studio with no Bobby tonight.
63360	66960	I was decorating a hotel and I kept thinking maybe I could make it look like the one from
66960	67960	The Shining.
67960	71320	So you are playing, I mean we'll get into your gaming weekend a little bit, but you
71320	75740	are playing Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer like a lot and you were playing that before
75740	76740	the show tonight.
76740	79360	I've done my last project so I have a party waiting for me.
79360	82560	Tell us about your band because I thought the fact that you could set up a band was
82560	83560	cool.
83560	89500	I just threw out freaking instruments but like you can, one of your projects is to create
89500	94240	a concert hall and I was like what instruments can I put in here that don't go together?
94240	95240	So I have a piano.
95240	96240	Of course you have to have a piano.
96240	97240	I have bagpipes.
97240	98240	Uh huh.
98240	99240	I have a theremin.
99240	100240	Uh huh.
100240	101240	I have an alto sax.
101240	102240	Uh huh.
102240	103240	I have a sitar.
103240	104240	You did get a sitar.
104240	105240	I did get a sitar.
105240	106240	And I have a taiko.
106240	107240	Okay.
107240	108240	No marimba though.
108240	109240	I suggested marimba.
110120	111120	That's too bad.
111120	114800	There was a xylophone and there was a um.
114800	115800	No didgeridoo.
115800	116800	It wasn't a didgeridoo.
116800	117800	I would have put a didgeridoo if I had seen it.
117800	118800	Fake ass game.
118800	120360	I did put a xylophone in.
120360	121360	Okay that's cool.
121360	122440	So I put the xylophone in.
122440	123440	Alright.
123440	124440	Um so.
124440	125440	Xylophone.
125440	126760	It's the reason for the letter X.
126760	127840	Yes.
127840	132640	And so I went back into the concert hall and there was a concert in play with an ostrich
132640	137040	singing and everyone playing the instruments and it was all you know the music that's already
137040	141760	in the Animal Crossing games but they were just switching from it and she was singing
141760	144200	along and you could hear it and you could play along with them.
144200	147280	You could pick one of the instruments and it would play in tune with the music.
147280	149120	Animal Crossing is so stupid.
149120	151880	Your butt's cheating.
151880	155040	We do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network of vog network dot
155040	159160	com and if you are listening to us you should join our chat room live dot vog network dot
159160	163840	com where Tigerclaw is asking what about a tuba or a cowbell.
163840	165360	There wasn't a tuba.
165360	166360	There was no tuba.
166360	167360	There was a tuba.
167360	168360	Somebody needs to introduce the animals.
168360	170120	Oh the other instrument I put in there was a harp.
170120	171120	There you go.
171120	172120	Add a harp.
172120	173120	That's a busy, busy orchestra.
173120	177120	Uh of course six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern every week right after the Bobby Blackwolf
177120	178880	show at the voice of geeks network.
178880	182240	Uh joining me here in studio as well say hello to tech master Loki.
182240	183240	Hey what's up.
183240	184240	Hey not much how you doing Loki?
184240	188320	Not much just haven't been on Humble Bundle in a while so I was seeing what was there.
188320	190520	This is exactly how our last show started.
190520	192920	And nothing really there.
192920	194200	Yeah not yet.
194200	195400	Maybe they're setting up for something big.
195440	196440	Who knows.
196440	199720	Yeah they have like some sale thing because I guess they're their two year anniversary
199720	201720	at the Humble store or something like that.
201720	202720	Fair enough.
202720	204000	You know it's.
204000	208220	So again our pal Bobby was off tonight so we were chatting in studio before usually
208220	211560	we'll be listening to him and you know so we're prepared to chat with him at the end
211560	215000	of the show and so forth but tonight we were just able to kind of catch up and talk about
215000	217160	some random topics off air.
217160	221440	And you were talking about your son and how you're trying to get your son to watch Marvel
221440	223880	movies but he's not having it right.
223880	227560	No he doesn't want to watch Marvel movies because he's you know kind of timid about
227560	230920	everything so you know honestly it's a little violent.
230920	234600	I mean I guess PG-13 maybe needs to wait a couple of years you know.
234600	239560	So it's a little violent for children but I found it fascinating what he does watch.
239560	244360	Yes he does watch he's been watching a lot of YouTube lately because they kind of get
244360	248760	I'm well I'm getting sick of what they're watching on TV and so he watches YouTube videos
248760	250120	of Minecraft.
250120	254240	And so it's basically whatever comes up first when you type in Minecraft which ends up being
254240	260800	the diamond mine cart and popular MMOs and so he watches people play mods and that's
260800	261800	about it.
261800	265080	Yeah I play different Minecraft games and he watches that for hours.
265080	270800	It's fascinating to me to think like this is what let's play culture is becoming because
270800	276520	you know I was a kid raised on what Mr. Rogers neighborhood and what square one television
276520	279080	and Sesame Street and everything on PBS.
279080	283400	Your kid is in part I'm sure he watches some of that stuff too but is in part being raised
283400	284920	by let's plays.
284920	290200	Yeah they want like it see the kids they want to watch what they want to watch right away.
290200	293600	It's not oh hey SpongeBob is on.
293600	294760	No that's not going to work.
294760	298000	It's it's I need to watch videos of Olaf right now.
298000	300360	You know that's what my youngest son is.
300360	303200	Interesting and that's kind of what this video on demand culture is creating.
303200	306360	Yeah it's just like I want to watch Minecraft videos.
306360	307360	Done.
307360	308360	Minecraft videos.
308360	314600	You know instead of like oh hey I got to wait until five o'clock for you ultimate Spider-Man
314600	316040	to be on or something like that.
316040	317040	That's not going to happen.
317040	321160	It's just you know it just reminds me of the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the
321160	325320	girl Veruca Salt who's the I want it now because you know they had the that was all in the
325320	329320	news this week because there was the 44th anniversary or something they all reunited
329320	334440	on one of the talk shows here and you know I don't know just kind of full circle there.
334440	338480	I want it now and you can get it now with video on demand.
338480	343360	Yeah I mean and that's kind of the thing and I think you know with these channels as long
343360	347280	as they're you know not too explicit.
347280	351320	And I think with most of the Minecraft people that play those they know their audience and
351320	354480	they're not too bad and it's somewhat entertaining.
354480	358520	I mean it's enough to keep them you know occupied for a few hours.
358520	361480	So and it doesn't cost me anything.
361520	366240	Oh and hey I'm not definitely I'm definitely not paying for YouTube reds.
366240	367240	So there's that.
367240	368240	I don't blame you there.
368240	370440	Go into our chat room at live dot vog network dot com.
370440	372440	Kaijuto says his son is smart.
372440	374000	Marvel is for chumps.
374000	377800	Oh that's not a that's not a play so we're starting.
377800	379280	He likes Marvel as well.
379280	383680	I mean he still loves all the Marvel superheroes and plays all that stuff but he's really into
383680	387960	Minecraft Tigerclaw suggesting he should watch the Star Wars movies to prepare him for The
387960	389240	Force Awakens.
389240	390720	He's not going to see The Force Awakens.
390720	395800	He doesn't care he doesn't even know anything about the series and it would be too scary
395800	396800	for him.
396800	401160	I didn't want to see The Force Awakens but you know that probably won't be until.
401160	402160	Yeah.
402160	405680	No way am I going to go when it first comes out and just all the crazy in January.
405680	408320	I'll wait and see in January.
408320	409320	Let's see.
409320	413760	Weiland saying square one oh man bringing that show up totally isn't dating yourself.
413760	418760	Can you watch math net on demand because I'm telling you that was quality television right
418760	419760	there.
419760	424120	I'm I'm sure if it's on YouTube you can because I mean what the thing about YouTube which
424120	428120	is great before used to be OK find the video and there you go.
428120	432200	Now you type in something OK watch this video and it just plays the next one and the next
432200	435080	one and the next one and the next one forever.
435080	437240	Yeah which kind of can be annoying sometimes though.
437240	440920	Yeah sometimes it doesn't really like fit like when we're doing Olaf it pulls up a League
440920	445360	of Legends video in the middle somewhere you know because there's some guy named Olaf that
445360	447880	plays League of Legends.
447880	448880	Let's see.
448880	451680	And lastly before we get into you know the rest of what we have planned for the show
451680	452680	tonight.
452680	455680	S.S.J. 100 Matt in chat says Minecraft is the game the kids are growing up with.
455680	460520	It's crazy to think about them possibly starting their own podcast many years later reminiscing
460520	463060	about Minecraft and other current games.
463060	467040	You had the way we reminisce about you know math net or whatever it is square one television
467040	469980	and all the rad stuff when I was a kid.
469980	473040	Just you know people will be reminiscing about Minecraft.
473040	474520	It's so interesting to think.
474520	477720	Well here's the funny thing is whenever he sees like an eight bit game or something it's
477720	482320	all yeah it looks like Minecraft because it's blocky.
482320	484560	I'm like no that's what graphics used to look like.
484560	485560	You know.
485560	486560	Oh my gosh.
486560	487940	It's not on purpose like Minecraft is.
487940	489720	How funny.
489720	493280	OK so let's get into some of the other topics we have to discuss for tonight's show.
493280	498640	First off let's talk about last week because we there was no show on the feed last week
498640	502800	and you know I tried to get the word out on Twitter and Facebook and stuff that there
502800	505940	was going to be a show but I was still getting messages even today like did you guys do a
505940	506940	show last week.
507160	508160	So here's the thing.
508160	512940	We had a show all set up ready to go at probably at about two o'clock that day we thought we
512940	517460	were going to still do the show and then I definitely felt like I was feeling sick.
517460	521220	Like you know how you just kind of start like all of a sudden you're like oh I feel it.
521220	523980	I feel the scratch in the nose the throat.
523980	527920	So I knew I was getting sick and it was setting in rapidly so I kind of made a call at about
527920	532180	four o'clock like we're not going to do the show because I'm getting sick and I don't
532180	536860	want to get Loki sick who would then in turn get the kids sick.
536860	540860	Jimmy was already here because sometimes she gets here early so we can hang out before
540860	541860	the show.
541860	542860	But you kind of saw that.
542860	543860	I was already out in the area.
543860	547120	Yeah you kind of saw that I was starting to get sick and you were like yeah probably not
547120	548120	doing the shows.
548120	550420	Well that when you started taking a nap I just left.
550420	555780	I was in the middle of sitting in a park blasting a portal but you know that just.
555780	559620	I mean I want to reminisce to the days where Loki hated Ingress and didn't understand the
559620	560620	point.
560620	561860	Well I don't understand it.
561860	565360	It's still like sometimes I wonder why I'm even playing it because it's like it's really
565360	566360	pointless.
566360	570920	No believe me believe me I've been there about once a week I have that discussion with myself.
570920	572520	Why am I playing this fucking game.
572520	576680	But there are some really rad people I've been playing it but anyway that all that aside.
576680	577680	Yeah.
577680	579460	So so long story short I got sick.
579460	583560	I didn't want to get my co-host sick because we all tape here at my house which where Studio
583560	586560	N7 is located here in lovely Sacramento California.
586560	592400	So you know I hate not doing a show and having an irregular week off because you know anytime
592400	596600	I've done a panel on podcasting or given people advice on podcasting and my advice
596600	600200	continues to be make sure you are regular with your show.
600200	606200	Do a show every week because when you don't do a show that's when your audience find something
606200	607280	to replace you.
607280	612080	So I really I mean I'm OK with missing a show when it's a holiday or something where your
612080	616560	listeners are probably distracted as well and not going to be listening but you know
616560	617560	yeah.
617560	621840	So I really hate missing shows but I know all our listeners are pretty decent people
621840	625200	and you know when they heard I was sick I was getting a lot of nice messages on Twitter
625200	626200	and stuff.
626200	629640	We understand feel better it sucks but you know you have been more convenient this week
629640	634160	because there's Fallout 4 and people like right to show right.
634160	635160	What day is this.
635160	639000	I was worried some of my co-workers are probably going to think like did he take time off to
639000	643100	play video games which is funny because I'm not even playing Fallout 4 but no I was legit
643100	647200	sick and I just have to say this be the end of it and we'll get into actual video games
647200	653640	but like this is probably the worst I've been sick since I had the swine flu in like
653640	654640	2009.
654640	655640	Right.
655640	657800	But like even Alan was commenting like the whole time we've been together.
657800	660560	This is the sickest you see me I'm pretty sure I had the flu and you might even still
660560	664920	hear it in my voice like I'm still congested even today and it's been a week.
664920	667840	Bobby in chat says canceling a show to play Fallout 4.
667840	669300	Who would do such a thing.
669300	672840	Is that why there's no Bobby tonight.
672840	673840	That's funny.
673840	674840	All right.
674840	675900	Anyway so there you go.
675900	677120	That's what happened with last week's show.
677120	678120	So sorry about that.
678120	682640	So it's funny we had a whole show show role and everything set up for last week and stories
682640	687440	we were going to discuss but that's going to make our kickoff topic very easy tonight.
687440	694340	So to kick off our show tonight we'd like to present last week's news set to Holik.
694340	698760	Last week for the week of November 8th in gaming Blizzcon happened over the weekend
698760	701960	before the what would have been the last show and there was a lot of news coming out of
701960	702960	Activision Blizzard.
702960	707880	For one Activision bought the company King the makers of Candy Crush.
707880	711960	They felt that EA was getting too evil and they really needed to up their evil game.
711960	713560	They were diversifying their evil.
713560	718560	A lot of people had a lot to say about Activision buying King which some people see as a one
718560	723480	trick pony but I'm sure Activision sees as a way to tap into the mobile market and a
723480	726960	lot of still loyal Candy Crush players.
726960	731640	Also out of Blizzcon the first trailer for the World of Warcraft movie was released and
731640	734840	I'll just tell you on a personal note what they showed last year looked better in my
734840	738920	opinion but I will still see the movie it looked well enough.
738920	743400	Destiny celebrating 25 million users that game is sure having a renaissance.
743400	748880	Funny coming off of the Activision story and Diablo 3 experienced a very similar thing.
748880	753600	On N7 day November 7th which was last week big day for Mass Effect fans a new teaser
753600	758800	was shown for Mass Effect Andromeda narrated by FemShep which was interesting because they
758800	762240	said that Shepard has nothing to do with the new trilogy but yet there she is narrating
762240	764840	the trailer who knows.
764840	770760	Let's see and then Borderlines online cancelled sorry to hear that and then Konami closing
770760	777980	their last studio in the US in Los Angeles and that is last week's news in a nutshell.
777980	779360	So there you go.
779360	782360	Anything else big from last week you guys think is worth discussing you want to mention
782360	785040	real quick?
785040	787760	Well the Activision is talking about getting into the movie business but I guess it's not
787760	791360	really that surprising they were talking about making a Skylanders show for a while
791360	798960	now and some of that's going to be a thing Skylanders Academy and yeah and maybe they're
798960	801040	going to be making Call of Duty movies.
801040	804600	Yeah there was a lot of movie news last week which I wouldn't actually be too bad because
804600	808000	they have an okay storyline well and it was one of those things that when they announced
808000	810440	that they're going to make movies out of Call of Duty I was like I thought that was already
810440	814760	a thing that was happening somewhere and to be honest I mean the storylines now with all
814760	819320	the like futuristic tech and stuff is a little bit more interesting than just you know World
819320	820320	War II.
820320	822960	I think Kevin Spacey will be in it because you know he was in the in the games right?
822960	825760	Probably not but cool.
825760	830080	Yeah so Activision Blizzard forming like some type of like movie studio I guess was was
830080	835320	in the news last week as well but not just them doing movies The Witcher was going to
835320	840440	be getting a movie in 2017 but it should be noted that's because those games are based
840440	844680	off a book series the book series technically is what they're turning into a movie but some
844680	848960	you know still see it certainly as you know the same universe as the games so that is
848960	853200	going to be getting a movie out of that and then one other quick thing I want to mention
853200	856800	out last week because I thought this was interesting and it was something we were going to talk
856800	863920	a little more about but Valve kind of got the smackdown from a UK advertising authority
863920	869400	over misleading customers during the Steam summer sale and the reason why and I remember
869400	871000	seeing this on the US store.
871000	872720	It wasn't Val's fault though.
872720	877000	Well they still it was their store it was on their shelf right but here's the thing
877000	884600	so Grand Theft Auto was on sale for $39.99 but technically that wasn't what was really
884600	890040	on sale you could essentially it was you got the game and the bonus currency for the price
890040	895560	of the game is what it was so people were saying that this discount wasn't genuine because
895560	900120	the product that they were advertising didn't exist before the sale and I thought it was
900120	905360	because they what they did is they raised the price of the game and then discounted
905360	909660	it back to its original price to show that there was a price drop like it was on sale
909660	913680	but it was being sold for its original price was the issue yeah because they included the
913680	916960	currency in it that's what they did they did they raised the price by including that fake
916960	923840	currency essentially so and yeah that was they got they got in trouble for that so Valve
923840	928120	has to not show those sales in that way ever again and must ensure that future discounts
928120	934080	are not misleading so you know Valve is usually up to as a company that does no wrong you
934080	939720	know all hail Gabe is it steam sale time and all that stuff but you know that was a but
939720	942080	you you say actually it's not Valve's fault.
942080	946600	I think it's Rockstar's fault because they're the ones that deal with you know setting prices
946600	950400	on that stuff it's just a storefront they were doing that not only on Valve's storefront
950400	955440	but on other storefronts as well it was just jacking it up and that's what people call
955440	959280	them out on it like immediately.
959280	962880	Bobby Blackwolf trying to lend some clarity here going the problem with the Valve thing
962880	967280	is that they showed them side by side they showed the game only not on sale for forty
967280	971120	dollars and then they showed the game with the bonus currency on sale for forty dollars
971120	977160	next to each other by accident so I mean I remember going onto the store and seeing the
977160	981960	whole sale with the currency and yeah I understand that for an hour it showed something different
981960	985400	and this is where they kind of got caught but I remember even at the time when I saw
985400	989640	that seeing like oh they just jacked up the price of the game by including the currency
989640	994080	and then put that on sale I was like that's kind of shady but I mean the game was brand
994080	999260	new at the time I wasn't expecting it to be on sale but I was kind of like that's a little
999260	1004000	you know that brand new just put the just knock five bucks off or do ten percent or
1004000	1009960	something that's like really really you know not that big a deal you don't have to do one
1009960	1014720	of the famous you know steam sale deep discounts just do a little discount to get people excited
1014720	1019520	about it I don't know anyway so essentially that was last week's news some of the stuff
1019520	1024000	we missed last week so we will get into this week's news but first we always like to start
1024000	1028520	off the show talking about our gaming weeks so let's get to it Dark Sakura how was your
1028520	1035160	gaming week kind of busy we got Fallout 4 which is okay I'm really is more Dan playing
1035160	1044440	it than me we also were playing Animal Crossing amiibo festival which was actually stupidly
1044440	1054360	fun but kind of disarming in how easily one can overtake the other you play for happiness
1054360	1059640	is it Mario Party I couldn't get the sense what there's no minigames oh but you do little
1059640	1065640	things along with it like you play the turnip the stalk market you do the turnip thing and
1065640	1072600	you have different special events that happen every random day and you have holiday events
1072600	1077160	you can play the calendar any time of the year but we did November twice so we had to
1077160	1081640	help gather ingredients for Thanksgiving and it's all the Animal Crossing characters show
1081640	1089800	up and you can play I've got four amiibos now the villager does not work so that is
1089800	1094080	so weird the villager is not one of the amiibo I mean I realize they have a whole separate
1094080	1098880	line for Animal Crossing but it's weird like yeah amiibo have usually crossed over you
1098880	1104120	know and the other it's weird the Animal Crossing amiibo work in Smash Brothers but in Mario
1104120	1110920	Maker so but so we got the two that came with it which was Isabelle and Digby and I picked
1110920	1117080	up Mabel and Tom Nook and I want the pack that's got Toto KK in it I mean sorry KK slider
1117080	1124620	I just think it's cool to say Toto KK because it's fun to say so anyway we've been say total
1124620	1132800	bukkake what did you say Toto KK okay so anyway I've been playing that I've been playing
1132800	1137600	Animal Crossing happy home designer which it's been fun but it's a little disappointing
1137600	1142460	how short the actual game itself is because I think I'm actually at endgame now which
1142460	1147600	is I mean you can still play but it's I'm going to get the credit soon I'll put it that
1147600	1156000	way I've done all the town projects I've been playing some Dragon Age Inquisition I didn't
1156000	1161640	play any Final Fantasy like I said I was you've had a very Animal Crossing filled week actually
1161640	1166000	question for you from our chat room about Fallout SSJ100 Matt wanting to know if watching
1166000	1170080	Dan play gets you sick after a while because you've talked about like motion sickness yes
1170080	1176240	some of that so I figured that when it comes time for me to play it more I'm gonna do it
1176240	1181080	in the third person perspective so that I don't have to oh yeah that's right because
1181080	1185100	Bethesda is pretty good about that yeah that's one button it flips it between yeah that's
1185100	1192800	in Skyrim and all that too yeah what else was it that I put yeah I'm playing Undertale
1192800	1197580	which I haven't gotten too far because I hate the control scheme in it and if I can
1197580	1201580	figure out how to remap the controls in it I'll have a bit much better time playing it
1201580	1207640	I'm sure that can't be too difficult to do no but it's a cute game it's very like a fucked
1207640	1212200	up NES game I have a lot of people telling me I need to play Undertale and I do I it's
1212200	1216520	on my list of things to get to before the year's up we'll see I've also been playing
1216520	1223020	the beginner's guide which is I think I might have talked about it before but basically
1223020	1228760	you're just sort of walked through this one amateur game designers designs you know whether
1228760	1235320	they be map projects or you know his own little incomplete games but you get to wander around
1235320	1240840	in the universe and look into some of the guys thoughts on gaming and I just got Dear
1240840	1245640	Esther today which I had been meaning to play so I'm looking forward to starting that oh
1245640	1250360	that's by the folks who do Everybody's Gone to the Rapture that's kind of the pre well
1250360	1254960	the games aren't necessarily related but I guess there's elements of Rapture which is
1254960	1261360	still one of my favorite experiences in gaming this year so far that game was was I feel
1261360	1267640	weird calling it a game I would say that experience was I still think it's an interactive experience
1267640	1274840	worth experiencing but yeah so but Dear Esther was only 10 bucks so I got it yeah on Steam
1274840	1283120	I thought there was something else but no you got all the big stuff yeah well no we
1283120	1288920	got more games we got because we took advantage of the buy to get one free deal at Target
1288920	1294200	so I took back need for speed to get my Animal Crossing because it was actually the same
1294200	1306040	price I got so we got Mario Party Smash Brothers what else did we get oh yeah Dan got Metal
1306040	1313040	Gear Solid 5 and Fallout 4 and what was the other game that we picked up can't even remember
1313040	1319720	it seriously I can't well he was gonna get me Yoshi and then decided I guess it honestly
1319720	1326680	enough I've got so many things on the plate right now but oh yeah we got Mario Kart okay
1326680	1333160	yeah so that's one you should have yeah all right there it is Alan alchemy in chat saying
1333160	1336640	I think Dear Esther started as a half-life 2 mod years and years ago yeah that's true
1336640	1341640	actually that started as a mod and then kind of spun off into its own thing so kind of
1341640	1346920	funny the evolution of how that game maker kind of created their stuff let's go over
1346920	1352360	to Loki how was your gaming week I played quite a bit I see I played a little bit of
1352360	1357560	Fallout 4 only a couple hours of that because that's all I had time for at the time and
1357560	1362240	I haven't been able to play it since because my wife has been hogging the TV so I need
1362240	1369200	to figure out something to play it so I don't have to have the TV and then I played a little
1369200	1374120	bit Mario maker I played through all the different event stages that they had so you can unlock
1374120	1380840	the different characters for the mystery mushroom so they have like all the Game Center
1380840	1386080	CX and the Famitsu and all that stuff those characters you can unlock so I played through
1386080	1393200	all those and what else I played a little bit of Minecraft Windows 10 edition but once
1393200	1399920	again it's just kind of like no point to it I kind of I'm so wishing that like the regular
1399920	1405560	game ran as well as it does in Windows 10 on that version but it's so limited because
1405560	1410280	it's based off the mobile version so like I was trying to figure out like how to make
1410280	1413880	stairs the other day I was like how the hell I'm like I'm doing the recipe right now why
1413880	1418520	the fuck is this not working and so I look it up online there's like a separate exclusive
1418520	1423220	thing for the pocket edition that you have to have to like cut the stone or something
1423220	1427560	like that like this is dumb yeah they really just need to make it regular Minecraft just
1427560	1431240	like I'll put some regular Minecraft back on there or something like that and just play
1431240	1434800	that with some mods and stuff because watching those videos you know with my son and everything
1434800	1438680	I'm like hey that looks pretty cool I want to play that it's you know kind of getting
1438680	1443960	me back into that a little bit but I just haven't really played it yet and then what
1443960	1449920	else do they play I played more ingress of course quite a bit actually I had to cut it
1449920	1456020	back a little bit to this week because I'm running out of data on my plan for one and
1456020	1460860	I've run out of inventory pretty much now except Rob helped me out by give me quite
1460860	1470140	a few bursters they might be listening and then and then just like I don't know so this
1470140	1476860	week I actually have two days that I'll be able to play so we'll see tell them your plans
1476860	1482260	they're everywhere I'm almost to level 8 so I'm like 120 get there hundred and sixty thousand
1482260	1489180	away from level 8 but I knocked I think I got a hundred two hundred K in like one day
1489180	1493940	like for a couple hours so I don't think it'll be a problem now that you are like you know
1493940	1497800	full throttle on team ingress and all this how do you feel about the book Pokemon go
1497800	1502280	thing is this something you know no not interested not interested I don't like Pokemon what do
1502280	1505920	you think though now that you have more experience with ingress about the fact that this company
1505920	1509340	that you know has made this game is going to be making the Pokemon go I don't know what
1509340	1512820	they're really gonna do with it is just gonna be spots where you go try to find Pokemon
1512820	1516260	I mean how's that gonna work do you battle other people I mean yeah I don't know there's
1516260	1519980	still a lot of like I think there could be like more excitement to ingress as well because
1519980	1525460	it's kind of just like okay go within proximity hit a button trace some stuff done it's not
1525460	1528780	like hey there's another player over there I'm gonna battle you or something like that
1528780	1532220	because I'd be a little more interesting but we made eye contact there like the other day
1532220	1538420	like when I was playing you know I I see the other team playing and it's like it's completely
1538460	1544140	lazy on their part like I'm out of my car you know and like going up to these portals to like
1544140	1548980	hit different things cuz like I can't hit him with the bursars I have and I see these guys just like
1548980	1554060	driving a car they literally just stop they're illegally parked playing the thing and then they
1554060	1558020	blow up my portal link a second and then they drive the next one blow up that one in a second
1558020	1564060	and that's it I wave to them no waving back I'm like what the fuck I mean seriously like there's
1564060	1568260	some that like kind of like tease back and forth and stuff you know like they'll blast my portal
1568260	1572700	once not really doing any damage like just want to make sure you're awake I'm like yeah I'm awake
1572700	1578580	you know it's you know fun stuff like that but yeah I don't know these like the other team has
1578580	1584060	seemed very friendly like I think I waved I'm like hey Cobra senior hey how's it going you know like
1584060	1590260	I just kind of waved in like nothing just like blank face driving around yeah you got it like
1590260	1594780	you're taking it way too serious and there's you know as far as that team thing goes there's bad
1594780	1598220	apples on every team I'm sure there's people on our side that are that are mean about it too
1598220	1601180	because I've met some nice people on the other team and what have you but I'm like at the end
1601180	1606020	of the day you know for those people I just say like we're all fucking nerds we're playing a cell
1606020	1610100	phone game that involves going out in the real world like you're a fucking nerd too as much as
1610100	1614620	I am so why don't we just say hey and talk about nerd stuff for like five seconds I never understood
1614620	1621060	that was like I am going to inherently have a problem with you because your favorite color
1621060	1626340	and mine are different I just think it's so like I just thought it'd be just like kind of like you
1626340	1630740	know hey I blew yours up hi you know just like that would have been fine I was because I was
1630740	1637060	trying to be friendly hey ice I know it's you you know hey and now is that I mean it's like nothing
1637060	1641660	and they just look so lazy they won't even get out their car like it's like the portals just a
1641660	1646380	slightly a couple feet away oh but I can't possibly put anything on it because that would
1646380	1652820	involve me stepping out of my vehicle it's like whatever I whatever yeah I know and I just don't
1652820	1656900	have the time to drive around like all day long doing that and like some of them do I guess but
1656900	1660980	you can't control other can people you can only control yourself and I know that I've seen way
1660980	1664940	more places because of the game and done a lot more walking and some like whatever I'm getting
1664940	1670420	what I need out of it yeah so that's that yeah anything else for your game of the week I think
1670420	1675420	does it all right my gaming week not super eventful obviously because the flu is kind of knocked me
1675420	1679660	out a little bit yokai watch I guess I didn't get to talk about that last week but I did buy
1679660	1685620	yokai watch I've been playing quite a bit of that I'm having a good time with the game I think it's
1685620	1692020	pretty fun and it's it's interesting going around and the way you kind of will use your spy glass
1692020	1698020	to find the yokai and then the battle system I like it's you spin this wheel around that will
1698020	1703340	choose the three characters and they auto battle but you can control their ultra moves and you can
1703340	1707900	control the targeting but you have to be not only watching what you're doing on the bottom screen
1707900	1711300	but you want to kind of like watch the top screen because sometimes there might be like items that
1711300	1715620	flow around that you have to throw a dart at like I know I'm making it sound really complicated
1715620	1720520	because it is in some ways it's it's it's more in depth than you might have gotten the impression
1720520	1725820	from the demo because it's just the auto battling in the demo but there's there's a bit going on I
1725980	1732260	think yokai is pretty interesting and I like how you can use the play coins to get extra items or
1732260	1738380	even yokai there's even QR codes out there you can find a tumblr full of them that you can scan on
1738380	1744860	your DS and you can get like special event coins they'll get your random yokai and yeah so I don't
1744860	1751140	know it's like Pokemon in the sense that you know you have these little dudes that you collect that
1751140	1756420	go with you to fight for you but otherwise the battling is very very different and even the game
1756420	1763700	itself it's just in the fantasy life engine like and it's just a more modern-day setting otherwise
1763700	1769700	but the game looks a lot like fantasy life if you ever played that and just you know kind of plays
1769700	1774140	a little differently with the battling system but I'm enjoying a yokai watch so I was playing a lot
1774140	1779180	of that last week this week I played a little more as I've been sick but otherwise I haven't played a
1779180	1784100	lot of new stuff I've just been playing Final Fantasy 14 quite a bit because they had the patch
1784100	1788300	that came out this week where they have a new raid called the void arc and they have two new dungeons
1788300	1796060	I've been leveling my machinist I was 30 a couple weeks ago which is the starting level for machinist
1796060	1803860	and I'm already now 51 almost 52 probably will hit 52 tonight so you know I've just been doing that
1803860	1807660	I've been having a lot of fun playing that class that's one of the new classes they released in the
1807660	1813100	heavensward expansion so I think I just like heavensward jobs because my main is an astrologian
1813100	1818100	now I have a machinist and if I'm gonna play a tank dark knight is actually my favorite so I
1818100	1823940	think I'm just I'm just the kind of person that really likes the heavensward jobs so that's been
1823940	1830780	playing a lot of that otherwise not a lot of new stuff on PlayStation or Wii U or any of that stuff
1830780	1837340	just mostly Final Fantasy 14 so we'll probably get back into the consoles this week as I'm
1838020	1843340	feeling a lot better but I'm telling you earlier this week was not pretty I didn't even really want
1843340	1853220	to play any video games that's how you know I'm sick that's how you know anyhow so oh I guess I
1853220	1858380	should say one other thing on on 3ds because I have some opinions about this so I mean we're
1858380	1863620	gonna get into this in the news in a little bit but Nintendo released this badge arcade thing if
1863620	1869260	you guys seen this on the 3ds the badge arcade which is in Japan they've had it for a while I
1869260	1873700	know this cuz Shane was talking to me about this before cuz he had a Japanese 3ds and so he was
1873700	1878580	telling me about this and so I guess it finally came out here so I was checking it out and it's
1878580	1884260	an interesting concept if you haven't played it at all it's a free app that you download on your
1884260	1890700	3ds and it's like crane games it's free to start yeah yeah I'll get there so it's it's these crane
1890780	1897140	games and so you can control these cranes and you can like pluck these little badges and if it
1897140	1901860	grabs them and you know it gets gets them out at the crane crane game then you can actually use
1901860	1907020	these badges on your 3ds home screen to like decorate folders or you can actually use them
1907020	1912660	on any of the empty spots to actually kind of create like you know like a little pattern so I
1912660	1917740	guess and then there's like backgrounds you can buy of course that you can then kind of mix and
1917740	1922820	match some of the badges to kind of get these full-on like Zelda themes or other like retro
1922820	1928300	Mario Brothers or even Splatoon and some of the other newer Nintendo stuff and some of the crane
1928300	1932860	games are different too because like there's like a hammer one where instead of a crane like a hammer
1932860	1937660	will come down and go thwunk and it'll knock all the badges hopefully into the chute like if you
1937660	1941580	time it right and then I saw one today that was like a bomb or something where you drop a bomb
1941580	1948140	and the bomb explodes it makes the badges go everywhere so but here's the thing um you have
1948140	1957500	to pay one dollar for five plays on a machine now every day you can do a practice machine one time
1957500	1964380	and the practice machine if you do well will get you anywhere between one and like five free plays
1964380	1969580	and I think you know usually the bunny will just end up giving you one free play a day anyway so
1969580	1975180	usually end up with like two to five free plays a day but I gotta say I don't know I think it's
1975180	1979980	kind of shady the fact that they're selling the plays for a dollar and you're not even
1979980	1985220	necessarily guaranteed to get anything out of it and it's kind of like the prizes I don't think
1985220	1991300	the badges are that exciting like big deal so you can decorate your home screen with sprites I just
1991300	1997340	I don't get it and I just I don't know so I've been kind of lazily checking it once a day the
1997340	2001660	past few days just to kind of see like oh what can I get for free out of two plays but then it's
2001660	2006740	like I win stuff and it's like great things I don't really want to use because I have this
2006740	2013220	awesome NES remix theme on my DS and it's like I'll just stick with that it's fine the other
2013220	2017140	thing I just thought was interesting about the whole badge arcade is that when you when you log
2017140	2022020	in for the first time in a day the bunny will start telling you about the featured game and
2022020	2028140	it's like a fucking commercial it's like did you know it's the 30th anniversary of Super Mario
2028140	2033060	Brothers and did you know there's this game called Mario maker that's out right now and look at all
2033060	2037860	these cool things you can do a Mario maker and right now we have these crane games to celebrate
2037860	2043800	Mario maker so you should check out Mario maker it's available in the Wii U eShop right now tell
2043800	2051140	me have you played Mario maker and it's like oh my god bunny die like just leave me alone it's it's
2051140	2058180	like you have to sit through this commercial to get one free play where you might win a Zelda
2058180	2063820	badge but you're not gonna get link or Zelda from the crane your first go you're gonna get like one
2063820	2069460	of the shitty little rocks that you can push to maybe see a staircase under like if you want to
2069460	2075420	actually have enough place where maybe you can pluck the link badge for your profile give me a
2075420	2081340	dollar it's just I don't know it's a little bit ridiculous and I don't like it I get that this
2081340	2088500	might be like a mobile phone thing or maybe bigger in Japan or whatever but I still don't like it so
2088500	2096580	that's all I have to say about that why why are in chat at live.vognetwork.com has some comments
2096580	2102300	on this saying I've been playing this on my Japanese 3ds for ages the crane physics are
2102300	2107500	pretty realistic if you buy two dollars in plays on the same day you get a theme that matches the
2107500	2113740	badges you're playing for if you're into themes it could be a good deal and he says something sales
2113740	2119900	bunny overdrive sales bunnies my man my homie my wife but he's got no place in ingress thug life
2119900	2126140	I have no idea what that means if you read up higher he was doing like a little oh was he right
2126540	2132980	sorry that's I'm doing I'm reading is ingress like smashing your portals we don't give a fuck
2132980	2137900	yo batter he's whacked dead phone out of luck do any of those guys as they drive up and blast your
2137900	2141420	portal they like blasting music from there no they're not blessed see that would be more
2141420	2144900	interesting then they're just driving by saying well you think because you think you know they're
2144900	2149420	not gonna be blasting like rap music or even country music they'll be blasting like the
2149420	2154940	soundtrack to Tron or something you would think I don't know at least maybe that's just me that's
2154940	2160860	how I roll I don't know all right let's see dungeon buster and chat says well if it helps
2160860	2169780	there aren't any bunnies in fallout 4 not even mutated once there it is all right that's gonna
2169780	2177220	do it for our gaming weeks as far as housekeeping goes we don't have a whole lot to say except that
2177220	2182140	we actually we won't have a show over Thanksgiving week so I know that's two shows gone in November
2182140	2187580	so I'm sorry guys but the last one wasn't planned but as far as the holiday weekend goes the show on
2187580	2191780	the 29th wouldn't really surprise me a lot of you guys are gonna be out of town and doing other
2191780	2196580	stuff anyway so we won't be here in two weeks but we will be here next week of course for episode
2196580	2202220	number 622 and then we should be here through most of the holiday period I didn't look to see
2202220	2208180	what days this year the holidays were on what day are the big ones on the towards the end of
2208180	2211700	the week but it's not the weekend looks like Christmas and New Year's Day are both Fridays
2211780	2217620	this year so there you go and dark soccer what do you do you have services for Hanukkah on any
2217620	2223220	Sundays no why would they be on Sunday I don't know it's on Friday right that's Shabbat yeah so
2223220	2228580	just checking next year it's supposed to be on Sunday I think or Saturday Sunday is it yeah
2228580	2236340	it's it's my synagogue usual do either like a first night or last night service or do like a
2236420	2243420	Shabbat service for Hanukkah um if I can make it out there I'll of course I'll be going but well
2243420	2249420	actually and actually now that I'm thinking about this we probably won't be here on December I think
2249420	2257460	it's 14th because dark soccer and I are gonna be a gamer X in San Jose which vog network is a little
2257460	2261500	little sponsor of we're actually gonna have a table at the show I actually filled out a little
2261500	2266340	forum I didn't talk to you about that they're sorry you talked to that off-air but we December
2266340	2271420	13th it's funny I'm gonna be bringing my menorah with me oh is it during Hanukkah it's during
2271420	2277940	Hanukkah how funny so they um but I might try to find a little do they have dreidel drinking games
2277940	2282700	or is that like we could come up with that cuz I'm totally down for a dreidel drinking game if
2282700	2288500	that's not like offensive or whatever it's just jam it's just gambling it's all it is I'll teach
2288500	2292860	everyone how to play the dreidel game and we'll play with you know pills can we play for like
2292860	2298580	y'all flavored shots oh my gosh well guilt chocolate well chocolate shots will bring it will bring guilt
2298580	2304420	all right and then like the winner gets like I don't actually if you play for shots I'd be fine
2304420	2310940	but then when you have to put that put your your guilt back then what do you do throw up just put
2310940	2316500	the glass back I don't know we'll figure something maybe someone gets a double shot I don't know
2316500	2322380	dreidel drinking games coming I'm gonna look this up yeah Hanukkah ends on the 14th or GX as they
2322380	2327580	they call it because of course everybody games and you know I have that Thursday through Monday
2327580	2332500	off yeah we're gonna have a good time we're gonna head down I think Thursday night dark soccer and I
2332500	2340420	got a sweet yo we're gonna party by the way I have to say so so I am I talked to Victoria about
2340420	2346380	doing the lady Ness mm-hmm so she's gonna help me with a circle skirt oh nice and I've ordered
2346380	2351980	a blue and white striped shirt and I'm gonna dye it yellow huh the blue is Navy blue so it shouldn't
2351980	2358740	turn green mm-hmm so and it's a like a scoop neck shirt so I'm gonna do lady Ness nice so you're
2358740	2363420	gonna be a cosplay queen that weekend it's gonna be the casual cosplay because sometimes somebody
2363420	2368060	you know one can get tired wearing you know gray warden armor and that shits heavy even for being
2368060	2374140	made out of felt so all right so there you go so we will be there in San Jose so probably not gonna
2374140	2379060	have a show that weekend I know Loki can't make it out because it's hard to get him away for a
2379060	2385940	whole weekend but we probably just if I want to like keep my life you know that's we realistically
2385940	2389620	just wouldn't be able to probably be back in time on Sunday because things will probably be closing
2389620	2394220	down Sunday afternoon I don't know we'll let you know a little closer to the day it's just a maybe
2394220	2399500	on us not being here that weekend cuz I seem to remember last year we were kind of out of there
2399500	2406740	by noon on Sunday I would say is that again December 13 13th yeah you're like I'm not gonna
2406740	2414620	be here anyway no no no no I was just curious I couldn't remember when that that event was going
2414620	2420940	on in Oakland oh it's the same day same day yeah no I can't do the big Ingers stuff in in Oakland
2420940	2428020	because gamer X is the same weekend so it's fine what times your event uh oh god I don't know they
2428020	2432500	it's like four hours long I'm not gonna skip out gamer X to go do the Ingress event I'm sorry I
2432500	2440340	draw though I draw the gamer X is more important no I draw the line all right even do they're just
2440340	2447020	like hack a poorly it's everybody it's it's like you know the video of Pokemon go where everybody
2447020	2452100	was standing in Times Square trying to capture Mewtwo that's an Ingress thing it's just a bunch
2452100	2456020	of nerds all standing around historical sites looking at their phone pew pew battling back
2456020	2461580	and forth it's pretty much what it is what I've been told I have not been to one they had one here
2461580	2465340	in Sacramento and I couldn't even go because I was in the bay I think I was at another fucking
2465340	2469140	con that weekend or something it's just like there's always some convention getting away my
2469140	2473740	Ingers but that's alright that's alright gamer X is gonna be a ton of fun we're gonna be there with
2473740	2477740	the table I think dark soccer and I think the plan is we're gonna have some classic games for
2477740	2482660	you to come over and play that's right and then you can talk to us about vog because we'll be
2482660	2489580	there which reminds me I might get the okay to bring my we just got super ever drives nice so
2489580	2494380	I might be able to bring some I'll bring the retron for sure and that'll take care of most
2494380	2498820	of the classic stuff to bring you some of my Famicom cartridges oh and I forgot to mention I guess
2498820	2501780	this part of a game week I'll just mention this real quick this is more of a last week thing but
2501780	2507660	I went to um I went to the flea market here locally and I actually picked up for my retron
2507660	2510980	five that I bought a couple weeks ago because you know those things will play all that does
2510980	2515340	those retron fives they are just an emulator but what it does it dumps the cart and then instantly
2515340	2524940	emulates it so I actually bought blaster master on cartridge goonies to star tropics and blades
2524940	2531540	of steel so like I have an awesome collection I want to see ever drives work on the retron
2532100	2537540	bring lower that would be interesting fun so I'll probably bring the retron over to gamer X so we'll
2537540	2546060	have some classic gaming set up at the table do you vote like a non Apple laptop yeah I have my
2546060	2552420	old old it's kind of old but it works the point why I was curious what are you gonna do with it
2552420	2556780	I'm not doing anything with it you asked for a reason cuz you're plotting something by the way
2557620	2563380	I'm donating your old iBook g4 to the little Apple museum that's at my work great my old
2563380	2570820	computer ends up in a museum somewhere it's a tiny use litter great great dark stalker just
2570820	2577660	told me that something I once owned is going to be in a museum how does that make me feel age wise
2577660	2590620	it's gonna be a testament to technology all right anyhow let's get into this week in gaming news
2590620	2597220	we've got a lot going on in the gaming world so we'll start off with Loki yes so this is kind of
2597220	2604580	cool you know it's finally out of like their beta testing so now they have the first 104 titles that
2604580	2611260	are gonna be backwards compatible on the Xbox one for the Xbox 360 and quite a few titles most of
2611260	2617620	those you kind of played before as part of that beta test some more notable ones on there of
2617620	2626060	course you know like fable 2 you know the Gears of War series they've got let's see just cause 2
2626060	2637660	which is pretty awesome let's see some of the Tom Clancy games a lot of the XBLA games so those
2637660	2643580	are available on there I will tell you I powered up my xbox one this week to check this out I had
2643580	2648300	15 new games available to just get in my queue and download and I was actually playing quite a bit of
2648300	2652820	luminous today yeah luminous that would be good and then Borderlands the original Borderlands was
2652820	2661100	one of those castle crashers kind of cool crazy taxi get ready to make some crazy money see I
2661100	2667660	played some luminous this week original mass effect you can you can even still if you flagged DLC back
2667660	2671500	in the day it's a little tricky it took me a minute to figure this out because I tried to get
2671500	2676940	it through the game by going to download content but what you do is on your Xbox screen where you
2676940	2680940	have all your games you hit the not the start button but I guess it's where the start button
2680940	2685860	would be the menu button and there's an option in there to like manage the game and that's where
2685860	2690460	you can pull down all the DLC that you may have had on your 360 so that's how I was able to get
2690460	2695140	like heavenly star and like the Tokyo Club stuff that was in luminous because remember they it is
2695140	2699460	the DLC so you can still get that so that that was cool because I was expecting that it was just
2699460	2705580	gonna be the playing game because it was you know just pulling down what they could emulate but I
2705580	2712060	guess you can still actually get the DLC which is great intron evolution which is an okay game yeah
2712060	2721700	not bad yep and then yeah that's it so is there gonna be more in December or have they said when
2721700	2726380	we're getting more they're working on more there you know they're gonna include some more I guess
2726380	2731380	starting in regular updates are gonna start and eventually they're gonna include Halo Reach Halo
2731380	2739100	Wars Call of Duty Black Ops the Bioshock series and Skate 3 and they're saying all future games
2739100	2746460	with gold titles would also backwards compatible as well and yeah and I know a lot of people are
2746460	2752460	trying to get Red Dead Redemption as one of those title sets backwards compatible two words Lost
2752460	2758380	Odyssey I know it was a multi-disc game that's gonna make it harder but I don't care that has
2758380	2763620	to be one of them that give us Lost Odyssey there's anybody from Microsoft out there if I
2763620	2768380	still have that somewhere oh I know I've got to have it somewhere here if not I'll go rebuy I
2768380	2776260	don't think I yeah Lost Odyssey is like the it's it's it's such a good JRPG and I I just think it
2776260	2780700	was just overlooked because you know lol Japanese game on the 360 well it's like you know when you're
2780700	2785900	playing like Final Fantasy 13 and stuff or even there's like other Final Fantasy games and it's
2786060	2790060	like didn't quite feel like the old school Final Fantasy games as far as like turn-based and stuff
2790060	2794660	mm-hmm but Lost Odyssey felt like the old school Final Fantasy games yeah it did I would even take
2794660	2800900	blue dragon I know blue dragon had its shortcomings dark soccer was a fan of blue dragon though you
2800900	2805900	kind of stuck up for that I was also high on coding a lot it was right remember it was right
2805900	2810220	after I had hand surgery yeah blue dragon just kind of felt like a Super Nintendo RPG that was
2810460	2817060	like on a Xbox 360 it was fun yeah so no I liked it I I would I would revisit blue dragon if they
2817060	2820980	would they would make that backwards compatible but we'll see I'm sure a lot of people have their
2820980	2827140	demands but I just send your tweets to Microsoft that Lost Odyssey needs to be in there as bad as
2827140	2833260	Red Dead Redemption does so just except Ron was also another backwards compatible game was it I
2833260	2836460	don't you know what's funny I think I had the original Tron but I don't know if I ever bought
2836500	2846020	discs of Tron on 360 so anyway um let's move on to some Nintendo news Nintendo had a huge week this
2846020	2851340	week obviously had a lot of people talking about their direct that they did on November 12th this
2851340	2857300	was the first Nintendo direct since the true Iwata is passing so it opened of course with Reggie
2857300	2863460	Fils-Aime and they went into a lot of different news so let's just try to skim the surface of
2863460	2867260	what was covered I'm sure a lot of you guys have already heard about a lot of this so let's talk
2867260	2875060	about it Twilight Princess HD confirmed for Wii U complete with a wolf Zelda amiibo there I'm sorry
2875060	2882020	wolf shame on me wolf link for the Legend of Zelda amiibo that was announced as well that will do
2882020	2887180	what um I didn't catch exactly what it does I don't know that I think it's supposed to work with
2887180	2893980	the new Zelda game but aside from that what will that do who cares amiibo right it'll look nice
2893980	2897940	maybe it works in other games but I will say yeah Brad from pop culture in our chat at live
2897940	2904020	dot vog network com says that amiibo looks awesome and it does look awesome I mean it kind of doesn't
2904020	2912020	doesn't need to do anything it's just you know it looks awesome so they also talked about Pokemon
2912020	2917180	super mystery dungeon which will be out on the 20th of November which is a baumannii holiday for
2917180	2923900	those you old-school fans of the show let's see there's gonna be a new online portal for Super
2923900	2927980	Mario maker which I don't understand why they couldn't just build that into Mario maker that
2927980	2932300	is a little weird isn't it you know it's like you know hey little big planet had a way to search for
2932300	2939300	levels Mario maker no you have to go to an external web portal which makes me wonder once again why
2939300	2943340	don't they get online I mean if this new console that they're coming out with is supposed to be
2943340	2949740	really online centric and no one I have a disk drive everything that kind of scares me yeah the
2949740	2955820	free to start Pokemon p cross coming out in December so another Pokemon game on 3ds that's
2955820	2963060	free to start as a lot of them tend to be poke poke and tournament coming out on Wii U for spring
2963060	2969860	2016 there will be an amiibo card for shadow Mewtwo that will be released with that a game
2969860	2977660	looks weird I'll try it release date for Star Fox zero April 22nd is the release date for Star Fox
2977660	2983380	zero and I know a lot of people looking forward that Mario Luigi paper jam dated for January 22nd
2983380	2989660	2016 Final Fantasy explorers was shown and it will be launching in January with all of the Japanese
2989660	2996220	DLC included so that's pretty cool something to give to us for making us wait for the game
2996220	3003180	Mega Man legacy on the 3ds will be coming with a gold Mega Man amiibo because Loki loves amiibo
3003180	3009980	February the 23rd my mom's birthday February 23rd of 2016 I will buy my mother a gold Mega Man amiibo
3009980	3014100	for her birthday and she will love it what's this rom well this looks like crap did you spend your
3014100	3021580	money on this you should save it Pokemon red blue and yellow going to be coming to the 3ds as kind
3021580	3032420	of like a virtual console release Lucas the amiibo coming out on January 22nd Dragon Quest 7 and 8

3044380	3049260	yeah that was really exciting news I'm very happy about that dark soccer you Dragon Quest kind of
3049260	3055260	girl you know really you know I thought you were I'm gonna check that out 7 and 8 on the 3ds for
3055260	3062420	sure and this had a lot of people talking new character announced for Hyrule Warriors 3ds
3062420	3071900	linkle the female link concept art it got such a buzz when they released that before she is now a
3071900	3077660	canon character for Hyrule Warriors there's already been cosplay I know right I gotta say
3077660	3083020	for what it's worth lingo does look badass like you know I love the character look as well and I
3083020	3089220	love the fact that they kind of took a different approach and they gave her crossbows instead of a
3089220	3094900	sword and shield so that she could kind of exist but be different you know if that makes sense so
3094900	3100820	I don't really see her as a female link because she isn't really using the same weaponry she's
3100820	3107500	just you know a female protagonist that has a lot of linked traits but she's wielding crossbows so
3107500	3113340	I just think she's she's cool and her name sounds like tinkle yeah right but here's the question now
3113340	3119900	are they gonna make a game that stars lingo because I'd actually be all for that I want to
3119900	3124740	know more about this character so I'm all for a lingo game but then what's gonna be the plot is
3124740	3133900	she out to save princess or Prince Zordla I don't know who's the Zeldorf I don't know what's gonna
3133900	3139080	happen is there gonna be a prince that she has to save or or what's the plow the goal is what
3139080	3144540	Zelda cool Zelda cool Zefram Zefram that's a that's a male name that starts with Z it could be could
3144540	3150820	be Zach Zell the legend of Zell Oh wasn't Zell characters father's day right that wasn't that's
3150820	3157180	not a real name though Zelda and link are actually real names Oh speaking of Final Fantasy this was
3157180	3163300	kind of a big deal by the way this was the one where the internet just shit itself and that was
3163300	3170100	the announcement of cloud strife as a playable character in Super Smash Brothers I know it's
3170100	3175340	about time after all the Nintendo games he's been in it's about time that you know he gets some
3175340	3183820	representation on I think it's fair to say nobody saw that coming that was quite the surprise hey
3183820	3188380	you know what in all seriousness props to the smash team for keeping that leak under wraps
3188380	3193340	because remember the right you thing got spoiled because it was in some of the data files so they
3193340	3200580	kept this one under wraps I can't wait to see Master Chief in smash net right let's let's think
3200580	3205580	what other Nintendo centric characters should be in smash next how about Lara Croft nice thing you
3205580	3210220	know when I think of Nintendo I think of Lara Croft who but see the thing is I I say that but
3210220	3216860	I'm like actually that would be a badass character for Smash Brothers oh my gosh huh I just realized
3216860	3224860	we've already had a male version of Zelda have we we've had chic I didn't think of that okay yeah
3225420	3232380	there you go are you thinking so what we're gonna get Sackboy next in smash how many more
3232380	3236820	characters do we have to add before it becomes PlayStation all-stars well we may find out when
3236820	3242580	there's a special broadcast next month for Super Smash Brothers Wii U seeing here we're all
3242580	3246140	thinking at least and I still think this that shovel knight would have been a sure thing with
3246140	3251500	the amount sure it's coming yeah it's too obvious so maybe it's just those two or maybe it'll be one
3251540	3258460	more who knows here's what I just want to Captain Rainbow so that was the Nintendo Direct and I'm
3258460	3262980	sure a lot of you have heard this news and all the joking aside about the cloud stuff and you know
3262980	3268900	wow it's kind of interesting that they chose a character from what was notably so the first
3268900	3274260	Final Fantasy game not initially released on a Nintendo platform wasn't it supposed to be like
3274260	3278380	you didn't like Final Fantasy 6 that they were supposed to be redoing or something like that
3278380	3283100	end up being that was just a tech demo that if you're thinking about the fantasy 6 Nintendo 64
3283100	3288980	thing that was just tech demo but anyway all that stuff aside here's the reality check though if
3288980	3293780	they had come and said that the character that was going to be in the game was going to be I
3293780	3300700	don't know lock from Final Fantasy 6 is the game like it would not have had that same impact I
3300700	3307620	think it would have been like oh shit cool Final Fantasy character but like like Final Fantasy 7
3307620	3313660	or hate Final Fantasy 7 cloud is a fucking identifiable character that you just you know
3313660	3320100	him it is a little weird when you consider that you know that game actually was quite significant
3320100	3327660	in a non Nintendo kind of way but but all that aside you know what whatever Solid Snake ended up
3327660	3333740	being in a Smash Brothers game and you know I kind of associate that series more with Sony yes I'm
3333740	3339100	well aware of the GameCube game but come on that started as a Sony game here's where this gets
3339100	3342740	interesting though so you all I'm sure many of you listening to this show already knew about all
3342740	3349460	this Nintendo Direct stuff but here's where I kind of wanted to go with it is isn't it interesting
3349460	3356460	how much focus there was on Square Enix products in this Nintendo Direct think about it what are
3356460	3363180	the third party got that same type of frontage in this Nintendo Direct than Square Enix did well
3363180	3368060	the reason why I think is because a lot of times they do publishing for them like I think one of
3368060	3374780	the Dragon Quest games that came out recently was published by Nintendo instead of Square Enix for
3374780	3380700	when they brought it over here mm-hmm or like I know I there's some Square Enix games that were
3380700	3386780	published by Nintendo I know that but just saying there's the Final Fantasy explorers was in there
3386780	3391980	there was the Dragon Quest 7 and 8 was in there and now we have cloud and Smash Brothers which
3391980	3395900	is a pretty big deal that was a lot of Square maybe they're just not getting a lot of support
3395900	3400980	from other third parties well it's funny you mentioned that now does anyone else remember a
3400980	3406580	couple months ago on the show there was a rumor and it was one of those you know Tim Foil have
3406580	3412140	things there was a rumor that there is a third party party publisher that is getting in bed with
3412140	3420700	Nintendo for NX in a big way that some third-party publisher is stepping up and will be providing a
3420700	3427300	huge chunk of content for the NX and I even remember at the time somebody had called out
3427300	3432860	the Square Enix was a likely candidate and now after watching this direct I'm like okay Square
3432860	3438460	Enix and Nintendo they fucking or something's going on here's why I would think that that would
3438460	3443060	be a good candidate because look it's out of all of these like third major third-party companies
3443060	3450020	that do publish on consoles which of them are really heavy in the mobile market you've got EA
3450060	3454740	which doesn't give a shit about Nintendo right now and you've got Square Enix even though they
3454740	3459460	were ironically trumpeted when the Wii U was released and let's not forget that the EA got
3459460	3467500	up on stage it was like we're gonna back the Wii U in a big way for 60 days yeah so but Square Enix
3467500	3472260	you know they're pretty have they have a pretty large mobile presence and this new platform is
3472260	3477380	kind of I don't know I think a lot of people are thinking mobile with that so maybe that's why
3477380	3481620	they're kind of jumping in on board of that because it's something that they're doing already
3481620	3491060	Tiger Claw in chat asking what if the Final Fantasy 7 remake comes out on the NX well that
3491060	3499460	would be awesome in 2018 or 2019 where the fuck that comes out yeah I mean did now I have to kind
3499460	3505180	of go back in time to the e3 press conference this year but did did Square announce that as
3505220	3512500	an exclusive for Sony cuz I'm not sure I mean and a lot of the square stuff that comes out
3512500	3521020	on PlayStation 4 like I don't know Final Fantasy 13 games or like Dragon Quest Heroes or or Final
3521020	3528660	Fantasy type 0 and Final Fantasy 15 they're on both Xbox one and PlayStation coming out
3528660	3535740	after they announce Gordon Freeman as the next character for smash hmm why are in chat says none
3535740	3540100	of the square stuff announced in that presentation was exclusive at all and as the show under Matt
3540100	3547420	says I think they said you can play it first on PlayStation hmm who knows so game grew in chat
3547420	3551060	with another perspective on cloud and smash saying the whole thing about cloud strife is
3551060	3556660	that he is the protagonist of the best-selling JRPG ever that isn't Pokemon cloud is a pretty
3556660	3561820	iconic well-known character and I I definitely agree with game guru I mean we can talk all the
3561820	3566180	day about like Solid Snake last time I mean you know it wasn't really on Nintendo platform is
3566180	3572260	yeah old NES games at least there is some sort of tie and it's it's just more the fact that you
3572260	3578380	know if they had said it was going to be you know lock or I don't know see solar Rosa from
3578380	3583740	Final Fantasy 4 it would not I mean it would still been like a oh hey Wow cool type of mode
3583740	3587740	yeah I would have been like oh wow neat type of thing but I don't think it's gonna have nearly
3587740	3594660	that impact that cloud has it would have been interesting if it was a character like lightning
3594660	3599260	or something but I think maybe that's a little too new and so I think cloud is kind of that
3599260	3605820	perfect blend of like classic character but yeah it's it's interesting because you know cloud was
3605820	3611660	not really on a Nintendo console although of course in chat over at live dot vognet or dot
3611660	3616140	com why we are pointing out cloud has been on a Nintendo console before theater rhythm
3616140	3623620	that doesn't really count and are they gonna announce gex coming next is that gonna be the
3623620	3628660	next who know crash bandicoot will be the next anything's possible you know what though man
3628660	3633380	somebody made a great there was some some meme floating around out there I mean think about it
3633380	3644100	like somebody has made a game where you can have Mario link Pikachu mega man pac-man Sonic were you
3644100	3653580	and cloud all doing battle against each other like that this is like a huge game in gaming history
3653580	3659060	the fact that they're able to bring these different franchises into it is really nothing short of
3659060	3664060	amazing but also speaks you know really highly of Nintendo's ability to create a fighting game that
3664060	3669740	people really love one other thing I have to say that hasn't been said yet about the whole fact
3669740	3676700	that cloud is now gonna be in Smash Brothers so how about that cloud amiibo when's that coming
3676700	3682900	out cuz that's gonna be a thing right it's got to be it's got to be part of the agreement Ryu ones
3682900	3689300	coming out why not a cloud one so I'll be a show that amiibo or maybe I'm just thinking of two
3689300	3694700	different costs you probably saw like a fan wank thing but now it's gonna be a real deal there were
3694700	3699820	two different costumes but it's you know in in Smash each character has what six or seven
3699820	3704060	different outfits anyway so yeah but yeah they had cloud in the regular garb in the Final Fantasy
3704060	3709260	Advent Children garb for sure and who knows what other looks they'll have for cloud in the game
3709300	3715660	probably give us some different skins and so forth so why why are in chat says pre-order now up sorry
3715660	3722740	all gone Bobby Black Wolf saying cloud amiibo is a PAX exclusive better not I'd be so upset
3722740	3727820	all right I don't think there'll be a I don't think they'll be that crazy to make it exclusive
3727820	3735100	to evil gene exclusive ah yeah that that is the level of crazy that could definitely happen so
3735100	3739820	anyway very busy week for Nintendo and that direct and a lot of news this week to keep
3739820	3748500	Nintendo fans going into next year dark Sakura well and I like how the news is delivered on
3748500	3758860	this one get that phthalo blue ready Bob Ross you know we had the whole Bob Ross marathon on
3758860	3766500	twitch well looks like we're gonna have regular episodes of the joy of painting yay there is
3766500	3772660	going to be a Bob Ross channel every week twitch is going to show an entire season of the joy of
3772660	3781820	painting on the Bob Ross channel and that's starting on I don't see the actual start it
3781820	3786500	already started okay it's on Mondays it was like last Monday the marathon is also gonna happen
3786540	3791420	again every October 29th oh where they're gonna show everything back to back to back yeah nice
3791420	3797180	so so you can beat the devil out of that brush along with Bob Ross for years to come no no he
3797180	3800980	doesn't be he just makes gentle stroke no he actually says I'm a beat the devil out of that
3800980	3805100	brush just beat the devil out of that brush when he hits it on his on the stand yeah that's one
3805100	3811940	thing but that's when everybody in chat goes devil equals wrecked I'm sorry but have some happy
3811940	3816380	little clouds and leave it at that look I probably had a lot of happy little clouds I
3816380	3821180	talked about this two weeks ago on the show and I you know continued to watch the Bob Ross marathon
3821180	3825340	quite a bit until its conclusion and I would probably talked about this more last week if
3825340	3830900	we'd had a show but that Bob Ross is my favorite thing to have ever happened on twitch like for
3830900	3834700	real it's it's almost one of my favorite things to have ever happened on the internet like the
3834700	3839260	chat room was actually it's like I can't believe I'm saying this about a twitch chat room was
3839260	3844460	actually a lot of fun to watch it's like your twitch plays Pokemon you know with all the crazy
3844460	3849220	shit coming out of that there was so much spam with a whole like up left down right that and all
3849220	3853420	this stuff but like the stuff that was going on with Bob Ross was really funny like you know
3853420	3858660	anytime he says you know oh let's go a little crazy with this painting then the chat room you
3858660	3863780	know oh shit he going crazy crazy mode activated done it and then like he'll he'll paint a tree
3863780	3868420	right in the middle of the painting and the whole chat room ruined ruined ruined ruined and then
3868660	3873580	he'll finally make it like he'll fit it into the painting and they'll go saved say clutch save
3873580	3880300	hype back about that ban him for cheating and also it's just holy our soccer's rolling her eyes so
3880300	3886300	hard over there it was really funny and like but I mean but in a respectful kind of funny we're
3886300	3891860	like we're laughing with him and not at him and there's a huge difference trust me and I just I
3891860	3897220	just think that I I really love how long is it gonna take me for the joke isn't funny anymore
3897220	3904900	I I don't know I think there's something about that particular series and just Bob Ross's
3904900	3910340	attitude and everything where I mean maybe there's only gonna be a hundred people watching the
3910340	3915940	marathon instead of like 60,000 or whatever was watching close it out but it's still probably
3915940	3920420	more people than are watching it on PBS at like Saturday at 3 in the morning or whenever they
3920420	3924540	air at these days yeah I wonder what they would do though if they had like a side-by-side stream
3924540	3934620	with William Alexander who is the Bob Ross's mentor oh the he's he did the magic of oil
3934620	3940660	painting and the art of Bill Alexander which was the precursor to the joy of painting and he was
3940660	3948140	this grumpy German man and he was so great to watch he was so hilarious well it's you know we
3948140	3952620	were talking at the beginning of the show Loki about how your kids are growing up on Minecraft
3952620	3958020	let's plays I think there were a ton of people like you know obviously I'm old enough to remember
3958020	3962180	Bob Ross when he was on TV early in the morning but I bet a lot of people that were watching the
3962180	3967820	marathon and having fun with it and everything were totally not aware of who he was in fact I
3967820	3972420	even seem to remember reading some blog posts about like people from the UK were watching it
3972420	3976860	you know they never had Bob Ross over there but they kind of got to see it and we're kind of like
3976860	3981820	you know this guy was pretty awesome and and got to you know see a lot through that so I just I
3981820	3988860	just think it wasn't I you know is it gonna work for every great PBS thing that's happened in the
3988860	3998540	past 20 years probably not mr. Rogers man that's gonna be crazy oh no there it is dungeon buster
3998540	4003940	and chat says Bob Ross beat the devil out of internet negativity mr. Rogers neighborhood was
4003980	4008420	gonna be fucking insane if they do that yeah but it has to how's that gonna I don't know it has to
4008420	4014700	tie into creative somehow we'll see so all right so dark soccer is sending me a YouTube that I guess
4014700	4019900	I'm gonna try to play here is it just right at the beginning of this yeah I think so was it not
4019900	4038980	Iron Chef is this somebody doing in my mind I remember this is Bob Ross's precursor and then
4038980	4045460	you when you actually looks newer the whole like little he died in 97 oh that's sad oh there you
4045460	4050860	go I thought someone was like making his voice up at first I know I throw my first product is
4050860	4055140	this one of those lame things or somebody does the voiceovers of the real is watching him as a
4055140	4063660	kid too sorry all right that's awesome anyway yeah I Bob Ross I'm glad that's gonna live on on
4063660	4067260	Mondays even if not as many people are watching it's still it's still out there for somebody to
4067260	4071820	enjoy for the first time so I love the message he gets out he puts out there to that he's just
4071820	4075940	like anybody can paint you can just you just go down to the store get this get yourself some
4075940	4082100	patella blue and anybody can paint I still feel like I can't paint but watching him like I feel
4082100	4086460	like I could if I wanted to so who knows all right let's move on with some more news back to some
4086460	4094060	other gaming stuff Loki so the Xbox ones doing pretty well they've seen a 81% growth over the
4094060	4100140	sales from last year and you know they said you know commenting on that the strength of the
4100180	4107740	greatest games lineup in Xbox history drove record Xbox live usage for October and made Xbox one the
4107740	4115500	best-selling console in the US with an 81% growth compared to October 2014 and you know I have to
4115500	4122900	agree they do have quite the lineup as far as first party tile goes Sony what the fuck I'm
4122900	4128620	coming out uncharted that's about it yeah they've got fucking halo forza you know all this shit
4128660	4134980	coming out so Microsoft have war Microsoft is definitely seeing the payoff from you know
4134980	4140140	investing in these exclusive games you know and now they've got halo 5 and rise the tomb Raider
4140140	4143820	and you know some of the other stuff they've had this year sunset overdrive or a replay I mean you
4143820	4147660	have to admit they do have a pretty impressive lineup of exclusives so I think this is finally
4147660	4153100	getting some people on board yeah maybe other people like me too who are finally completing
4153140	4158820	the trifecta at home by picking up an Xbox one and now they have every you know next-gen console
4158820	4163500	I know not everybody's crazy gamer like me but I bet there's some like me out there that are
4163500	4167780	finally you know using these exclusives as a reason to pick up the Xbox one after all this
4167780	4173020	time and of course rise of the tomb Raider you know temporary exclusive well yeah but still
4173020	4175940	exclusive enough and I'm hearing really good things about the game I haven't played it myself
4175940	4181060	yet I hope to get around to it soon but I'm hearing a lot of great things about it people
4181220	4189940	on my Twitter that are playing it seem to really enjoy it so there you go um let's move on with
4189940	4195620	some more stories this one is definitely a controversy for Nintendo you know they've got
4195620	4200580	a game coming out soon Xenoblade Chronicles X I'm definitely looking forward to this because
4200580	4205700	the last Xenoblade game was great and I'm sure it'll be a great JRPG on the Wii U however
4205940	4214260	controversy because the localization of the game here in the States for Xenoblade Chronicles X in
4214260	4224900	the character customization section the breast size customization slider has been removed they
4224900	4233580	just don't like tragedy you can no longer create gigantic boobies or you know if you're into the
4233580	4238940	itty-bitty titties you can you can't slide the slider all the way outside that to that side as
4238940	4244100	well no longer will you have customizable breasts my question is so where did they freeze the boobs
4244100	4252900	at do they all have the biggest level boobs that would be funny like why are you all upset we froze
4252900	4259060	it at the biggest level so fucking calm down bitches I don't know dark soccer are you upset
4259140	4264180	you cannot increase and decrease the size of the breasts on your characters in Xenoblade Chronicles
4264180	4273220	not upset by it but it's stupid yeah yeah hackers will find a way hackers gonna hack well I will
4273220	4278660	have my big breasts I will tell you this in Dragon Age Inquisition one of the mods out there for the
4279700	4285860	PC is a custom body shapes rather than just the cookie cutter that they put out so
4285940	4292900	anything's possible well the good news is the rest of the game appears to be largely unchanged
4292900	4298860	unchanged so that is this the one thing that they've changed something about a swimsuit as
4298860	4303660	well considering the age of the characters probably not such a bad change they made in
4303660	4307540	that case so which is weird because you know those types of swimsuits are sold to those
4307540	4312620	age of children even though we feel that's inappropriate but you know let's not represent
4312840	4317540	that in the game either all right let's move on before we get to some release dates dark
4317540	4326940	Sakura well I'm the creator of Eve online CCP games has raised 30 million dollars in investments
4326940	4337500	to create content for virtual reality games they've got the money set aside they're also
4337660	4343740	going to continue to develop and promote Eve Valkyrie which is going to launch for oculus
4343740	4351900	rift in 2016 and PlayStation VR for the first half of 2016 and gunjack that will be on Samsung's
4351900	4359540	Samsung's gear VR so it looks like they're really pushing it a quote here saying is that we believe
4359540	4365460	VR will revolutionize revolutionized not just video games with the wider technology and media
4365460	4375220	industry as a whole so cool I won't be doing any of it or else I'll throw up on everyone do you
4375220	4379060	think there might be a way that they can make this more accessible for somebody like you nope
4379060	4384820	no it's gonna be too much no matter what probably what if it was a lower frame rate or would that
4384820	4390060	doesn't matter I think it's actually worse if it's a lower frame rate have you heard my stories
4390060	4397580	of Goldeneye no I know I know what if it was still a third-person experience but it was just
4397580	4403860	that the glasses allowed you to look at it everywhere no they try and they normally try by
4403860	4407820	like having something that doesn't move like in the center of the screen so that you can kind of
4407820	4412900	focus on something yeah yeah if I have like like an overlay sensor or something like if you were
4412900	4419780	like the shot crosshair yeah like a not even just that because I mean I can have a crosshair in the
4419780	4425100	middle of I mean there was one in Goldeneye and I still got sick I need something bigger to focus
4425100	4432060	on but I don't know I think I would just be sick no matter what hmm do you think you'll try it just
4432060	4438660	see or I will if you have a bucket handy this sounds like something it needs to be on YouTube
4438660	4446260	the bucket challenge all right that's gonna be a little bit different than ALS all right let's
4446260	4451980	travel around the world and check out some release dates and games coming out on a shelf near you and

4610860	4614780	release new games that we know they don't give me they don't usually yeah they don't typically do
4614780	4618820	that the only one time that I've seen an exception for that was back when the original rock band came
4618820	4624740	out that was on like November 20th or something hmm all right well let's go over to Japan where
4624740	4630780	it's it's a busy week over there as well over in Japan we have on the PlayStation 4 this week at

4719260	4724900	has anything to do with you know the makers of the iPhone and the iWatch in fact this looks to
4724900	4733620	be based more often anime series so watch bad Apple Wars and lastly on the 3ds this week Mina

4813620	4824140	it if you have a galaxy note 5 galaxy s6 edge s6 and the s6 edge plus and I have an s6 so very
4824140	4833380	tempted to purchase that and I'll have to check it out all right one more story for you guys on
4833380	4842260	Dragon Quest Heroes Dragon Quest Heroes apparently was confirmed for the PC there was a message on
4842260	4847420	Steam that showed that Dragon Quest Heroes will be coming out on the PC so for whatever reason you
4847420	4852940	didn't pick this up on PlayStation 4 Xbox one it was when it was released recently you can pre
4852940	4858180	purchase the game if you want so but the interesting thing is I guess when this was
4858180	4863020	first spotted they tried to click on it and nothing was seen so maybe this ad went up early
4863020	4867540	I don't know just a quick warning huh you know as much as Dragon Quest Heroes is probably an
4867540	4875260	awesome game uh-huh Tecmo koi this really really really shitty PC ports yeah so just consider that
4875260	4879940	before you consider yourself warning that all right fair enough maybe maybe wait for somebody
4879940	4886700	else to buy it I mean watch you know total biscuit talk about some of the PC ports of that or I saw
4886700	4892380	like Jim Sterling talked about and he's a huge fan of like the you know dragon well the different
4892380	4899860	samurai warrior series or Dicey warriors and their PC ports are fucking terrible yeah all
4899860	4906060	right well we'll keep an eye on it then and we'll see to register participation for this week's
4906060	4912140	episode of orange under 80 with vog network.com use the passphrase smoke all right well let's get
4912140	4917420	to it we're gonna take a step back we're gonna go back to a time when you couldn't really go to
4917420	4922940	YouTube to express your opinions on games because it didn't exist you could maybe write a letter to
4922940	4929220	a magazine the classic game of the week the chance for us to step into dark soccer's gaming vault and
4929220	4934420	find a game that she thinks hey I wish I had this one you should check this out so dark soccer
4934460	4940300	picky one she doesn't actually have in the vault I wish I had it she did here is the classic game
4940300	4949260	of the week this game is Musha which in Japan was an as Musha a last full metal fighter Eleanor and
4949260	4957420	it came out in 1990 it was a vertical scrolling shooter that was done by compile for the Genesis
4957460	4964700	or Mega Drive as it was known and it was published by toa plan in Japan and by seismic in North
4964700	4973860	America it is one of the a left series of one of the games in the LS series so Dan's asking me
4973860	4985900	if I fed the cat no oh I just replied on my Apple watch so I didn't have to pull out my phone Musha
4985900	4992900	yes anyway so basically it's just an amazing little shooter I thought that the inch the
4992900	4999020	intros on it had some very interesting graphical things they did like from the reflection of the
4999020	5005980	bat of the scenery on the the pilots visor and everything it did some really neat stuff music
5005980	5015060	was pretty great to you anyway you play as one of the Mecca in the series and you go through and
5015060	5020660	obtain power powerups called P chips and you can make your Mecca change color and get sub weapons
5020660	5030740	and they can also act as a shield if it gets hit then you lose the weapon then you get the Mecca
5030740	5039060	gets damaged so your sub weapons will include an energy shield a beam weapon a beam cannon and
5039060	5045780	missiles so you can also get helper drones that have these customizable attack modes you can get
5045780	5052820	up to two during combat and when one is destroyed anyone appears if you've got any saved in reserve
5052820	5063140	so you can save up your drones there so anyway the game is actually considered one of the best
5063140	5070660	I'd say shooter games that came out during that era it has been re-released on virtual console and
5070660	5078100	the original copy if you can get the others put this way an unboxed North American copy of this
5078100	5089900	just the loose game easily can go past 200 plus on eBay so it is really really difficult to get
5089900	5098500	your hands on one if you've got it give it to me but I mean even after I just love your demand
5098500	5103860	there if you own this give it to me now we're looking at the game 25 years later is still
5103860	5110660	considered one of the top 10 classic shooters of all time and the best that compile has ever done
5110660	5116300	I think it does look pretty great and I'm even saying that the shooting segments of this keep in
5116300	5121700	mind compile also did the Guardian legend and the shooting aspects in this I think are far better
5121700	5127100	than the Guardian legend I will go on record saying that although the Guardian legend overall
5127100	5135300	still a game I would better play so it's also I'd say to me one of the the best mega drive games
5135300	5141940	that ever came out in the 90s so there you go that's all I can say about it all right there
5141940	5149420	it is your classic game of the week MUSHA even if someone wanted to send me a Japanese copy I
5149420	5154700	wouldn't say no that way even if somebody wanted to send me a dollar I wouldn't say no to that
5154700	5160740	God someone sent me a dollar before I didn't tell you that really well back when Loki made my intro
5160740	5166260	for pump up the volume mm-hmm it said like give her a dollar yeah someone sent me a dollar nice
5166260	5171180	so are you one of those people that takes your first dollar and frames it and put it on the wall
5171180	5177740	I don't know about a soda there you go you spent that dollar I spent it I was poor there it is your
5177740	5182620	classic game of the week we are gonna take a quick break but don't go anywhere we'll be right back
5182620	5187380	one thing about Muscha the reason why it's an acronym for the u.s. one is because it was called
5187380	5195020	metallic uniframe super hybrid armor okay oh that's that's what she stands for yes for the
5195020	5200220	u.s. right there it is all right we're gonna take a break when we come back with more of orange
5200220	5203820	lounge radio some rapid-fire news the frugal question of the week we got some emails to catch
5203820	5210140	up on that's for sure and we will also take your calls at 1 8 7 7 game olr or username on skype
5210140	5221940	orange lounge radio when we come back after this with more of orange lounge radio welcome back
5221940	5229980	everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight with episode number 621 November the 15th of 2015
5230260	5235660	after an unexpected week off last week due to a sickness sorry about that if you're just joining
5235660	5240060	us live at the voice of East Network a vog network.com we recapped a little bit of what
5240060	5243940	did go on in the world of gaming last week and talked about some of the big news from this week
5243940	5250660	like the you know the OMG cloud is going to be in Smash Brothers and all that stuff we were talking
5250660	5257380	about there so we're gonna get into some rapid-fire news now I think is a good time so we'll start off
5257380	5264460	with Loki all right so let's talk a little bit about roller coaster tycoon now not necessarily
5264460	5270500	a game I'm too excited about but it looks pretty cool and unfortunately you're gonna have to wait
5270500	5274180	a little bit longer to get it because like most games that are coming out or we're supposed to
5274180	5282540	come out this year it has been pushed out of 2015 to 2016 and no actual date has been given yet but
5282540	5290260	we expect it next year because it ain't coming out this year mech warrior online is going to be
5290260	5297980	coming to steam starting December and this is the next project that they were working on after the
5297980	5307740	shadowrun game and you can expect this on December 10th so that looks pretty awesome I am a huge mech
5307740	5314140	warrior fan or at least I used to be so kind of want to check that out finally I'm not surprised
5314140	5320860	at the least about this but dead or live extreme 3 is getting a collector's edition and what would
5320860	5328340	be most apt for that game but of course booby mouse pads and that's what you can expect when
5328340	5333460	you get the dead or live extreme 3 fortune collector's edition for PlayStation 4 it's
5333460	5338580	gonna come with playing cards featuring the characters in there a sexy photo book
5338580	5348740	and 3d mouse pad featuring Mary Rose but what Alan yelled from the other room it's classier
5348740	5358140	than Kleenex and lotion much classier all right you're gonna get some booby mouse pads no I don't
5358180	5364180	even know if this game is coming out here yet so probably not I don't know if we can't get slider
5364180	5369180	bars in Xenoblade then maybe not I don't know and it's it's like you know yeah it's kind of cool to
5369180	5372940	see like boobs in video games but the game doesn't really have a lot of content to it I just don't
5372940	5378620	feel like playing like beach volleyball and yeah you don't enjoy the Barbie modes no not really
5378620	5384740	all right well moving on to something a little more serious but still a lot of tongue-in-cheek
5384900	5389540	fun because it's about one of the worst video games ever made the desert bus for
5389540	5401900	hope campaign is underway desert bus 9 just started oh yeah so is are they involved because
5401900	5406460	I know they've dropped in pretty much every year at some point made a cameo yeah that's
5406460	5412460	fun so cuz you know the game the desert bus the game itself is not desert bus there was like a
5412500	5418900	Penn and Teller like collection that's it smoke and mirrors that was gonna come out and actually
5418900	5425260	never did so technically this game actually didn't come out something like that or like commentary on
5425260	5430860	the censorship because remember how that was like huge in the late 90s yeah so anyway it's it's
5430860	5437260	interesting that you know this group desert bus for hope has turned this game into a you know
5437260	5443180	yearly this annual event where they raise quite a bit of money for child's play last year 2.4
5443180	5448820	million oh no I'm sorry cumulatively over the years 2.4 million that's still no small chunk
5448820	5454300	of change and last year they went for a hundred and fifty eight hours that's darn near a full
5454300	5459540	week probably will top it this year I imagine so we'll see and then if you think it next year will
5459540	5467100	be ten years of this game that's great for charity though so there it is desert bus 9 underway so you
5467100	5473460	can check that out I think it's think it's desert bus org is the website do you know the website
5473460	5479460	offhand our soccer you're looking at this it is desert bus org there it is you look at the space
5479460	5486940	jam website like the movie it still exists is your mic on dark soccer I think we haven't been
5486940	5493940	hearing you there you go oh my god okay nobody in chat said anything about that whatever right now
5493940	5500140	the space jam website still exists I was I have never seen that movie all the way through and I
5500140	5506180	don't even know I was reading about it but it was hmm I'm sorry I got completely distracted
5506180	5511820	by space jam that's fine was there any reason to shut it down who knows right mm-hmm guys you know
5511820	5516940	says I thought she was in the kitchen no Alan is in the kitchen not dark soccer dark soccer's at
5516940	5525220	a computer all right anyhow let's talk about moogles moogles in Final Fantasy 15 I mean duh
5525220	5530620	of course moogles are going to be in Final Fantasy 15 but I guess a Twitter poll went out where
5530620	5536460	people were asked do you want to see Final Fantasy 15 have moogles in the game and of course yes
5536460	5543620	overweight no and according to the game's director it'll be a fun little incorporation and it won't
5543700	5547700	be very chatty or anything so it sounds like it's gonna be more of a reference than a full-on like
5547700	5552300	it'll be a fun incorporation they run across the street as your car hits them like a raccoon and
5552300	5558940	they just fly off the windshield oh that's sad Kupo don't say that all right let's see let's
5558940	5565020	talk about that game Yuka Lele I don't know how many of you guys kick-started that game but you
5565020	5571540	can look forward to a new retro inspired character that has been added to the game rextro 64 us
5571540	5579340	okay is a pretty great name rextro 64 us is a new character that's set to appear in the game
5579340	5586180	it was designed by Mark Stevenson and is resembles what you would see in most 90s 3d platformers a
5586180	5592220	very blocky polygonal scan lined body there he is the guardian of the arcade machines that are
5592220	5597180	hidden in the level each world has at least one arcade machine and if you complete the retro
5597180	5604100	challenge you get another pagey so there you go retro rextro I keep want to say retro 64 us
5604100	5614940	it's rextro 64 us a new character in Yuka Lele dark Sakura well um Metal Gear online is getting
5614940	5624860	what I would say has should have always existed in every game ever cat hats oh my god that pictures
5624860	5634020	hilarious yeah they are getting cats on their heads like what we used to get on the private
5634020	5644460	servers for Ragnarok online it's pretty funny also mother 3 is gonna be coming out on Wii U
5644460	5653060	Virtual Console but only in Japan which sucks because I really want to play it and then maybe
5653100	5660300	they'll release it here when they release the Lucas amiibo maybe we can dream and now this is
5660300	5671260	something that I think is pretty scary here in the US is that basically the best spy we have the
5671260	5682740	best I'd say entity infringing on privacy is the US government they were supposed to have disband
5683460	5692500	replaced their surveillance program and did not and so this is now getting a lot of international
5692500	5701540	ire and what this means at least as far as gaming goes is that they also pull up personal data
5701540	5711300	internet transmission sometimes that even applies to your games so just saying all your sexting
5711300	5716540	that you do in the World of Warcraft I can see it listening to you call other people bitches
5716540	5723980	well yes somebody needs to hold Sam's looking at your dick pics okay keep it in your pants
5723980	5739980	all right let's get to the frugal question of the week you should be our friend if you're not
5739980	5744340	our friend why aren't you our friend you've been listening to this show for almost two hours now
5744340	5749420	and you're still not our friend I don't understand so you can officially be our friend over on
5749420	5756340	Facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio is where you can be our friend what Facebook not
5756340	5761300	good enough for you are you more of a Google person that's fine we're on Google Plus as well
5761300	5767220	google.com slash plus orange lounge radio and every week we ask a question of our Facebook
5767220	5773340	and Google Plus communities when you slam those words together you get boogal well this week we
5773340	5780540	asked about the topic announced that cloud for Final Fantasy 7 this week would be joining the
5780540	5785820	roster for Super Smash Brothers only you and 3ds and of course this leads to discussion that this
5785820	5791660	character was an interesting choice because Final Fantasy 7 of course is the first Final Fantasy
5791660	5797380	game to not release on a Nintendo console that being said do you think cloud was the best
5797380	5802900	character to represent the Final Fantasy series if yes why if no what character do you think would
5802900	5808220	have been a better selection represented the gamers everywhere so let's start with Andy are
5808220	5812660	who replied over on Facebook say in terms of representing Final Fantasy it was probably a
5812660	5818860	good choice but in terms of celebrating all things Nintendo it's a very poor choice I feel like Smash
5818860	5824300	is more about celebrating Nintendo so that should override representing Final Fantasy Square
5824300	5828900	Nintendo should have gone with something more associated with Nintendo someone from a Final
5828900	5834380	Fantasy that was on Nintendo system or another of their games dark Tetsuya says I would have
5834380	5839260	definitely nominated somebody from Final Fantasy 6 even though the only 3d models of them I can
5839260	5845060	think of were from that old n64 demo from years ago lock Celeste or Tara would have been my
5845060	5851780	choices degenerate Johnny says personally I would have thought that a moogle or black mage you know
5851780	5856060	something a little more generic would have been more fitting for a Nintendo game also because
5856060	5860300	there were final fancy characters featured on Nintendo consoles however Nintendo is known to
5860300	5864900	utilize non Nintendo characters and Smash Brothers from game series they used to be on their consoles
5864900	5870740	for example solid snake instead of big boss so why why not use cloud as far as mainstream is
5870740	5877780	concerned he's the face of Final Fantasy I also thought of the moogle thing where why didn't they
5877780	5883300	just maybe use something like super generic like that from the series or a chocobo or something
5883300	5889220	then you know I do get the cloud thing but I am surprised they didn't just use a moogle
5889220	5895300	entertainment over on Google Plus says cloud is the most recognizable character from the
5895300	5900580	Final Fantasy series and his giant Buster sword would be an interesting thing to wield in any
5900580	5905980	fighting game however part of me wants to see more female characters and all of the things so
5905980	5912220	I would have included either Yuna from Final Fantasy 10 Tifa from Final Fantasy 7 or Fran from
5912220	5919020	Final Fantasy 12 yes to Fran for sure but and technically I was the Final Fantasy 12 game on
5919020	5923980	the 3ds well I guess that's true that's a good that's a good reason to have Fran in the game
5923980	5929340	and I love Fran but you know the thing about Fran is that whenever I think of Fran I think of
5929340	5934180	both the air and Fran and that goes I can't think about the air without thinking of Fran as well
5934180	5940580	like they're just they're just a wonderful twosome from that series so yeah I just I couldn't have
5940580	5947140	one without the other maybe could be like ice climbers where you would control both so there
5947140	5952660	you go Kai's you know in our chat room over at live.vog network.com agrees with Tifa I want Tifa
5952660	5958580	she'd kick ass and also I agree with the female characters well that begs the question where's
5958620	5963300	Linkle cuz can I go back and change my vote cuz I want Linkle and Smash Brothers now at this point
5963300	5967700	I think it's just a matter of time it's just a matter of time maybe I don't supposedly this is
5967700	5972020	it the December thing we're gonna hear about this is it that's it for Smash Brothers done no more
5972020	5978260	they're gonna move on to something else Smash Brothers for the NX probably after this we'll
5978260	5983100	see but I can't imagine that that won't be a thing so all right there it is thank you guys for
5983100	5989220	answering the food goal question of the week appreciate that we'll ask another question next
5989220	5993140	Sunday that usually goes up during the day at some point in the afternoon or the morning whenever I
5993140	6000100	begin working on the show all right let's get back into some other news Loki all right so there was
6000100	6005900	apparently a game that was gonna be made for Jurassic World and I'm talking aside from the
6005900	6013060	Lego game that they had it was being worked on by a cryptic studios Seattle location but it was
6013060	6019780	shut down unfortunately by the owner perfect world and now footage of that is coming out from demo
6019780	6026100	reels from some of the people that worked on the game and so now they have like some you know there
6026100	6032060	was some footage on YouTube which of course taken down already they had some images of like the t-rex
6032100	6038540	as well as a character that looks pretty similar to Christopher Pratt's character so I don't know I
6038540	6046700	not sure if I'd be that excited about that game I mean the movie's okay but I don't see them doing
6046700	6053420	like a huge game with that I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like a big online game or what the
6053420	6058540	case would be they said it was described as like an open-world game and that it was gonna be headed
6058540	6068500	to PC and current gen consoles and it was a triple-a MMOG so too bad when that in that movie ended up
6068500	6074380	being so freakin huge it's like one of the biggest movies they've ever put out and could have had
6074380	6078580	this huge game behind it but I guess they had the Lego game so that's something you know a game what
6078580	6084180	I don't think was that great but and now that well don't and then they also have some of the
6084180	6089420	characters in Lego dimensions yes that'd be cool yeah there is that so I don't think there's a
6089420	6096180	whole world or anything like that though so some clarity on Nintendo's smartphone games some folks
6096180	6100140	wondering how much is it gonna cost to play Nintendo's new smartphone games and guess what
6100140	6108380	in a financial dealing with DNA this week it has been mentioned that they will be free at least to
6108380	6114860	start but you can you can guarantee that there will be plenty of transactions within the game to
6114860	6121020	help get your money there that was confirmed in an earnings briefing that was attended by the Wall
6121020	6128220	Street Journal the CEO of DNA Isao Moriasu said games currently in the pipeline are all free to
6128220	6134700	play there are five smartphone games being planned to launch before 2017 and we talked in a prior
6134700	6140380	week about me Tomo which was revealed previously that was supposed to be this year but it's been
6140380	6147660	delayed to March 2016 remember not included in this is Pokemon go and I know a lot of people
6147660	6152740	looking forward to that but that is a Nintendo adjacent thing but technically the Pokemon company
6152740	6158380	is a separate company they are working with Niantic which Ingress which looking I've talked
6158380	6163940	a lot about they're already involved with remember that is all separate from this so Pokemon go does
6163940	6170100	not count as one of the five so anyway in that original briefing though Nintendo said other
6170100	6175900	games might be paid a download but it seems like DNA clarifying that that is not the case at least
6175900	6183540	for whatever is planned right now so there you go certainly no new information on what those other
6183540	6189380	games could possibly be at this point but we'll see I'm very curious to see if there's a you know
6189380	6195780	Zelda esque type of game or Mario if they go full throttle on that or if they kind of stay with
6195780	6201500	things that are more on the outside more like the advance wars the Pikmin you know things that are
6201500	6205500	like they're definitely Nintendo properties but they're kind of on the outside maybe a splatoon
6205500	6211300	finger paint wouldn't that be funny you can you can finger paint on your touch touch screen or
6211300	6216020	something who knows I guess anything's possible we won't know until next year for sure Dark
6216020	6228220	Saga well as I had mentioned two weeks ago we had the South by Southwest overcoming harassment
6228220	6236540	and games discussion this has actually been expanded it was it had been canceled before
6236540	6241420	because of online threats and they decided to bring it back because it needs to be done so
6241420	6248420	they've added nine additional speakers now which include Susan Benesch of the dangerous speech
6248420	6258220	product Alan Barr David the founder of red button Michelle Dennedy the vice president chief privacy
6258220	6265260	officer at Cisco so they've got some big names on here but also save point that had been canceled
6265260	6271900	before say point a discussion on the gaming community will take place Tuesday May 15th so
6271900	6278860	if you go to SX SW comm you can see where the changes are and what's been expanded and I think
6278860	6285100	it's great and I hope they don't buckle this time and you know let the assholes online think that
6285100	6290260	you know you can threaten people and get away with it I get that there's been a lot of vitriol
6290260	6296460	and hateful crap on Twitter and and on certain dark places of the internet and reddit and all
6296460	6301020	that stuff and you know all that crap aside which I don't really want to touch with a ten-foot pole
6301020	6307180	at this point I'm curious about is this forum when we talk about online harassment and game
6307180	6312620	harassment is this going to address it all like what sometimes people put up with in multiplayer
6312620	6319500	spaces like what we see on you know Xbox Live playing Halo where the you know or Call of Duty
6319500	6326100	where the n-word and you know and things we see in the MMOs that's really ugly like are we gonna
6326100	6332620	be talking about that as well like I just I feel like there's a lot of touch points besides that
6332620	6337980	other bit of ugliness that has happened online in the past year you know what I mean I hope so
6338020	6343540	yeah I mean I think it should be addressed I feel like those are some of the roots wherein
6343540	6347500	the other stuff all comes from I don't know like when we talk about online harassment I just hope
6347500	6354220	we we talk about what happens on a small scale as well as what happens on the you know large very
6354220	6361780	vocal scale so anyway all right let's move on something else Loki all right so we're right
6361780	6367020	around the corner from December which means the next game awards are gonna be happening and of
6367060	6373700	course got some details on that let's see it's supposed to be taking place once again I guess
6373700	6378740	that the Microsoft theater in Los Angeles on December 3rd and with that they're gonna have
6378740	6389380	an advisory board of industry experts and this year they're gonna be including let's see Reggie
6389500	6400980	fisa Mae he's a Gilmont from Ubisoft Hideo Kojima and Kojima productions they put the word Konami
6400980	6408740	next to Kojima just curious Nintendo's gonna be coming back as well this year and they may be
6408740	6415380	announcing new titles no words but they you know like last year they had like a lot of game
6415380	6419420	announcements and trailers and stuff so hopefully we'll see something come out of that as well also
6419420	6424660	have a list of the nominees for this wait will they honor Roberta Williams again and Ken Williams
6424660	6431180	to be fair will they honor them again I don't know cuz they they should game of the year your
6431180	6439380	nominees are blood-borne fallout for Metal Gear Solid 5 the phantom pain Super Mario maker and
6439380	6446180	the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt I think all pretty good choices there let's see very obvious choices for
6446180	6451180	game of the year I mean to be honest like if I hadn't even looked at that story or read that
6451180	6456700	story I probably could have guessed at least four of those five that would've been on the list some
6456700	6463380	of the let's see developers of the year Bethesda CD Projekt Red from software Kojima productions
6463380	6467140	and Nintendo pretty much all the same companies that make those games that are in the top there
6467140	6474260	gee yeah I like how congeum productions is on there what game do they make this year I don't
6474260	6478660	believe they were on you know well that's right they were removed from yeah that I gave me the
6478660	6482700	year title huh that's unfortunate anything you know all the same normal categories that they
6482700	6489580	have there also of course they've got some like this best fan creation as well so one of the
6489580	6496860	nominees on that GTA 5 targets which is kind of like a cinematic movie made with the game engine
6497180	6502940	real GTA from corridor digital portal stories Mel which I thought was pretty awesome that was
6502940	6510480	that kind of standalone game that was free if you have portal or any source engine game super
6510480	6515540	mario maker the e-reader levels so those you know levels that were made by that one fan there and
6515540	6521220	then twitch plays Dark Souls it's kind of an interesting little side category yeah about Bob
6521220	6529020	Ross twitch Bob Ross which is not on there unfortunately let's see if you don't acknowledge
6529020	6535180	the Bob Ross twitch thing you failed this year you failed all of us make it happen and then of
6535180	6541100	course best perform the devil out of these awards which this is weird because I didn't I wasn't I
6541100	6546580	didn't remember that Mark Hamill was playing this character at this time but they had best
6546580	6553020	performances Ashley birch as Chloe price and life is strange Camilla Ludington as Laura Croft and
6553020	6560220	rise of the Tomb Raider Doug cockle as Gerald from Witcher 3 Mark Hamill as the Joker I thought
6560220	6566540	Mark Hamill wasn't doing the Joker anymore I thought it was Troy Baker now doing I thought
6566540	6576420	to in back Batman Arkham Knight and then Viva Seifert in her story going to our chat room over
6577260	6582780	at live.vognetwork.com Rama says back the fuck up fallout 4 just came out yes we keep in mind with
6582780	6588820	the press and all this stuff they've had the game for weeks doing the reviews and evaluations in
6588820	6593060	advance in fact there was a lot of talk about the embargo because I seem to remember there was an
6593060	6596780	embargo about the embargo that was something that happened last week when we weren't here but
6596780	6604500	basically it Bethesda came out and said you can tell people on this day that your embargo will
6604500	6608780	be up on this day it was something really ridiculous and of course you know a bunch of
6608780	6613220	eight if a screenshot showed up on Twitter and it was kind of one of those you know thing we all
6613220	6620260	pointed and laughed at but anybody that's you know voting or whatever the advisory board in these
6620260	6625940	award shows they've been playing fallout 4 for at least a few weeks now but Splatoon has got quite
6625940	6635220	a few nominations they have best family game best shooter game best multiplayer game and I think
6635220	6640420	that's it SSG100 Matt clarifying the Joker thing I think he did the Joker in a couple of flashback
6640420	6644580	scenes I just thought it was Troy Baker from now on I thought he was done doing that maybe they
6644580	6649060	used some old footage or something who knows most anticipated game voices at conventions
6649060	6654980	though for fun all Sony to almost all Sony titles there that's kind of funny so most anticipated
6654980	6661100	game horizon move three Final Fantasy 7 remade no it's a horizon zero dawn no man's sky quantum
6661100	6666980	break last guardian uncharted for all of but one Sony titles those are all like so that's a little
6666980	6672020	for quantum break ridiculous no Zelda no Zelda game I'm yeah surprising Zelda's not on there a
6672020	6680300	little bit no Final Fantasy 15 nothing nothing all right well I mean I don't know I'll check it out
6680300	6686940	it wasn't bad last year it was just some of it was just weird but I appreciated it more than like
6686940	6691380	some of the really awful pandering that happens with some of the televised award with all these
6691380	6698340	celebrities that have obviously never picked up a controller in their life so I liked the awards
6698340	6703340	last year wasn't that the show last year too or Trey Parker got up and said I beat Kevin Spacey
6703340	6707820	at something and like it was really yes yeah that was pretty awesome so I hope there's more moments
6707820	6711900	like that and again I want to know who they're honoring this year maybe somebody in chat knows
6711900	6715900	cuz I don't know if it was in that story who are they honoring this year is that Roberto Williams
6715900	6724060	and Ken Williams it's pretty probably a miyamoto I'm guessing or Iwata what I mean yeah but I don't
6724060	6729260	know I don't know if they would do somebody that's already passed I mean I can't imagine they'll get
6729260	6733780	through the night without saying something about Iwata but will he be that tribute that lifetime
6733780	6739820	achievement award maybe not I think they might get Jima Kojima that would be kind of interesting
6739820	6745860	with this year and everything I'm all for the classic PC developers though as well you know I
6745860	6752020	love my Michael maybe an Atari 2600 maybe like a David Crane or uh I don't know Howard Scott
6752020	6756220	Warshaw or something that you know really influenced that old era of games we'll see
6756220	6766460	all right anyhow let's move on to talk on JJ Abrams he's a busy guy you know when he's not
6766460	6772220	rebooting Star Trek or or making a new Star Wars episodes contributing to some of the hugest nerd
6772220	6779660	franchises of all time for better for worse now he's moving on forget two games bad robot which
6779700	6787100	is his studio teaming up with infinity blade creator chair on spy jinx spy jinx will be a
6787100	6793420	game on PCs and phones in 2016 it's an espionage game there's not a lot being said about this maybe
6793420	6798420	this is a game that we might see at the awards who knows but they're saying it's gonna be action
6798420	6804420	role-playing strategy world-building so I guess maybe it kind of looks like Team Fortress 2 but
6804460	6811900	it's it's gonna be a lot more than that so there you go something that JJ Abrams is working on so
6811900	6819060	we'll see hopefully it will be better than the second Star Trek film was at least that's my
6819060	6828700	opinion anyway Kaijuto says oh shit espionage game I'm in oh no JJ maybe not let's see I love
6828700	6833540	this going back to the talk about who should we who should we recognize at the Game Awards
6833540	6839380	Akuma JP in our chat saying leave Kojima alone you're lucky he even performed for you bastards
6839380	6844300	leave him alone please we're seeing the honor and they always say we should honor this you know
6844300	6850900	spike Konami just like say oh yes he is the reason that this game is awesome fucking oh me that's
6850900	6856580	fair it's a good clarification all right let's get to you guys each week you guys email us at
6856580	6863420	our mailbag participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us emails and dark soccer's

6885860	6892100	to me memes and games just a week of lazy writing instead of writing something original or
6892100	6897420	interesting it's just cribbing on some popular quote joke and quote oh god it took me a minute
6897420	6902540	to realize that this was even about it the meme thing and get real return guacamelee and stuff
6902540	6907860	that has the memes okay yeah yeah I think about cases when stand-up comedian gets cost caught
6907860	6912900	taking content from other comedians they usually get dumped on for being unoriginal and often end
6912900	6917860	up having trouble landing gigs I feel like this is a similar situation where one half of the
6917860	6922060	internet finds it okay because they're laughing more the novelty of recognizing the meme more
6922060	6929220	than anything else honestly that's what I like about them to exacerbate things even more double
6929220	6934420	anyway most of the means that make it into a game are already done to death anyway I might laugh at
6934420	6939180	something once or twice and then again if someone twisted in some novel way but by the time a game
6939180	6945620	in development comes out the means are at least a few months old assuming the game is even taking
6945620	6951820	something more modern and not an over 9000 reference from 2006 so yeah I'm generally
6951820	6957460	against games leaning on memes too much they won't stop me playing an otherwise amazing game guacamelee
6957460	6963260	comes to mind because that game is exceptional and I loved it in spite of the memes I just wish
6963260	6969260	game devs would think a little harder and come up with something original thanks Andy are I don't
6969260	6973820	know I mean I I respect your opinion I think you're being a little harsh I don't think there's
6973820	6980180	anything wrong with like a little reference a wink and a nod is all it is if the game's entire plot
6980180	6987100	is based around a meme or like a whole quest that's you know games based around memes wasn't
6987100	6993020	that script scribble knots hi you know what's interesting about the scribble knots thing though
6993020	6999660	is that the memes became a meme about that game you know that the memes weren't the game but the
6999660	7005940	memes memeify the gate is very meta it's very meta scribble knots is a very meta example but
7005940	7010220	like you know when it's a wink and a nod a very tongue-in-cheek thing I don't think it's I really
7010220	7014180	don't think it's a big deal and I get a chuckle out of it and it's it's interesting because I had
7014180	7019140	the same reaction you had Jamie where the emailer called out the whole like some people get it and
7019140	7024500	some people don't and it's it's not cool people think it's funny because of the novelty of finding
7024500	7030020	it yeah and I'm kind of like yeah I kind of like that I I mean I'm not gonna sit there and be like
7030020	7034900	haha I think I got it and you did it I liked how they did it in World of Warcraft with the characters
7034900	7040860	that you would see like my favorite was and or a Moorhead yeah who was based off of the name from
7040860	7047060	Agnes Moorhead who was in Dora in bewitched yeah and I like that they would throw in just kind of
7047060	7054940	obscure Harrison Jones same thing right or how you would find Harris Pilton and then you'd find her
7054940	7062340	little invisible friend if you had that visibility spell that shit was funny I know see that that was
7062340	7071620	funny and then in in Final Fantasy 14 the quest to fight Titan extreme is called quake me up before
7071620	7077700	you or a Magomo or something like that and it's really funny but like you know I don't know it I
7077700	7083660	but I think there's also the point I want to make with the part that he thought was not okay that
7083660	7090100	you and I are like it's not so bad I think there's a lot of stuff out there that is like humor have
7090100	7096380	you ever seen like movies that are for kids that have a lot of very adult jokes in them well yeah
7096380	7101220	actually let's take that back a little bit Rocky and Bull Eagle okay sure I'll just say
7101220	7106780	Animaniacs but sure Animaniacs I mean it's it's that same type of thing you know I mean if you were
7106780	7112660	paying attention to the politics you know when Rocky and Bull Eagle was on TV yeah the antics
7112660	7119060	were were geared toward kids but so many so much of the content and commentary is pure satire aimed
7119060	7126340	at adults or you know like you're saying with Animaniacs like when she pulls out Prince's as
7126340	7131460	goodnight kids you know that type of thing you know that joke yeah yeah yeah no it's like like
7131460	7137860	you need to get fingerprints and she comes out with Prince and goodnight kids now to be fair to
7137860	7142340	the email or to be fair dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vog network.com says reminds me of that
7142340	7147700	Wii U eShop game meme run I think it got taken down but yeah that was definitely a one-note
7147700	7153900	joke that got old in five seconds and yeah I agree when like the entire joke is the meme okay
7153900	7161660	it gets old it's stupid it's not funny you're beating a dead horse it's not clever and I think
7161660	7166060	that's a clear difference when it's like that you're using the meme for the sake of using the
7166060	7173540	meme it's not clever but when like you kind of maybe twist what would be in the game anyway to
7173540	7177100	sort of reflect a pop culture thing like the Harris Pilton thing in her invisible friend I
7177100	7181940	think is a great example that that's a little more like tongue-in-cheek and I think that's
7181940	7187540	where it's at its best yeah so anyway but thanks for the email even if we disagree a little bit on
7187540	7192980	that yeah the run my episodes used to kind of do something like that where they're in the US
7192980	7201480	anyway there are episode names were the names of like movies or books only done with Ron my
7201480	7205860	character names or something more having to do with the thing yeah and you know to be fair I
7206060	7210220	wonder if and to be fair to the email or two I bet I because I wonder if they're sitting there
7210220	7217020	going you guys are saying pop culture I'm saying memes and maybe to be fair there there is maybe a
7217020	7221220	difference between pop culture references and internet meme references and so maybe I should
7221220	7226660	call that out ties into the same thing though I I sort of think memes in a way are pop culture
7226660	7231460	it's internet culture but it's really just the whole thing has gone wrapped up into each other
7231460	7237820	so yeah I know remember his kids are growing up on minecraft let's place it's those two are coming
7237820	7241740	closer together Julian yeah closer anything I went over there to hang out with Becky and he
7241740	7247380	was watching minecraft things I'm like okay I quit playing minecraft like a year ago I'm in the
7247380	7252620	wrong business I should be doing minecraft let's plays but I should do it as crazy Rob Roberts no
7252620	7258540	I like your idea from earlier oh yeah before we were on air okay tangent time before we were on
7258540	7262420	air tonight and talking about this story I kind of I had this random thought I was like are there
7262420	7266980	any drag queens that do let's play videos like do they do they get out there and actually sit there
7266980	7270740	and do the let's plays in there in their drag persona because like I was thinking like like
7270740	7277900	a Dame Edna that plays video games hello my puppets or my pixels well you know we do know a drag
7277900	7284220	queen everybody knows a drag queen is several but we know gamer one apparently there is actually is
7284300	7291500	there there is oh there's you know I have seen and I wonder if this is it what God not not Coco
7291500	7299140	Montrese Coco Peru Coco Peru Coco Peru does the Grand Theft Auto but that's different because I
7299140	7305280	feel like her let's plays are like do you do you guys remember from Michael and I wish I had the
7305280	7309780	audio clip when I bring this up do you guys remember from like like five years ago when I
7309860	7318380	made my mom watch me play Mortal Kombat and she's like Rob oh that is gross what does she do Rob
7318380	7325080	that is that game is so gross that's kind of a Coco Peru does in those videos like what's going
7325080	7329940	on what did you just shoot her did you just shoot that innocent person that's there on this like
7329940	7334560	this is a way to get out some aggressions you know that's because Coco Peru's big thing is
7334560	7340360	tension tamer tea and I'm gonna need some tension tamer tea after watching that anyway so it's a
7340360	7345080	little different because with all due respect to Coco Peru I don't think she's really a gamer I
7345080	7350560	think that's more one of those somebody is having her watch those to react to them for the shock
7350560	7355640	value I think it's a different drag queens react to yeah it's like a drag queens react to type of
7355640	7363720	thing yeah if I'm wrong on that I apologize Coco Peru I'm a big fan all right hello LR
7363720	7370680	on last week's episode you mentioned the Xbox one Kinect price cut to $100 Rob asked a question why
7370680	7377400	do I need it I'm fairly passionate about my Xbox one which I bought on launch day with the Kinect
7377400	7382560	I use both on a daily basis I will answer your question with this you don't seriously you don't
7382560	7387760	need it if you just want to use your Xbox one as a gaming console and nothing more there's no need
7387760	7393000	for it as future support has all but disappeared that being said I can't imagine my life without
7393000	7398880	it anymore my cable box is connected to my Xbox one and it's become the center of my living room
7398880	7405040	the Xbox pause and Xbox play commands are worth the price of all by themselves the fast forward
7405040	7412120	and rewind commands get love too when when your hands are covered in chicken or pizza or who knows
7412120	7419280	what or even when they aren't not having to reach for a remote is awesome but I also use the voice
7419280	7424080	commands daily to switch channels launch games and jump between apps we can go to crunchyroll
7424080	7429080	and watch the next episode of an anime or jump to Netflix and start whatever all without touching
7429080	7435320	anything browsing the integrated game store is also super easy I always check out the weekly
7435320	7441820	sales using only my voice I will pause and say that that's actually why I waited to get why I'm
7441820	7446760	waiting to get my new Apple TV because of the Siri commands that do all the same stuff so it sounds
7446760	7450960	like if you're willing to have the Xbox one be that centerpiece of your living room that a lot
7450960	7455320	of other stuff kind of goes through then you got to get a lot more value out of it than say maybe
7455320	7461520	me who's switching between like four different things to really get everything I'm kind of getting
7461520	7467560	that but see my thing is that I play games on my systems and I don't do much else with them can I
7467560	7470400	take a quick tangent I'm sorry because I know you're not done with email but this is relevant
7470400	7475560	I promise so the new Xbox one dashboard came out this week as well along with the Xbox backwards
7475560	7481840	compatibility I'm not a fan I am I'm not really a fan and maybe it's because I'm not integrating
7481840	7487880	the way that Microsoft wants me to integrate but I have to be honest I'm just I'm really not liking
7487880	7494160	it like the Xbox dashboards have gotten worse and worse over the years like I missed when it was
7494160	7500680	just simple like when it's you know go left and right for the different menus and then up and down
7500760	7505440	for whatever which I understand is is kind of where this new dashboard is going so maybe but
7505440	7511520	but I just feel like there's a lot of stuff that's still really buried and like even to like redeem a
7511520	7516000	code on the store it took me forever to figure out where to freaking find that I don't know I
7516000	7522840	just not everybody's gonna agree with me there but I personally feel the new dashboard is really not
7522840	7528440	cutting it but at least I can play rock band and whatever game I need to play there are a few other
7528440	7534200	bonuses to the Skype experience is pretty great I've heard a lot of people praise the Xbox fitness
7534200	7539040	app and it's many available workouts though I admittedly haven't tried it yet Kinect is required
7539040	7543920	for it and of course there are a few games you can play on it but that's all gravy as far as I'm
7543920	7549880	concerned Kinect makes me feel like I'm in the 21st century I absolutely love using it and I enjoy my
7549880	7554080	Xbox one a lot more because of it do you need it absolutely not but I sure as hell love mine
7554080	7562040	Kinect is dead long live Kinect that's from YY are thank you for the perspective I appreciate the
7562040	7566280	honesty where it's like what you don't really need it but if you're gonna if you're gonna put
7566280	7570040	everything through your console then there's there's a lot more you can do so I appreciate
7570040	7575720	that perspective you know it has gotten me closer and closer to Kinect is the fact that it's a way
7575720	7580880	that you could do the live streaming on Xbox one and you know have your face they're kind of
7580880	7585440	similar to how you have to have the PlayStation camera on the PlayStation 4 to do streaming which
7585440	7591360	I have to admit in both cases is pretty stupid why can't I just hook up a USB camera to one of these
7591360	7596080	systems and have that be my camera I mean I get it they're not gonna sell as many of these cameras
7596080	7601560	by letting me do that but I still don't have to like it in both cases like I just I just wish I
7601560	7606240	could just hook up a camera and use that for the streaming but with the Xbox 360 backwards
7606240	7611800	compatibility stuff one cool thing that Microsoft has done to their credit not only is it simply you
7611800	7617960	can play these games on your Xbox 360 but you can do the Xbox one stuff with it like stream it like
7617960	7623400	do the caps and the videos and stuff that's pretty rad I gotta say and and really breeze just a
7623400	7630480	little bit more life into some of these older games all right we have two emails left greetings
7630480	7634800	peoples there's something I wanted to email you about in reference to last week's episode that is
7634800	7639000	until it did my research it involves Metroid there's a tidbit I thought I knew about this
7639000	7642880	game a tidbit that I thought would never go and mention while discussing the impact this game's
7642880	7648320	had on gaming landscape I thought that the term boss as it relates to video games came from the
7648320	7654240	original and NES Metroid's instruction manual as it turns out this is wrong and likely comes from
7654240	7659840	a fountain of bad information twin galaxies oh snap so why do I bring this up I'm curious if
7659840	7663760	there's anything gaming related that any of you believe to be an absolute fact that turned out
7663760	7668200	to be wrong stay care of entertainment this message is brought to you by Xbox wrestling
7668200	7682040	this is a tricky one to answer on the spot um I would say back before we had the internet which
7682040	7688880	maybe some of y'all can't remember that far back but you know when we didn't have Japanese games
7688880	7697520	here in other words like we didn't know that there was necessarily a Mario Brothers 2 that
7697520	7701480	was different than ours you know maybe if you were into the right cultures and had the right
7701480	7707440	magazines you kind of knew that but I want to say I was convinced at one point there was like a
7707440	7712160	legit like Super Mario Brothers 4 that released in Japan that we didn't have here and that turned
7712160	7716200	out to not be true once I had the internet was able to figure that out but I feel like that was
7716200	7719520	something that was going around back in the day as a Japan had a Mario Brothers 4 and we didn't
7719520	7726600	or we'd get ads for games that were gonna come out and then they never did yeah whereas now you know
7726600	7733760	when they're on on the internet we find out about it right away or here was one that I spent hours
7733760	7740600	trying to do this in Final Fantasy 7 was to get the test zeros to show up which they were in Maya
7740600	7749640	the what manual was the versus books manual for Final Fantasy 7 talked about the test zeros which
7749640	7754480	apparently they were only in the Japanese version I guess stuff like that but nothing that I took to
7754480	7762280	be actual gospel I know how about the blood code on Mortal Kombat for the Super Nintendo that was
7762280	7767920	something everybody was convinced was there and like my friend put it in and saw the blood and
7767920	7772480	it's there in the Super Nintendo version of the game and dah dah dah and it's not there like that
7772480	7780000	was just like a game genie code that turned the sweat red exactly it turned the sweat red and but
7780000	7786320	you couldn't decapitate technically the sweat was just blood anyways it was turned gray so I still
7786320	7791520	have my Final Fantasy 7 strategy guide the versus one is the one I'm talking about that actually
7791520	7797600	book if you have it intact it'll go for money that particular one will which I was very mad
7797600	7802960	at dance friend Eric for slashing through my cover when I loaned it to him I was mad I got
7802960	7810000	another copy of it by the way um but ask Jeeves but I will say this that I've played through the
7810000	7814800	Japanese original Final Fantasy 7 because it's a fuck of a lot easier and the test zeros are in it
7814800	7822120	so just saying they beg you not to kill them it's adorable these they're like Doberman creatures
7822120	7829960	anyway um last last email yes okay dear olr I tried out the new Nintendo badge arcade this
7829960	7836080	weekend it has a cute pink bunny that entices you and then extorts you for cash yes I've seen I paid
7836080	7843360	for the VIP thing by the way what's the VIP thing get the VIP me garden thing where you can add
7843360	7848880	people as a VIP oh yeah I bought that too yeah that was a while ago that came out but yeah yeah
7848880	7853720	I know what you're talking about you're a VIP in my 3ds just you know you're online too yeah you
7853720	7860120	and Shane and Dan are the three that I have yay Loki's sold his I have a few I think I have Bobby
7860120	7867460	black wolf in there I have some I had to go back and find other people yeah um he even turns on the
7867460	7872360	demon eyes and flames when you consider not spending money in macro transactions why macro
7872360	7878320	the cash cost for five plays is a dollar anything over 99 cents is not a micro transaction if you
7878320	7884440	want to be literal literal anything over a millionth of a dollar is not a micro transaction if this
7884440	7889920	game was only played by adults I'd be sort of okay about it I mean you can spend your money as
7889920	7897120	you wish but children especially very young ones are being hit with very psychologically intensive
7897120	7902200	addiction methods aside from the very threatening rabbit it makes it clear you're spending real
7902200	7908140	money but ignores the fact that you're getting very virtual rewards also the first hit is free
7908180	7914140	and then they let you play a fake game once a day for the random chance of free plays the result is
7914140	7920180	the free games after the first hit are intentionally diluted and set up on a random delivery schedule
7920180	7925300	it's all extremely addictive is it tied to the internet can you let just change your clock in
7925300	7931580	your 3ds um it keeps telling you not to turn the power off once you've started and I noticed like
7931580	7935580	as soon as you operate the crane there's an instant like loading type of thing or something
7935700	7941340	so I don't know I don't know but I'm I mean hackers gonna hack I'm sure somebody's finding
7941340	7947460	a way around this but and I'll kind of laugh when they do and somebody will find a way to
7947460	7952380	just unlock all the badges for free wait but anyway I don't want to I think the appropriate
7952380	7958300	fate phrase here would be chasing the pink bunny I guess instead of the white rabbit I'd recommend
7958300	7963380	parents guide their children through the game and explain why each thing is designed to be addictive
7963380	7968820	I would recommend not letting children play the game I'd straight up I'll sell just don't go down
7968820	7973980	that don't don't save your payment information on that 3ds sorry I also have your parental
7973980	7980060	controls on or watch your money or watch your money disappear Nintendo for the record for the
7980060	7985660	record I don't think explaining it to children is gonna be necessarily a valid tactic because
7985660	7992140	and I'm gonna go a little bit into neurobiology right now a children children's brains are not
7992140	7997340	developed enough to understand the difference between long-term consequence their brains are
7997340	8004660	wired for immediate satisfaction the brain stays this way for men up it can be up until the 27
8004660	8009460	before their brains start looking more for consequence I don't think some ever grow out of
8009460	8016380	it but I'm saying the general range for males is between 21 and 27 and for women is between like
8016380	8024860	21 and 24 it's a smaller window at the end but yeah that's just biology Nintendo badge arcade
8024860	8029260	is also the perfect time to open a dialogue with children on gambling and drug addiction and why
8029260	8037300	they're similar hating the bunny Robin I'm glad I'm not alone in feeling that that Nintendo badge
8037300	8042700	arcade is shady as hell like I think that's really the best way for me to put it it's shady as hell I
8042780	8049780	think though again some children just aren't going to get that concept their brains aren't wires to
8049780	8054940	get it don't know the good news is that doesn't automatically install your 3ds just don't know
8054940	8059540	what it the hammer on it just keep the print controls on and don't save your credit card
8059540	8068140	information yeah you know that's one thing and I I normally don't have this discussion this one
8068140	8076300	thing I've liked about the family sharing with my iTunes and with my App Store is that if you've
8076300	8084060	got kids you actually can enact a parental control that makes them have to ask you every time they
8084060	8090300	want to buy an application or make a transaction in an app so I think that more systems need that
8090300	8097340	you know and not enough of them have it so just my two cents fair enough I don't like having to
8097340	8102300	put my like password information in like for purchasing a free app though that pisses me off
8102300	8110300	on any format I kind of get it in a way though because like maybe you don't want the kid filling
8110300	8116340	up your device or whatever with crap you know you still want to have some sort of say about what
8116340	8123660	they're putting on your device especially if there could be a you know a scandalous type of free to
8123660	8129100	play thing out there that maybe you don't want kids around I'm just saying I can store it's
8129100	8136620	annoying but I can sort of see the reason for it a little bit at least so anyhow there you go
8136620	8141540	emails thank you guys so those emails participate at orange lounge rated calm if you have an email
8141540	8146620	to send for a future week in the meantime let's get to the F use of the week it's the part of the

8256060	8264900	create some Metal Gear Solid 5 theme prosthetics for a double amputee and this person that James
8264900	8275540	Young he lost his arm in his leg in 2012 I guess when he was dragged between two rail carriages
8275540	8283820	and so now they are creating this highly stylized multi-functional limb for him that's pretty
8283820	8290780	awesome I kind of want to see what that looks like once done and then that's how somebody

8329420	8334900	those virtual hologram things done kind of like the gorillas I think they do their tour that way
8334900	8340580	or remember when Tupac showed up at Coachella and the whole hologram thing that's basically
8341220	8346780	Hatsune Miku yes I have compared Tupac to Hatsune Miku and I'm not going to apologize for it so
8346780	8354620	Hatsune Miku anyway is going to be going on her first US tour starting in April Miku Expo going

8453780	8459300	there up front with them won't that be fun that sounds fun I bet you we could get like Captain

8493380	8498300	different there it is again one eight seven seven game olr or a username on skype orange
8498300	8505020	lounge radio all one word looking over to Loki to see if there's any last-minute stories to get
8505020	8510780	out here before we or while we wait for some calls I suppose I really need to play more Fallout 4
8510780	8515020	there's so what is it that you're seeing that's so awesome that's blowing your mind well this is
8515020	8519820	just a lot of the VAT stuff so like there's one guy that you know focused in melee and so they
8519820	8525460	had like a power power arm thing that he just punched the guy's face off and this one now it's
8525460	8530020	a wild mongrel and they shoot the face off of this one too it seems like the type of thing that
8530020	8534980	Alan would be really into that game because I know he's really into Skyrim with mods everything but
8534980	8539180	I don't remember him playing Fallout 3 I don't know if he'll play this one or not we'll see
8539180	8544260	anyway it's just like yeah I didn't really play through oblivion very much and then then Skyrim
8544260	8548380	you played the crap out of exactly all right well we are getting a phone call so let's get to it
8548380	8553100	hi you're on orange on radio who's this hey everybody it's Rama hey Rama how you doing I'm
8553100	8558900	good but more the bigger question is how are you feeling sir I'm not a hundred percent but I'm well
8558900	8562420	enough to be doing this show for you all tonight and that's a big improvement over where I was
8562420	8568580	Monday or Tuesday night so I do understand because when I did my show Tuesday night I
8568580	8576500	did not realize how bad Mako Chan's voice was it was bad everything I've had wrong is in my
8576500	8582460	sinuses so like even still you probably heard me sniffling and I apologize for being gross but it's
8582460	8588660	just like that's like what I'm dealing with and like Monday Tuesday was bad like it was just snot
8588660	8593340	fountain everywhere now I'm being gross on purpose but it was just like it was so bad and like you
8593340	8602140	know no matter what and you believe me steamy spicy soups taking sinus pills long hot showers
8602140	8607940	um you know all the tricks trust me I was doing short of the neti pot that is the one thing I
8607940	8613740	can't do that's that chick that pours the rub that I can't do that there's a much better one
8613740	8618500	than the night I hate doing the neti pot myself but this other one squeezes uh-huh and it's a
8618500	8623180	quick flush it's not like this long slow I still feel like I'm gonna like inject it into my brain
8623180	8630860	by doing that trust me it it helps so much anyway but yeah so luckily I'm slowly getting on the
8630860	8635020	other side of it but you know what's what's interesting so Wednesday was a holiday from
8635020	8639180	work so thankfully I didn't have to take it as a sick day but a good friend of mine was having
8639180	8645140	surgery on Wednesday so and I volunteered because I'd had the day off work to take this person to
8645140	8649860	the hospital and then take them back after the surgery so it's like I'm going to a hospital and
8649860	8653820	I'm like sick and I'm like trying not to get my friends sick who's having the operation it's just
8653820	8661340	like oh my god it's crazy so this is just this is just a bad week so you know I know some of you
8661340	8666140	look forward to olr on Monday but let me just tell you this is just you need to let me have a
8666140	8670740	sick day once so I know and I know everybody's really cool and is understanding and sort but
8670740	8677820	just oh my god this is a bad week anyway my friend what is on your mind well I wanted to call and

8905220	8913180	bye bye bye 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio in the meantime Loki got
8913180	8924340	anything else for us no no sadly that's okay 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio
8924340	8930820	I was gonna bring this up earlier cuz during the break we were playing some music from you know we
8930820	8937500	just did some different game music random stuff and I I happen to play that song from Final Fantasy
8937500	8945020	10 that you hear in the very beginning of the game where they're doing the tournament you what's it
8945020	8949740	what's the name of that song oh what's the name of the song from Final Fantasy 10 the big big rock
8949740	8957060	song other world that's it that was the song I was playing during the break and Loki had commented
8957140	8961460	that that song you had hacked into Final Fantasy 11 they had a thing where you could swap up the
8961460	8968260	music so that was my in-party battle music is like totally awesome and then my solo battle music was
8968260	8973060	smacked my bitch up and that was awesome too and then of course they changed the chocobo writing
8973060	8978580	music from the chocobo theme to the foul course theme from never in story which it was even more
8978580	8984980	awesome it just made that game even better nice nice you know Final Fantasy 11 got its last patch
8984980	8990180	this week or its last major story but I keep hearing that they'll still be like little quality
8990180	8995540	of life patches for a little while but this is the last story patch essentially at this point the
8995540	9001300	game will not be changed and that was released on 11 11 or got that that patch and then of course
9001300	9008460	the service for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 going to be ending in like March or April I think and
9008460	9013980	then PC service will continue and then there'll be whatever is happening with the mobile expansion
9013980	9017660	or whatever the hell they're gonna do next for Final Fantasy 11 I look forward when it goes to
9017660	9024380	free play yeah you hope you're hoping it's uh it's gonna be interesting but also there's a Final
9024380	9031340	Fantasy 11 event in Final Fantasy 14 one of the characters from 11 shows up in 14 and there's like
9031340	9034780	this whole little like cross-promotion thing going on although it's a newer character so it's not
9034780	9039180	anybody I recognize but I thought it was funny because you do all these different fates in 14
9039260	9044860	and one of them is you go to the beach and you fight all these crabs and the dialogue actually
9044860	9049820	says when I needed training I would get together with some friends and go to the beach and we would
9049820	9054860	fight all these crabs and then that's the that's the fate that you do and it actually plays the
9054860	9058780	old battle music from 11 while you're fighting all the crabs so I thought that was really funny
9059340	9064380	so it was a cute little event that they had in 14 and then at the end of it you get the person's
9064380	9070540	armor that you can not transmogrify what do they call it again glamour you can glamour your gear
9070540	9076700	into that gear which I thought was pretty cool so yep all right wow it's quiet tonight on the
9076700	9082380	phones 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio give you one more chance to get
9082380	9089820	through here before we call it a night here in studio um any gaming plans for this week any
9089820	9094140	games you guys are still looking to pick up this week I hear a lot of people I was getting a
9094140	9100140	text from shane earlier in the show about the amiibo festival game on wii u uh talking about

9151260	9156220	early feedback yeah they're really he keeps trying to rope you into it I'm like I'm telling him like

9273420	9278380	up live for the shows uh remember sunday night six o'clock pacific nine o'clock eastern uh at
9278380	9284380	vog network.com I'm really excited though uh in the coming months I'm hoping that we're gonna get
9284380	9288140	our name out there more and more you know I haven't been able to do a lot of promotion for
9288140	9293180	vog uh or the show but with us doing gamer x we're gonna get to meet a ton of people there
9293180	9298060	and then um you know magfest I'm hoping we can do something there and so on so that'll be exciting
9298060	9303100	help uh help grow our little uh family a bit and get us some more callers here on the show but
9303100	9307500	how about that I think somebody's making good on their chat promise hi uh you're on orange
9307500	9312780	sounds radio who's this hey this actdeft hey actdeft what a surprise to hear you on the show
9312780	9315900	yeah I'm just I'm just giving you crap what's up buddy what's on your mind
9317180	9323420	uh well um you were talking about amiibo festival uh you haven't played it yet right I have not I've
9323420	9328380	only seen what they teased on those directs and I was like I don't think I'm really into this but
9328380	9332460	I don't like jamie's telling me I might be wrong shane's even telling me I might be wrong and I'm
9332460	9339180	assuming you're calling in to tell me I'm wrong yeah pretty much all right well tell me about it
9339180	9346060	what is what is the game what is amiibo festival animal crossing um it's it's kind of hard to
9346060	9353820	explain it's definitely a party game it's uh you have to play it uh with other other people but
9354620	9362220	it's it's like I don't know I I thought it was it was uh way more fun than mario party
9362220	9368700	uh whereas when mario party uh it's more like a competition with with other people
9369900	9378700	with um an amiibo festival it's just enjoy the game uh and and if you win it's okay it's good
9379260	9386220	it's like more like a feel-good game yeah rather than a competitive one so it's really fun
9386620	9389820	saying it's a hippie dippy everybody wins type of thing
9390780	9396700	kinda you still there's still a first place a second place and that but see but you're not
9396700	9401740	going to threaten to kill the person playing as princess daisy for taking your star everyone does
9401740	9406300	get points in it that they can power up for outfits and stuff and unlockables and you can
9406300	9410220	unlock mini games you can play with other people because you know how mario party goes like if
9410220	9417420	somebody steals your star like you may actually hurt them yeah you're like motherfucker exactly
9417420	9424380	but what what this uh this game you're not a you're pretty much enjoying the game so
9425740	9431980	like i said it's really hard to explain it in uh in a simple way but basically it's like it's like
9432220	9436380	monopoly where uh wasn't like uh life threatening
9438300	9445500	basically you guessed that okay okay uh yeah i like that well okay i'll i'm gonna check it out
9445500	9451180	i just i was a little put off by the price but i do really want that isabel amiibo i think i've
9451180	9454940	actually lost count of how many amiibo i have don't laugh at me um i need to count them up
9454940	9460860	again but i think i could be up to just about 50 now because i just bought five of the animal
9460860	9467180	crossing amiibo you're getting there you're getting there i'm so disgusted with myself i
9467180	9473100	really am hey at least you don't have an almost complete collection so oh well then yeah i'm more
9473100	9477500	disgusted in you no i'm just kidding well you saw you probably saw maybe you didn't see because i
9477500	9481900	think i only put this on instagram i don't think i put it on twitter or anything but i actually have
9481900	9488460	not just the american rob the robot but i got a japanese rob the robot or as they call it over
9488540	9493340	there just robot because it's a different color and so i actually got the two and alan was like
9493340	9498780	wait a minute i thought you weren't going to be buying two characters in different poses because
9498780	9504220	i have like i have a mario from smash brothers i didn't get the mario from mario party i don't need
9504220	9508620	it i don't need to go that far with it where i have every figure right um yeah but i did buy
9508620	9516300	two robs but i'm like my name is rob he's one of my favorite characters and the japanese one does
9516300	9521100	look cooler than the american one and i thought it's cute when you have two of them side by side
9521100	9528460	because you know rob rob like my online name rob roberts yeah anyway it's it's it's like obvious
9528460	9535180	you have to have it exactly i have to have it yeah i also got it too it's it's it looks really
9535180	9541340	pretty great better than the american one yeah so now it's good that i don't know if you reported
9541340	9548940	on this but the famicon robot uh is also coming to america so you don't have to i know right i
9548940	9553020	heard it if you don't want it i heard that that it showed up in a target ad or something that it's
9553020	9560140	gonna yeah yeah and the weird and one of the amiibo kiosks uh it appeared that the the sorry
9560140	9567660	the famicon robot it's coming to america so yeah you it's it's not that expensive it's like 20
9567660	9574140	dollars on amazon so it's not really that much a lot of you if you want to wait yeah yeah i
9574140	9580860	actually have more japanese amiibo than you'd think you know let's not forget in some ways
9580860	9586300	akuma jp is to kind of blame for some of this i'm just saying because and i'm always saying that
9586300	9591820	because i know he's listening but remember one of the first amiibo was that we fit trainer and i was
9591820	9596620	here crying and bitching and moaning and bellyaching about what a fucking pain in the ass it
9596620	9601100	was to get a we fit trainer because there wasn't enough of them and that you know the the stock
9601100	9606620	shortages and all that stuff or whatever they were uh talking about and then you know akuma jp being
9606620	9610300	the cool guy he is is like well i can just walk into a store in japan and get one you want me to
9610300	9613740	get you one here i just show up in the mail and sure enough he sends me a we fit trainer and it
9613740	9619580	was suddenly like the clouds parted amiibo collecting can be easy you just have to be
9619580	9625500	willing to import from japan and now a lot of figures of might have come from japan not even
9625500	9631580	just like akuma jp ended up sending me like a pac-man later on but like you know i got that rob
9631580	9636460	i bought one of my other figures came from japan my tune link came from japan because i couldn't
9636460	9643100	find them here anymore because they're kind of like gone but they were on uh um uh amazon for
9643100	9647180	like 12 bucks because i guess a japanese store was trying to clear them out so i bought a japanese
9647180	9653020	too i just wanted tote kk without having to spend 35 for the three pack when they sell him as a
9653020	9658860	single in japan uh keep i'm telling you keep an eye on amazon because at some point you may have
9658860	9665660	to pay like 15.99 so 12.99 but it's 20 bucks on um playasia so it may cost a little too much it
9665660	9670780	may come down you'll never know but they do have a couple of the other ones yeah yeah like the
9670780	9676860	duck hunt amiibo uh the japanese version on amazon is ten dollars which uh free shipping oh yeah it's
9676860	9683980	not bad yeah here you have to buy the the retro pack with robin and game and watch so if you
9683980	9688940	only want the duck hunt yeah yeah and i love the duck hunt amiibo and i love the rob amiibo
9688940	9694060	obviously but i i truly think the mr game and watch amiibo is probably the worst amiibo in
9694060	9700220	my entire collection it really is like no no i like it but i i that's i think that cheap plastic
9700220	9705340	thing they did i mean i get the cute idea behind it but i think it's kind of executed poorly
9705420	9710540	and like okay when you when you use mr game and watch and yoshi's wooly world to get the skin or
9710540	9716220	whatever it's just a pure black yoshi like it's kind of dippy i'm i'm not a fan of the mr blackface
9716220	9723660	yoshi no no don't go there no there so yeah i was not uh not pleased with mr game and watch so he
9723660	9731340	sits in the back of my collection but then also most of my amiibo come from imports uh i think i
9732220	9740940	what probably uh like a third of my amiibo come are american uh another part uh another third
9740940	9748540	could be from europe and most of them yeah from japan because they they sometimes are cheaper
9748540	9754540	even than the than msrp here in america so yeah it's gotten a lot better this year than it was
9754540	9759020	last year because it's i bet if i go back and listen to some of my amiibo rants from last year
9759020	9763660	i'm gonna be so ashamed of myself that how full throttle i've gone on this but now it's much
9763660	9767420	easier to get on amazon and once in a while you can kind of find what you're looking for you know
9767420	9774700	except i guess you know there's some amiibo i have that shane is actually like really irritated that
9774700	9778860	i have them and he doesn't because now he can't find them and one of them is that we fit trainer
9778860	9785020	so thank you akuma jp seriously you don't know how much that that little piece of plastic figure
9785020	9788860	means to me because that's something i can hold over shane going i have this and you don't
9789020	9795420	but also this apparently samus really hard not zero suit but original samus is apparently really
9795420	9800380	hard to find now and he's like i can't find a samus anywhere do you know what other figure
9800380	9806700	or amiibo figure is really hard to find right now what's that kirby i don't have a kirby in
9806700	9813580	my collection and i i right now you it's like uh at least an american one i think it costs
9813580	9819500	like 35 dollars yeesh so yeah i'm like it's the first one i got
9822460	9830220	but yeah i think the japanese version is like 18 16 so it's not that uh difficult to find but
9830220	9835580	yeah it's kind of expensive all right awesome yes it's because it's getting rare to find
9838940	9842780	all right well uh akuma jp i'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show all righty
9844380	9850700	oh i'm sorry i'm having a arigato sorry i'm chatting with akuma jp in chats right now
9850700	9854140	that's what i get for multitasking during the show is he sent me a message on something else
9854140	9859420	so sorry about that sorry act deft uh anything else on your mind before i let you go
9860780	9862860	okay thanks for having me thank you bye
9864780	9869260	i can't handle it i'm malfunctioning rob the robots breaking down we gotta end the show
9869340	9874540	calling people by the wrong name that's what you get when people private message me during the show
9876220	9880540	usually i just won't even call him dark sakura usually i was messaging you usually i don't even
9880540	9883820	look at my private messages during the show but sometimes i'm like all right i'll try to
9883820	9888620	multitask a little bit and then that's what happens i call somebody the wrong name but anyway uh

9951740	9956620	low on data for my plan and probably won't be playing too much ingress on wednesday maybe i'll
9956620	9961340	work on my game instead all right that seems like a fair compromise we'll see all right we'll see
9961900	9965980	but then level eight is so maybe there's a wi-fi somewhere that you could use
9967420	9972700	and well it's just i am now we'll see all right and last but not least dark soccer your final
