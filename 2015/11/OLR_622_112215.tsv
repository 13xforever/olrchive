7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	This week, Sony too revisits backwards compatibility with PlayStation 2 emulation on the PlayStation 4.
18000	21000	Here's hoping classic Star Wars games help get us through to The Force Awakens.
21000	27000	There's plenty more along with your calls and comments tonight on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	48000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this November the 22nd of 2015 with episode number 622 of our show.
48000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts, but you can find me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E,
52000	56000	and I am joined here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California with my co-hosts.
56000	60000	Say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
60000	63000	I like this coffee.
63000	66000	You're having some coffee to help pick you up, give you a little energy?
66000	67000	It's delicious.
67000	71000	Yeah, I gotta say, I don't know who invented the Keurig. I'm assuming it was Keurig.
71000	74000	Is that the name of the company? I don't know, but anyway.
74000	78000	Whoever invented that, that thing is a lifesaver for...
78000	83000	But, so I don't sound like a free advertisement because we're not on the payroll.
83000	90000	To hell with that 2.0 thing where it wouldn't do the cups that weren't first party. It was so weird.
90000	94000	It was like an NES system that wouldn't play the third party cartridges.
94000	97000	I never have that problem.
97000	102000	Because when I buy a bag of coffee, it lasts about a month.
102000	111000	And my filters cost $2, and I can make my cup flavored any way I want to by adding things to it.
111000	114000	Can you make that cafe mocha right there?
114000	117000	I could buy that cafe mocha because they sell the grounds.
117000	119000	Oh, do they? Oh, that's something, I guess.
119000	121000	This is just the Target brand.
121000	125000	I thought there was something special because some of them now, they don't just put coffee in it, but they actually put cream.
125000	129000	I have this one at work that actually has cream and sugar in the cup as well.
129000	131000	So it's like a whole all-in-one thing.
131000	140000	I enjoy that you share coffee with me, and I'm glad to buy you cups. I just wish that they were more biodegradable than they are.
140000	145000	It seems like some other companies are coming out with solutions, so maybe everybody will switch to that.
145000	151000	Because there's these other ones we get that are totally different, and they work, but they seem more out of materials that would biodegrade easy.
151000	158000	These do make a lot of waste. However, delicious, and just exactly what I needed.
158000	159000	Hits the spot.
159000	166000	I also have Kit Kats. I've been on a quest for all the different flavors of Kit Kats from Japan.
166000	168000	I finally got the cheesecake Kit Kats.
168000	169000	Oh, that sounds amazing.
169000	174000	They're really good. I only have a few left from the package I bought yesterday.
174000	178000	But I forgot to buy the strawberry cheesecake ones that they had at...
178000	188000	In Japan Town in San Francisco, they have an omiyage store, which it's like the packaged omiyage that you get when you travel all over Japan and then you take them to all your friends.
189000	196000	But they had the strawberry cheesecake ones, and I almost bought that box, except I thought I already had strawberry cheesecake, but I just had regular cheesecake.
196000	200000	Still super good. And then I got blueberry cheesecake soft Oreos.
200000	201000	That's a flavor?
201000	203000	It's a flavor in Japan.
203000	204000	Ah, that sounds amazing.
204000	207000	They're amazing. Green tea Oreos are also good.
207000	210000	I'm kind of glad you didn't bring all that to the show, though, because I've eaten enough this weekend.
210000	213000	They also have heavy sweet cream Oreos.
213000	215000	It tastes like condensed milk.
215000	221000	This is kind of funny to me that this weekend you traveled to the West and went to San Francisco to spend the day.
221000	227000	And I traveled to the East and I went to Reno and went to Wizard World this weekend on Saturday.
227000	230000	And then, of course, we're in Reno. We got to go to a buffet.
230000	236000	So we went to a buffet, and I am really not proud of how much I ate at that buffet, but it was pretty good.
236000	239000	You know, I did have something dismaying happen.
239000	240000	What's that?
240000	247000	One of the big reasons I went was to go to Soko Hardware and get a tatsunabe, an iron pot.
247000	253000	And the one I wanted was like $130 for a wrought iron pot.
253000	261000	And they had cheaper ones, but I think I'm going to just look online because I really want a good tatsunabe for making sukiyaki and other things.
261000	262000	I've started cooking a lot more.
262000	265000	Let me ask you one other quick question, then I want to get to Techmaster Loki.
265000	268000	Because, obviously, this is a video game show and we do talk about gaming.
268000	271000	Did you go to that little arcade they have there with all the imports?
271000	275000	I stopped by there, but I had Becky with me, so I didn't play anything.
275000	276000	Ah.
276000	280000	But you could see it from a little place that you go to get taiyaki.
280000	281000	Yeah.
281000	282000	Alright.
282000	285000	Well, also joining us in the studio tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
285000	286000	Hello.
286000	287000	Hey, Loki, how you doing?
287000	288000	Doing fine.
288000	293000	Good. Well, since Dark Soccer and I are kind of pooped from our trips, you're going to need to carry the energy on the show tonight.
293000	298000	Because before you were here, Dark Soccer and I were like, can we maybe have like a nap segment?
298000	301000	Like maybe like the official OLR siesta of the week?
301000	303000	And then we just go silent for five minutes while we nap.
303000	306000	Or maybe 20. I guess 20 minutes is a much better nap than five.
306000	310000	So you might have to pick up the energy a little bit on tonight's show, Loki.
310000	311000	Okay.
311000	321000	So, one little storyline here on OLR I'm sure people have been following and kind of getting a chuckle out of over the past couple months.
321000	324000	Was that you used to make fun of me for playing this cell phone game.
324000	330000	I didn't make fun of you for playing Ingress. I didn't get it. It was like Minecraft.
330000	331000	You know, where I didn't get Minecraft.
331000	333000	I think that's a good comparison. That's a fair comparison.
333000	335000	Because when I first played Minecraft, I was like, I don't get it.
335000	337000	I still don't get it, but I'm playing it anyway.
337000	340000	So, but you've gone like full tilt boogie on Ingress.
340000	345000	And right now they're doing a special event, which is like, it's for their third anniversary.
345000	346000	Double XP.
347000	351000	I just call it XP because for all the role playing games, it's always experience.
351000	354000	That's basically what it is, but they call it AP because they got to be different.
354000	357000	So, but it's double that for like a week or two.
357000	360000	So you've been taking big advantage of this, right?
360000	366000	Yeah. So I went from level seven to level nine.
366000	372000	I'm not nine yet because once you get to past level eight, you have to have like certain amount of medals and stuff.
372000	373000	It's like achievements.
373000	377000	So imagine like to get further in a game, you have to have achievements to unlock stuff.
377000	379000	So I don't have the achievement yet.
379000	385000	I don't have a gold medal to level up to nine, but I have the experience to do it.
385000	387000	I just don't have the medal yet.
387000	393000	That's the only downside of the double AP because Alan gained a lot during that segment when they did it last year.
393000	396000	And he was short on badges for a little bit as well.
396000	400000	I think he just barely has the badges to get to 10 or whatever, which I think he's going to hit during this event.
400000	402000	So kind of interesting.
402000	406000	So anyway, I just thought the listeners to get a kick out of that, that you've been playing a lot more than that.
406000	414000	I had, you know, some time to take because I had these like floating holidays I had to take before the end of the year.
414000	422000	And I was just like, eh, if I tell my wife what I'm going to take time off or take time off, she's going to watch the kids.
422000	424000	So I'm just not going to say that I am.
424000	429000	And so you better hope nobody plays this for you.
429000	434000	I mean, it's fine. It's, um, it was only like a day or two.
434000	441000	And it's, you know, I just got out of the house and I was playing that until like eight at night.
441000	443000	You know what to get you out, get you moving.
443000	449000	Yeah. I, my phone's been buzzing, you know, tell me, Hey, you've hit your walking, you know, thing for the day.
449000	451000	Hey, you've hit a new record of walking.
451000	458000	And you know, so I did a lot of that and, um, I got to frack farm something with some people on Friday.
458000	464000	So that was kind of fun. I bought my first in app purchase, which I didn't actually, I didn't actually pay for that.
464000	467000	I answered free surveys through Google, you know, through the Android thing.
467000	472000	And so I had like five dollars and I'm like, okay, I'm just going to buy some in app purchase for that.
472000	475000	And I still have money left over. So no real money has actually been spent on it. Okay.
475000	478000	Okay. Just time, just time. It's very little time.
478000	487000	I mean, anyone has an Android phone and seriously do that because it's like one second surveys and you get like a few cents and they send it to you like a few a week.
487000	492000	All right. Cool. All right. Well, I do want to also introduce the ever present fourth guest on our show.
492000	499000	We don't have anybody in studio tonight, but we do have our live chat room and we always appreciate those folks that participate along with our show live.
499000	501000	It's part of what makes our little gaming podcast.
501000	508000	We have here a little bit special is that we are all in the same room here in the studio, but then we're also with you guys virtually via our chat room.
508000	518000	We do tape live Sunday nights at the voice of geeks network, vog network.com, vog network.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
518000	523000	And if you are listening live, you can always go to our chat room live dot vog network.com.
523000	525000	We do read chat. We do.
525000	533000	Sometimes if we are not, you know, we again, we don't have time to play every single game in the world because, you know, we all have day jobs and stuff.
533000	543000	But, uh, sometimes you guys that have played games, maybe we haven't experienced, you will end your opinion on something or you might set us, like if we say, um, Oh, such and such game doesn't have this feature.
543000	548000	You might correct us and say, yes, it does. Or in the case of what happened today.
548000	559000	So to do a, do a small correction, the last week's episode, I suppose I get a message from Shane and he's like, I'm listening to last week's episode and he's like, nobody corrected you on how wrong you were.
559000	565000	That Dragon Quest heroes is not on Xbox one. And you actually said it was, and now that I was kind of thinking back, I'm like, that's right.
565000	573000	It was a PlayStation four exclusive, wasn't it? So, Hey, sometimes, sometimes even with the help of chatters, we might miss something accidentally, but, uh, it happens.
573000	583000	But anyway, we do appreciate those. You guys that, uh, participate with our program and, uh, looking at the chat room, uh, some folks talking about coffee because dark soccer was talking about the coffee thing a little bit ago.
583000	591000	Uh, William murder face and chat says French press for life. Uh, Mr. Rizzo's agrees to the French press. I know Alan's a big fan of the French press.
591000	602000	I have a French press. I also have a 1950s Pyrex percolator, which I love. Um, but Dan doesn't like the way the coffee turns out in it, but I love the sound. And then I have my drip cups.
602000	613000	Um, dark to see in chat says, has Rob seen the Oreo churros? Yes, I have. They're only like one Oreo car in Disneyland. I think it's actually outside, um, in, uh, downtown Disney.
613000	623000	But I, I, you guys, as much as we kind of always talked about Disneyland on the show, I haven't been in over a year now. The last time I went to Disneyland was last E3. I just, the prices have gone up so much. It's sad.
623000	638000	So I've seen the Oreo churros. I have not experienced one yet. Um, let's see. Um, act deft in chat says we have some hazelnut spread Oreos in Mexico or Nutella Oreos, but not actually Nutella. That sounds kind of amazing.
638000	647000	Actually. I told him if he sends me some, I'll send him a Kirby candies from the Japanese store. There you go. That sounds like a good exchange. Uh, let's see.
647000	661000	Um, also going to chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Alan Alchemy, responding to the, uh, siesta we're threatening to take during the show says the ritual recording of part B will be an hour long. Deal with it. Z, Z, Z. New Adele album plays.
661000	678000	Well, you know, we actually would not be able to stream the New Adele album because she put the kibosh on that. From my understanding, you cannot hear New Adele on Spotify because certain artists that can still sell millions of copies of their albums kind of just give the finger to streaming.
678000	692000	Cause you know, they want to sell more copies of their albums at Target. I sort of say, you know, put it on a delay or people are going to turn to piracy anyway, but whatever. It's, it's an interesting, uh, decision that they make there.
692000	704000	Uh, and blueberry in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says exotic limited edition snacks are the best. It's like finding shiny Pokemons in real life, but you can eat them too.
705000	718000	Who says you can't eat Pokemons? Who says you can't cook a Pokemon? That's what Charmander's for. So if it's anything like, you know, uh, Ingress, you know, recycle. I want to convert this Pokemon into like, I don't know, something.
718000	728000	Well, you, you, you joke about the Ingress comparison, but let us not forget. Those are the guys that are making Pokemon Go. That's why I made the comparison. So yeah, it may, it may, that may be a reality someday. We'll see.
728000	743000	I have to say, just mildly speaking on Pokemon, the new Digimon series came out that's related to, uh, the first two series that came out in Japan and over here. Um, and it's amazing and it's on Crunchyroll.
743000	744000	Okay.
745000	749000	I have to say for any other people who were, did you, cause you know, I'm a, I was a big Digimon fan.
749000	751000	I know you were, you were like the only person I knew that watched it.
751000	759000	And there, you know, I played the Digimon games and everything, so it's kind of video game related, but, um, it's on Crunchyroll and everyone owes it to themselves to watch it.
759000	771000	Cool. And you know, um, as much as that Pokemon Go thing, as a, as a Ingress player over a year, as much as when they first announced that I was kind of like, what the fuck? Like I was just like, this doesn't make sense.
771000	781000	The more I kind of think about it and I'm like, I am actually like really excited for that because I think it is going to be the Pokemon MMO we've always wanted, except it's going to be real.
781000	784000	So are you supposed to like battle people with that or like?
784000	794000	You know, everything is speculation at this point. They've shown one trailer, they've shown nothing on gameplay. Supposedly there was a beta test in 2015, but I kind of doubt that that's happening. I think, um.
794000	797000	Why am I not hearing this from Kotaku yet?
799000	809000	Maybe, maybe they got blacklisted by Niantic, I don't know. But to be fair, Loki, we haven't heard it either. So, we're just as much hot water as anybody else. So, anyway.
809000	820000	I just, you know what's funny? I didn't even have any, I know this, getting into our kickoff topic tonight. I know that's the thing that like everybody's been talking about on blogs and everything and I know even Bobby was talking about it on his show tonight.
820000	829000	And that's when I realized, when Bobby brought it up on his show, I was kind of looking at our show roll going, oh shit, I didn't put that anywhere on our show roll tonight, even though like that's a big thing.
829000	840000	Because it's not fucking news, who cares if they, oh damn, a website that I don't care to read anymore because it's very sensational got blacklisted by two companies. Well, fuck them, who cares?
842000	851000	I think it's more the precedent than anything else. What if it was a different site that you did like? Because there probably is going on with a site that you do like.
851000	854000	Okay, well if you violate your NDAs, then you're probably going to get blacklisted.
855000	863000	But my understanding was they weren't under NDAs for anything that they spilled. NDAs are usually very specific to what you can and can't disclose.
863000	871000	Because that's the weird thing about the industry is that they've got one arm that's the very public facing stuff and everything that they're pushing and promoting and then there's the other that's working on everything in secret.
871000	879000	Well, if you do something that they don't like, if you're an entity that's doing something a company doesn't like, they don't have to do business with you.
879000	894000	They don't have to share information with you because they don't see you as a trustworthy source anymore. It's like, well, I understand that you're not going to maybe follow our narrative or whatever as far as what we're putting out of PR and stuff.
894000	906000	That's fine. If a company doesn't want to do that, like a media company, then that's cool. But it's like, hey, we had this big announcement planned and you guys went and fucked it up. We're kind of mad at you for that.
906000	911000	So we're just not going to give you the opportunity to do that anymore. I don't see a problem with that.
911000	930000	My whole thing on it is that a lot of this I see parallels as to why I really don't enjoy E3 anymore. And that is that it's about the script and sticking to the script and nobody wants to go off the script and everything is just, okay, you can come spend five minutes with our very blah copy of the game.
930000	938000	Or now it's about, you can come to our theater where you've waited in line for an hour to get in this theater where you can watch somebody else play the game for 20 minutes.
938000	950000	You know, and it's just like, I just, I'm not an on the script kind of guy, but I also don't do this for a living. I don't get paid for OLR. Has anybody here been paid for this show at all?
950000	952000	I got a copy of Dragon's Lair once.
952000	967000	Once in a while there might be like a fun little perk and we're always very thankful for that. We have some awesome listeners and all that. But as far as like, do we make $500 a show or something? No. God, no. In fact, we probably pay out more money than we're actually getting in perks.
967000	972000	But this isn't, like we've been doing it for what? Like fucking 13 years, right? We wouldn't do it if we didn't have fun.
972000	974000	Orange Lounge who?
974000	985000	Yeah, right? So, I mean, it is what it is. But my whole thing is that, and we talked about this when I talked about why I just don't really enjoy E3 as much anymore. I love the networking part of it.
985000	997000	I love to meet people, talk to other people and so forth. But as far as like, it's kind of boring at this point. Like it's just not worth the money to go to LA or the time off work and all that.
997000	1008000	But what I love and my favorite part and what I've found has been like the most rewarding in the past year or two working with games is working with the developers who aren't on the A-list.
1008000	1018000	You know, there's a lot of very hard working game makers out there who are on like the B-list. And there's nothing wrong with being on the B-list.
1018000	1030000	We've had a lot of great people here on OLR who we've interviewed who are doing some great games, right? And even the indie level things. I love talking to indie people and about the games they're doing.
1030000	1041000	So there's sort of that side of it where I'm like, okay, well, I think Kotaku in this case, they have a right to answer the question, why did you not review Fallout 4 when it came out like everybody else did?
1041000	1044000	I think they do have a right to say, here's why.
1044000	1045000	Totally do.
1045000	1053000	But on the other hand, that doesn't mean I feel that Ubisoft and Bethesda should be strong armed into working with Kotaku.
1053000	1054000	No.
1054000	1065000	I don't actually believe that. I just think Kotaku will have to work better and smarter like the rest of us do who don't have these cushy partnerships with the developers.
1065000	1069000	Oh, boo hoo, you can't get your review copy. Where's my review copy?
1069000	1070000	Yeah.
1070000	1071000	I didn't get a review copy.
1071000	1078000	So, you know, it's just kind of one of those. And I kind of think, you know, well, then that website with their views.
1078000	1086000	Okay, so they're not going to be running stories on Fallout 4. They're not going to be running stories on Assassin's Creed, as many maybe.
1086000	1092000	That's more real estate for them to run stories on people who are probably really desperate for the coverage.
1092000	1098000	And that's not going to be what's going to be run on their website. But yeah, I see what you're saying.
1098000	1104000	Ideally, I mean, again, I very rarely, you know, I've had an issue with that website for some time.
1104000	1111000	I think things have gotten a little better, but they're not, like, it's still just not a website that is in my rotation, really.
1111000	1116000	But obviously everybody was tweeting about that story. I had to go see what the fuck was going on with that.
1116000	1118000	But anyway, that's just my thought on that whole thing.
1118000	1126000	So going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, I was going to see if anybody was saying about, let's see, Mr. Rizos.
1126000	1129000	I was like, everybody's talking about Digimon in chat, and I think that's DarkSaga's fault.
1129000	1130000	But I do see some comments.
1130000	1132000	Hey, Digimon is great.
1132000	1135000	No, there's nothing wrong with that, but Mr. Rizos in chat says,
1135000	1140000	I agree with Loki. Nobody who's looking for real info on gaming goes to Kotaku anymore.
1140000	1145000	SHO100Matt says, I do think that Kotaku is doing their jobs as journalists and reporting news from sources.
1145000	1151000	If Bethesda and Ubi is really mad about this information being leaked out, then maybe they should be mad at their own staff or clients.
1151000	1153000	I guess it kind of depends on how they got the information.
1153000	1155000	Let me finish. That leaked the information out.
1155000	1160000	Plenty of companies have ways of locking down the information channels if they wanted to keep information quiet.
1160000	1168000	I do think that is a valid point. Why are you not more mad at the people leaking the information?
1168000	1170000	It's just that they don't know who's doing that.
1170000	1172000	And I don't know. What were you going to say?
1172000	1175000	I was going to say it depends on how they got the information too, of course.
1175000	1182000	If they had talked with somebody and they're like, listen, this is under NDA, but here's what we're working on, blah, blah, blah.
1182000	1186000	And then they went, oh, hey, here's the information we got from our source or whatever.
1186000	1192000	And that's kind of fucked up. But if they have anonymous sources or whatever reporting this stuff to them, I mean, whatever, that's fine.
1192000	1196000	Once again, though, but they're well within the right to blacklist you, though.
1196000	1204000	You know, especially in a big industry where there's hundreds of people, somebody gets fired or let go for a reason that they're not happy with.
1204000	1209000	And so they turn to one of these sites and that's how they get back at their old company.
1209000	1212000	Come on, that has to happen. That has to happen.
1212000	1218000	You know, and I'm sure that's probably a part of how some of these websites get their information is jaded former or current employees.
1218000	1219000	Yeah.
1219000	1227000	So, you know, anyway. I'm not saying that's okay or that's right or people should do it. I'm just saying that's what's happening.
1227000	1231000	No, I want to talk to you. I want to talk to a Bethesda play tester.
1231000	1237000	Because how how is this stuff like that's good.
1237000	1243000	Good enough. I mean, because like I know it's such a double.
1243000	1248000	It's such a double standard to be like, you know, oh, what's a Bethesda game? It's going to be buggy as hell.
1248000	1254000	I mean, and that's why I enjoy those games, because it's like, hey, the dog is stuck under the table clipping through the ground.
1254000	1262000	That's okay. Like the other day was that the dog was it was stuck in like an animation loop or something like that.
1262000	1269000	So it kept like sneezing for like five minutes and then start like hacking up like a hairball for like five minutes.
1269000	1275000	And it was scratching for five minutes. It kept getting stuck in these animation, these idle animations.
1275000	1279000	It was kind of funny. Bobby Blackwell has a fair counterpoint here in chat saying,
1280000	1286000	My response that I said was that the bugs are most likely found by QA, but that the devs didn't have time to fix it.
1286000	1291000	Most of the bugs were probably reported. So blame the firm release date that they didn't want to delay.
1291000	1296000	I think he makes a valid point, because I've definitely heard the story of the QA tells them there's a problem.
1296000	1303000	And oh, we don't have some of these bugs that are like have been in Bethesda games like from like Fallout,
1303000	1310000	you know, New Vegas, Fallout 3, you know, Skyrim. These are like bugs that have been in all of these games.
1310000	1317000	And it's just not been fixed. I don't know. I mean, yeah, I understand that they're not being fixed by the devs,
1317000	1322000	but will they ever? They're not. I mean, honestly. And you know what?
1322000	1329000	At this point, I would be surprised if we see console mods, because they can't get their shit together with the way it is right now.
1330000	1333000	I'm going to take one more comment on the Kotaku thing here, and then I want to move on.
1333000	1340000	ActDeft in chat says both parties involved are in the right here. Kotaku is in the right to be pissed for being called out on doing their job.
1340000	1344000	And I imagine he's probably finishing his thought right now. And I'm just reading this early.
1344000	1352000	But my thought is the one more thing I want to get out here is that maybe it's time to just re-examine this whole process to begin with.
1352000	1361000	And it's always interesting to me how secretive and how tight-lipped a lot of the gaming stuff is,
1361000	1364000	where they really don't talk about what they're doing in advance.
1364000	1368000	And we've talked and made a lot of comparisons to the movie industry before.
1368000	1373000	I've always said on this show, game ratings should have the exact same ratings as movie ratings.
1373000	1377000	I don't understand why the two are separate, right? We've made comparisons between the two industries before.
1377000	1382000	In the movie industry, they're usually a lot more forward with what they're working on.
1382000	1386000	And that hasn't ruined anything in movies, as far as I know, right?
1386000	1390000	No, I mean, you get a lot of direction.
1390000	1398000	I mean, okay, maybe people steal ideas and that's how you get those direct-to-video things like, what was it, like, instead of Snakes on a Plane, it was like...
1398000	1399000	Yeah, Snakes on a Train.
1399000	1400000	Snakes on a Train.
1400000	1401000	No, but...
1401000	1402000	I mean, come on.
1402000	1405000	That company, that's all they do. They do those knock-off movies.
1405000	1409000	Exactly. I would actually maybe enjoy some knock-off games for parody purposes.
1409000	1414000	But, like, I think, I don't know if you really have to worry about companies stealing each other's ideas.
1414000	1424000	I guess you could say, like, you know, Titanfall, you know, had, like, the mechanics from Titanfall and Call of Duty kind of borrowed those for their last two games.
1424000	1427000	So there's some stuff that's being taken from one another.
1427000	1436000	But you can't copyright those mechanics, even though Konami would like to copyright, you know, arrows moving up a screen and you have to line it up with something.
1436000	1442000	So that's kind of fucked up, but you can't really copyright that stuff.
1442000	1444000	So, I mean, I don't see the point.
1444000	1452000	Maybe that they just changed their mind. You don't want to get people hyped up on stuff that's not going to come out like Prey 2 or Half-Life 3, you know, that type of stuff.
1453000	1460000	Alright, I'll end with one more comment here from William Murderface in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com who says,
1460000	1464000	I think the main perp here is entitled shitlords on the internet.
1464000	1470000	I can agree with that. DarkSaga, do you agree with that? The main problem here is entitled shitlords on the internet?
1470000	1471000	Yeah.
1471000	1481000	I just, like, you know, I hear Kotaku and I hear that there's something bad happening to them.
1481000	1483000	And I'm just like, I just don't care.
1483000	1488000	It's not as violent as the reaction I have to certain other gaming websites, but it's, you know.
1488000	1491000	You know, it's just like, oh, they're blacklisted. Well, you know, they kind of had it coming.
1491000	1500000	You know, that's kind of like the way I feel with that. It's just, you know, maybe they didn't, but I just don't fucking care anymore because of so much garbage that's been posted on the website.
1500000	1507000	Loki's over there going, they had it coming. They had it coming. They only had themselves to blame.
1507000	1515000	Alright, moving on. The thing I actually wanted to talk about with the kickoff topic tonight is that we have a lot of anniversaries going on in gaming right now.
1515000	1523000	Which makes sense because this being that week leading into Black Friday and Thanksgiving, you know, this is a huge release window.
1523000	1526000	And usually a lot of game systems come out in this timeframe, right?
1526000	1536000	So, actually, believe it or not, yesterday, the 21st, was the 25th anniversary of the Super Famicom system.
1536000	1539000	That's awesome. Were we getting any free virtual console games?
1539000	1542000	Probably not because I don't think there's an Nintendo Direct.
1542000	1543000	Ah, fuck them.
1543000	1549000	But November 21st of 1990 was when the Super Famicom, which of course was the Japanese Super Nintendo, that's when that was released.
1549000	1553000	So believe it or not, that system is 25 years old.
1554000	1565000	And I think many people would say, I don't know if everybody would say, but many people, including myself, probably would say, probably the best video game console ever made.
1565000	1568000	I kind of think. And maybe that's just because of my age.
1568000	1577000	You know, maybe people who are a little bit older than me, like if you're, or I'm sorry, a little bit younger than me, if you're like 7 years younger than me, maybe you think the best console of all time was the PlayStation.
1577000	1580000	Because that's what was out when you were that age.
1580000	1587000	Or maybe if you're like 15 years younger than me, you probably think it's the PlayStation 2, you know, or something.
1587000	1595000	Or the Xbox even. But yeah, that's, I think is probably the greatest console they ever did.
1595000	1601000	Even if it's really funny to look at some of the old ads and magazines, this is something that's been circulating around the internet this week.
1601000	1608000	Is some of these old ads and magazines that showed just how much those games cost because they were on cartridge.
1608000	1617000	I mean, you know, I seem to recall, like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II, like at the time, were like $80 games, I think.
1617000	1623000	Because they were on cartridge. And that was $80 in the 90s, which was a lot of money.
1623000	1627000	But those games were hella badass and worth it.
1628000	1637000	Any quick Super Nintendo memories or favorite Super Nintendo moments or like thing you most anticipated on Super Nintendo to kind of cap this together here?
1637000	1640000	I don't know. I mean, like a lot of the games were really cool.
1640000	1647000	And I remember I sold my Nintendo to get a Super Nintendo and the first games I got for it were...
1647000	1656000	I don't even remember what games I had. I know I had Roadrunner's Death Valley Rally, which is like Sonic the Hedgehog on Super Nintendo.
1657000	1663000	And I played the shit out of that. I don't remember what other games I had. Probably Link to the Past was amazing.
1663000	1670000	When we got my Super Nintendo, we got it with A Link to the Past. Of course Mario World came with it.
1670000	1679000	We had Home Alone, which my brothers played obsessively, and we got the Super Scope 6, which was actually fun. Blastress was pretty fun.
1680000	1683000	Tigerclaw on chat at live.fognetwork.com says,
1683000	1688000	I used to play a shit ton of Super Mario World. It was the game that came packed in the Super Nintendo.
1688000	1698000	Oh yeah. I mean, Nintendo, man, they were masters of the...in some ways still are masters of the...well, they slipped a little bit on Wii U.
1698000	1703000	But they usually are masters of the must-have pack-in game, right?
1703000	1712000	Think about it. Wii Sports sold that Wii. Super Nintendo was definitely bolstered by that Super Mario World.
1712000	1719000	I mean, it's one of the best games they ever did on the console, and it was the first, if you think about it, being the pack-in game, right?
1719000	1724000	And then, you know, Super Mario Brothers being a pack-in game for the original NES.
1724000	1730000	Granted, depending on which configuration you bought, but for most people they got the Super Mario Kart.
1730000	1737000	Yeah. Was an amazing Super Nintendo game. It was a pack-in game. Now, Nintendo may have slipped a little bit.
1737000	1740000	I don't know if Nintendo Land is on the same level as those other games, but...
1740000	1741000	Nope, it was shit.
1741000	1748000	I wouldn't go that...I wouldn't go far to say it was shit, but it wasn't Wii Sports, and it definitely wasn't Super Mario World.
1748000	1751000	No one was like, ooh, it's Wii Sports.
1752000	1759000	Let's see. Act F says, speaking of anniversaries for Nintendo on November 21st, Amiibo, one year old.
1759000	1766000	And that's how long it took for you to finally find them on shelves. There you go. One year out, and you can finally find the Amiibo on shelves.
1766000	1768000	I bought one today because of Shane.
1768000	1770000	Oh God, did he pressure you into Falco?
1770000	1780000	He woke me up this morning by a text message and said, Lottie's out at Target. So I got Lottie.
1782000	1786000	He's such a little jerk. He was messaging me all day Friday.
1786000	1787000	I need the 3-pack now.
1787000	1793000	He was messaging me all day Friday going, you want to get a Falco? The Falco figure's so pretty. It's so blue, you should see it up close.
1793000	1801000	I'm like, Shane, you are in the wrong line of work. You need to be a salesman. You need to be a salesman. This is what you do so well.
1801000	1805000	I want to get the 3-pack so I can get my DJKK.
1807000	1817000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I'm retired from Amiibo buying until the Cloud Strife Amiibo comes out. Then I will un-retire for one day only and then retire again.
1818000	1823000	I may have to get that. May. But then again, I don't have Smash so that's kind of pointless.
1823000	1830000	If anybody from Nintendo is out there, seriously, do not make that fucking Cloud a retailer exclusive. Blood will be shed.
1832000	1838000	That's not a threat against Nintendo. I'm saying, you know those Black Friday fights you see at Walmart? That's going to be nothing compared to those Cloud Amiibos.
1838000	1842000	You better make sure plenty of those are available.
1842000	1850000	Let's see. SHO 100 Matt says, Shane waking up Jamie on a Sunday. He clearly likes to live dangerously. That's a very fair point.
1850000	1851000	I went back to sleep.
1854000	1864000	Allen Alchemy in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, 2014 Sky. Amiibos are trash pandering to hoarders and merch addicts. Manufactured supply shortages. Burn it all to the ground.
1864000	1872000	2015 Sky. Amiibos cover my body with them and I'll roll around. They're pointy but I don't care. I have 80 of them. Money is no object.
1872000	1875000	It's an accurate read. What can I say? Opinions change.
1876000	1884000	No, I still think a lot of the retailer shit they do is bullshit. I don't understand. I don't understand.
1884000	1898000	I don't understand why Nintendo does not have their own store online where you could just buy the Amiibo and then they know you could preorder them on their store and then they would know exactly how many to make.
1898000	1901000	They could keep the money. I just don't understand why that's not a thing.
1901000	1906000	But see, if they're not in crazy demand, you'll stop talking about them and therefore they don't get the coverage.
1906000	1910000	They figured that out with the Wii and it's been like that ever since. These artificial shortages.
1910000	1922000	Because no one is inept enough to be able to not predict their fucking amount of product that they need for their customers for how many years now? Almost ten fucking years.
1922000	1924000	I mean, I'm sorry. They're not that stupid.
1924000	1928000	This does not ever seem to be a problem with Disney Infinity or Skylanders.
1929000	1938000	Well, Skylanders actually was a big problem and for Disney Infinity, though, they manufacture fucking toys and they still have those issues as well and they've done retailer exclusive things.
1938000	1947000	Skylanders I don't think is so bad because at least with Skylanders, for the most part, it's not a franchise. I don't think that people are like,
1947000	1955000	Oh my god, I gotta get a new one! Well, maybe it is, but at least with Disney, it's like, okay, recognizable characters.
1955000	1962000	Skylanders, I'm like, who the fuck is this character? I don't fucking care. Where's Spyro? That's not fucking Spyro. What the fuck did they do to Spyro?
1962000	1965000	My interest in this game is fucking up there.
1965000	1971000	Let's see, Bobby goes on, he's kind of slamming amiibos a little bit, but then says,
1971000	1978000	Lego dimensions don't have this problem. I haven't had a problem getting any Lego dimensions anything. Money is no object. Cover my body with Lego dimensions.
1978000	1982000	Wouldn't that hurt, though? Have you ever stepped on a Lego? It fucking hurts.
1982000	1985000	If you step on enough of them, though, it doesn't feel so bad.
1985000	1995000	Wasn't there a thing circulating on Facebook where now Lego is selling Lego-branded slippers for you to walk around the living room so you don't step on your kids' Legos that they've left all over?
1995000	1997000	I'm always positive that's a thing.
1997000	2000000	You're telling them to fucking clean it up.
2000000	2019000	Anyhow, I want to say one other anniversary. This one's a tough pill to swallow, because when we get on here and we say the NES is turning 30 years old and the Super Nintendo is turning 25 years old, we can kind of look at that and go, God, I feel old right now.
2019000	2042000	But this is definitely one that's going to make you go, wow, time flies, life's short. Also celebrating an anniversary tomorrow, November 22, 2005, 10 years ago, the release of the Xbox 360. Ten years ago, if you can believe it. The Xbox 360 turns 10 years old tomorrow.
2042000	2044000	Am I getting any free games out of this?
2045000	2055000	No, you'll probably get a free avatar. I love how that's Loki's response to all these anniversaries. What free thing am I getting? Happy birthday to me. What am I getting for free?
2055000	2064000	Well, if they're celebrating an anniversary, I'm not buying them anything, so what are they providing to me as a commemorative thing?
2064000	2087000	Maybe they'll be a sale. Who knows? I don't know. Anyway. And actually, wow, why did I think today was the 21st? Probably because I was reading the Super Nintendo article. Good, the chair was correcting me. I was testing them. Today is November 22, so today is actually the 10 year anniversary of the Xbox 360. Sorry, my mind was still stuck on the Super Nintendo thing, which was yesterday.
2087000	2103000	So it's actually today. But one day, differences aside, 10 years. I remember a time here on Orange Launch Radio when we were talking about the launch of the 360.
2103000	2117000	And speaking of trash amiibo retail shortage, all this stuff, let us not forget the Xbox 360, that was a fucking mess when it launched. Remember that? It was impossible to find it.
2117000	2118000	Oh yeah, I remember that.
2118000	2122000	You had to check retailer stuff online. I remember the only way I was able to get it...
2122000	2124000	You had to go buy them out of the back of a car.
2124000	2129000	Yeah, I had to go buy... That's right, you bought yourself a... Oh my god, and then didn't it not work or something?
2129000	2131000	No, it worked perfectly fine.
2131000	2132000	Did it? Oh.
2132000	2134000	Yeah, it was good. I mean, it died eventually.
2134000	2137000	What was the one where you got ripped off? You like went to Stockton or something?
2137000	2148000	Oh, it was because I went to mod an Xbox 360. I went to mod one, and then they stole it or something. But, you know, whatever. Had like 12 more or so.
2148000	2155000	So yeah, I had to get... I remember, in order to get one, I had to get the core system. Because Best Buy told me they got five in randomly one day.
2155000	2160000	And I got the core system, and I had to buy that hard drive separately. But it was like, whatever, I'm gonna pay it.
2160000	2164000	Because I want to play Final Fantasy 11 on this thing when it comes out for the 360.
2164000	2168000	I bought like almost every launch game, and I was disappointed by most of them.
2168000	2175000	But I did like... Why did I end up playing mostly? I played... I liked Amp 3, actually. That was pretty fun.
2175000	2186000	I didn't like Perfect Dark because you can't jump. I'm like, dude, what fucking year is this that we can't jump in a game? That's kind of stupid. So, there's that.
2186000	2192000	As ridiculous as it is, Xbox Live Arcade was really what sold me on an Xbox 360.
2192000	2194000	I have way too many Xbox Live Arcade games.
2194000	2202000	Geometry Wars was a fucking game changer. And if you think about it, a lot of where we're at today in the industry with digital distribution and everything else,
2202000	2207000	I mean, Xbox Live Arcade was the start of that. So, you know, that's going back a good ten years or so.
2207000	2212000	And there was a lot of, you know, shovel stuff that came out in those early days of 360.
2212000	2221000	But you also had a lot of, for the first time, legally emulated versions of classics that included online leaderboards,
2221000	2230000	sometimes online multiplayer, depending on the game, achievements, and things that kind of modernized these classic games.
2230000	2237000	And Sneaking! Where are my Burger King games? I was promised a second set of Burger King games.
2237000	2242000	And they're not here, and I am so sad that there's not more Burger King games.
2242000	2247000	I understand that you'd probably put them out as an app now, but that's not what... I want a fucking console game.
2247000	2250000	I'll take it from any fast food place.
2250000	2254000	Some folks in chat talking about their best 360 moment. S200Matt says,
2254000	2262000	The best 360 moment was getting the Orange Lounge radio and Bobby Black Wolf icons that I still have today on the Xbox One.
2262000	2267000	Yes, we were fortunate enough. That was back in the days when we were on All Games Radio.
2267000	2274000	And we were able to kind of group together, and I don't remember the specifics about this, sorry,
2274000	2282000	but somebody over there, I don't remember if it was Bobby or Scott or whoever, got in touch with the folks at Microsoft,
2282000	2288000	and yeah, we were able to get those gamer pics on the Xbox 360, which sadly you can no longer get.
2288000	2292000	They were cleared off the store some time ago. Because, you know, everything kind of...
2292000	2296000	Microsoft shifted away from those gamer pics in favor of those avatars.
2296000	2297000	Oh, that was a good choice.
2297000	2300000	Well, you know. But it was certainly an honor to be included.
2300000	2306000	I mean, think about it. How many gaming podcasts got to have an official icon on Xbox 360?
2306000	2311000	There was only ever two packs. There was, you know, the All Games Network pack that we were in,
2311000	2316000	and then there was the one before that, whatever gamer tag radio was on.
2316000	2321000	I think they're the only show out of that group that's still on today. Please don't hate me if I'm wrong.
2321000	2326000	I just don't remember all the specifics. But whatever their network was at the time, I think they had it as well.
2326000	2329000	So, what? That's maybe like 12 podcasts?
2329000	2331000	Orange Lounge Radio Who?
2331000	2338000	We had gamer pics on Xbox Live. I'm sorry. I don't know what you guys...
2338000	2343000	Well, you know, Bobby had the most successful icon out of any of them.
2343000	2350000	Because I believe he was the only one that didn't actually put letters or like the name of his show,
2350000	2353000	because he had his little logo, the little wolf outline thing.
2353000	2359000	And because it didn't have letters on it or whatever, it can kind of be interpreted.
2359000	2364000	I think many people that were using it have no idea what the Bobby Black Wolf show is, unfortunately.
2364000	2366000	But maybe it gave some awareness to him.
2366000	2368000	Hey, it's a furries icon.
2368000	2371000	I don't know what the reason could be, but we'll see.
2371000	2374000	So, certainly more people were using his than were using OLRs.
2374000	2378000	But we were thankful to everybody that was using OLRs. That was pretty cool.
2378000	2383000	Alan Alchemy saying, best 360 gen memory.
2383000	2386000	Sky, remember when Xbox Game Room was hype?
2386000	2387000	Here we go.
2387000	2390000	And they were like, we are absolutely supporting this.
2390000	2391000	And then it was out for three days.
2391000	2393000	And they went, everyone is fired and we're closing it down. Bye.
2393000	2395000	Yeah, yeah, I remember that.
2395000	2400000	Not everything that has happened in the Xbox 360's time frame has been a good memory.
2400000	2404000	We could also talk about 1 versus 100 again, because I think I bring that up every week.
2404000	2410000	How I just love the concept of an online game show that's always kind of going.
2410000	2412000	And 1 versus 100 was that.
2412000	2414000	And when it shut down, I had a cry.
2414000	2417000	Now, thankfully, and granted we've had them on the show to talk about this.
2417000	2419000	And you all know we love them over at Jackbox Games.
2419000	2422000	But they're filling that void a bit with what they're doing.
2422000	2427000	And they're kind of leveraging a lot of Twitch, I think too, to make that a little more current.
2427000	2432000	But there's something about that 1 versus 100 era that I miss.
2432000	2437000	I think the fact that it was live sometimes during the day.
2437000	2441000	And you actually had a host who was talking and saying things that were current.
2441000	2444000	And a lot of the questions would be about current pop culture stuff.
2444000	2446000	And I thought that was really cool, actually.
2446000	2449000	My favorite moment? Grand Theft Auto IV.
2449000	2451000	And maybe Saints Row.
2451000	2454000	But mainly my modded games in Grand Theft Auto IV.
2454000	2457000	That was the best gaming experience I've ever had.
2458000	2461000	All right, so Xbox 360 has certainly brought us a lot.
2461000	2463000	I mean, if you think about it, my god.
2463000	2466000	Achievements. That was new on the 360.
2466000	2468000	And now that's like a standard. That's everywhere.
2468000	2471000	That's on... except Nintendo.
2471000	2473000	But even within some Nintendo games.
2473000	2475000	Yeah, it's on Steam. It's on PlayStation.
2475000	2477000	It's in some Nintendo games.
2477000	2479000	But it's not system-wide yet.
2479000	2481000	I'm assuming the NX will have to have it.
2481000	2483000	It doesn't have to.
2483000	2485000	I guess not. And I guess you don't have to do anything.
2485000	2488000	It doesn't also have to have party chat or anything like that.
2488000	2491000	Some people can motivate themselves without arbitrary goals.
2491000	2494000	But arbitrary goals can be fun, too.
2494000	2497000	If you give me donuts, I will take that.
2497000	2500000	Because it's not arbitrary. I can eat them and they're delicious.
2500000	2505000	And then some folks talking about the Red Ring of Death in chat.
2505000	2506000	Tigerclaw saying,
2506000	2509000	My first Xbox 360 Red Ringed during a session 1 versus 100.
2509000	2513000	Yes, another dark spot in Microsoft's history there with the 360
2513000	2517000	that cost them a lot of money when they had to extend that warranty.
2517000	2520000	I remember my Xbox Red Ringed within that first week.
2520000	2523000	You could probably still find that episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
2523000	2527000	I didn't end up getting my Xbox until, I think, February or March of 2006.
2527000	2529000	I feel like it was around Valentine's Day.
2529000	2532000	But I remember. And we talked about it on this show.
2532000	2535000	Yeah, I got my Xbox. I had to play it for three days before it Red Ringed on me.
2535000	2536000	I had to send it back.
2536000	2539000	I think our original never did, but we had another one that did.
2539000	2541000	It's just so interesting.
2541000	2544000	The second one I got never did. It's still down here.
2544000	2545000	That's, you know, God.
2545000	2548000	And I think about that thing is almost 10 years old then at this point.
2548000	2549000	It's crazy.
2549000	2550000	Anyhow.
2550000	2551000	All right.
2551000	2553000	We've talked at length about some kickoff topics.
2553000	2558000	I do want to get into our gaming week so we can get into the news tonight as well.
2558000	2560000	We always like to talk about what we've been playing
2560000	2563000	and where our head is at when it comes to video games
2563000	2564000	going into the show this week.
2564000	2566000	So let's talk about how was your gaming week?
2566000	2568000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
2568000	2570000	My gaming week was…
2570000	2572000	I'm still tangled over here.
2572000	2573000	You're right there.
2573000	2576000	No, it's the wires here are always tangled
2576000	2580000	because there's this one that always is intersecting mine right here
2580000	2582000	that needs to not intersect my wire.
2582000	2583000	Is it the guest mic?
2583000	2584000	Or is it my mic?
2584000	2585000	Yep, it's the guest mic.
2585000	2586000	It's the guest mic.
2586000	2587000	All right. We'll work on that.
2587000	2593000	Anyway, so what I've been playing is I played a little Final Fantasy XIV
2593000	2595000	but not for very long.
2596000	2599000	I've been playing a lot of Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer
2599000	2602000	because that game is super cute and super fun.
2607000	2610000	I also played Wrecka today as in the Super Famicom game.
2614000	2617000	Dan put in some Thunder Force IV which is pretty fun.
2618000	2620000	It's a combination of retro gaming
2620000	2623000	but we also put in The Guardian Legend this morning
2624000	2628000	because we got our EverDrives
2628000	2634000	and so we wanted to see if there was any kind of play difference
2636000	2641000	or any kind of difference on the intro screen for Gaiden.
2643000	2648000	So apparently we'd always seen no game by Compile and Irem.
2648000	2650000	Apparently Irem was the publisher for Compile
2650000	2653000	and it says that differently on the Japanese cartridge.
2653000	2655000	So that was pretty cool.
2658000	2660000	Really? That's about it.
2660000	2666000	Oh, and Dan was watching Pat the NES Punks marathon this weekend.
2666000	2667000	So that was pretty neat.
2667000	2669000	All right, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2669000	2675000	I played a whole shit ton of Ingress, so there's that.
2675000	2679000	I'm kind of embarrassed about the amount of time they spent on it this week.
2679000	2687000	But I did level up from 7 to 9 basically experience wise.
2687000	2693000	I think on Friday I actually got 1 million AP in one day.
2693000	2696000	So that was pretty massive.
2696000	2700000	And I kind of learned a little bit more strategy with that and everything.
2700000	2702000	So I'm enjoying it a little bit.
2702000	2704000	It's tiring.
2704000	2707000	God, I ate through so much data on my plan.
2707000	2708000	It's ridiculous.
2708000	2710000	In fact, I'm kind of scared to look at it right now
2710000	2714000	because just in one day I think I ate through about a quarter of my data,
2714000	2716000	which is ridiculous.
2716000	2720000	Aside from Ingress, I did manage to get some Fallout 4 time in,
2720000	2723000	so I have my settlements going
2723000	2726000	and I've just been kind of exploiting the game a little bit.
2726000	2731000	I played it a little bit last night and I'm still enjoying it.
2731000	2735000	It's very Skyrim-ish to me.
2735000	2737000	I'm not really into the Fallout series,
2737000	2740000	so I don't really know too much about the backstory and everything,
2740000	2744000	but I'm enjoying it, so looking forward to that a little bit more.
2744000	2746000	I'll probably play some more tonight actually.
2746000	2750000	And then I played a little bit of Minecraft,
2750000	2756000	the Windows 10 edition and Xbox 360 edition
2756000	2760000	because my son's been playing on my old game that I had done in Survival
2760000	2762000	and had a pretty nice map going there,
2762000	2766000	but he's really, really, really into that still.
2766000	2771000	And the Windows 10 one, I missed the update,
2771000	2774000	so I haven't gotten a chance to see they're updating it now.
2774000	2776000	We're going to talk about that a little bit later.
2776000	2778000	But there's a lot more stuff that they're adding
2778000	2780000	to kind of bring it up to speed with the PC version
2780000	2783000	because I've actually been thinking about going back to the PC version again
2783000	2785000	just for maybe single player play some of the mods
2785000	2788000	because my son watches, like I said, all those mod videos and stuff.
2788000	2790000	I'm like, hey, that looks kind of fun. I want to play that.
2790000	2792000	So I don't know.
2792000	2795000	Okay. Well, that's it for your gaming week.
2795000	2799000	Then my gaming week, not quite as active as my co-host
2799000	2801000	because, again, I was out of town for a few days.
2801000	2805000	I went to Wizard World, which I had a good time there
2805000	2809000	and some fun celebrity sightings and all that, some good panels,
2809000	2813000	but it actually didn't have anything to do with video games.
2813000	2818000	So except for the fact that I saw some cool video game stuff for sale,
2818000	2820000	I did end up getting a Tron shirt from one of the vendors
2820000	2823000	because, unfortunately, I'm starting to see less and less Tron stuff,
2823000	2826000	so I did get an actual, I think it's a fan, it's not an official shirt,
2826000	2830000	but still, it says Flynn's Arcade with a little disc on it,
2830000	2832000	so I was excited about that.
2832000	2835000	But as far as games, I've still been playing Final Fantasy XIV quite a bit
2835000	2838000	thanks to the new 3.1 patch.
2838000	2841000	I've been leveling a DPS class up to 60.
2841000	2844000	I've been working on Machinist because I already have the Astrologian,
2844000	2846000	who's my healer, it's kind of my main, already at 60,
2846000	2848000	but I want to be a little more versatile in what I can do
2848000	2852000	to help other friends of mine that play the game.
2852000	2855000	It's good to have more than one class, so I've been working on that.
2855000	2860000	Otherwise, the only really new thing I played this weekend,
2860000	2866000	they actually had the Overwatch beta open up to a lot more people,
2866000	2871000	and I was fortunate enough that I was able to check that out.
2871000	2874000	I didn't really play against real people
2874000	2878000	because everything I'm hearing online is that it's still kind of a toxic trash environment,
2878000	2880000	which is really unfortunate.
2880000	2882000	But I did play a little bit with bots,
2882000	2886000	and I've got to say, I do really enjoy the different characters
2886000	2888000	and how there's so much variety.
2888000	2890000	It's kind of fun to just go through the different characters
2890000	2892000	and see the types of moves that they have.
2892000	2894000	I really liked, I think her name was Mei.
2894000	2898000	She's the one that uses freeze things.
2898000	2903000	She can freeze people with a ray, she can drop a block of ice,
2903000	2906000	she can encase herself in ice and heal herself.
2906000	2909000	I kind of liked playing with her.
2909000	2912000	Yeah, I think there's a lot of great character design in that game.
2912000	2918000	I hope they can do something about removing some of the junk stuff that's online.
2918000	2923000	And I also really hope that there's some type of single-player mode in the game.
2923000	2925000	And in kind of thinking about it, I'm like,
2925000	2928000	you know, there probably won't really be a single-player mode.
2928000	2932000	And I've got to be honest, if all it is is multiplayer,
2932000	2934000	I don't know if I'll end up getting it.
2934000	2936000	I've got to be honest.
2937000	2941000	I mean, it would be cool to play with friends and other people from VoG
2941000	2944000	and people that I know aren't going to be dirtbags online.
2944000	2947000	But I don't know if I'm really interested in playing a game
2947000	2949000	with nothing but strangers all the time
2949000	2951000	and dropping that kind of money on the game.
2951000	2954000	So I really hope there's some type of single-player experience in Overwatch
2954000	2956000	or I might end up passing on it.
2956000	2958000	That's the one thing that kind of concerns me.
2958000	2960000	But I mean, the game does look really good
2960000	2962000	and I love the way it runs on my machine.
2962000	2964000	It's very smooth.
2964000	2966000	Pretty awesome.
2966000	2968000	ActDeftInChat says,
2968000	2971000	it can't be more toxic than Team Fortress 2, can it?
2971000	2975000	Well, it's a lot like Team Fortress 2.
2975000	2978000	The game itself is a lot like Team Fortress 2
2978000	2980000	but with just some very different characters.
2980000	2983000	So I don't know.
2983000	2984000	William Murderface says,
2984000	2987000	I bet Overwatch will have some sort of grouping system.
2987000	2991000	I hope they at least ask some type of question in the beginning.
2991000	2993000	Like, are you an asshole? Yes or no?
2993000	2995000	And then they put all the yes people by themselves.
2995000	2997000	Okay, well obviously a question like that won't work.
2997000	2999000	Well, you know what's funny?
2999000	3002000	On the 360, I remember this was a thing,
3002000	3004000	because we were talking about anniversaries, right?
3004000	3006000	The Xbox 360 and stuff they did online.
3006000	3008000	I remember when you would first sign up,
3008000	3011000	you would pick, like, which group do you want to be put in?
3011000	3012000	Yeah, I remember that.
3012000	3014000	And one of them was, like, family-friendly.
3014000	3016000	One of them was hardcore,
3016000	3019000	which we all knew was where the dirtbags would go.
3019000	3021000	And then there was another one that was kind of, like, casual or something.
3021000	3022000	I don't know.
3022000	3024000	But they have, like, their four different...
3024000	3027000	I don't know if that ever really was utilized.
3027000	3029000	Oh, fuck no.
3029000	3032000	Yeah, I kind of feel like that really did nothing.
3032000	3035000	So I wonder if maybe that wouldn't be a bad idea
3035000	3037000	worth approaching in Overwatch.
3037000	3040000	But I guess if they have maybe, like, ranked mode versus casual
3040000	3042000	or, you know, for fun or something,
3042000	3044000	maybe they'll help separate that out a bit.
3044000	3046000	But I don't know.
3046000	3047000	I mean, I remember doing that.
3047000	3052000	Of course I was in hardcore because, jeez, there's no more hardcore than me.
3052000	3055000	And I just want to make sure I make this clear
3055000	3058000	because I can already see this email coming in about,
3058000	3066000	well, you know, why do you razz Overwatch for having all this online communication
3066000	3069000	but then say Splatoon sucks because it doesn't have it?
3069000	3074000	The main difference is that when I want to be able to talk to friends,
3074000	3077000	like, if friends and I are playing, that's a nice thing to have.
3077000	3080000	We kind of work around it on the Wii U by using Skype.
3080000	3083000	I did play Splatoon. I don't remember if that was last week.
3083000	3086000	Maybe it was, like, Monday or something, so I forgot to mention it just now.
3086000	3088000	But I was playing a little Splatoon online,
3088000	3090000	and we were using Skype to communicate on that.
3090000	3093000	But it would be nice if that could just be done natively through the Wii U
3093000	3095000	for when I'm playing with friends.
3095000	3099000	I did notice Overwatch seems to have a built-in voice chat,
3099000	3102000	which I don't think you get online when you play with strangers,
3102000	3104000	and let's all be thankful for that.
3104000	3106000	But it is an option when you're playing with friends,
3106000	3110000	so that's kind of cool that that's embedded like a console version of the game would be.
3113000	3117000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with vognetwork.com,
3117000	3119000	use the passphrase TEETH.
3120000	3121000	Let's see.
3121000	3124000	Alan Alchemy in chat says that's a horrible comparison
3124000	3127000	because Overwatch right now is on the PC platform,
3127000	3130000	which allows layering background third-party apps.
3130000	3133000	Splatoon is what you see is what you get.
3133000	3135000	I'm not really trying to compare the two games,
3135000	3137000	but I can just kind of see that coming,
3137000	3140000	like, why are you saying this on this game and this on this game?
3140000	3142000	I just want to make that clear what the difference is.
3142000	3144000	All right, so that's it for my game week.
3144000	3146000	Getting into housekeeping tonight.
3146000	3150000	There is sadly going to be no OLR this next Sunday
3150000	3152000	due to the holiday weekend,
3152000	3154000	and I know Dark Soccer is doing something else.
3154000	3156000	I feel like you said you were doing something else, Loki, but even if you're not,
3156000	3157000	well, oh well.
3157000	3158000	You're ingressing.
3158000	3161000	But many of our listeners will be out doing other stuff, too,
3161000	3164000	so with the Thanksgiving holiday this weekend,
3164000	3166000	we will not be doing a show on Sunday.
3166000	3167000	We could go do that.
3167000	3168000	What?
3168000	3169000	Ingressing.
3169000	3170000	We'll see.
3170000	3172000	I don't know if I'm going to end up out of town or not.
3172000	3173000	That's the other thing.
3173000	3174000	I'm kind of on the fence on if I'll be out of town or not.
3174000	3175000	All right, we'll see.
3175000	3177000	So we'll play up here.
3177000	3180000	So there's that next Sunday,
3180000	3183000	and we're still going to try to make it work,
3183000	3185000	but I do want to remind everybody,
3185000	3189000	GamerX is coming up, or GX as they're calling it this year,
3189000	3191000	and VOG Network will be there,
3191000	3194000	although I just found out we're not going to have electricity at our table
3194000	3196000	because we have to pay for that,
3196000	3197000	and it's going to be too much money,
3197000	3199000	so I have to figure out what we're going to do.
3199000	3201000	It's a standby, but Dark Soccer and I were talking before the show.
3201000	3203000	We think we have some good ideas,
3203000	3208000	but we will be there having a good time with the people and the event itself.
3208000	3210000	There's going to be a lot of great panels.
3210000	3213000	I know there will be some good cosplay and some fun things to see,
3213000	3215000	so we will be at GX in San Jose,
3215000	3218000	and that's going to be the weekend of the 11th, 12th, and 13th,
3218000	3221000	which means we may not have a show the 13th.
3221000	3224000	We may have a short show because the only problem is
3224000	3226000	if we don't do a show the 13th,
3226000	3229000	we're going to have no show this Sunday, show, no show again,
3229000	3233000	and especially with me having been sick a couple weeks ago,
3233000	3235000	I really don't like missing that many shows.
3235000	3237000	I know y'all are understanding and so forth,
3237000	3240000	but I don't want to fall out of your rotation on your podcast app
3240000	3241000	or however you listen to this show,
3241000	3244000	so I do want to try and maybe get a short show,
3244000	3246000	maybe right as we get back from GX,
3246000	3249000	because I feel like we did that last year, didn't we, Dark Sakura?
3249000	3251000	We came back, and didn't we start a show at 7 o'clock?
3251000	3252000	Yeah, I thought we did.
3252000	3254000	I feel like we did something like that, so we may do that again.
3254000	3257000	So, Loki can go ingress for an hour and then come to the show.
3257000	3262000	I'd be playing more Fallout if my wife would get off the TV.
3262000	3263000	I mean, honestly.
3263000	3264000	Maybe that'll happen.
3264000	3269000	Okay, seriously, if she watches TV,
3269000	3272000	I have to figure out whatever the hell I'm going to do to entertain myself.
3272000	3277000	If I want to use the TV, I have to find things to entertain her with.
3277000	3281000	Like, I have to have a book for her or something, which is fucked up.
3281000	3283000	Vidpower in chat says,
3283000	3285000	Oh, hey, Jennifer Hale will be at GamerX.
3285000	3287000	Yes, that's true, Jennifer Hale will be there.
3287000	3288000	Dark Sakura.
3288000	3290000	I'm going to follow her around like a lost puppy.
3290000	3291000	I can't imagine.
3291000	3293000	Dark Sakura will meet Jennifer Hale in a couple weeks,
3293000	3294000	and that's going to be an amazing meeting.
3294000	3295000	Yes, that'll be great.
3295000	3296000	Very excited for her.
3296000	3300000	And there's going to be a lot of interesting, diverse people there.
3300000	3305000	So, I'm a little sad that the Ellen McClain, John Patrick Lowry thing
3305000	3308000	didn't end up panning out because I think they ended up having a conflict.
3308000	3311000	I'm a little sad about that, but I understand these things happen.
3311000	3313000	Some celebs always have to cancel the con.
3313000	3315000	It's not anybody's fault. It just happens.
3315000	3317000	Same thing happened last year, too.
3317000	3318000	I know, right?
3318000	3319000	That's kind of unfortunate.
3319000	3323000	But there'll be a lot of other fun guests there, so I'm excited to do that.
3323000	3324000	And you know what?
3324000	3325000	Dark Sakura and I will be there.
3325000	3326000	And hopefully you guys will be there.
3326000	3329000	Some of you out there, at least in the area, will be there as well.
3329000	3330000	And we're going to have a good time.
3330000	3331000	We'll play some Jenga.
3331000	3332000	Sounds good?
3332000	3335000	Bobby says don't break the ice.
3335000	3336000	Don't break the ice.
3336000	3338000	Bobby says that LuckyWish is falling forward on the Wii U
3338000	3339000	so he can play it on the GamePad.
3339000	3342000	Yes, I actually do wish that I could play it on the GamePad.
3342000	3348000	But oddly enough, I actually have the components to build a GamePad-type device
3348000	3350000	for other systems.
3350000	3353000	I actually had planned on doing it at one time and purchased everything.
3353000	3357000	Just never got around to making it because I would have had to 3D print a case
3357000	3358000	and I don't have that.
3358000	3361000	But I might be able to work something with duct tape.
3361000	3363000	All right.
3363000	3365000	Let's get into some gaming news.
3365000	3367000	We're only, what, an hour into the show?
3367000	3368000	I haven't touched a bit.
3368000	3369000	Well, maybe a little news.
3369000	3371000	But we're going to get into the bulk of our gaming news tonight right now.
3371000	3372000	Loki.
3372000	3376000	So hey, Sony has actually confirmed that they're going to be working on
3376000	3379000	utilizing PlayStation 2 and emulation.
3379000	3383000	So they're trying to get that technology to work on the PlayStation 4
3383000	3388000	to be able to bring PlayStation 2 games to the current generation consoles.
3388000	3391000	And of course, they have nothing further to say at this time.
3391000	3400000	I still don't understand how it's not possible that the system can't emulate PlayStation 2 games
3400000	3404000	because, hell, a PC can emulate PlayStation 2 games.
3404000	3407000	And I'm not even talking about a really powerful PC.
3408000	3411000	A PlayStation 3 can emulate PlayStation 2 games.
3411000	3416000	And I'm not talking about the ones with the backwards compatibility.
3418000	3421000	So I would assume that a PlayStation 4 can do that.
3421000	3425000	Hell, let's not even worry about PlayStation 2 games right now.
3425000	3426000	PlayStation 1 games.
3426000	3429000	A fucking PSP can run PlayStation 1 games.
3429000	3433000	Why is that not a thing already on PlayStation 4?
3433000	3435000	To be fair, and I'm sure somebody's yelling that back at us
3435000	3439000	as they listen to this show, wasn't there the whole major chipset change
3439000	3441000	that came between the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation 4,
3441000	3443000	that they changed that type of graphics chip?
3443000	3445000	I understand that, but it's a PlayStation 1.
3445000	3449000	My old phone could emulate a PlayStation 1 game.
3449000	3452000	I kind of feel like, okay, and that was kind of a question I have,
3452000	3456000	is that, okay, if they're going to get the PlayStation 2 games playable,
3456000	3459000	then PlayStation 1 would just be a given with that, right?
3459000	3463000	Because didn't the PlayStation 2 just natively play the PS1?
3464000	3467000	And it wasn't even like when the 3s were first out,
3467000	3470000	because the PlayStation 3s had a 2 in them, basically.
3470000	3472000	They were like 3s and 2s in the same box.
3472000	3473000	That's how the emulation worked.
3473000	3476000	I think they still have the chipset from the 1 in there as well, but...
3476000	3478000	Yeah, because the 3s played the 1 game. I don't know.
3478000	3479000	So I feel like...
3479000	3481000	They had the chipset there at one time,
3481000	3483000	and then they went and software emulated everything,
3483000	3485000	because on the PSP you could do it.
3485000	3486000	But that's my thing.
3486000	3488000	The PSP can run it.
3488000	3490000	The PlayStation 4 can definitely run it.
3490000	3494000	You can't tell me there's something that the PSP can run that the PlayStation 4 can't run.
3495000	3497000	I'm assuming it must be compatibility stuff,
3497000	3500000	because at this point, since the hardware's not in there,
3500000	3502000	they're having to turn to software emulation.
3502000	3504000	You're right, you can do it through software on the PC,
3504000	3507000	but if they're going to be selling these games at whatever price,
3507000	3509000	they've got to be able to do it.
3509000	3510000	You know what?
3510000	3511000	You know what? I'd love to see, actually,
3511000	3513000	because we're getting into that whole Windows 10 thing
3513000	3515000	where you can use a lot of the Windows 10 apps and stuff,
3515000	3519000	cross and play with Xbox One and stuff like that.
3520000	3524000	I would love to see a bleem situation where you're having, you know,
3524000	3526000	someone can easily build an emulator, hide it somewhere,
3526000	3530000	and just, oh hey, they can play PlayStation 1 games on your Xbox One.
3530000	3532000	Who knows?
3534000	3536000	One other thing I kind of want to ask with this whole thing, too,
3536000	3539000	is I'm curious to see if they're going to allow it
3539000	3544000	where you can put the PlayStation 2 disc in the PlayStation 4,
3544000	3545000	and it'll work.
3545000	3548000	Because now they're getting a little bit,
3548000	3551000	this is where the competition is a healthy thing,
3551000	3555000	because Microsoft is now really needling PlayStation.
3555000	3558000	I think in their latest ad, at least the one out of the UK,
3558000	3563000	they even did a riff on, you remember that PlayStation 4 video
3563000	3566000	that they showed at E3 that had everybody screaming
3566000	3571000	when they said, look how easy it is to play used games on your PlayStation 4.
3571000	3575000	And it was like one of the executives handing the game to another one.
3575000	3577000	How to play your friends' games or something.
3578000	3580000	And they kind of smiled, and it's just that easy.
3580000	3583000	I remember they showed that at E3 and everybody was just screaming laughing
3583000	3586000	because it was such an amazing shade throw at Microsoft.
3586000	3591000	Well, I want to say, Microsoft UK released some video this week
3591000	3595000	that was a parody of that, but it was backwards compatibility,
3595000	3600000	and they even say in it, you don't have to rebuy your old games.
3600000	3603000	You own them. They're yours. That's stupid.
3603000	3606000	I feel like they even said language that was kind of like,
3606000	3608000	you shouldn't have to buy your games again.
3608000	3612000	So they're kind of putting baby in a corner here with PlayStation 2.
3612000	3616000	And I 100% agree, you shouldn't have to rebuy your games.
3616000	3622000	I think it is stupid, Nintendo, that you have to buy those virtual console games again.
3622000	3626000	And that they're tied to a console, which I don't have anymore because it broke.
3626000	3629000	So maybe, question mark, that's the slow down,
3629000	3633000	is that what they're trying to do is instead of being able to offer
3633000	3637000	select titles for download on the PlayStation 4,
3637000	3642000	they're going to open it up so all of them work on the PlayStation 4.
3642000	3647000	Because then the shade throw, now what they can do
3647000	3650000	is they can throw shade right back at Microsoft and be all,
3650000	3653000	and it's not just some PlayStation 2 games.
3653000	3658000	It's not just 104 games. It's all the games.
3658000	3660000	Well, that's cool that they can say that.
3660000	3663000	It's all the games except for the PlayStation 3 games,
3663000	3666000	which you don't play on this because if we're comparing generations,
3666000	3667000	it's totally different.
3667000	3671000	And that's fair and that is still something I think all of us want to see.
3671000	3674000	But it's a start. It's better than where we're at now.
3674000	3677000	I just want something. I mean, it would be nice to have this
3677000	3679000	because I did buy some PlayStation 1 games,
3679000	3682000	and I just don't feel like hooking up my PlayStation 3 to play them.
3682000	3688000	And I think there's just so much worth revisiting classic shit
3688000	3689000	that so many people didn't play.
3689000	3691000	I want them to play Import.
3691000	3693000	Yeah, that would be great too.
3693000	3696000	Then I don't have to dig out my JPS 2.
3696000	3698000	Well, and then there's things out there now like VibRibbon
3698000	3702000	that they finally officially released in the U.S., even if digitally.
3702000	3705000	But that would be cool that you could play that on the PlayStation 4.
3705000	3709000	Didn't they say when they released that at E3 or whenever that was
3709000	3712000	that they actually said we're working on the PlayStation 4 stuff?
3712000	3715000	How long has it been? It's been a little while now.
3715000	3719000	Well, I think it would make sense that I have Norwegian Lock
3719000	3722000	because that's how they were with PS1 games on Xbox.
3722000	3725000	Not Xbox, what I'm saying. On PS3.
3725000	3729000	My assumption is this is imminent with the PlayStation experience.
3729000	3732000	The PlayStation experience is in two weeks.
3732000	3735000	It's the week before GamerX in San Francisco.
3735000	3737000	Maybe they have nothing to announce right now
3737000	3739000	because they're going to announce it in two weeks.
3739000	3744000	I kind of feel like if you don't hear it out of that,
3744000	3746000	then I don't know what they're planning to do with this,
3746000	3749000	but I really feel like this is coming out of PlayStation experience.
3749000	3753000	And just, again, to tinfoil hat this a little bit,
3753000	3756000	didn't they say a long time ago,
3756000	3759000	we want to enhance the PlayStation games on PlayStation 4,
3759000	3762000	meaning we want trophies.
3762000	3766000	We want basically more support of those games.
3766000	3769000	So, I mean, if they come out with that at PlayStation experience
3769000	3772000	and say not only can you emulate the PlayStation 2 games,
3772000	3775000	but they have more than they had before,
3775000	3780000	that's going to be a really, I think, cool addition to the PlayStation 4
3780000	3783000	that's going to have a lot of people perking up a little bit.
3783000	3784000	Even if they don't have the three games.
3784000	3786000	I mean, yes, I want to see the three games as well.
3786000	3788000	You do. We all want to see the three games.
3788000	3793000	But, I mean, there's still a lot of places where you can get PS1 and PS2 games.
3793000	3795000	Go to any garage sale or flea market.
3795000	3798000	There's a ton of them out there, so we'll see what'll happen.
3798000	3800000	All right.
3800000	3803000	Anyhow, let's move on with some more news,
3803000	3806000	and I want to talk a little bit about the Xbox One in all this.
3806000	3809000	And the Xbox One getting a feature that was on the PlayStation 4,
3809000	3814000	and that is now you can remap buttons on the Xbox One controller.
3814000	3818000	It's not quite the same as it is on the Elite controller,
3818000	3821000	but it's a lot more than what was there before.
3821000	3825000	So now there's a centralized way through the Xbox Accessories app
3825000	3828000	that launched as part of the whole UI overhaul
3828000	3831000	where you can actually swap buttons.
3831000	3833000	So you can have one button do the function of another.
3833000	3836000	So X can do what LB did and so forth.
3836000	3840000	However, you cannot remove button functions entirely
3840000	3843000	or allow multiple buttons to one function.
3843000	3846000	That is still on the Elite controller.
3846000	3853000	But still, it's a pretty big step for people that need that button remapping in their games.
3853000	3857000	So that is now available on the Xbox One where it was not before.
3858000	3861000	Even though it wasn't a part of this story,
3861000	3864000	we were talking a little bit with our pal Bobby Blackwolf
3864000	3866000	before we went live with our show tonight
3866000	3869000	about some of the accessibility changes and so on.
3869000	3874000	And something else that came out with this was more narration on Xbox One
3874000	3879000	where it now is reading more to you about basically what's going on.
3879000	3882000	Not that it's going to read for you what's going on in the game,
3882000	3886000	but it's telling you a little bit more about what buttons are being pressed and so forth.
3886000	3893000	And funny enough, we were wondering if one of our blind listeners was listening
3893000	3895000	because he's called into this show before, Sturlock,
3895000	3897000	and he's talked about that experience and so forth
3897000	3903000	so that additional narration would kind of enhance that, I would assume.
3903000	3905000	And Bobby did let me know in private message.
3905000	3909000	He did hear back from Sturlock after he ended his show who said,
3909000	3913000	It's pretty amazing. It's leaps and bounds ahead of what Sony has at the moment.
3913000	3916000	You can actually do most things, even buying games.
3916000	3919000	PlayStation 4 is still extremely limited.
3919000	3922000	So that's really rad for accessibility
3922000	3925000	and allowing more people to be able to enjoy video games.
3925000	3929000	So good move on Microsoft's part.
3929000	3932000	All right, let's move on. Darcyra.
3932000	3937000	Well, we have had a lot of discussion about YouTube
3937000	3942000	and how, well, really the discussion has been more complaining,
3942000	3946000	which is very us to complain on this show.
3946000	3949000	You know what? Yes. Yes, we do.
3949000	3955000	So they have finally listened or at least responded to the complaints
3955000	3961000	about various fair use videos being taken down.
3961000	3964000	And so they released this statement.
3964000	3968000	YouTube receives a lot of takedown requests under copyright law
3968000	3971000	asking us to remove videos, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3971000	3975000	Sometimes those request target videos that are clear examples of fair use,
3975000	3977000	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
3977000	3985000	So they are really working on trying to analyze if they are legitimate or not
3985000	3991000	by continuing to say that they've set up an initiative.
3991000	3993000	And I'm going to continue.
3993000	3997000	YouTube indemnifies creators whose fair use videos have been subject
3997000	4001000	to takedown notices for up to one million of legal costs
4001000	4005000	in the event that takedown results in a lawsuit for copyright infringement.
4005000	4009000	This ensures those creators have a chance to protect their work
4009000	4013000	and makes the entire creative world better by educating people
4013000	4018000	on both the importance and limits of fair use doctrine.
4018000	4025000	However, this is only available to some people and not all people.
4025000	4031000	I guess maybe they're taking their biggest, most high-profile users
4031000	4034000	and offering them this kind of protection.
4034000	4040000	So this would prevent the takedown requests from going through.
4040000	4045000	And if they are sued, then YouTube's going to cover the legal costs.
4045000	4047000	That's great.
4047000	4050000	And that's one thing I've bitched about for the longest time on this show
4050000	4057000	is where is the fucking accountability of the people filing these copyright takedowns wrongfully?
4057000	4062000	And why does YouTube not side with the people that are basically giving them the money,
4062000	4064000	which is their content creators?
4064000	4067000	Finally, we're seeing that happen, at least in some capacity.
4067000	4069000	And I'm willing to give YouTube the benefit of the doubt
4069000	4073000	that they need to test this with a small group before they open it up to more people.
4073000	4078000	And I would imagine, especially what they're offering to do there with legal coverage and so forth,
4078000	4082000	you may have to meet a certain threshold of subscribers to qualify for it and so forth, which is fine.
4082000	4087000	But I'm so glad that they're putting this accountability in there for the people issuing the takedowns.
4087000	4096000	On the page about the details for this, they give examples of what fair use are using user-created video content.
4096000	4099000	It's only US videos for right now.
4099000	4109000	And overall, really, the hope with this, I think, is that by showing an example of how fair use is,
4109000	4118000	and giving an alternative, that this could spread and give copyright holders a little bit more of an idea of how they should be acting.
4118000	4123000	And also, this relates to gaming, certainly for Let's Play and so forth.
4123000	4130000	But I believe one of the people that YouTube is backing right now is, and god, I forget his name at the moment,
4130000	4132000	but he's a huge commenter on...
4132000	4133000	Jim Sterling.
4133000	4139000	That's it. And he actually had the bits and pieces of Metal Gear.
4139000	4144000	Wasn't it like a read on Konami and then Konami pulled the video?
4144000	4149000	No. Well, I mean, that was, you're thinking of Angry Joe, then he had...
4149000	4151000	Oh, I got my wires crossed.
4151000	4155000	I remember the Metal Gear one where he was talking about Kojima and stuff, and they had pulled down a video.
4155000	4160000	Or no, it wasn't him, actually. There was some other dude that did that. I'm sorry, I can't remember who now.
4160000	4165000	There was somebody that was talking about the whole thing, and then they got their video pulled, and then they got reinstated by YouTube.
4165000	4170000	Jim Sterling had some other ones. He normally gets stuff, because he does his best of Steam Greenlight trailers,
4170000	4178000	and he'll make fun of terrible-looking games, and he gets some of these small indie developers that'll pull that on him.
4178000	4180000	Even the way he's doing his fair use, they just don't like it.
4180000	4188000	He did a video on his thoughts on that. Of course, I haven't watched it yet, but I will link it in the chatroom to watch during the break.
4188000	4191000	I did, because I follow him and I watch that stuff.
4191000	4197000	He basically talked about that process that he was actually contacted by YouTube about this,
4197000	4203000	and they kind of went through and how that's going to work with these different types of videos, and they're using that point.
4203000	4206000	Well, he sure raised a fuss when it happened, as he should.
4207000	4210000	I've also raised a fuss, but I don't have the YouTube following he does.
4210000	4216000	He's had several small studios do that to him, too. They'll pull a copyright strike and threaten him,
4216000	4220000	and make all these threats against him and his family, and stuff like that.
4220000	4229000	It's ridiculous, because if you don't like it, it's criticism, and he's a critic, and too fucking bad.
4229000	4235000	So, good. I'm glad to see YouTube is taking steps in that direction. Hooray.
4235000	4242000	So, that makes me feel a lot better. It's not 100% better, but it's a huge step in the right direction, that's for sure.
4242000	4246000	I'm excited to see how that plays out. Let's move on. Logie.
4246000	4254000	Alright. So, along with that, this is kind of another company that I haven't really bought from them before,
4254000	4258000	but I'm aware of them, and the company is called Green Man Gaming.
4258000	4263000	It's one of the Steam outlets that you can purchase Steam keys from. There's a lot of different ones out there.
4263000	4272000	But, I guess they've been running into a problem with different publishers saying that they're not an authorized reseller for their keys.
4272000	4280000	So, for example, Witcher 3, the Wild Hunt, when it was coming out, apparently some of the keys, they weren't acquiring them legitimately,
4280000	4289000	and some were not guaranteed to work. Also, with different new releases like Call of Duty, Black Ops 3, or South of the Screed Syndicate,
4289000	4298000	both Activision and Ubisoft have contacted them and said that they are a non-authorized reseller,
4298000	4306000	and some of the DLC that was supposed to be with those games weren't included with it, because they were getting them through some other means.
4307000	4320000	And, apparently, Activision and Ubisoft, they're saying that they're not authorized to sell EA, Bethesda, Warner Brothers, and Devolver Digital and ArenaNet games.
4320000	4326000	So, I don't know. It's interesting. I guess just be careful who you buy from.
4326000	4331000	But, I thought they were pretty legit. I mean, I know they do sales and everything.
4332000	4338000	I still think it's a good thing that the Steam Marketplace does have multiple locations that you can buy things from,
4338000	4346000	so there's a little bit of competition there, as opposed to some of the other companies out there, or even the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace.
4346000	4350000	Some comments from Chad on this over at live.vognetwork.com. William Murderface says,
4350000	4356000	There's been murmurs about them since word leaked that there were Witcher 3 keys may have been unauthorized.
4356000	4361000	And Bobby Blackwell says, These are the guys buying Humble Bundles for a dollar and reselling the keys.
4361000	4366000	Which is, obviously, extremely tacky behavior.
4366000	4375000	I don't remember them exactly being that part of that, but if they are doing that, that's not a good thing to be a part of.
4375000	4384000	No. Absolutely not. I should say allegedly. I don't know where the story is to back that up, but Bobby doesn't usually throw stuff out there.
4384000	4389000	I know there's other sites that did that, but yeah, I don't remember them doing that specifically.
4389000	4397000	Let's see, Dungeon Buster adding to the Witcher 3 thing says, CD Projekt essentially came out and said they didn't get the keys from them,
4397000	4402000	so I have no idea where they came from because it was a launch title for their GOG Galaxy.
4402000	4409000	Well, and the other thing too about their keys, too, is some of them were for other regions, too, so they were sending the SO.
4409000	4413000	Who knows where they're getting them? Yeah. Somewhere.
4413000	4421000	And I've heard of that, too, where some websites will sell Russian keys for games and they sell them way cheaper because...
4421000	4425000	Piracy is an issue or something. Yeah. Unfortunately.
4425000	4432000	Alright, well, let's move on. Let's talk about Dark Souls 3. I know people are looking forward to that game.
4432000	4442000	That's a series that's been going on for a while, but the director of the game, Hidetaki Miyazaki, says he doesn't expect that he'll be continuing to make these Dark Souls games.
4442000	4449000	In an interview with GameSpot, he says that Dark Souls 3 will be the last in the series, or at least that's what he considers.
4449000	4455000	In the quote, quote, I don't think it'd be the right choice to continue indefinitely creating Souls and Bloodborne games.
4455000	4465000	I'm considering Dark Souls 3 to be the big closure on the series. That's not just limited to me, but FromSoftware and myself together want to aggressively make new things in the future.
4465000	4474000	I believe that FromSoftware has to create new things. There will be new types of games coming from us, and Dark Souls 3 is an important marker in the evolution of FromSoftware.
4474000	4482000	Can one of those be another ChromeHounds game? I don't think they made ChromeHounds, but maybe they did. I don't remember who made that. I know it was published by Sega.
4482000	4489000	But I know they do Armored Core, and I love Armored Core, although I haven't bought the last few games from them. But I'd love a new Armored Core game. We can make it super hard, too.
4490000	4502000	It's a tricky situation, because I'm one of those people that's like, yeah, I want Bioware to make Mass Effect games forever, or at least as long as they're still good.
4502000	4503000	And Dragon Age.
4503000	4514000	When they start being bad. But I also can kind of respect when he's like, I don't want to do these games forever, and maybe there's a point where I want to end the story, or what have you.
4514000	4520000	I sort of think maybe just because he doesn't want to do it doesn't mean somebody else will pick up the rights.
4520000	4530000	You know, like maybe, who knows, throwing crazy talk out there, like maybe Sony picks up the rights and has one of their in-house people do it or something.
4530000	4535000	You know, it doesn't mean these games will stop forever, but I can understand why he doesn't want to be involved with it anymore.
4535000	4538000	So, maybe Konami will pick up the rights and make a pachinko machine out of it.
4538000	4540000	Who knows? Anything is possible.
4542000	4546000	And Bobby Blackwolf is confirming FromSoftware developed ChromeHounds.
4546000	4549000	Alright, I just couldn't remember. But yes, new ChromeHounds game.
4549000	4555000	And Dungeon Buster says, if Dark Souls 3 is the last one, I'm okay with that. Love the series, but I'd love to see what else they can do.
4555000	4560000	Yeah, and I think there's a lot of people that are kind of, I think it would be okay to give the series a break.
4560000	4567000	Go work on something else for a little while and then maybe revisit Dark Souls on the Playstation 5 or something, if you want.
4567000	4571000	You know, if the fans are really clamoring for that or what have you.
4571000	4578000	Alright, and William Murderface says, can we get a PC port of Bloodborne, please, and an Xbox One port too?
4578000	4584000	I think there was some type of deal though with Sony on that, because Sony has been putting their promotion dollars in it.
4585000	4590000	So, I don't know. Maybe it's a timed window thing, kind of like Rise of the Tomb Raider, but we'll see.
4590000	4594000	Alright, moving on. Dark Sakura, before we get to release dates.
4594000	4599000	Well, this is an interesting one, although it's kind of a big duh as well.
4599000	4607000	But there is research. They analyzed 500,000 data points for League of Legends players.
4608000	4616000	That the usernames are reflective of the type of behavior that people show in game.
4616000	4626000	Meaning that usually players who are a bit more profane or antisocial also have usernames that reflect those same type of traits.
4626000	4639000	Whereas, you know, people who are kinder and more positive, those who are team builders or leaders, usually have the names that reflect positive traits.
4639000	4653000	Kind of a big duh, but at the same time it's just, it's leaning, it's giving an idea of more what to look for, ways to kind of, you know, play safely online.
4654000	4664000	And they are actually now looking into using these data sets that they've gathered as methods for studying human psychology.
4664000	4672000	Ways to find people with clinical disorders who are playing games and whatnot. So, pretty interesting.
4672000	4677000	The whole study's been published online. Put out by, looks like the University of York.
4678000	4689000	So, I mean, even though you kind of say it's a duh, it is kind of an interesting stopping and thinking point about, you know, what is that username that you put out there maybe say about you.
4689000	4692000	And we'll get into this a little bit later with the FUGU Question of the Week and so forth.
4692000	4705000	But I guess it's probably not a big surprise to hear that if somebody has a big name that's like the mixed caps, that's like, you know, Sephiroth misspelled 666.
4705000	4712000	That person's, maybe, maybe they'll be cool. Actually, we used to have a listener that was like Sephiroth something with numbers. He was cool.
4712000	4718000	But like, usually there's a lot of guys that use those names and like, you know, devil.
4718000	4722000	They're also using those to determine age as well.
4722000	4723000	Yeah, yeah.
4723000	4727000	Because some of those have to, are more having to do with age and maturity level.
4727000	4735000	But my thought is people that have those names with the mixed case and the punctuation and all that and the leet speak, those are usually the ones that are dirt bags in chat.
4735000	4744000	Whereas, you know, if you have somebody that's like cat loving grandma 123, probably not the person that's going to be as aggressive. You know what I mean?
4744000	4751000	I mean, I realize some people are always going to be ironic and there's that. That doesn't always work 100% of the time and I wouldn't want to make assumptions.
4751000	4760000	But I can certainly see where, okay, a good majority of the time, what you kind of put out there is going to be reflective of that a little bit.
4760000	4765000	But it kind of makes me stop and think about, I wonder what my username says about me.
4765000	4771000	Like when somebody goes into a match and sees my name, like what they must think about me.
4771000	4777000	You guys kind of wonder that maybe like, what do you think your username says about you?
4777000	4779000	He misspelled ski.
4779000	4785000	Probably on Twitter and stuff. Or yeah, a lot of people say that. Which is, it's actually funny.
4785000	4786000	It's very lighthearted name.
4786000	4795000	It's funny you bring that up. Where that comes from, and I haven't told this in a long time on the show, is that I had the name Green Sky years and years and years ago.
4795000	4803000	And the whole point behind that was, if the sky was green, which I love green, if the sky was green, that would be different but cool.
4803000	4805000	And that's me. I'm different but I'm cool.
4805000	4812000	Like that was, I don't know, everybody has a weird story behind their name, but in my mind that's where I got the name from.
4812000	4817000	But then I found out, that name apparently is really popular. And so it's taken on a lot of sites.
4817000	4823000	So a lot of places I have green s-k-i-e, because I would spell it wrong so I could actually get the name.
4823000	4826000	That's where my gamer tag comes from and all that, right?
4826000	4832000	But then at one point I was just like, it's a long name and I don't have to be green. So I was just Sky.
4832000	4839000	But now, honestly, I'm kind of like, I actually kind of want to change. I don't think I really want that name anymore.
4839000	4843000	I'm always like, I'm Rob Roberts, but I'm Sky.
4843000	4847000	Rob Roberts is my online identity at this point.
4847000	4854000	So I would like to change my Twitter, if I could, to Rob Roberts, but a spam account has it.
4854000	4856000	So I can't change it.
4856000	4859000	I can't change mine to Jamie Summers because it's a porn star.
4859000	4861000	You could.
4861000	4866000	Well, and then there's a part of me that's like, should you let go of a four character Twitter name?
4866000	4867000	Nope.
4867000	4872000	That's some rare real estate. And there's a part of me that's like, maybe I shouldn't actually let go of a four character Twitter name.
4872000	4874000	I got hate because someone else wanted Dark Sakura.
4874000	4875000	Oh, too bad, so sad.
4875000	4878000	Oh, well, there's places that have taken that one as well.
4878000	4882000	So I use my fallback, which is Kuro Tsubasa.
4882000	4889000	And I have a Gmail name all the time. I'm getting stuff that is not for me.
4889000	4895000	Like, and just like, and I get a lot because it's one of those things where it's like a very simple name.
4895000	4897000	And I know Bobby has talked about this on his show, too.
4897000	4902000	I'm bringing Bobby up a lot tonight. I should have just had him on Skype as a host tonight.
4902000	4907000	But Bobby, I know he gets that a lot with his name, too, because he's Black Wolf.
4907000	4911000	And I think a lot of people, you know, that's a very, you know, it's kind of like Green Sky.
4911000	4917000	It's a color object. It's kind of like a very, a thing that people want to grab.
4917000	4919000	So it's interesting to me.
4919000	4923000	Loki, what do you think your name might say about you when you play online?
4923000	4925000	I don't know.
4925000	4930000	Doesn't say much about me until I play with somebody and they're like, I hate that guy.
4930000	4935000	They probably think of the Thor movies.
4935000	4939000	Yeah, probably. It wasn't from that, though. It was from The Mask, because I was a big Jim Carrey fan.
4939000	4944000	But I like Loki from the Thor movies as well.
4944000	4951000	But you know what's funny is that when I play other stuff, like Ingress, I have a very not-so-serious name that I use in Ingress.
4951000	4956000	And it's one of those things where it's because I just think, I just think it's funny.
4956000	4961000	And it's one of those things where video games aren't serious and it's just a video game.
4961000	4968000	And so, you know, when it says my name is blowing up your portal, I just want people to kind of chuckle because it's not fucking serious, you know what I mean?
4968000	4980000	Yes, and then there's people like, also real player in the area, Phillip gets them wet, that, you know, that is a legit player that happens to be on our side.
4980000	4982000	Woo!
4982000	4992000	Yeah, there's a lot of people that use the names like 6ix9ine and 666 and, you know, all that stuff. Whatever. It's a video game. It's not that serious.
4992000	4997000	Let's see, going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
4997000	5005000	Dungeonbuster says, I love the really creative ones. One of the neatest ones I've seen for a cleric was Blessedabon.
5005000	5020000	I do love a good, funny name. And I, you know, not to toot my own horn, but when I was playing World of Warcraft, I played a monk, a Tauren monk in the Pandaria. I played a Tauren monk named Calmane. And I, you know, usually got a chuckle out of that.
5020000	5025000	I loved making fun names like that. Remember I had Rebecca Black?
5025000	5026000	I do, I do.
5026000	5030000	I found quotes that I say for the person who was following me around singing.
5030000	5033000	But I had Mookal, remember?
5033000	5034000	Yeah, I do.
5034000	5036000	M-U-U-C-A-U.
5036000	5037000	Mhm.
5037000	5041000	And, god, those are fun. And then, of course, the whole RIP characters.
5041000	5045000	PrincePeachFuzz in our chatroom says Blaze420.
5045000	5050000	Seriously, with a name like that, what do you think most people are going to assume?
5050000	5056000	When you play a person named Blaze420 on Xbox, what are you going to assume about that person?
5056000	5061000	They're going to be easy to beat because they're high. That's what you're going to assume.
5061000	5063000	They're hot and they're a Taurus.
5063000	5070000	That's going to be my new online name, HotTaurus, which is funny because I'm actually not a Taurus.
5070000	5071000	But, why not?
5071000	5074000	Alright, let's see. And TigerClaw says,
5074000	5079000	For years, I wasn't happy with how Google forces your real-life name to show up in your YouTube account
5079000	5084000	until they changed the rules and I was able to put in my nickname so that it shows up instead of the real life.
5084000	5090000	I found out you can put your nickname in first, then put a dot on last name since the dot will be invisible.
5090000	5095000	Yeah, the Google forcing your real name thing, that was kind of a mess as well.
5095000	5100000	But I think they did kind of go back on that a little bit.
5100000	5108000	Anyhow, moving on. Let's talk release dates. We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates.
5108000	5111000	Let's start with Loki in the US.
5111000	5116000	So there's nothing coming out this week, surprise, because it's Black Friday week and everything.
5116000	5121000	But, since we're not going to be here next week, I'm going to go ahead and talk about what's coming out in the first,
5121000	5129000	which of course includes the next purchase I will be making, Just Cause 3 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as well as PC.
5129000	5132000	Also coming out, and I didn't realize this was even coming out now,
5132000	5138000	but Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, that's coming out on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5138000	5145000	Also they have a Kung Fu Panda game, Kung Fu Panda Showdown of Legendary Legends for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,
5145000	5150000	PlayStation 4, Xbox One, 3DS, and I'm assuming on Wii U even though you don't see it on there.
5150000	5158000	Well, for some reason they're re-releasing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas yet again on PlayStation 3,
5158000	5160000	so that's also something else to look forward to.
5160000	5167000	Xenoblade Chronicles X coming out on Wii U on the Friday, on the 4th.
5168000	5173000	And that's it, although looking at the following week, I can't believe that Devil's Third is coming out.
5173000	5176000	I didn't even realize that was coming out. Not that I even give a shit.
5177000	5181000	Presumably Chronicles looks good. I'm not sure if I'll pick that up though. Maybe.
5181000	5184000	Alright, let's travel over to Japan and check out some releases over there,
5184000	5190000	such as Blade Arcus from Shiny EX is on the PlayStation 4 from Sega on the 26th of November.
5190000	5194000	Farming Simulator 15 is also out for you farmers.
5194000	5201000	Also, God Eater Offshot is like a twin pack. Volume 2 is being released on the PlayStation 4 this week.
5201000	5208000	And Mato Kironai Yugi Itai Daybreak Special Gigs comes out in Japan this week.
5208000	5210000	All of that on the 26th.
5210000	5216000	Checking out the Wii U, we do have a release on the Wii U this week. It's Taiko no Tatujin.
5216000	5220000	Atsumete Tomodachi Dai Sakusen comes out this week in Japan,
5220000	5223000	so I wish we got those Taiko games here in the US,
5223000	5228000	but I understand when they tried it, it didn't sell very well, so it is what it is.
5228000	5231000	On the Vita, lots of stuff on the Vita this week,
5231000	5235000	because Vita games in Japan is actually a thing, unlike it is here.
5235000	5238000	Criminal Girls 2 in regular and limited edition.
5238000	5241000	The God Eater Offshot I mentioned before is also on the Vita.
5241000	5244000	Goze comes out in regular and limited edition this week.
5244000	5246000	Kasato in regular and limited edition.
5246000	5256000	Net High Ryuyoku no Melodia Diva with the Blessed Dragonol comes out this week on the Vita as well.
5256000	5259000	And Shin Sankoku Musou 7.5 Empires.
5259000	5261000	Also, one more.
5261000	5269000	Jaigen Taisen Neptune vs. Sega Hard Girls You May Know Gatai Special comes out as well this week.
5269000	5273000	I have no idea what this game is. It looks like some type of role-playing game.
5273000	5276000	And I don't know if Sega characters are in it or something,
5276000	5280000	or why it has the word Sega in the title, but I'm not seeing that in the graphics.
5280000	5282000	So, hmm.
5282000	5284000	But there you go.
5284000	5289000	Maybe it is Sega characters, because it does say on the Sega logos on there,
5289000	5292000	Idea Factory and Compile Heart are all contributing to this game,
5292000	5296000	so maybe there are some Sega-related characters in this.
5296000	5300000	They've had a few of those RPGs that were crossovers between three of those.
5300000	5303000	Yeah, and they get more of the crossovers over there than we do here.
5303000	5305000	We don't always get them over here.
5305000	5307000	Had them before, I just don't remember when the last one came out.
5307000	5309000	It was like 3DS or DS.
5309000	5310000	Right.
5310000	5317000	This week in Japan on November the 26th, Ikatsu, my number one stage in regular and limited edition.
5317000	5323000	But, probably more people looking forward to a huge release on November the 28th.
5323000	5326000	Monster Hunter X is out on 3DS.
5326000	5329000	That is going to be a pretty big deal.
5329000	5332000	So, that's on the 3DS this week.
5332000	5335000	And that is it for Japanese release dates.
5335000	5337000	Let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.
5337000	5339000	We have a few things in the UK.
5339000	5341000	Let me make sure I have the right date.
5341000	5345000	On the 24th, we have The Whispered World for iOS.
5345000	5352000	For the 26th, we have TrackMania Turbo on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
5352000	5355000	And on December 1st, I'll go ahead and extend out a bit,
5355000	5359000	we have Just Cause 3 and Rainbow Six Siege.
5361000	5362000	That's it.
5362000	5365000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.
5365000	5368000	But, Dungeon Buster, talking about the Sega game.
5368000	5370000	Saying, haha, Sega Hard Girls.
5370000	5373000	It's an anime with personified consoles.
5373000	5375000	Terrible animation, but it has its fans.
5375000	5376000	There you go.
5376000	5379000	I thought that was...
5379000	5382000	Maybe I'm confusing it with the other...
5382000	5384000	What was it?
5384000	5388000	Of course, now I can't think of the goddamn name of it.
5388000	5390000	Hyperdimension Neptunia?
5390000	5393000	That's what I always think when talking about, like,
5393000	5395000	consoleized girls.
5395000	5399000	Because, I mean, they're supposed to represent the different game consoles and stuff.
5399000	5401000	But, maybe that's a different series all the other.
5401000	5404000	Well, now I'm trying to go back and actually look at the artwork
5404000	5407000	to see if maybe I can see, like, the consoles.
5407000	5409000	That could be, well, I don't know.
5409000	5411000	Let's see, I'm trying to bring it up here.
5411000	5413000	Of course, I had closed it when I was done reading the dates.
5413000	5415000	But, that's some good insight from Dungeon Buster there.
5415000	5417000	So, I'm actually looking at the artwork.
5417000	5419000	I mean, is...
5419000	5421000	Oh, that's a Dreamcast controller on her head.
5421000	5423000	Okay.
5423000	5425000	That is... I see it now.
5425000	5427000	So, she's got a Dreamcast controller on her head.
5427000	5429000	This one's a Genesis controller.
5429000	5431000	So, okay. I see it now.
5431000	5435000	So, it's consoles as anime ladies.
5435000	5437000	I see now.
5437000	5440000	They did Hyperdimension Neptunia with the original Xbox.
5440000	5443000	They have a really, really plus-sized woman as the Xbox.
5443000	5445000	The original one.
5445000	5447000	Oh, because that thing was...
5447000	5449000	The size of a house.
5449000	5451000	Let's move on, Loki.
5451000	5455000	So, apparently EA has confirmed that they're working on a new Assassin's Creed-type game.
5455000	5458000	And, this is, of course, because, hey, guess what?
5458000	5462000	They've got, you know, Jade Raymond, you know, joining EA.
5462000	5464000	And...
5464000	5466000	I mean, it just makes sense.
5466000	5469000	They said, we've never really operated in the largest genre of gaming.
5469000	5471000	That's the action genre.
5471000	5474000	I mean, I don't know.
5474000	5476000	They've had other action games.
5476000	5478000	They've tried to have action games.
5478000	5482000	I mean, I guess they consider a lot of their games shooters.
5482000	5486000	But, they're trying to make, like, an Assassin's Creed-type game.
5486000	5490000	So, more open-world, more single-play versus multiplayer.
5490000	5491000	Hmm.
5491000	5493000	Which, I like single-player games.
5493000	5495000	I don't like Assassin's Creed, but...
5495000	5497000	I don't know.
5497000	5499000	So, maybe this is something that we could see at E3 next year.
5499000	5502000	I just don't like stealth action games, is my thing.
5502000	5505000	And, maybe you don't have to play Assassin's Creed stealth-ly.
5505000	5508000	But, I just don't really like stealth games.
5508000	5512000	Like, if my Assassin guy would be just kind of like Leroy Jenkins,
5512000	5515000	just kicking down the crowd and shooting people in the face.
5515000	5517000	That's not really stealthy, so...
5517000	5520000	He breaks down the door with a ham-sar voice.
5520000	5523000	I'm the best Assassin ever!
5523000	5526000	Can we just get, like, I mean, here's what I would like to see, okay?
5526000	5528000	Let's just back up here.
5528000	5530000	I would like to see, like, a Deadpool through time game.
5530000	5533000	You know, if you want an Assassin game, I want a fucking Deadpool game.
5533000	5537000	Like, and you can set them in, like, every single genre that Assassin's Creed's been in,
5537000	5540000	as a pirate back in the, you know, the American Revolution days.
5540000	5542000	I'm down with that.
5542000	5543000	As long as Deadpool's in the game.
5543000	5545000	He's trying to seduce Bea Arthur.
5545000	5547000	I think it would be amazing.
5549000	5553000	Alright, I got one more story for you guys, so we're gonna get to the classic game.
5553000	5556000	And speaking of classic games, appropriately,
5556000	5563000	there's apparently a quest, so to speak, going on right now to bring back Bubsy.
5563000	5565000	Do you guys remember Bubsy?
5565000	5566000	Yes, I do.
5566000	5568000	Yes, I rented that game.
5568000	5572000	Yes, the Bubsy Two-fer, which is two of Bubsy's classic adventures,
5572000	5575000	Bubsy Two-fer is on Steam Greenlight.
5575000	5577000	Oh, man, you can't even get that instantly published?
5577000	5581000	Yeah, it's kind of weird that it can't just get instantly published,
5581000	5585000	but for whatever reason, yeah, they want to bring back these classic Bubsy games,
5585000	5588000	and they have this whole hashtag campaign going and so forth,
5588000	5592000	so it'll be interesting to see how the Steam Greenlight goes.
5592000	5594000	It'll get in, because it'll ironically get in.
5594000	5597000	It's getting a lot of coverage as well.
5597000	5600000	There's really terrible games that get, you know, put in there,
5600000	5604000	and this is a legitimately old game that's not that great, but it was okay.
5604000	5606000	Can we bring back Gex while we're at it?
5606000	5608000	Because Gex was pretty fun.
5608000	5611000	And by the way, those two games that are a part of this collection,
5611000	5614000	we have Bubsy in Claw's Encounter of the Ferdkind,
5614000	5620000	which I believe was the first game, and then Bubsy Two, which has no title.
5620000	5622000	Bubsy Two, we're not creative enough for a subtitle.
5622000	5627000	So I guess the last update, this is pretty high up on the Steam Greenlight chart,
5627000	5629000	so it seems like a given that this will end up getting greenlit,
5629000	5633000	but I'm kind of with you, I'm kind of surprised it didn't just automatically get put through.
5633000	5635000	So, weird.
5635000	5640000	And then folks in chat saying, Alan Alchemy says,
5640000	5643000	Bubsy One was amazing, but wasn't the second one shit?
5643000	5646000	And then goes on to correct himself, okay, Bubsy 3D was the bad one.
5646000	5647000	Yeah, Bubsy 3D was...
5647000	5650000	Bubsy 3D was what pretty much killed the entire franchise.
5650000	5654000	So, yeah, hopefully the original...
5654000	5656000	It was an awkward time, it's like puberty,
5656000	5659000	like everybody was getting into the 3D games,
5659000	5662000	they didn't quite know what to do with it,
5662000	5667000	and then unfortunately they just shit out Bubsy 3D.
5667000	5671000	And there's a lot of really bad 3D games that came out around that time.
5671000	5675000	It was an awkward stage of gaming.
5675000	5677000	Kaijuto in chat at live.vognetwork.com says,
5677000	5680000	I remember Bubsy and the only thing that was good about that game was
5680000	5683000	he tapped the TV screen if you let him stand too long.
5683000	5686000	Other than that, the game sucked ass.
5686000	5689000	I didn't think it was that bad, unless it was Bubsy 3D.
5689000	5692000	But I do remember, the standing still animations are always
5692000	5694000	some of my favorite in games, that's for sure.
5694000	5696000	Let's see.
5696000	5698000	And bobbyblackwolf with a reality check saying,
5698000	5702000	Just because a game is old, it doesn't mean people will re-buy it on Steam,
5702000	5703000	hence the green light.
5703000	5705000	I just kinda, I don't know, I guess I thought people had
5705000	5707000	fonder memories of Bubsy, but maybe,
5707000	5711000	maybe Bubsy 3D has still tainted people to this day,
5711000	5713000	because even Alan was like,
5713000	5715000	it wasn't one of those games, real shit.
5715000	5717000	Let's see, and tigerclaw is asking,
5717000	5720000	you guys remember the Bubsy animated cartoon?
5720000	5722000	No, didn't that not become a thing?
5722000	5726000	I remember there was one, but I don't think I ever watched it.
5726000	5729000	Whenever I think of an animated cartoon like Bubsy,
5729000	5734000	I would think like, what was that, was it Bonkers or something?
5734000	5737000	It was something that was part of the Disney lineup or whatever.
5737000	5740000	Alan Alchemy in chat at live.fognetwork.com saying,
5740000	5745000	King's Quest VIII equals worst game to come out of the proto-3D-as-the-norm
5745000	5748000	Quake Half-Life 3D Awkward Puberty era.
5748000	5750000	Yes, talk about a franchise killer.
5750000	5754000	I mean, King's Quest VIII pretty much killed that franchise until like,
5754000	5757000	just recently they did the whole, you know,
5757000	5759000	kinda re-imagining of the series on consoles,
5759000	5761000	but those games play very differently.
5761000	5762000	What about like Dragon's Lair 3D?
5762000	5765000	Didn't they do like a 3D Dragon Lair game that wasn't very good either?
5766000	5769000	I feel like they did like a real Dragon's Lair, something that was on like Xbox,
5769000	5771000	like original Xbox or something.
5771000	5773000	So, anyway, let's move on.
5773000	5775000	We would need to get into the classic game of the week.
5775000	5777000	We're running kinda long tonight, believe it or not,
5777000	5781000	but we do need to step into the vault where every week
5781000	5784000	Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
5784000	5789000	hey, play some cute music and put on this game.
5789000	5791000	And this game is one with cute music,
5791000	5792000	actually we're gonna talk about it tonight.
5792000	5797000	Dark Sakura, taking us to Japan tonight to visit the classic game of the week, right?
5797000	5800000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5801000	5805000	Classic game of the week is Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.
5806000	5808000	Yes, I'm doing this one.
5808000	5812000	And I realize I've already done Super Mario 2 or Super Mario USA.
5812000	5816000	I am specifically doing Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic.
5816000	5820000	Because I want to go into this for a particular reason.
5820000	5823000	Nintendo has sold out.
5824000	5827000	They've done it several times in the past.
5831000	5836000	You know, two of the times that they did this,
5836000	5839000	and this is of course going back to the 80s,
5839000	5842000	and yes, Garris makes my heart go Doki Doki, thank you, Alan.
5843000	5847000	But three times in the past, and this is one of those times,
5847000	5849000	did Nintendo sell out.
5849000	5855000	One of them was with Kete Kita Mario Brothers,
5855000	5860000	where they just were advertising stuff the whole time by reskinning Mario Brothers.
5860000	5863000	There was On Night Nippon Super Mario Brothers,
5863000	5866000	which was another reskinning of Super Mario Brothers.
5867000	5868000	And then there was this.
5868000	5873000	This among those was the first time that it was a full game meant to advertise.
5873000	5877000	I was gonna say the real big time that they sold out was probably the CDI games.
5880000	5882000	I'm talking about for advertising.
5883000	5888000	So anyway, Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic,
5888000	5892000	which will translate to Dream Factory Heart Pounding Panic,
5895000	5902000	was released in conjunction with a very limited event that happened in Japan.
5902000	5908000	It was for the Yume Kojo 87, which was a carnival done by Fuji TV
5908000	5913000	to promote its fall lineup of shows.
5914000	5919000	It was a big carnival, and one of the things that they had going on
5919000	5927000	was a sort of dedicated Rio de Janeiro style carnival with masks and everything,
5927000	5931000	which of course was also mildly influenced by Marty Roth.
5933000	5937000	This only happened for about a month and twelve days.
5937000	5941000	It lasted from July 18th to August 30th, 1987.
5941000	5943000	So it wasn't very long.
5943000	5948000	And a lot of the ads for this were masks.
5948000	5950000	Just all these masks.
5950000	5956000	And a lot of the styles of the masks showed up in the Japanese version of the game.
5957000	5965000	So how the shy guy and the little bird hopper guy and all of these things were wearing the masks.
5965000	5969000	And you had a mask motif in the background.
5969000	5975000	What for us were the mushroom blocks were actually different types of masks.
5975000	5979000	One of them looking very much like Gene Simmons, I must say.
5981000	5985000	The characters in the game were the mascots from the carnival,
5985000	5989000	which had sort of an Arabian Nights kind of theme.
5989000	5999000	So you had the main character who was Imogene, and then Mama, Lina, and Papa.
5999000	6005000	And they were going into a bedtime story where Wart was a character in the story
6005000	6008000	and he kidnapped their children Pokey and Peaky.
6009000	6011000	So there was...
6013000	6018000	It was really in its core advertising.
6018000	6023000	However, we got a really good game out of it.
6023000	6026000	Kind of a confusing game at first, but a really good game.
6026000	6032000	And I really more wanted to go into the backstory of how this came into play.
6032000	6034000	Because not too many people...
6035000	6040000	I mean, people know that, yeah, it was the You Make Hojo game,
6040000	6047000	but they don't really know how it came about or what You Make Hojo was or any of this other stuff going on.
6050000	6054000	So other things this game had in it, as far as big differences,
6054000	6058000	is that you had to beat it with all four characters to get the ending.
6059000	6062000	Oh my god. Can you imagine beating Super Mario Brothers 2 with Toad?
6062000	6063000	Yes.
6063000	6065000	Not for me, no thank you.
6065000	6067000	Peach or Luigi all the way.
6068000	6070000	It's funny, Luigi was Mama.
6070000	6074000	And Luigi actually has a higher jump than Mama did.
6074000	6076000	So some of those were changes.
6076000	6078000	You could not run.
6079000	6084000	The run feature was something that had been a Mario thing,
6084000	6089000	so they didn't implement it until they put the Mario stuff on it.
6090000	6094000	In the Japanese version, you could kill Wart in four moves.
6094000	6097000	They bumped it up to two in Super Mario 2.
6097000	6099000	But in the prototype, it was four.
6099000	6100000	Bumped it up to six.
6100000	6101000	Yeah, bumped it up to six, sorry.
6101000	6103000	They bumped it up by two.
6104000	6108000	Sound effects change, like the little creatures don't scream when you kill them.
6110000	6114000	The Fanto actually was also redesigned.
6114000	6116000	You had different masks as well.
6117000	6119000	And it wasn't as...
6122000	6129000	It wasn't as, I'd say, aggressive as it is in Super Mario Brothers 2.
6129000	6134000	The White Mouser was changed because he was actually super hard and very erratic,
6134000	6138000	so they put in Claw Grip, who was not in the original version at all.
6140000	6142000	The sound effects are the big thing I noticed.
6142000	6144000	You can even hear it in this Birdo fight.
6144000	6145000	Let me turn it up a little bit.
6147000	6149000	Yep, it's screeching.
6150000	6153000	What's the mask? Look at the gate.
6153000	6158000	The gate's a masked bird instead of the, sort of, falcon-looking thing.
6160000	6168000	The Gray Sniffit is in the manual for it, but didn't show up in the Japanese version.
6168000	6171000	The musical score shortened a little bit.
6171000	6177000	The Subspace music was its own. It was sort of an Arabian theme.
6177000	6179000	Oh, here it is.
6179000	6181000	Dammit, it just passed by.
6181000	6184000	You could hear it in the background for a little bit there.
6184000	6186000	The character playing this just went into Subspace.
6188000	6191000	The Starman is in there, but a different music plays.
6195000	6199000	Your mushrooms, where you go to gain extra life, are hearts.
6199000	6202000	Which makes sense that you have the hearts on the side.
6203000	6205000	You have a save feature in the game.
6209000	6216000	Some of the sound effects actually had to do with the fact that it was the disk system versus the NESP,
6216000	6220000	so it had different, with the different pin connectors.
6222000	6227000	Actually, you can go back and play this one, because that's a little bit longer of a theme.
6227000	6229000	Oh, they're already out of Subspace?
6229000	6230000	Yeah.
6230000	6231000	That's a good one.
6231000	6232000	Um, anyway.
6236000	6239000	Some of the platforms were changed around.
6241000	6243000	Some of the artwork was different.
6243000	6245000	Okay, so here it is.
6245000	6254000	The animations were, uh, they actually added animations for the US version,
6254000	6256000	so they improved upon that.
6256000	6260000	Which was really weird, because in some games, like Contra, they removed animations.
6262000	6270000	The explosion blocks say bomb B-O-M instead of bomb, and the bomb thing was just for Super Mario Bros. 2.
6270000	6272000	Some of the vegetables looked different as well.
6272000	6277000	The one up mushrooms were the heads of whatever character that you were controlling,
6277000	6279000	and the potions were actually lamps.
6279000	6281000	They were magic lamps.
6281000	6285000	One thing that was very big is that when you could pull up a shell in the US point,
6285000	6290000	in the Japanese one in Doki Doki Panic, it was actually a little head.
6290000	6297000	And it was in the game called the Big Head, but it was actually a face in blackface.
6297000	6306000	So, granted, that's a pretty good reason to get rid of that, given that's a very, I'd say, racially insensitive thing.
6307000	6310000	So yeah, a few things were different about the ending.
6310000	6318000	You, uh, instead of rescuing Subcons, you rescued Pokey and Peaky,
6318000	6321000	and you're standing on their cage while they're still inside it.
6321000	6323000	You know, you don't get the-
6323000	6325000	Oh, here's the star music.
6328000	6331000	It's different. It sounds like something out of Kid Icarus or something.
6331000	6332000	Yeah.
6332000	6336000	Another thing is that you don't get the who beat how many number of levels,
6336000	6339000	because, honestly enough, you have to play through the game with everyone.
6339000	6340000	Yeah.
6340000	6341000	So, there's a need.
6341000	6343000	And so, that's it.
6344000	6351000	That is the differences with Yume Kojo Doki Doki Panic and why the game exists.
6351000	6354000	It's basically Nintendo giving advertising.
6356000	6359000	I like some of these comments in chat here over at live.vognetwork.com.
6359000	6360000	S2100matt saying,
6360000	6364000	Seriously, Mouser doesn't get that much love in Mario games anymore.
6364000	6370000	You know, a lot of the characters from Doki Doki that crossed over into the Mario universe,
6370000	6372000	you know, kind of retconned in, essentially,
6372000	6376000	you see Shy Guy a lot today, but that's really the only one.
6376000	6380000	Like, you don't see a lot of the other Mario 2 mobs,
6380000	6382000	and it always kind of, you know, and I know I've said this on a show before,
6382000	6387000	I'm always kind of surprised that Wart never came back as a villain in any other game.
6387000	6390000	Is he just, does he just suck compared to Bowser?
6390000	6392000	Maybe he actually died.
6393000	6395000	Mario actually murdered him.
6395000	6400000	The sub-cons executed him, and Mario went back to the real fucking universe,
6400000	6402000	where somehow there are Shy Guys,
6402000	6407000	which my theory about the Shy Guys is that when they take off their masks,
6407000	6411000	they're the big blue puffy things hanging around in Klonoa's universe.
6411000	6413000	Akdeft is screaming in chat because, in all caps,
6413000	6416000	because he was a dream, he never existed.
6416000	6419000	Okay, like, this is a fucking video game, people.
6419000	6423000	Like, that could stop the story from, I mean, come on.
6423000	6426000	It doesn't matter. He could still, he could still be a villain in a game.
6426000	6430000	I'm linking a few of the posters for the game, the promotional art,
6430000	6435000	that, um, it's kind of interesting because it actually does show, um,
6435000	6440000	Mario and Peach with the characters that they replaced.
6441000	6446000	Um, I just find it very interesting, you know, um,
6446000	6451000	it was really, I'd say, you know, and given, I mean,
6451000	6453000	now this is sort of common knowledge now,
6453000	6457000	the real reason why it became Super Mario Bros. 2 over here
6457000	6459000	is because the lost levels are fucking hard.
6459000	6463000	What we got is the lost levels were hard, but that was Super Mario 2.
6463000	6468000	And it was actually in that game that Luigi got his higher jump.
6468000	6474000	So, since then, though, this game has had a big influence
6474000	6477000	on the rest of the Mario games, because you think about it,
6477000	6480000	Peach has always had her floating in any game that she's played in.
6480000	6481000	Yeah, and Act Deft actually said,
6481000	6484000	I like how they transferred the abilities in Super Mario Bros. 2
6484000	6485000	to Super Mario 3D World.
6485000	6489000	Well, now then, that part of the dream ended up working out, didn't it?
6489000	6491000	See what I mean? They can bring back what they want.
6491000	6492000	It doesn't matter, it was a dream.
6492000	6497000	And Toad was the fast puller, a little lighter on his feet.
6497000	6498000	He knows how to pull out.
6498000	6504000	Mario was always the middle-of-the-road guy. He's the reliable one.
6504000	6507000	And Luigi has his weird floppy legs.
6507000	6510000	And I would always call him Crazy Legs Luigi,
6510000	6513000	ever since I was a kid, ever since playing this game.
6513000	6514000	DartTet Studio says,
6514000	6515000	I'm sure I mentioned it before,
6515000	6519000	but Video Game Historian did a thing on Super Mario Bros. 2 and Doki Doki Panic,
6519000	6521000	and seems like those characters were from Fuji TV,
6521000	6523000	so maybe that's part of why. I didn't realize that.
6523000	6526000	No, they were mascots for this event.
6526000	6530000	For the Yume Kojo 87.
6530000	6535000	Because the theme of their carnival was an Arabian theme,
6535000	6538000	and they created the mascot.
6538000	6539000	I see.
6539000	6542000	And his whole family and everything was specifically for that,
6542000	6543000	but all the masks...
6543000	6545000	The family never came over.
6545000	6547000	They were...
6547000	6549000	The family doesn't come over in Mario Bros. 2.
6549000	6551000	They changed them to Mario and Luigi.
6551000	6553000	Oh, well, yeah, all of them changed.
6553000	6556000	Even Ima Jean, the main character.
6558000	6561000	Mama was replaced by Luigi.
6561000	6563000	What was the girl's name again?
6563000	6564000	The dad is Toad.
6564000	6565000	Papa is Toad.
6565000	6566000	Yeah.
6566000	6568000	And I'm trying to find the girl's name again,
6568000	6570000	because I had it a second ago.
6576000	6577000	Lina. Her name was Lina.
6577000	6578000	That's it.
6578000	6579000	And she got...
6579000	6581000	But yeah, that last picture they posted in chat room
6581000	6582000	was from a telephone card.
6582000	6587000	They did a lot of promotion for the event and for the game,
6587000	6591000	and it really seems like a lot of work to go into this,
6591000	6594000	and that carnival thing was huge.
6594000	6595000	It was a really big thing,
6595000	6598000	but it only happened for just over a month.
6598000	6601000	So that's really the part that blows my mind.
6601000	6604000	It's like where the World's Fair used to be years and years ago.
6604000	6607000	I guess, but this is really...
6607000	6609000	And I guess Nintendo is still doing it,
6609000	6611000	because they sold out with Mercedes.
6613000	6614000	That's true.
6614000	6615000	It hasn't ended. It hasn't ended.
6615000	6616000	Alright.
6616000	6618000	Yeah, but that's really it.
6620000	6621000	There it is.
6621000	6625000	It's basically Nintendo advertises for Fuji TV.
6625000	6627000	There it is, your classic game of the week,
6627000	6628000	Doki Doki Panic,
6628000	6631000	the game that would become the Super Mario Brothers 2
6631000	6632000	that we know here in the US.
6632000	6634000	Alright, we are going to take a break.
6634000	6636000	We're running long tonight, but that's good.
6636000	6637000	We're having some good discussion.
6637000	6638000	We're going to have a little more.
6638000	6640000	When we come back, after a quick break with you guys,
6640000	6641000	your emails, your phone calls,
6641000	6642000	the Fuqua Question of the Week,
6642000	6645000	and more news when Orange Lounge Radio returns,
6645000	6647000	right after this.
6653000	6656000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,
6656000	6660000	live tonight with episode number 622 of our show
6660000	6663000	for November the 15th of 2015.
6663000	6665000	We're having a pretty long show tonight.
6665000	6666000	Funny how that works sometimes.
6666000	6668000	We had a lot to talk about in the beginning of the show,
6668000	6671000	a lot of anniversaries to celebrate in gaming with this,
6671000	6675000	leading up to the big Thanksgiving holiday,
6675000	6677000	and of course, the shopping,
6677000	6678000	and I'm using my quotey fingers,
6678000	6681000	holiday that comes with that Black Friday.
6681000	6685000	I'm curious, anybody in here planning on venturing out
6685000	6686000	on any of that Black Friday stuff?
6686000	6687000	I don't support it.
6687000	6689000	Yeah, it's not for me.
6689000	6690000	I can't deal with the crowds.
6690000	6691000	No.
6691000	6693000	I actually have to work this year.
6693000	6694000	I don't have Friday off,
6694000	6696000	which is a little different for me.
6696000	6699000	But, you know, there's a lot of people out there
6699000	6701000	working hard that work on Thanksgiving,
6701000	6703000	and not even just retail,
6703000	6706000	although certainly a lot of people in retail just get,
6706000	6708000	oh my God, they get put through the ringer this week,
6708000	6711000	so my prayers for you all.
6711000	6714000	Isn't there supposed to be some steam sale going on or something?
6714000	6716000	A lot of restaurants, movies.
6716000	6717000	Is there a steam sale?
6717000	6719000	There's a steam sale coming up.
6719000	6721000	They're doing a fall one,
6721000	6724000	and then they're doing a winter one as well towards the new year,
6724000	6728000	and then this time, I hope it's not a story they were going over.
6728000	6731000	No, this time they're doing, like, it's different.
6731000	6733000	They're not going to have the flash sales or anything.
6733000	6735000	It's just going to be a sale.
6735000	6736000	Here's the price.
6736000	6737000	That's it.
6737000	6740000	That's probably for the best.
6740000	6743000	They did a lot with the whole robot game last time.
6743000	6744000	Well, I don't know if you saw me.
6744000	6745000	I was looking at Red Box
6745000	6747000	because they're selling off some of their games
6747000	6750000	between now and Black Friday for like under $10.
6750000	6755000	Like they had Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and Ghosts.
6755000	6759000	It's not my cup of tea, but Assassin's Creed Unity was like $9.
6759000	6761000	I was trying to get Far Cry 4,
6761000	6765000	but yeah, good luck finding a kiosk that has a game from last year
6765000	6767000	still in their kiosks.
6767000	6771000	And if you do buy it, good luck at being actually a diss.
6771000	6776000	If there is a sale coming up, does that mean I can maybe get 10% off Fallout 4?
6776000	6777000	Too early for that?
6777000	6778000	I don't know.
6778000	6779000	You never know.
6779000	6780000	Maybe.
6780000	6781000	You all right over there, Dark Sakura?
6781000	6784000	Wasabi Kit-Kats.
6784000	6785000	Ugh, it's too spicy.
6785000	6789000	I want the Sakura Matcha Kit-Kats, but it's a little expensive.
6789000	6790000	Oh my gosh.
6790000	6791000	Someone send me some.
6791000	6792000	You're going to be full of Kit-Kats.
6792000	6793000	You're going to turn into a Kit-Kat.
6793000	6794000	You're going to eat so many of them.
6794000	6795000	All right.
6795000	6801000	Let's give me a break.
6801000	6803000	You mean to break you off a piece of that Kit-Kat bar?
6803000	6804000	Yes.
6804000	6805000	I believe that was the joke, Loki.
6805000	6806000	Yes, I believe that was the joke.
6806000	6813000	It's just a little bit of highbrow pun there, but I kind of gave her a dirty look for it
6813000	6814000	anyway.
6814000	6815000	All right.
6815000	6819000	Let's please get back into some gaming news quick before Jamie tells another joke.
6819000	6820000	Get back into gaming news.
6820000	6822000	So, let's see.
6822000	6827000	So, for rapid fire news, we've got Telltale confirming that they are working on season
6827000	6829000	two of Game of Thrones.
6829000	6831000	Apparently the first one sold pretty well.
6831000	6832000	So, hey, why not?
6832000	6834000	Because, you know, the fans are asking for it.
6834000	6836000	So, let's keep it going.
6836000	6838000	So, I'll have to look forward to that.
6838000	6841000	I still have not played the first season, and I know I think I had the first episode
6841000	6846000	free, so I may have to check it out.
6846000	6852000	So, with each Black Ops game that comes out, they have, like, of course, you know, the
6852000	6853000	Nuketown map.
6853000	6859000	And this time, and of course each one has a little Easter egg, usually involving the
6859000	6860000	mannequins.
6860000	6862000	This time they have some robot mannequins.
6862000	6867000	If you shoot the arms off of them, it kind of, within two minutes, and that's off of
6867000	6874000	all the mannequins, it turns into this, like, I don't know, really crazy, like a creepy
6874000	6876000	weeping angel thing.
6876000	6880000	And if you don't know what the weeping angels are, those are basically like these monsters
6880000	6882000	that when you look at them, they're completely still.
6882000	6886000	You turn your back to them, they run up to you to try to kill you.
6886000	6888000	And so, that's what happens in the game.
6888000	6893000	And then when you do that, all the robots start chasing after you when you're not looking
6893000	6896000	at them, and you turn around and just like in mid-pose, like striking at you and stuff
6896000	6897000	like that, and it's crazy.
6897000	6900000	But then they can actually hurt you in the game.
6900000	6905000	So, that's something to check out if you decide you don't want to play multiplayer on Nuketown
6905000	6909000	and you want to kill two minutes by shooting all the arms off of the robots, then go right
6909000	6912000	ahead and check out that Easter egg.
6912000	6916000	And speaking of kind of like a Silent Hill type of Easter egg, Norrin Reedus has come
6916000	6920000	out saying basically Silent Hills still needs to happen.
6920000	6924000	And he's super bummed that the whole thing just kind of blew up.
6924000	6928000	Basically saying the internet buzz about Silent Hills happening was so huge.
6928000	6932000	I've never seen anything like it, petitions with hundreds of thousands of people that
6932000	6935000	signed it, petitions to please make it happen.
6935000	6936000	That's crazy.
6936000	6940000	That's a crazy fan base for not just a video game, but also for people making that video
6940000	6941000	game.
6941000	6945000	And for me to jump on that truck with him, I was like holy balls, it has to happen.
6945000	6948000	You need to do this.
6948000	6950000	And then of course Konami said fuck that.
6950000	6958000	We're just going to make a pachinko slot machine out of that.
6958000	6962000	Why is it like every week on this show we have a story about how Silent Hills is just
6962000	6963000	continuing to disappoint us?
6963000	6965000	Because it was like such an amazing thing.
6965000	6968000	Like the last few Silent Hill games have been kind of meh.
6968000	6969000	And then they're like, hey guess what?
6969000	6971000	We're going to do this shit fucking right.
6971000	6977000	And it's just like the way they announced it was right, the people behind it, it just
6977000	6978000	felt so good.
6978000	6982000	And then Konami's like, fuck it.
6982000	6986000	It's like the greatest tease of them all.
6986000	6988000	Aside from Half-Life 3.
6988000	6989000	Alright.
6989000	6991000	Let's move on and talk about Rock Band.
6991000	6993000	And guess what?
6993000	6996000	Rock Band 4 is going to be getting an update.
6996000	6999000	Which is good because it kind of needed one.
6999000	7002000	So it's getting an update on December 8th.
7002000	7004000	And some of the features that will be going into the game.
7004000	7006000	Leaderboard and friend challenging.
7006000	7008000	More detailed song results.
7008000	7010000	In-depth statistics.
7010000	7011000	Improved calibration.
7011000	7013000	More items in the rock shop.
7013000	7017000	A mode that automatically plays the drums kick pedal for you.
7017000	7020000	Which is something, you know, again we talked about accessibility earlier.
7020000	7021000	People have been asking for that for a while.
7021000	7022000	So that's good that's there.
7022000	7024000	And also I just suck at using the kick pedal.
7024000	7026000	And there's that too.
7027000	7031000	And a full combo tracker that marks which songs have been full comboed.
7031000	7034000	And gives you an in-song indicator to show if you're doing it.
7034000	7037000	Or if you have actually broken your combo.
7037000	7043000	And the tracks from Rock Band 3 will finally be able to be imported into Rock Band 4.
7043000	7047000	Not hearing anything about, I don't know if that includes Rock Band 2 and 1.
7047000	7048000	Because that's 3.
7048000	7050000	But we'll see.
7050000	7053000	So anyway it sounds like a lot more features coming out on December 8th.
7053000	7056000	Maybe what should have been there when the game came out.
7056000	7058000	But I guess better late than never, right?
7058000	7060000	So there's that to look forward to.
7060000	7064000	Moving on, Don't Starve Shipwrecked.
7064000	7067000	Which, you know, if you played the original Don't Starve.
7067000	7069000	Which a lot of people have lost many hours to that game.
7069000	7073000	It was one of the early PlayStation 4 download games.
7073000	7075000	And of course it's done very well on Steam as well.
7075000	7078000	But Don't Starve is getting an expansion called Shipwrecked.
7078000	7082000	And it's coming out on Steam early access on December 1st.
7082000	7088000	New seasons, new creatures, new biomes, and many other new ways to die.
7088000	7089000	Hooray!
7089000	7096000	Many different types of job classes to hopefully not die as you're playing Final Fantasy Explorers.
7096000	7099000	That's right, 21 jobs announced for the game.
7099000	7104000	Which is weird to say that they've announced them because the game has been out in Japan for some time.
7104000	7109000	But I guess it would be appropriate to say some of the PR push is starting now.
7109000	7111000	And this is one of the early PR things that they're putting out there.
7111000	7115000	Is here are all the classes you can play in Final Fantasy Explorers.
7115000	7119000	Which include things that, you know, if you're playing Final Fantasy XIV or other Final Fantasy games.
7119000	7126000	You probably are familiar with things like Machinist, White Mage, Black Mage, Dark Knight, Bard.
7126000	7127000	You probably know all those classes.
7127000	7131000	But there are some other long time dormant Final Fantasy classes that are coming back.
7131000	7136000	Such as Sage, Alchemist, Blue Mage, Geomancer.
7136000	7139000	I know those were in Final Fantasy XI, but I haven't seen those otherwise.
7139000	7141000	Blue Mage.
7141000	7144000	Yeah, lots of fun stuff coming to the game there.
7144000	7146000	So I'm excited to pick that up.
7146000	7149000	Even if it is a little different than your normal Final Fantasy game.
7149000	7151000	Because it's a little more Monster Hunter.
7151000	7154000	I still want to check that out when it comes out in January here in the States.
7154000	7156000	Dark Sakura.
7156000	7158000	Excitement!
7159000	7162000	There is, I didn't announce this to anybody.
7162000	7168000	But I broke my, um, I popped my Kickstarter cherry.
7168000	7170000	With this one.
7170000	7175000	The Hot to Full Boyfriend plushie Kickstarter has passed $95,000.
7175000	7180000	When I went to check on my contribution, it actually passed $100,000.
7180000	7183000	So, um, all of the birds are unlocked.
7183000	7185000	There's limited stock.
7185000	7191000	For people who earlier pledged the $25 tier and up.
7191000	7198000	You actually get to pick one more bird.
7198000	7201000	You can add another one for $12 each one.
7201000	7203000	I got emails on it.
7203000	7209000	The $25 tier, by the way, gives you shoes so he can stab you in the back while you sleep.
7209000	7211000	You get Ryota, who is adorable.
7211000	7214000	And you get Okasan, who is really funny.
7214000	7217000	So, those are great.
7217000	7226000	And then, um, Capcom has confirmed a second round of Street Fighter V characters.
7226000	7231000	Um, well, they've put out shadowy images of them.
7231000	7237000	But the thought is that it's Alex, Guile, Ibuki, Balrog, Juri, and Urien.
7237000	7239000	So, who knows.
7239000	7248000	And then, um, last but not least, um, the Mega Man Legacy Collection will not have a physical release in Europe.
7248000	7253000	It looks like it's going to be, uh, download only.
7253000	7258000	So you do not have a chance of getting the gold Mega Man amiibo.
7258000	7259000	Sorry.
7259000	7261000	That's it.
7261000	7267000	Alright, let's go to the FUGL question of the week.
7267000	7278000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
7278000	7281000	And we read some of our favorite answers on the air.
7281000	7285000	And if you're not following us on Facebook, you should be our friend.
7285000	7287000	Be my friend on Facebook.
7287000	7290000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7290000	7295000	You can also, if you're one of those that's like, oh, I don't do Facebook, then maybe you're on Google Plus.
7295000	7300000	And you can add us over there at Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio.
7300000	7304000	This week's FUGL question of the week is about a story that Dark Soccer was talking about earlier.
7304000	7307000	Uh, where, what does your username say about you?
7307000	7311000	So we asked our listeners tonight, what is your username when playing online games?
7311000	7316000	And what do you hope that says about you to the other people playing?
7316000	7319000	This is probably a tricky question because we didn't get as many responses as we usually do.
7319000	7321000	But we did get a few good ones here.
7321000	7330000	Um, Brad's starting us off tonight over on Facebook saying, my username on just about every platform is Pod Culture.
7330000	7334000	What it says is that I am not above shameless plugging for my podcast.
7334000	7338000	Excellent answer. Excellent answer.
7338000	7340000	As you, as you shouldn't be. It's a great show too.
7340000	7346000	Uh, Tiger Claw is responding to us on Facebook saying, my username has always been Tiger Claw since day one.
7346000	7351000	The name was taken from the video game Wing Commander, which had a ship called the Tiger Claw.
7351000	7353000	You know, I don't think I ever realized that.
7353000	7355000	And Wing Commander was an awesome game.
7355000	7358000	He probably told this story at some point like six years ago, but I forgot.
7358000	7362000	So that's a great, Wing Commander series is awesome.
7362000	7364000	Um, so that's cool.
7364000	7366000	Uh, it was a name that has stuck with me ever since.
7366000	7368000	And what does it say about me? I don't really know.
7368000	7373000	But recently there's a new character in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series on Nickelodeon called Tiger Claw as well.
7373000	7376000	Which is why I changed all my avatars to reflect that character.
7376000	7381000	I never thought I'd see the day where a nickname I've been using for many years is also the name of a character.
7381000	7383000	That just puts a smile on my face.
7383000	7387000	They must have seen your tweets because you were a big supporter of the Ninja Turtles movie and all that stuff.
7387000	7390000	That was a shout out to you, bro.
7390000	7395000	That's, you never know. At least it's fun to think that, right?
7395000	7399000	Alright, how about Redertainment who responds and says, I am Redertainment.
7399000	7402000	What I hope my name says is that I am entertaining and red.
7403000	7406000	Also, names don't necessarily correlate with behavior.
7406000	7409000	I mean, my real name is Hunter and I've never once hunted.
7409000	7415000	Rob doesn't rob people and Jamie doesn't, well, what is it to Jamie somebody? Is it dirty?
7415000	7419000	The name is the female version of James which means a supplanter.
7419000	7420000	Oh.
7420000	7422000	I've looked it up.
7422000	7425000	Um, for the record, this is talking about nicknames.
7425000	7427000	So these are names that you would be choosing yourself.
7427000	7428000	I see.
7429000	7432000	But do you celebrate Arbor Day, just out of curiosity?
7432000	7434000	That has nothing to do with planting.
7435000	7436000	With planting a tree.
7436000	7437000	Subplanting.
7437000	7439000	Oh, sorry, I heard planting.
7440000	7448000	Alright, moving on. Fat Cylon responded and said, fat because I'm fat, not p-h-a-t.
7448000	7451000	Cylon because, well, I have a plan.
7451000	7452000	I have a plan.
7456000	7457000	I'm sorry, I love that answer.
7457000	7459000	It's just, it's very direct.
7459000	7462000	It's very, it's just very like, you know, hey, here it is.
7462000	7463000	I have a plan.
7465000	7469000	Cyber Judge responds and says, I use Cyber Judge in games most of the time.
7469000	7477000	However, since Blizzard's naming policy about no titles caused me to not be able to have Judge in my name back when I played WoW,
7477000	7482000	I now use names like C.Y. Jaden, I think is how you pronounce that. Sorry if I mispronounced that.
7482000	7487000	I don't think my name says anything about me. Maybe seeing Cyber Judge, you think I'm a Judge. I'm not.
7487000	7493000	I came up with that name because my real name was also a TV Judge's name, and co-workers started calling me Judge.
7493000	7497000	Judge was just too popular of a name, so I added Cyber to it.
7497000	7501000	I figured you would just like, judge people on the internet or something.
7502000	7503000	Alright, anyhow.
7503000	7511000	ActDeft responds to us over on Google+, saying, I've used Deft and many variations of it as my handle since I ever started using the internet,
7511000	7513000	and I keep using it just for recognition purposes.
7513000	7517000	Usually most people don't know what it means and probably don't expect something about it.
7517000	7529000	And lastly, PrincePeachFuzz responds to us on Google+, and says, I came up with PrincePeachFuzz because I was facially follicle challenged.
7531000	7538000	Again, another very honest, direct answer, but I actually love that name. PrincePeachFuzz is a pretty great name, I gotta say.
7538000	7542000	So there you go. Thank you guys for sharing those stories and answering. I know we didn't get a lot of answers tonight.
7542000	7548000	Probably because I posted the question really late, because I got back from Reno like three hours before the show, so it was a little later than usual.
7548000	7553000	But I appreciate the answers nonetheless. And I learned something about some of you this week, where your names come from.
7553000	7554000	I want to hear more stories.
7555000	7560000	Would you guys go answer the question anyway, even if I don't read them on air, just because I'm curious?
7560000	7562000	I want to know where some of your names come from. I'd be curious.
7562000	7565000	So just humor me and answer the question throughout the week.
7565000	7568000	Alright, let's get back into some longer news. Loki.
7568000	7575000	Alright, and I was actually just checking this out right now, although I didn't actually do anything.
7575000	7577000	I may have to restart my level in order to get this to show.
7578000	7582000	But there's been a new update to Minecraft Pocket Edition, or Windows 10.
7582000	7586000	I'm still pissed off that it's the Pocket Edition that it's based off of.
7586000	7590000	But they upgraded to 0.13. And what did they add with this?
7590000	7594000	Well, they added some of the basic redstone mechanics.
7594000	7602000	So they have the redstone torches, the redstone dust, also some of the pressure plates, buttons, that kind of thing.
7603000	7608000	The Nether. I'm surprised they didn't have the Nether there, but the Nether's there now.
7608000	7613000	Enchanting and, I guess, brewing as well.
7613000	7617000	And then also they've added rabbits to the game.
7617000	7619000	And sandstone temples and desert bottoms.
7619000	7623000	Like seriously, it's been so long I've played the PC version, there was not rabbits in the fucking PC version.
7623000	7627000	Like I need to go back to the PC version, it's probably going to be a completely different game for me when I see that.
7627000	7630000	I'd be like, what the fuck is all this shit going on?
7630000	7636000	Like I see these videos, my son watches with puffer fish and shit, and I'm like, what the fuck is that?
7636000	7638000	I'm like, I don't know that character.
7638000	7645000	But yeah, it's available as a free update, so if you haven't checked it out yet, you should definitely play it.
7645000	7654000	But what's the most frustrating thing though is that this game runs so well on the Windows 10 edition, but it's just not up to the PC yet.
7654000	7656000	And there's no mod support.
7656000	7659000	I noticed you were playing Minecraft during the break, was that the Windows 10 version?
7659000	7660000	Yeah, it was.
7660000	7662000	But it's not, you don't have the updated one yet.
7662000	7663000	Oh you do?
7663000	7664000	Yeah.
7664000	7665000	Is it getting better?
7665000	7666000	Is it getting there?
7666000	7667000	Yeah, it's getting better.
7667000	7672000	I mean, I'm just playing the creative, or not creative, survival mode thing that's like wasting time now.
7672000	7677000	I may have to start over in order to get the rabbits and stuff, but I don't know.
7677000	7678000	It's alright.
7678000	7681000	I just am kind of bored because I'm playing by myself.
7681000	7686000	That's why I kind of want to look into the mods so it's more of a challenge and stuff.
7686000	7688000	Alright.
7688000	7691000	Well, I need to check out the Windows 10 Minecraft updates.
7691000	7699000	But yeah, I really wanted to get to where the original PC version was at, but with the graphics rendering of the Windows 10 version.
7699000	7701000	The Windows 10 one runs awesome.
7701000	7704000	If they would just make a new client for the PC version, I'm fine with that.
7704000	7710000	You just get it to run better because it doesn't run very well, and the Windows 10 one runs so well.
7710000	7712000	And I think that's because it's based off the Pocket edition.
7712000	7713000	Alright.
7713000	7719000	Well, we're going to talk rumors, and I don't usually like to talk rumors on the show, but for two reasons I'm going to do it.
7719000	7725000	One, it's about Mass Effect, so therefore I totally love this series, as is Dark Sakura.
7725000	7727000	Loki, we never did convert, but maybe next time.
7727000	7732000	And two, this is something where it's on Reddit.
7732000	7738000	Again, I know grain of salt, but the moderators of the Mass Effect Reddit basically said,
7738000	7744000	We have reason to believe that this is coming from an actual source. It's an internal source.
7744000	7749000	So, again, take it with a grain of salt, but I don't know about you, Dark Sakura.
7749000	7751000	I'm ready for some details on Mass Effect Andromeda.
7751000	7752000	I know.
7752000	7753000	So, this is exciting.
7753000	7754000	So, here's the deal.
7754000	7759000	You will be accompanied by two AI squadmates, just like you were in previous Mass Effect games.
7759000	7766000	Two squadmates that came up, a blonde woman, and the krogan that's in the E3 trailer is one of the squadmates as well, it looks like.
7766000	7770000	Characters are equipped with jetpacks for environmental exploration.
7770000	7772000	So, that could be interesting.
7772000	7774000	Add kind of a third dimension to that.
7774000	7776000	Don't know if jetpacks will be in combat.
7776000	7782000	Apparently they're saying the omni-tool, you'll be more of that, and you'll be able to create a shield with your omni-tool.
7782000	7784000	And there'll be also more destructible cover.
7784000	7788000	Weapons otherwise will be the same as what you've seen before, but the ship is very different.
7788000	7791000	The Mako is visible inside the ship.
7791000	7795000	There's a meeting room with the squad members, which is kind of like the first game, or first trilogy.
7795000	7802000	You can manually fly the ship from location to location in first person rather than going on the galaxy map,
7802000	7805000	although you get a guide that you can use for rapid travel.
7805000	7807000	Waypoints and markers guide the player.
7807000	7810000	That's going to be interesting if you actually fly the ship yourself.
7810000	7811000	I wonder what you'll get from that.
7811000	7818000	There's also a Pathfinder's Quarters, which refers to the N7 protagonist title of Pathfinder.
7818000	7821000	They're on a quest to find a new world for humanity.
7821000	7826000	Other species, who you might recognize from previous games, are also on the hunt for a new planet.
7826000	7831000	There is a new enemy race, described as a cross between Vortia and Collectors,
7831000	7837000	which are two really nasty enemy types from the original trilogy.
7837000	7841000	And there's an antagonist the player can choose to kill or spare, which kind of seems like a duh.
7841000	7844000	That's a very common thread in Mass Effect games.
7844000	7849000	Also, as far as the graphics go, supposedly the facial models have been improved drastically.
7849000	7853000	Armor is customizable, but there's no further details than that.
7853000	7857000	So that is what's all pouring out right now about the new game.
7857000	7860000	Hopefully some official details from EA sooner rather than later,
7860000	7865000	but I'm going to guess they're going to keep it all under their hat until E3.
7865000	7871000	And I remember there were some earlier leaks on an internet forum way before they announced Mass Effect Andromeda
7871000	7875000	that talked about that the game would take place in the Andromeda Galaxy.
7875000	7880000	And so a lot of that is turning out to be seeing that too.
7880000	7886000	So I don't know how much longer EA is going to be able to keep the secrets there, but we'll see.
7886000	7889000	Well, they could always blacklist everyone who reports on it.
7889000	7893000	Right? Oh, I guess we got on the EA blacklist tonight because we opened our mouths and we talked about it.
7893000	7898000	Then again, I don't think we've ever had an EA person on this show or ever gotten.
7898000	7902000	So I don't know. I guess you can't lose what you don't have, right?
7902000	7903000	Whatever.
7903000	7905000	Well, there's harmonics, but...
7905000	7908000	It is what it is.
7908000	7909000	Anyway.
7909000	7910000	Yeah. Let's move on.
7910000	7917000	Well, the nominations for the game awards were announced.
7917000	7923000	However, with the jury this year, Killscreen has decided not to participate
7923000	7931000	because it was noted that all but one of the members of the jury were male.
7931000	7941000	And they basically stated out there that when they noticed the disparity on the jury, they decided not to participate.
7941000	7949000	They're committed to doing things 50-50 when it comes to gender and will only involve itself with companies that do the same.
7949000	7965000	One of the big things that was stated as well by the Polygon editor-in-chief is that, and this is just a quote,
7965000	7971000	it's not enough to simply acknowledge the gender imbalance while many editors on staff participated in selecting Polygon's nominations
7971000	7975000	and many will similarly participate in selecting our final vote in each category.
7976000	7987000	I've asked, and this is Jeff Keeley, moving forward, to replace Polygon's jury spot with, I can never pronounce this lady's name,
7987000	7994000	Megan Farrokhmanesh, to participate.
7994000	7999000	So, he's saying that basically you have to change it from within rather than without.
7999000	8005000	But I think in sitting out is a pretty good course of action as well.
8005000	8011000	If you don't want to be a part of anything that acts that way, then pull yourself from it.
8011000	8014000	I totally commend their action.
8014000	8024000	Yeah, it is a little, and the thing that kind of is interesting about this is that the Game Awards were called out on this last year.
8024000	8030000	And that's the part to me that kind of goes, they didn't really change anything from last year, did they?
8030000	8035000	So, I guess, yeah, now some people are going to get a little louder, and so that's what it takes.
8035000	8036000	Get really loud.
8036000	8037000	Yeah.
8037000	8038000	Make things change.
8038000	8046000	Also, I heard that they're going to scale down the show from three hours to two hours, and I'm kind of like, what the hell are they going to cut out?
8046000	8053000	Like, they were already cutting corners going, well, hey, since I'm interviewing you, why don't I just give you this award?
8053000	8056000	Are they going to cut out, like, Geoff Keighley's interviews and some of that?
8056000	8059000	Are they cutting out the Lifetime Achievement Award then, I guess?
8059000	8061000	Maybe because we didn't hear who's getting it this year, right?
8061000	8066000	Maybe they're cutting out music performances, which is okay, but...
8066000	8068000	I'm down with them cutting out music performances.
8068000	8071000	Well, but if they're performing music from a video game, then I'm okay with it.
8071000	8076000	But if it's just, like, random, like, hey, here's a metal band with a new single, then, you know, get out of here.
8076000	8081000	But I want to say, didn't they do something last year where they actually played a bit from, like, Zelda or something?
8081000	8087000	And my memory's fuzzy, sorry, guys. But I thought they had, like, there was, like, a little interlude or something, so...
8087000	8090000	I thought there was something around that, so...
8090000	8097000	William Murderface in chat says, well, many of us cut out caring about that award show a long time ago, so...
8097000	8105000	I guess I'm curious, I do still feel like, all these criticisms aside where, you know, I just sound like that cynical guy,
8105000	8112000	I do feel like the Game Awards were better than anything that's come before it that was on Spike TV and all that,
8112000	8117000	so I feel like it's still progress, even if there's a long way to go.
8117000	8125000	So I'll be interested to see if maybe they make positive steps in other places for this year's show. We'll see.
8125000	8127000	Moving on, Loki.
8127000	8133000	Alright, so, Fallout 4 has a game-breaking bug. I'm surprised it's just one.
8133000	8138000	But anyways, this bug, it's popped up and it actually renamed to a little bit of it.
8138000	8150000	The first place that they kind of noticed it was in Monsignor Plaza, and apparently when you try to travel in Monsignor Plaza,
8150000	8158000	it crashes to your desktop, and it affects both not only the PC players, but also PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
8158000	8162000	It doesn't happen to everybody, but some players are experiencing that.
8162000	8169000	Also, some players are experiencing that at other locations, and so basically you can't go to those locations.
8169000	8174000	You can step right up to the border of them, and as soon as you step in, boom.
8174000	8178000	So that kind of sucks. Haven't run into that yet.
8178000	8182000	I'm a little surprised it took this long to come out.
8182000	8186000	Especially if it's part of the story.
8187000	8192000	But it's not happening to everybody, and it's happening in different locations.
8192000	8194000	So maybe it's like certain graphics cards.
8194000	8196000	But it's happening on consoles, too.
8196000	8197000	Oh, shit.
8197000	8202000	So, it's just, I mean, come on, that's ridiculous.
8202000	8210000	And there's got to be something, these publishers, the software development companies, Sony and Microsoft,
8210000	8213000	have to do something to say, listen, this kind of shit is ridiculous.
8214000	8216000	I mean, all these companies are doing it.
8216000	8223000	Maybe we just need to step up to all these game companies that are releasing this shit all fucking broken.
8223000	8231000	Warner Brothers, EA, fucking Bethesda, releasing these games completely broken and fixing them after the fact.
8231000	8235000	There's got to be something that can be done.
8235000	8240000	I mean, it's kind of shady saying, oh, yeah, the game's perfectly fine.
8240000	8244000	And it's just like all fucked up in every single which way.
8244000	8247000	I think some of the glitches are funny.
8247000	8250000	But if it's breaking the game, then no, I don't think that's very funny.
8250000	8256000	All right, well, we'll see how they get out of this one.
8256000	8258000	I'm sure there'll just be a patch at some point.
8258000	8260000	Patches fix everything, right?
8260000	8263000	Well, the thing, though, is they're patching on PC first, and then they're going to do consoles.
8263000	8265000	So it could take a while before we see that.
8265000	8269000	Because the patches go through some huge quality check, right?
8269000	8275000	Exactly. And then along with that, though, some modders discovered some unused weapons in the game,
8275000	8279000	including a harpoon gun that didn't make it in.
8279000	8282000	Maybe it's going to be part of DLC or something like that.
8282000	8287000	But you can check it out if you have the PC version.
8287000	8291000	You can download the mod to bring in the gun.
8291000	8293000	So that's pretty cool.
8293000	8295000	All right.
8296000	8300000	Let's move on. Changing topics here to talk about Nintendo and something they've done this week.
8300000	8304000	They have opened up an official eBay store.
8304000	8307000	That's right. You can now shop for Nintendo products on eBay.
8307000	8310000	But don't look for things like actual auctions.
8310000	8314000	I don't know if you guys know, but eBay has a lot of the whole buy it now stuff.
8314000	8316000	So it's not really like an auction.
8316000	8321000	So they opened up a storefront where you can actually buy things like games and accessories.
8321000	8325000	But you're not really going to find a whole lot of difference between what you find in stores.
8325000	8328000	Mario Party 10 is still going to be $49.99 on the store.
8328000	8330000	Wow, what a deal then.
8330000	8336000	I guess Super Mario 3D World, they're showing us $30 US, where the list price is $59.99.
8336000	8341000	But I seem to think a lot of retailers have probably already slashed the price on some of those.
8341000	8347000	Let's take a look at eBay. Let's see how competitive they are.
8347000	8351000	I'm sorry. I just don't think that they're going to be offering great deals on that stuff.
8351000	8354000	Well, they're only selling 33 products in their store.
8354000	8357000	But you know what they're not selling on the Nintendo eBay store?
8357000	8359000	Amiibos. There's none of them.
8359000	8361000	No amiibo on the Nintendo eBay store.
8361000	8369000	Remember I was just saying earlier, wouldn't it be something if Nintendo just had a place where they could see how much demand there was for it and be able to make everybody happy?
8369000	8373000	I guess it's not so fun if you just go on eBay.
8373000	8377000	I guess they can't keep shelf space at GameStop if they turn to eBay and so forth.
8377000	8379000	It's just a little silly.
8379000	8384000	But anyway, I don't know. I've got to be honest. I'm looking through here. I don't see a lot of things where I'm like, ooh, I've got to get that.
8384000	8391000	My thought is, the reason why this store exists is probably not for me or you.
8391000	8401000	This is probably to catch some people, especially as the older generation, I think, turns more and more to online shopping to get around.
8402000	8407000	Honestly, now that I look at it, I do stand corrected. Their price is pretty good.
8407000	8412000	I mean, out of all the Buy It Now pricing, they are the lowest. Bravo to them.
8412000	8414000	Well, they're charging retail price, though.
8414000	8416000	$30. No, they're not charging retail price.
8416000	8419000	Oh. For that one specifically.
8419000	8422000	The retail price for Super Mario 3D World is still $60.
8422000	8425000	Interesting. Alright, so maybe you can catch a good deal.
8425000	8430000	So props to them on that one. But if you want to buy used, you may be able to find it cheaper.
8430000	8437000	And why couldn't maybe I get some classic Nintendo stuff? I guess they're pushing virtual consoles, so it does them no good to sell cartridges.
8437000	8443000	But wouldn't it be cool if I gave... Like, that's the type of stuff I shop for on eBay, is the classic stuff, but I guess Nintendo is not as good.
8443000	8451000	Yeah, I don't think I would buy, like, I don't know, from the actual publisher on eBay. I would think, okay, well, I'm going to look for the best deal.
8451000	8456000	But hey, I mean, in this case, they do have a pretty nice deal, so let's go for it.
8456000	8466000	Why can't they offer that digitally instead of fucking just, like, discount... Hey, here's an idea. Why don't you do some sales like PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace does?
8466000	8473000	That'd be nice. Discount your games instead of having to charge $60 for a game that doesn't even come down in price.
8473000	8483000	I feel like on Black Friday last year, they did do something like that. I mean, it's one day out of the year, but I feel like something will happen with that, so...
8483000	8490000	But anyway, the only thing, the thought I wanted to finish on the eBay thing is that, again, I don't think this storefront is for you or me.
8490000	8500000	I think it is for people who have turned online to doing shopping, where people are like, I want to get a 3DS for my granddaughter, because she's been talking about wanting Mario or whatever.
8500000	8508000	So, I kind of think this is just for a different audience, and this is just Nintendo trying to get more market coverage. I really think is what this boils down to.
8508000	8517000	I don't think it's really for the enthusiasts like you or me. But hey, if there's a deal in there once in a while, then what the hell? A deal's a deal, right?
8517000	8519000	So keep an eye on it.
8519000	8524000	Alright, let's move on. We're gonna get to the emails. Every week you guys email us.
8524000	8532000	Participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com is our email address. If you want to participate with the email bag segment in the show, participate at OrangeloungeRadio.com.
8533000	8537000	I don't think we had a lot of emails this week, but Dark Soccer's gonna dive in.
8537000	8538000	One long one.
8538000	8542000	One long one, she says tonight in our mailbag. Let's get to it, Dark Soccer.
8542000	8555000	Hi everyone, it's your friendly neighborhood Raginator. I just wanted to say that despite not being able to participate live during shows like I normally do due to temporarily not having internet at home, I do manage to catch shows via podcast.
8555000	8559000	I'm looking forward to seeing everyone again come May 2016.
8559000	8567000	Anywho, on to the meat and potatoes of my email. I was hoping to get your input in advance on my getting a new PC.
8567000	8569000	Excuse me.
8569000	8574000	Alright, now I'm contemplating between two retailers to go to for a gaming desktop PC.
8574000	8590000	I was wondering which in your opinions I'm better off going to. In terms of traditional brick and mortar stores, I'm considering going to Best Buy.
8590000	8598000	In terms of online retailers, I'm considering iBuyPower.com. Of the two, which am I better off going to?
8598000	8608000	When it comes to buy my new PC, I definitely want a gaming desktop. My spending limit will be $1350 including my sales tax, shipping, and handling if applicable.
8608000	8618000	I definitely want to go get the most bang for my buck, get the most powerful PC I can afford with said budget. That way hopefully I don't have to upgrade my parts for a while.
8618000	8621000	I'm gonna stop you right there. Build your own.
8622000	8633000	Yeah, I would say neither of those. I mean, I don't know about iBuyPower, but Best Buy, you're not going to find gaming PCs. They're going to be very limited on what they offer gaming PC wise, and it's probably going to be expensive.
8633000	8637000	Yeah. Build your own. Seriously?
8637000	8642000	But, I mean, if he doesn't know how to build his own, I would try even Newegg or something.
8642000	8655000	Yeah, Newegg is good. But, honestly enough, we built both mine and Dan's computers. Now, we already had our graphics card and power supplies, which would probably have been the most expensive parts.
8655000	8663000	We still built our pair of computers for $900. And both of them are gaming computers.
8663000	8676000	When I was mocking up a PC I was going to build for PC gaming and for the Oculus Rift, I think it was about $1300 that I was looking to spend.
8676000	8687000	And that was just from Newegg and different locations. If you definitely know how to build a PC, do it that way. Don't buy retail if you can avoid it.
8687000	8699000	Even if, or if you're going to buy retail, buy from a company that's going to make custom PCs. Don't buy an Alienware PC because it's overpriced.
8699000	8700000	And they're Dell.
8700000	8705000	And just, you know, maybe, I don't know.
8705000	8710000	William Murderface had a good analogy. It's like grown up Legos.
8710000	8721000	Yeah, I mean, half the fun is learning how to build that stuff. And it's not that hard. I mean, actually putting stuff together isn't hard. It's just figuring out what works together with each other and what you're going to need as far as spec-wise.
8721000	8732000	And finding the best deals is kind of the tricky part. But the actual assembly is not that hard. I mean, you can find instructions online on how to do it. It's not like a daunting task or anything.
8732000	8749000	And for the most part, it's you open it up, you punch out a little piece of perforated metal and stick your piece, the back end goes out, secure everything in, plug in some cables, you're done. It's easy.
8749000	8760000	Finally, Loki, I have an idea for you to use in Time to Car or any other game projects that you may work on. It's one of those so stupid it's actually brilliant ideas.
8760000	8770000	How about a rocket launcher? But not any ordinary rocket launcher. No, no, no. Instead of shooting rockets, it'll shoot, wait for it, weasels. Fuck yeah.
8770000	8778000	And these are no ordinary weasels either. These weasels will seek out human targets and summarily burrow up to the humans asses and then explode.
8778000	8784000	What? Or should I say ass-plode over the top? Yes, weird. Yes, but that's why it's so brilliant.
8784000	8787000	That's a little too postal for me, unfortunately.
8787000	8796000	Well, I will say, I can see them part way, but instead of a weasel, what about a ferret? Isn't that the OLR thing?
8796000	8802000	Yeah, I'm not going to put like rocket weasels or anything like that, although that sounds like an awesome name for a game.
8803000	8808000	Rocket weasel does sound like an awesome name for a game. We might have a dream game in the making here.
8808000	8812000	With the sequel Fuck It Ferret? I don't know.
8812000	8820000	Maybe it's like a buddy game, kind of like Banjo Kazooie or something. It's like, you know, Rocket Weasel and Fuck It Ferret.
8820000	8825000	I'm still waiting for someone to make Mortal Wombat. Anyhow.
8825000	8834000	Anyways, I got to get off. I said get off this library computer now since my time is up, but I hope everyone is well and I'll see you all as soon as I can.
8834000	8842000	One counterpoint I want to just offer real quick to the computer building thing, and I'm going to paint a lot of nerds with this, but I just want you to hear me out.
8842000	8850000	If your goal is to get back online and just play casual games, I actually don't know if you need to do all this build your own computer stuff.
8850000	8856000	I think it would be more fun, and if you are, you know, the nerdy type, you'd probably get more out of it for yourself.
8856000	8866000	But I think if you're like, quote unquote, desperate for a computer and you just want to be able to play casual games, because I know you play a lot of Steam games and like Magic and all that stuff.
8866000	8880000	Like, maybe just look for Black Friday. And again, I don't know when your finances will turn around, but yeah, I say Black Friday, but when you are able to, just look at getting a cheap all-in-one solution that, you know, has the specs for what you need.
8880000	8889000	And I know there's a lot of people that are going to disagree with me, but if you're not going to be doing the hardcore gaming, casual machine ought to do you just fine and get you back up and running.
8889000	8896000	You might even get a decent, like, a decent laptop. Like, my laptop wasn't that expensive. It was like a few hundred dollars.
8896000	8910000	And it's just, if you're looking for like a, I mean, desktop PC you're obviously going to get more out of, but if you're looking for like a laptop, anything with a dedicated graphics card and preferably not AMD, I got an AMD and it's okay.
8910000	8915000	But, you know, the way they do their chips, the APUs and stuff is kind of annoying.
8915000	8922000	But if you can find something like that, that would work out as well if you're not looking to play like, you know, really high-end games.
8922000	8932000	But yeah, if you can build your own, you're going to save the most money that way, because they really do, they mark up everything to try to, I mean, they got to make their money somewhere, so, I don't know.
8932000	8934000	Ask yourself, though, what do you really need?
8934000	8940000	I'm sure you've got a friend who's tech-savvy, if you're not, and just have them help you build a PC.
8940000	8945000	And if you, like, seriously don't have friends, there's like a Reddit, I can't believe I'm endorsing Reddit, but I am.
8945000	8952000	There's like a Reddit that's like, build me a PC, because I either, when I build, because I, well, I didn't build the PC.
8952000	8956000	See, here's the trick, Raginator, if you can't do it, date someone who can.
8956000	8958000	That's what I did.
8958000	8966000	But Alan built my PC, but I, you know, kind of told him like the specs and all that stuff, and we were actually kind of looking at that Reddit, that build your PC.
8966000	8973000	There's actually people out there, if you tell them the budget and all that, they'll come up with some ideas for you, so, there's a lot of online resources.
8973000	8980000	Alan is even chiming in here in chat, saying, pcpartpicker.com is a lifesaver, it deserves a shout-out.
8980000	8988000	Yeah, that was the site where you can actually, like, look at whatever parts you want to buy, and it finds what site has it cheapest, and it actually, like, monitors, like,
8988000	8995000	here's how much your computer would cost today, here's how much it was yesterday, here's how much it was a week ago, and it kind of, kind of, tracks that, which I think is good.
8995000	9003000	By the way, a lot of talk on Rocket Ferret, by the way, Embryon in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, please shoot me with ferret cannons all day.
9003000	9010000	I don't want them to crawl up my ass, but I would snuggle them forever. William Murderface asks, wouldn't Fuck It Ferret be a porn?
9010000	9019000	No. No, no, no. The word fuck is a very versatile word. In this case, fuck it doesn't mean, like, literally have sex with it, it just means, like, I'm done, fuck it.
9019000	9021000	Ferret's just like, fuck it, and goes up.
9021000	9026000	Yes. That is the ferret's special ability is to flip a table. Fuck it. And flips the table.
9026000	9029000	The table just appears out of hammer space.
9029000	9033000	And then the table smashes, the table smashes the enemy.
9033000	9036000	And, like, it's a giant table that lands on everyone on the screen.
9036000	9045000	Yes. I love it. Perfect. And we may already have somebody working on it. Dark Tetsuya says, Rocket Weasel. Oh, I might have to try and make that game.
9045000	9055000	So, there you go. And SSG100Matt, and I think ActDeft was saying this in another comment too, what I think you should do is buy a pre-built and upgrade it. It's the fastest and easiest solution for him.
9055000	9059000	I don't know if there is a correct answer here.
9059000	9065000	But you've got to be careful with buying pre-built and upgrading, because some of them you can't. I mean, you're limited on what you can. That's why building your own, so.
9065000	9073000	So, ask lots of questions if you are going to go that route. Ask questions. Don't just buy it because it's the cheapest. Ask yourself why it's cheap.
9073000	9078000	Anyway, I think we've given you a lot of ideas. Hopefully we didn't just confuse you more, but there you go.
9078000	9088000	That was it for emails, right? So, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you would like to submit an email for next time.
9088000	9095000	Meanwhile, it's time to get into the FUs of the week. It's time for us to get angsty. Why? Because...
9103000	9108000	Here is justice. Here is punishment. Here is...
9112000	9120000	I don't really have a legit FU. Except to just the problems I've had putting my staff play together.
9120000	9128000	So, I had to go out and buy more tacky glue. I was trying to debate if I'd get gorilla glue or tacky glue, but I love tacky glue.
9128000	9132000	Cosplay. Cosplay problems.
9132000	9134000	Loki.
9134000	9143000	I also don't really have an FU, I guess. I did want to take this point to say, they're making a sequel to Kung Pao finally, and I'm so excited about that.
9143000	9145000	I've been waiting so long for that.
9145000	9147000	FU to the fact that it took so long.
9147000	9153000	Yeah, FU to the fact that it took 13 years. You're wasting your fucking time with those stupid barnyard movies or whatever the fuck it was.
9153000	9155000	God, I know.
9155000	9163000	FU to the fact that I'm still coughing, like two weeks after I was sick. I'm still coughing, and it's really annoying.
9163000	9169000	And when I was up in Reno and it was a lot colder up there than it is here, like that cold just even irritated my cough worse.
9169000	9180000	So, FU to that nasty flu I had two weeks ago that took me out of the show and has continued to annoy me as I will be mid-sentence and then feel the need to cough.
9180000	9183000	Doing radio sucks when you have a cough, just saying.
9183000	9186000	But I love you guys. That's why I'm still here.
9186000	9194000	Alright, just a few more stories for you guys, and then phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9194000	9200000	Get on there and get ready to go, because I won't leave the Skype line open forever tonight, because we're already almost to 9 o'clock.
9200000	9204000	But before we get there, I do want to get to a couple more stories. So first, Loki.
9204000	9209000	So even though we haven't gotten to release stays for a couple weeks, I am looking forward to this.
9209000	9213000	Two Earth Defense Force games out on the same day, December 8th.
9213000	9222000	We're getting Earth Defense Force 4.1 on PlayStation 4 and Earth Defense Force Portable 2 or Earth Defense Force 2.
9222000	9228000	I'm not sure what the actual subtitle is on that, but those are both coming out.
9228000	9231000	That one, the second one is on PS or the Vita.
9231000	9242000	And yeah, so $50 for 4.1, which is kind of an expansion on 2025 that came out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
9242000	9252000	And then the Earth Defense Force 2 was a PlayStation 2 title that never came out over here.
9254000	9258000	So, gonna have to pick up 4.1, though.
9258000	9264000	I just figured we had to work. Any movement on Earth Defense Force is worthy of reporting on, right, Loki?
9264000	9270000	I would like to see a new game. Even like another Insect Armageddon game, I mean, it was okay.
9270000	9274000	It wasn't great, but it was still interesting. I don't know.
9274000	9280000	Alright. Well, we're gonna end tonight with a story on Mark Cuban. Oh yeah, that guy.
9280000	9284000	Well, you know, he's a very controversial owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.
9284000	9290000	Although, I gotta confess, I do like me some Shark Tank. That's a pretty good show. You guys ever watch Shark Tank?
9290000	9293000	I kind of like it. It's a guilty pleasure.
9293000	9295000	They have a lot of spin-off shows now.
9295000	9300000	Yeah, well, it was one of those shows that was getting really horrible ratings, but then it just kind of grew and grew.
9300000	9304000	But anyway, so Mark Cuban, you know, he's out there and he's a big business guy.
9304000	9306000	And why am I talking about him on a video game podcast?
9306000	9314000	Well, because he was in a charity event this week where he was playing League of Legends against the CEO of Intel.
9314000	9321000	And there was an interview that he did where he said he was actually talking about Colin Cowherd,
9321000	9326000	who was the one that was throwing the fit about esports getting airtime on ESPN.
9326000	9328000	And they ended up, like, I think he ended up leaving.
9328000	9334000	So anyway, Mark Cuban said, I love Colin, but he's an idiot when it comes to esports.
9334000	9339000	Don't hold back. I'm a noob. I'm still getting into it, but I love it.
9339000	9342000	It's like playing five-dimensional chess against the world.
9342000	9347000	It is one of the smartest games I've ever played. You've got to have dexterity. You've got to be quick.
9347000	9352000	This is a real sport. People are going to figure it out really, really quick.
9352000	9355000	Now, this man owns an NBA team.
9355000	9363000	I find that to be newsworthy, that he's putting his support behind saying, yes, League of Legends is a sport.
9363000	9370000	And I kind of really love that, how he calls it, five-dimensional chess.
9370000	9373000	It's a very, I kind of like that.
9373000	9381000	Anyway, so also just kind of funny, he actually dropped the F-bomb in the interview.
9381000	9387000	And the host let him know that he's going to be fined $15,000 for dropping the F-bomb in the interview.
9387000	9392000	But that was okay because all the fines were going to be donated to the CyberSmile Foundation charity.
9392000	9399000	So Cuban's response to the fine? Fuck it. And he ended up paying two fines to the charity.
9399000	9401000	That's awesome.
9401000	9407000	That's pretty awesome. I don't always agree with him, but he has his moments where he's pretty awesome, I've got to say.
9407000	9409000	So, there it is.
9409000	9412000	All right, we're going to open up the phone lines right now.
9412000	9417000	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9417000	9423000	If you want to get through and talk to us about anything we've talked about tonight, or maybe something we haven't talked about yet.
9423000	9427000	sj100matt saying he gets fined by the NBA all the time, so it's kind of an in-joke with him.
9427000	9431000	I see that. All right, anyway, the phones are lighting up already, so let's get to it.
9431000	9433000	Hi, you are on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9433000	9435000	Hey, it's Sterlok.
9435000	9437000	Hey, I'm glad to hear from you, Sterlok. How you doing?
9437000	9439000	Pretty good.
9439000	9441000	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9441000	9445000	Not too much. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Xbox One.
9445000	9454000	I was hoping that was the case. Tell us a little bit about, from your perspective, what all's changed with Xbox One and why it's important.
9454000	9467000	Well, yeah, with the new Xbox experience thing, they added a bunch of access changes, and one of them was Narrator, which is pretty awesome.
9467000	9472000	It's actually a lot better than what Sony did.
9472000	9476000	What does the Narrator feature do for those that haven't experienced it?
9476000	9487000	It's a screen reader, basically. It will say, you know, what you're highlighting and all that fun stuff, so you have a speech on your console.
9487000	9489000	That's great.
9489000	9499000	PS4 has this as well, but it's very, very, it's less bare bones than it was, but it's still not very good.
9499000	9508000	Have you found that this has opened the door up to experience maybe something that you have yet to experience?
9508000	9516000	Yeah, actually. I mean, I had a 360 and I played the crap out of it.
9516000	9526000	The reason I got the 360 over the PS3 was because of the web store.
9526000	9535000	So you could buy games directly in your browser, and then next time you're sharing it on your console, it'll just download it.
9535000	9540000	Because narrators on the web browser, that's common.
9540000	9544000	Microsoft has that built into Internet Explorer as a part of Windows, right? That's very common.
9544000	9551000	Yeah, well, actually, most blind people use external screen readers.
9551000	9565000	Well, I kind of use a combination of Mac, which has a screen reader called VoiceOver, and a Windows screen reader called NVDA, Non-Visual Desktop Access.
9565000	9574000	But yeah, no, it was just a web interface, so it was literally just a web page, so it made it really easy.
9574000	9583000	But now with this on the Xbox One, don't need all that. It will actually let you buy things from the console.
9583000	9588000	That's fantastic. I'm glad to hear about this progress.
9588000	9608000	Yeah, well, the sad thing is it took, I don't know how many people knew this or if you guys knew this, but the reason they're doing this is because of a law that passed.
9608000	9610000	Oh, I didn't.
9610000	9635000	It was, I forget the name of it now, but it was a ruling that was made several years ago that basically required devices, like entertainment devices, to be accessible, at least the communication side of it.
9635000	9651000	That's kind of important because, well, games and consoles were granted a waiver for a few years, but that finally expired.
9651000	9671000	So now they are required to have at least some functionality, like with the communication and stuff. Not everything is required.
9671000	9678000	I think especially with the PS4, they just kind of did the minimum of what they had to do.
9678000	9679000	I gotcha.
9679000	9687000	So Microsoft kind of, you know, they took their time and they added a little more maybe than what the law requires. I had no idea there was a lot more.
9687000	9699000	There was only, to my knowledge, there's only like two things that don't read all that well, which are achievements and the community section.
9699000	9700000	Okay.
9700000	9710000	Everything else is, oh, and of course, like external apps. You know, like Hulu and WWE, that kind of stuff.
9710000	9723000	Let me ask you this before I let you go. What do you think would be a great, like, you know, as a gamer who benefits from these accessibility enhancements, what would you like to see next?
9723000	9733000	What do you think should be next on the list for Microsoft or Sony to do to make the experience even better? What would help you out?
9733000	9745000	Well, the ultimate thing is something that will never happen, sadly, and that is that, you know, game menus would read.
9745000	9758000	But there's no way they're going to, you know, be able to, unless they built an API, which they aren't going to, you know, like to have game menus read would be pretty sweet.
9758000	9769000	You know what though, Sturlock? Never say never, because maybe some developer, you know, I do know we have some industry people that listen to this show, just a few, and not all of them are vocal.
9769000	9781000	But this is, I think, sometimes a good thing for them to hear because, you know, maybe if even in the system themselves, they can't mandate that the menus are readable, maybe that developer who's making their game might think,
9781000	9790000	you know, it wouldn't really be that hard for me to go in and have a button that you hit, and then it will read the menu, and that will help more people enjoy my game. Maybe somebody will hear that.
9790000	9804000	Yeah. I mean, I never thought that this was going to happen, honestly. So, yeah, you never know.
9805000	9812000	But I mean, I have now retracted my I will never get by an Xbox One statement.
9812000	9813000	It means a lot.
9813000	9824000	It took me four years, or however, no, it was three years. Whenever they made their stupid DRM announcement, that was just like, nope, I'm done.
9824000	9828000	Which they're still trying to recover from in many ways.
9829000	9840000	But, you know, they have really kind of gone above and beyond, and this is pretty awesome. So, I think I know which console I'm getting.
9840000	9846000	Alright. Well, Sturlock, thanks so much for the phone call. I'm going to let you go to try to squeeze in some more calls, but have a good one, and it's great to hear from you.
9846000	9847000	Alright, you too.
9847000	9848000	Alright, take care.
9848000	9849000	Yep. Bye.
9849000	9856000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, if you'd like to give us a call.
9856000	9858000	And here we go. Phones are lighting up again. Let's get to it.
9858000	9860000	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9860000	9861000	Hey, it's Embryon.
9861000	9863000	Hey, how you doing?
9863000	9864000	I am well.
9864000	9865000	Great.
9865000	9868000	I'm glad you're doing a little bit better, even though you're still coughing.
9868000	9880000	Yeah, I know. I hate when somebody's probably sitting there at home going, get that guy some tea. I drank some coffee. That's my hot drink of choice. But, yeah, I probably need some tea with honey. Maybe I'll enjoy that after the show. We'll see.
9880000	9883000	Yeah, I suppose. Whatever works. It's all good.
9883000	9885000	So, what's on your mind tonight?
9885000	9897000	I'm just calling to say hey. I played some Final Fantasy 14 tonight. I've been doing that, and I'm wrapping up the weekend with some Yokai Watch. Have you guys talked about that much?
9897000	9905000	I did a little bit, because I was playing a little bit of Yokai Watch. I think I'm on Chapter 5, and there's, what, 11 chapters in the game? I think I'm on Chapter 5.
9905000	9917000	But, yeah, I think a lot of people were really harsh on the demo, and I think the full game is a lot of fun. I like it. What are your thoughts on Yokai Watch?
9917000	9924000	Kind of the same. I wasn't super impressed by the demo, but I think the full version kind of opens up some of the breadth the game has to offer.
9924000	9934000	I think that in typical Level 5 tradition, there are some parts of the game that are really focused and really good, and then other parts that are kind of head-scratchingly obtuse.
9934000	9941000	Because I think that it's a really pretty game. I love the designs of the Yokai. I love the animations, and I love the idea.
9942000	9949000	It's a really fun little town and world to wander around in, but there are some things like, I think the quest design could use some work.
9949000	9955000	Like, I don't know, have you gotten to one of the points where you have to upgrade your Yokai Watch before you can enter an area?
9955000	9959000	Yeah, I had to get the grandpa's underpants.
9959000	9970000	Yeah, so there's some parts where you have to go fight certain Yokai to upgrade your watch, but the current main story quest overwrites that as far as the markers on the map.
9970000	9977000	So it's really hard to figure out where you're supposed to go, and I guess I could read the dialogue better.
9977000	9983000	I don't know, but it feels like when you accept one of those quests, I wish they would just put the markers for the Yokai you need to fight on the map.
9983000	9991000	But other than that, I think it's really cute. I think it's a good example of a Pokemon clone quote-unquote game done right,
9991000	9998000	although it does seem kind of weird that they're shying away so much from taking away the Japanese-ness of it.
9998000	10002000	Like, welcome to Springdale, USA. My name is Nate.
10002000	10012000	It's super obviously taking place in Japan, like Yokai or Japanese spirits, and even the bathhouse that you go to early in the game, right?
10012000	10014000	Like, you're getting an old man's fundoshi.
10014000	10019000	Yeah, I mean, it's funny because you do say that, and there are certain parts of the game that are very clearly translated over,
10019000	10023000	but there's other parts, like even very, very early in the game.
10023000	10026000	I don't consider this a spoiler because you're going to get into this within the first hour of the game.
10026000	10032000	But, you know, you find out that there's this cat that, you know, you're trying to rescue, and then if you didn't already know,
10032000	10038000	Yokai is, because I didn't really realize this when I was first playing the game, Yokai is like dead spirits in Japan.
10038000	10044000	So the cat talks about how he was run over by a car, and he's dead, and I'm like, this is a game for children.
10044000	10045000	Right?
10045000	10046000	Because it feels a little dark.
10046000	10049000	Like, surprisingly heartbreaking. I was like, oh, poor kitty.
10049000	10054000	I know, and me too, because I am, you know me, I'm a total cat person, so when I hear, like, cat getting hit by car,
10054000	10059000	I have that instant response of, oh, you know, like, it hurts my heart.
10059000	10061000	And so I'm like, this is for kids? I don't know.
10061000	10068000	But, you know, at the same time, kids are going to find out about that stuff eventually.
10068000	10075000	I guess it's kind of the same if you think about Pokémon essentially being like humans trapping animals and forcing them to fight to the death.
10078000	10079000	It's true.
10079000	10086000	One other thing that people don't often talk about about the game that definitely caught my eye is the 3D in the 3DS.
10086000	10088000	We don't talk about that a lot anymore with games.
10088000	10092000	When you were talking about, like, the graphics, the 3D effects are really well done, I think.
10092000	10094000	That was just something I picked up on.
10094000	10098000	I realize most people have probably long since shut off the 3D, which is fair.
10098000	10106000	The game still looks fine without the 3D effects, but I was just, I was, like, the way the cloud bursts when you spot a Yokai is a really cool 3D effect, I think.
10106000	10110000	Yeah. Every now and then there will be a time I turn the 3D back on for a game.
10110000	10115000	Like, the most recent time I did that was with Legend of Legacy, because I really like the storybook pop-up effect in that.
10115000	10119000	And then this is another one that I think actually makes really good use of it.
10119000	10126000	Because, like you said, it's easy to forget about almost, because even though the system is called the 3DS, I think many of us just sort of forgo that.
10126000	10132000	Because, at least for me, 3D hurts my eyes and gives me a headache after a little while, so I, like, tend to just kind of leave it off.
10132000	10133000	But it works well in this.
10133000	10142000	And the Yokai cam is pretty cute, too. If totally silly and superfluous, whatever, but it's still, it's fun to use that.
10142000	10147000	Have you found that Tumblr that has nothing but a collection of all the QR codes for Yokai Watch?
10147000	10148000	No, I haven't.
10148000	10152000	You need to check that out, because then you get all these coins to use in the little machine.
10152000	10158000	And that's how I got, like, a B-rank Yokai, like, in Chapter 4. Like, when you haven't even upgraded your watch yet.
10158000	10160000	I better do that then.
10160000	10167000	Exactly, right? It'll give you a little bit of an edge in the game. Awesome. Well, thanks for calling and talking to Yokai Watch with us. Appreciate it.
10167000	10168000	For sure. Take care.
10168000	10170000	Alright, take care. Good to hear from you.
10170000	10178000	Alright, let's get to some more calls. 1-877-GAME-OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
10178000	10183000	It's not ringing right away again, so I think I have a moment to go to Loki and see if there's a last minute story.
10183000	10186000	I think your mic might be off, Loki.
10186000	10193000	Sorry, I can tell you that the PlayStation TV has come down in price even more. You can get it for $20 at Best Buy.
10193000	10197000	What? The PlayStation TV? That 3D TV thing?
10197000	10200000	No, the PlayStation TV as in the portable Vita.
10200000	10202000	Oh, God. Okay, so I'm...
10202000	10204000	The Vita for your TV.
10204000	10207000	Okay, you know where my mind went, though, right? It was the actual TV.
10207000	10213000	Oh, shit. If it was $20, I'd be like, I'm sorry, I leave, gotta go get me a 3D TV.
10213000	10217000	$20 for a 3D TV? I could use that as a computer monitor, right?
10217000	10218000	Yeah.
10218000	10221000	I've always wanted to play triple screen Final Fantasy IV.
10221000	10225000	But seriously, you should pick $20. Come on, man. At the very least, it's a Vita you can play on TV.
10225000	10227000	You could probably use it as a PlayStation 1.
10227000	10229000	That's not bad. That's really not a bad deal.
10229000	10235000	That's not a bad deal. I don't use mine at all, but it was worth the $30 I paid for it.
10235000	10237000	You can play the PSP games with it, right?
10237000	10238000	You play PSP games?
10238000	10246000	It would be worth $20 just to play the Final Fantasy IV remake that was on PSP. It was the 2D remake.
10246000	10252000	Because there was one. Remember, the 3D remake is what's shown up on tablets and PC and 3DS.
10252000	10258000	No, the 2D remake, which is really good, is on PSP. I would pay the $20 for a Vita TV just to play that.
10258000	10260000	Plus, I have pixel shits on there, so...
10260000	10264000	That's right. Pixel shits. If you got it when you still could.
10264000	10265000	Yes.
10265000	10266000	Because I don't think you can anymore.
10266000	10268000	No. But it's preserved.
10268000	10271000	It is. Unless maybe there's a mod way to do it.
10271000	10275000	And I would hate to say piracy, especially for one of YYR's games.
10275000	10280000	But maybe there's a way to do it, and maybe you could PayPal YYR a dollar and he'll be fine.
10280000	10281000	It's free on his website, too.
10281000	10284000	Oh, is it? I don't know. We'll have to see what his opinion is on that.
10284000	10288000	If it's possible to backdoor the game into the Vita TV.
10289000	10292000	Let's see. ActDeftInChat says,
10292000	10296000	Until PSTV can play Taiko New Tatujin, I'll get one.
10296000	10300000	And bonds006 says, I was thinking the same thing, which I'm assuming is about the monitor.
10300000	10303000	So I'm glad I'm not the only one that jumped to that conclusion.
10303000	10305000	But also, what does that say about that device?
10305000	10310000	That when you said PlayStation TV, it was not the first thing that came to mind.
10310000	10313000	It should have been just... What did they call it before?
10313000	10317000	It was the Vita TV or the... What did they call it before?
10317000	10319000	Like in Japan, it's the Vita TV.
10319000	10323000	But here, since the Vita is not really a thing, it's not the same thing.
10323000	10327000	For $20, I mean, shit. Fucking get, like, Netflix works on it.
10327000	10329000	Fucking get Hulu to work on it for 20 bucks and be like,
10329000	10333000	Hey dude, you can fucking stream shit with this for 20 bucks.
10333000	10338000	But my TV already has PlayStation 4 on it, so...
10338000	10342000	I understand that, but my boxing, my fucking old ass thing is falling apart.
10342000	10344000	Like, it loses internet connection all the time.
10344000	10348000	Like, shit. 20 bucks. Come on.
10348000	10352000	Now, see, I'd get a PlayStation TV and bring it here in the studio on this TV.
10352000	10354000	And then that would allow us to, if we wanted to, during the show.
10354000	10357000	We never do this. We never play games during the show.
10357000	10359000	But, anymore. We used to.
10359000	10360000	But maybe if we had guests in the studio or whatever,
10360000	10363000	we could actually stream from the PlayStation 4 to this TV.
10363000	10366000	So, there's still that part of me that's like,
10366000	10371000	Maybe I should bring the PS4 in here and then we can do a broadcast
10371000	10373000	with the PS camera during the show.
10373000	10375000	But then, you know, I'm always also, I'm like,
10375000	10378000	But this is Orange Lounge Radio, not Orange Lounge Video.
10378000	10380000	I don't think it's that exciting to watch. I really don't.
10380000	10382000	So...
10382000	10384000	But some of our listeners seem to miss it, so I don't know.
10384000	10385000	I'm thinking about it.
10385000	10387000	It's more exposure, though.
10387000	10391000	That is true. That's honestly a big reason why I'm thinking about it.
10391000	10394000	I'm like, Well, if we did put it on Twitch,
10394000	10398000	then that's gonna be potential way more exposure for the show.
10398000	10401000	Even though I think this is super boring to watch.
10401000	10406000	But there's a lot of gaming podcasts that are just talking heads on Twitch,
10406000	10407000	and they do very well.
10407000	10410000	So, you know, and no shade against those shows.
10410000	10412000	They're getting great numbers, so what can I do?
10412000	10414000	I just, I'm always kind of like,
10414000	10417000	But it's radio, not television. I don't know.
10417000	10419000	Anyway.
10419000	10420000	You all right?
10420000	10421000	Yeah.
10421000	10422000	Okay. Did you have a comment?
10422000	10423000	No.
10423000	10424000	Oh, okay.
10424000	10425000	You just picked up your mic suddenly.
10425000	10426000	I thought you were gonna say something.
10426000	10428000	Yeah, when I was about to sit on it.
10428000	10430000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10430000	10431000	Our username on-
10431000	10432000	Most people wanna listen to my butt.
10432000	10433000	Our username on Skype.
10433000	10435000	Orange Lounge Radio.
10435000	10436000	Last call for calls.
10436000	10438000	If we don't get any more, we'll shut it down,
10438000	10440000	and we will call it a night.
10440000	10442000	And then we'll all go get cheesecake.
10442000	10443000	Oh, my God.
10443000	10445000	Did I tell you how much I ate this weekend?
10445000	10446000	I don't care.
10446000	10447000	Go eat cheesecake with me.
10447000	10448000	No, seriously?
10448000	10451000	No, I can't, because yesterday I went to the buffet,
10451000	10453000	and my fat ass had two full plates at the buffet,
10453000	10454000	because it was good.
10454000	10455000	It was good.
10455000	10456000	Only two?
10456000	10457000	Only two.
10457000	10458000	And then dessert.
10458000	10459000	And then-
10459000	10460000	Girl.
10460000	10461000	I went to-
10461000	10464000	And then my friend that I was with was like,
10464000	10466000	there's a hash house at Go-Go in Reno.
10466000	10467000	We gotta go.
10467000	10468000	So we ended up having a late night set.
10468000	10470000	I couldn't eat more food.
10470000	10472000	I think I had half a side of fries.
10472000	10473000	That's all I could even-
10473000	10476000	And even that was like, oh, my God, I'm so fat.
10476000	10479000	And then this morning, we had Steak and Shake,
10479000	10482000	because I can't go to Reno and not go to Steak and Shake,
10482000	10484000	because we don't have them here in California.
10484000	10486000	I'm telling Becky right now that I wanna go to Farrell's.
10487000	10490000	And again, I'm sure lots of people throughout the rest of the country are like,
10490000	10492000	Steak and Shake is not that big a deal.
10492000	10494000	Steak and Shake is that big a deal.
10494000	10500000	Try not having it, and then realizing you can't get a birthday cake shake at McDonald's,
10500000	10501000	or whatever else.
10501000	10505000	Or, everyone in the South, imagine no Waffle House.
10506000	10508000	Waffle House does not exist here in California.
10508000	10511000	But I actually, you're the only one that sticks up for Waffle House.
10511000	10513000	Most people tell me it's shit.
10513000	10517000	Except the waffles are, like, which I would fucking hope,
10517000	10519000	if you were to call your place Waffle House,
10519000	10521000	your waffles fucking pass.
10521000	10522000	The grits-
10522000	10523000	I've never been to one.
10523000	10526000	I'm a lifelong Californian, I've never been to a Waffle House.
10526000	10528000	The grits have to stick up.
10528000	10530000	The spoon has to stick up in the grits.
10530000	10532000	Waffle House.
10532000	10534000	See, Brad says, told me to shut my mouth.
10534000	10536000	Well, don't you tell me what to do, first of all.
10537000	10541000	But, Waffle House is amazing, and their grits are amazing.
10541000	10544000	Waffle House is amazing, and their grits are godly,
10544000	10547000	and I still have bags of grits from Waffle House in my cupboard.
10548000	10550000	I said imagine no Waffle House,
10550000	10553000	and that's what it's like for us not having steak and shake.
10553000	10556000	So you shut your whore mouth in return.
10556000	10559000	I'm having an argument with someone typing, this is great.
10559000	10562000	Imagine there's no waffles.
10562000	10564000	No, I don't wanna.
10564000	10567000	But it makes me want to go back now and have Waffle House.
10567000	10570000	At least have the grits at home, so that's good.
10570000	10572000	When are you gonna make me grits?
10572000	10573000	Come to my house.
10573000	10575000	Kiss my grits.
10576000	10578000	I need you to make some grits.
10578000	10580000	See, he told me he doesn't have a whore mouth.
10580000	10582000	He has a slut mouth because he's going to get paid.
10583000	10585000	Alright, the phones aren't lighting up,
10585000	10587000	and this is just descending into toilet bowl humor,
10587000	10589000	so I think it's time to wrap up the show.
10589000	10591000	Thanks to those that did get through tonight.

10617000	10620000	FUGL Question of the Week about your usernames,
10620000	10621000	because I want to know.
10621000	10623000	Because some of you have some really weird usernames.
10623000	10624000	I want to know the story.
10624000	10627000	So, but that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10628000	10630000	Thank you guys so much for downloading and checking out our show
10630000	10632000	or listening live, whatever the case may be.
10632000	10633000	Thank you for supporting independent radio.
10633000	10635000	And you know what? If you thought this show was stupid,
10635000	10637000	I don't know how you made it all three hours,
10637000	10639000	but thank you for doing so.
10639000	10642000	And check out another indie podcast, then,
10642000	10643000	if you didn't like what you heard here.
10643000	10646000	Just support indie podcasting and the people that do this
10646000	10647000	just because they love it.
10647000	10649000	Spread indie podcasting like an STD.
10649000	10650000	That's right.
10650000	10651000	With love.
10651000	10653000	Spread it with your whore mouth.
10654000	10656000	Becky was listening.
10656000	10658000	Maybe that'll be on a future iTunes comment.
10658000	10660000	Spread it with your whore mouth.
10660000	10661000	That'll be our new tagline.
10661000	10663000	Anyway, maybe that can be on the shirt.
10663000	10664000	O-L-R.
10664000	10665000	Spread your mouth.
10665000	10667000	O-L-R. Spread it with your...
10668000	10671000	Okay, now Jamie just convinced me maybe we do need video
10671000	10673000	because she made a face.
10675000	10676000	You may have...
10676000	10678000	I've made Rob convulse.
10678000	10680000	Damn this cough.
10680000	10681000	All right.
10681000	10682000	All right.
10682000	10683000	We're definitely done.
10683000	10684000	Thank you guys for supporting the show.
10684000	10685000	Please consider...
10685000	10689000	Tell a friend or two or five or 15, 25 about the show.
10689000	10690000	Help us spread the word.
10690000	10693000	A five-star review on a place like iTunes, Stitcher Radio
10693000	10697000	or wherever you found this show goes a long way as well.
10697000	10699000	Appreciate all of that.
10699000	10700000	Thank you guys again.
10700000	10702000	We will be back in two weeks.
10702000	10704000	Remember, we will not be here next week.
10704000	10708000	Those of you in the States have a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday.
10709000	10712000	Those of you overseas, have a great week.
10712000	10713000	Have some turkey.
10713000	10715000	In honor of your American friends.
10715000	10716000	That's right.
10716000	10717000	Have some pumpkin pie in honor of me.
10717000	10720000	In celebration of spreading death and disease.
10722000	10723000	Anyhow...
10723000	10724000	Small pox.
10724000	10725000	A gift from England.
10725000	10727000	Let's go ahead and wrap things up.
10727000	10728000	We're done.
10728000	10729000	We're definitely out of here.
10729000	10730000	Just kidding.
10730000	10731000	Hearts.
10731000	10733000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
10733000	10734000	Loki, how about you?
10734000	10735000	What's your final thought tonight?
10735000	10737000	At least it wasn't large pox.
10739000	10743000	My final thought is that in two weeks I would like to be rid of this cough completely.
10743000	10746000	Let's all cross our fingers and our toes.
10746000	10748000	Dark Sakura, last but not least.
10748000	10749000	Your final thought.
10749000	10750000	Drink half a bottle of bourbon.
10750000	10751000	You won't care.
10752000	10755000	I did have unlimited Jack and Cokes last night.
10755000	10758000	I didn't talk about my trip to a country bar here on the show.
10758000	10760000	I guess we'll have to save that for another week.
10762000	10763000	Have a wonderful week everybody.
10763000	10766000	We'll see you in two weeks with another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
