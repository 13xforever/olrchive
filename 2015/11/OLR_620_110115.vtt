Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
There's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
This week, Twitch breathes new life into art with the resurgence of infamous big-haired painter Bob Ross, while new life was also given to some DRM-laden plastic games.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
Raise your Bob Ross kappas, zappas, and join us in our happy little Studio N7 on this week's show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 620 for this November the 1st of 2015.

00:44.000 --> 00:51.000
I hope all you guys that celebrated Halloween yesterday had a happy and safe one and are on Candy OD today.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
So, you know, you can sit around and eat Snickers bars and play video games and listen to us talk about games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
Myself here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, Rob Roberts, joined by DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Boar.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
How are you?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Um, yeah.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Yeah?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Yeah.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm fantastic.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
Is that fantastic?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
I'm glad you are.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm glad you're fantastic.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Are you not fantastic?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
I don't know.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
You're so difficult to get emotion out of sometimes.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I know. That's what I do.

01:25.000 --> 01:32.000
If you were an NPC in a video game, you'd be the one that you walk up to and you press A and the character pops up and just says dot, dot, dot.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
I'd be the Tsundere.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Is that what they're called?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
I guess.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Alright. Also, say hello to Tech Master, Loki.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Hi.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Hi, Loki. How are you?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
I'm doing fine.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
So, not that I'm nosy, but I'm totally nosy and I notice you're on the Humble Bundle website right now.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
I got like four emails from them and I was like, is there anything good on here?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Nope.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
You are being tempted by Humble Bundles, I thought.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
No, I'm not.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Oh.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
I'm not because I don't have the money for it right now and there's something I really want, so.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
They still the Capcom Bundle or is that done now?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
That's done.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
It's the Humble Jumbo Bundle 5 now or something like that.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Gotcha.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
Well.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Doesn't have any games I want.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
At least it's, you know, all charity and all that.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Well, hell, there's games I didn't even realize that were in my library.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Like, I just saw Command & Conquer Red Alert 3.

02:13.000 --> 02:21.000
I'm like, wait, I thought I had that like little like teaser thing that they had as part of the EA Bundle, but I don't remember getting the full game, but apparently it's there.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
So, somewhere I bought that.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Alright.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
I don't even remember anymore.

02:26.000 --> 02:35.000
We are joined in studio tonight with some special guests, but I do also want to give a shout out to the other ever present fourth guest on our show, the Chat Room.

02:35.000 --> 02:42.000
If you are listening live to our program, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

02:42.000 --> 02:51.000
And if you are listening live, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after Bobby Black Wolf, and you can chat along with the show live, live.vognetwork.com.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
And over in chat, Tiger Claw says, we didn't have any trick-or-treaters show up, so we had all the candy to ourselves.

02:57.000 --> 03:04.000
Yeah, I noticed like less and less trick-or-treaters are actually out there and it's probably because, you know, people are crazy and, you know.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
But actually I found in our neighborhood, Alan actually went out and bought like candy at the dollar store or whatever, so he'd have something to give away.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
Because last year he got caught without candy and he answered the door and there were some kids there and he had that awkward moment of uh.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
And like luckily we had like an emergency supply of Smarties, because who actually eats Smarties, right?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
So we had an emergency supply as we gave it to the kids.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
But this year he was better prepared and we actually had the light on.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Apparently he gave it all away.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
And I was like, wow, we had enough kids show up in the neighborhood.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Oh, that reminds me.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Yeah?

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Is it candy?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
It must be candy.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Shut up.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Yay.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Trick-or-treat.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Smell my feet.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I was gonna say there was always that Japanese candy if you had any more of that left.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Fucking yes.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
There's this uh.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
She got my favorite.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
It's the little.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And clearly she has picked them all out of the bag.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yes I did.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.000
She got me the vanilla Tootsie Rolls, which are my favorite.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
I picked them out of the bag for you.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
Yeah.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Actually I picked them out for me and then I decided I wouldn't eat them so that I gave them to you.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Now I feel like a true rock star.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Because, you know, like those uh.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
I only want the green M&Ms.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
You have to pick out all the green M&Ms from the bag.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
They taste different.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
That's right.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
The green ones make you horny.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Uh, let's see.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Go into our chat over at live.vognotework.com.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
ActDeaf says, I want to get Undertale on Steam.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
The soundtrack is pretty good.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
You know, I've heard a lot of good things about that game.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
I haven't picked it up myself yet, but I hear a lot of comparisons to like Earthbound and that it's like a love letter to video games.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
So I'm very curious about it.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
I watched a YouTuber play part of it.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
It looked okay.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yeah, it looked alright.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I'll have to check that out.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
If you want to recommend some games, join our chat room over at live.vognotework.com.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
But we do have some friends in studio.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
These are actually some new friends to OLR.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
These guys have not been on the show before.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
But there's some guys that I've known for a little while.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
So I'm going to let them introduce themselves.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Because I don't know if they want to use their real name on the show.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
But first off, joining us tonight we have.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
Hi, I'm Mike.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
Hi Mike, how are you?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm good.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Good.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Make sure when you talk in the mic, get real close to the mic.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Make sweet love to the mic.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Otherwise they can't hear you.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
You have to practically deep throat the mic.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
You do.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
You do.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
You do a little bit.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Should not be that challenging.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Alright.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
How are you doing?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Doing good.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Good.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Welcome.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Welcome to the show.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
So you've listened to OLR before.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
You know what you're getting into, right?

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
Yeah.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Yeah.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
And you and I have played Final Fantasy XIV online together before, right?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yes.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
What do you play in XIV?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
I'm in Ora.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
A male Ora.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
The new race.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
The Ora.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Well, I started up when it came out for Mac.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
So I was interested in playing with a controller.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And the Mac client's not as bad now.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It was awful at first.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Gotcha.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
And folks that are listening live, I am trying to get his voice up a little bit.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
So sometimes we have to adjust.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
I'll talk a little louder.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Talk a little louder.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Thank you.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Perfect.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
Sounds good.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
And in chat they say, Mike sounds just like Shane.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
No.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Okay.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
I'll spice it up a little.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
There you go.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
There you go.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Which is funny because Shane is actually here in the studio.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
And it's not like there's this weird like twin identity thing.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
But I don't know if Shane's actually.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Shane just wants to play on his cell phone tonight.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
They could do that though.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
We'll see.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
I'll speak with some excitement.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
There you go.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
A little more enthusiasm than what Shane usually gives us.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Appreciate it.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
All right.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
What other games do you play besides XIV?

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
I'm pretty much addicted to Hearthstone right now.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Last month I spent pretty much the whole month.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.000
I took a break from XIV because we're in the lull of waiting for the patch.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
And so I decided to try to push for Legend in Hearthstone.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Which is the top ranks and stuff.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
And I didn't quite make it to my goal.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
But I peaked at rank 4.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And it's a ladder system.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
So up to rank 1.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
After rank 1 it's a legend pool.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
So made it up to rank 4.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
And then I don't know what happened.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
But slipped all the way back down.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
And boo.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
Now Blizzcon is obviously a pretty big deal in the Hearthstone community.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
And that's happening this weekend.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
And I'm kind of bummed out that I don't get to go after all.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Even though I'm a Diablo player.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
And I feel like we're getting the short end of the stick.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Or no end of the stick this year at Blizzcon.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
But whatever.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
But I know they do a lot of big Hearthstone stuff there.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
With the tournaments and everything.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
Are you going to have your big popcorn watching the Blizzcon at home game?

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Depending on what I'm doing.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
I'll keep up with it.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
But otherwise I'll probably be...

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
If I'm doing something else I'll probably just try to keep up as best I can on my phone or Twitter or whatever.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
But looking forward to all the stuff they're going to announce.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
Supposedly supposed to be a new expansion or adventure coming out.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
So new stuff. Yay.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Nice.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
Is that free still or are they still doing that stupid pay per view bullshit?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
It's pay per view but it's all...

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
Oh come on.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
It's not through DirecTV I don't think.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Thank you Activision. You're awesome.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Pay per view to view stupid fucking conferences.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.000
You get a digital pet and I think some other things.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Ah fuck them. Seriously.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
If all you want is news, that's what Twitter's for.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
And that's probably what I'll end up doing honestly.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
And if any big moments come up like the red shirt guy asks a question or something, it'll be on YouTube.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
As much as they want to get it taken down. It'll be on YouTube.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
Once it's on the internet you can't take it off, right?

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
I know you have some other passions that aren't just video games.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I want to give you a chance to give a cheap plug.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
I know you've done some other work with podcasting.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
I don't know if you want to give it a cheap plug here.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, just like talking about sports pretty much.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
I don't have anything really to plug at the moment because I'm not really tied with anything specifically.

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
But trying to do something on my own eventually.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
See what I can do with the podcasting actually.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
What sports ball is your favorite sports ball?

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
I really, really, really love basketball.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
Basketball? Then who's your team?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
I don't have a team. I actually just like watching basketball.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
You're a free agent right now?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
Yes, pretty much.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I thought you were going to say football.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
I'm cheap. Just entertain me.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
I know you have a team for football.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
Oh, let's not. No, I'm just kidding.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
San Diego, sadly.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Aw, everybody feels sorry for Mike.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Just kidding.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
Whatever.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
But you're from San Diego, so you have to have a little loyalty there, I understand.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
What about sports video games?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
Obviously that's a little...

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
We don't usually get into that topic a lot here on OLR.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
But do you play them at all?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Do you dabble in that?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Or no, it's just not the same experience for you?

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
Not at all, because I'd rather...

09:35.000 --> 09:41.000
Usually when it comes to sports, if I'm watching a game,

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
I really get the itch to actually go out and play, especially basketball.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
I'm like, oh my god, I can't wait to go out and play.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
I want to just mess around and imitate some players.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
Just mess around. Not even imitate, imitate, but just screw around, basically.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
So when you're there playing video games and one of the parents is yelling,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
why don't you go outside and actually play that game?

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
You're one of those people that will actually go outside and play the game.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Kind of. I was forced to.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
I was forced to as a kid to go out and play basketball, and then it ended up sticking.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Alright.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Alright, mom. Thank you.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
There you go.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
Also joining us tonight, we have another guest.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Another guy that I've played Final Fantasy XIV with.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
He sends a pattern here.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
We're having a little free company IRL meetup this weekend.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Sort of. Mini thing.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
But why don't you introduce yourself?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Hi, I'm Daniel.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
Hi, Daniel. How are you?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm doing great.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Great.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
I feel that coffee kicking in, so my heart's palpitating right now.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
And with you and Michael sharing a mic tonight, this is going to be very interesting,

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
because you're much louder, but you're in a good place.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
How are you? So you play XIV as well.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Yes.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
That's how we sort of know each other.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
What do you play in XIV?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
I play a...

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
Oh, great. I'm going to blank out. What are the cat people called again?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Mikote.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Yes, Mikote.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Mythra?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
I was thinking Mythra. That's what I was thinking of from XI.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
I mean, really, they're just the same races, but they have to change the names for some stupid reason.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
A Mikote, I think they're called.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
A Coyote Mikote.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Mikote.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
Now that 3.0's come out, I've been put back to Summoner as my main, which I'm loving.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
For a while, I was really hating the endgame with the Summoner, so I switched to the Black Mage,

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
but now with all the new rotations and everything coming out, I really enjoy Summoner a lot with Heavensward.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Awesome. What other games are you into besides just XIV?

11:31.000 --> 11:39.000
I also play Hearthstone as well with Michael, and for this last month I haven't played too much,

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
but I did end up playing Guacamelee, the Super Turbo Championship Edition.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
Oh, yeah. That's a fun game.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
Yeah. I've been watching a lot of Let's Plays of Mario Maker, and I don't own a Wii U,

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
so I was like, I need to get my platforming fixed somehow.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
And I looked through my whole PS4 library, and I happen to have Guacamelee from PlayStation Plus,

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
so I was like, hey, let's give this a shot, and it managed to scratch that itch well enough.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.000
Good. But we have a Wii U here at Studio N7, so were you checking out Mario Maker earlier?

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
I did. I did finally get a chance to play it, and it seems the controls are slippery.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
I didn't expect that.

12:12.000 --> 12:17.000
At least with a lot of the levels I tried were the original Super Mario Brothers-style level,

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
and I don't know if it's just that particular style, but the controls are a lot more slippery than I remember.

12:23.000 --> 12:30.000
So I don't know if that's something that they did on purpose, or if that is actually how it was, or if I'm remembering wrong.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
Our mind plays interesting tricks on us, but I'm sure some of the physics have changed,

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
because obviously, well, and what's funny is that I saw you just before playing Mario Maker,

12:38.000 --> 12:43.000
you were playing NES Remix, which actually uses the ROMs, and it's the smaller screen.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
So in Mario Maker, they had to basically go back and reinvent the wheel, because everything's rendered for widescreen now,

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
which, you know, remember folks, Super Mario Brothers was not widescreen.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Yeah, and I commented on that.

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
It was not HD, yeah, so they did have to remake everything, so if the physics are a little different...

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
And having that Super Mario Brothers graphics, but on a full screen, you're just like, whoa!

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Yeah, right?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
Giant.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
It's a little jarring at first, but I think that's part of the reason, too, that you don't just have World 1-1,

13:09.000 --> 13:16.000
at least not endorsed by Nintendo, I'm sure it's been done 5,000 times over by Mario level makers,

13:16.000 --> 13:21.000
but that's why they didn't have an official World 1-1, because people that remember how to do it,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
you know, with their hands tied behind their back and blindfolded, or whatever,

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
With their toes.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Whatever it was Jamie could do on World 8-1 or 8-2, which still blows my mind.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.000
I can't do it anymore, but the whole level was all timing.

13:34.000 --> 13:42.000
Yeah, but I bet if you were to, you could even go, like, essentially pixel perfect or object perfect in Mario Maker with that same level,

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
and you would not do it, because just that slight difference in the mechanics when things go to HD.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
We talked about this just a little bit last week, we were talking about that Mega Man remake in Unity,

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
and how it looks great, but it's probably, if the physics are even slightly different,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
the purists are going to have a big problem with it, because I can't speedrun this the way I used to.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
So, just food for thought. Food for thought.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Let's see, going over to our chatroom over at live.vog.network.com.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.000
ActDef saying Guacamelee is freaking awesome.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
It is. Let's see, USS Rover says just added OLR to list.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
Now 194 shows in spreadsheet.

14:20.000 --> 14:26.000
Awesome, well I hope that's a good list, and not like list of shows to send flaming bag of poo to.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
I hope that's, of course 194 would be a lot of bags, so no, I appreciate you being here in chat and checking us out.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
And VXJ6V, I love this answer in chat over at live.vog.network.com, says,

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
My favorite sports ball is Rocket League.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Hell to the yes, that game is awesome.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Mike, can you check out Rocket League? Have you seen Rocket League?

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
No, I haven't. I've heard you guys talk about it.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
I know what we're doing after the show.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
I know you guys have like an hour drive home, but you have to see Rocket League, it's a lot of fun.

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
It's like, it's soccer meets, okay, you just made a face when I said soccer.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
Are you one of those guys?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
I'm one of those guys.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Okay, well try to...

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
Soccer's like, I don't know, they're just...

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
You're going to start a fight here on OLR that I don't need.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
That's fine.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
Will you at least do Mega Man soccer? Because Mega Man soccer is rad.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
But it's still soccer.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
Ah, you're hopeless. Alright, it's soccer meets like Mario Kart.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Which is awesome, I don't know.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.000
I've heard good things about it, so I'll check it out.

15:27.000 --> 15:33.000
I mean, the second I start seeing it as, this is just soccer, it's going to be awful.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
Let me break it down into mic terms then. It's soccer if soccer was cool.

15:38.000 --> 15:47.000
No, I've heard nothing but good things about it, like across from everyone that's on the podcast I listen to.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
It's been nothing but good things.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
So, eh, I want to check it out.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
But, the soccer comparison is probably...

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
How about air hockey?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Sure.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
That's worlds better than soccer.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
At least people can't flop on air hockey.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Wait, what's that Dan? We can't hear you.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
I'm sorry non-Americans, but I can't do soccer.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
Alright, whatever.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
At least people can't flop on air hockey.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
That's true, that's true.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Alright, alright. Let's see.

16:13.000 --> 16:19.000
Act Deft in our chatroom, who by the way, he's from Mexico, if you guys didn't know, listens to the show.

16:19.000 --> 16:24.000
Act Deft says, why are you laughing at that? Because you know you're about to get some big shit, aren't you?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
He's about to get red.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.000
He's about to get red.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
I know what I said.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
You are about to get red.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
That's fine.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
The library is open. Here it is.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Act Deft says, soccer is awesome. You're just American and you're built to hate it.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
That's what I know. I know.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.000
I played soccer for five years when I was a kid. Did you know that?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Sorry.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
I played soccer.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
Why do you think I'm so skinny?

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
For the record, Manchester United all the way.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
I like soccer. The views and opinions expressed by that guy...

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
Are wrong.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Do not reflect those of Orange Line.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
I watched soccer before I watched baseball.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Uh oh, uh oh.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
No, no, no. Hold on, hold on.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
Shane is gonna wreck you.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Let me explain for a second.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
It's because baseball, like I've tried so hard for like several times to get into baseball.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
And I end up flat out falling asleep.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
Like during the games on the TV, on TV.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Going to a game is different.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I can already see the comments to this episode.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Never invite that guy again.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
No, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Soccer is worlds better.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
Somebody's gotta have the opinion that other people don't want to hear.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
That's what we're about.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
I hate all sports. They all fucking suck.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
All of them. Every single one of them.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Especially baseball.

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
From fucking ballet to fucking ice hockey to football.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
It all fucking sucks.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
There, done.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
So what do you do in sports?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
What about esports?

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
You have to get the puck into the cup and then someone vomits.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Is that how sports ball works?

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Yeah, as long as there's cheerleaders.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
Alright, back to video games, people.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Blades of Steel.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
Yes, let's all agree. Blades of Steel is awesome.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
Daniel, what else? What's your favorite video game of all time?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
I always ask new people this to the show.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
What is your favorite video game of all time?

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
And I'm only taking your first answer.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Final Fantasy IX.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.000
Really? Nine of the whole series?

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
Yes, VIII has a special place in my heart because that's what I started with.

18:26.000 --> 18:37.000
But IX, I replayed it in 2011 and after really being able to appreciate the writing and the character development in it and the music,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I was just like, nope, this is my favorite. This is it. Got it.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Oh, you sweet, sad summer child.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Wait, am I wrong?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
You need to go back and play the classics.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
Well, I think IX is one of the better ones. I will give you that, but it doesn't hold a candle to VI.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
True.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
Let me ask this question.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
I can't have that opinion yet because I haven't finished VI.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.000
I know you're a younger guy than me. We were having this conversation about how old you guys were when OLR started earlier and I wanted to cry.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
I wanted to fucking cry.

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
How old were you when Final Fantasy IX came out?

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
Oh, god, I remember playing it, but I'm trying to remember the freaking year. What was it, 1999?

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
1999 was eight, so nine was...

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
So 2000 it came out.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
About 2000, 2001, yeah.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
Okay, if it came out in 2000, then I was just going into like sixth grade.

19:26.000 --> 19:35.000
Okay, because I don't know if it was Bobby who said this or somebody else, but it's always your favorite Final Fantasy game is the one that came out when you were 12 years old.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
That is going to be your favorite Final Fantasy game, always.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
Well, it was my favorite for a long time because I was about that age.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
But they were close.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
Well, they were one year apart, really.

19:46.000 --> 19:56.000
And so I feel like after getting older and being able to appreciate some of those more eccentric parts to the storyline and everything, IX kind of won my heart over.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Alright, fair enough, fair enough. No, I like IX.

19:58.000 --> 20:04.000
IX had that fan service that people wanted to see that VII and VIII didn't have because VII and VIII were so like...

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
Especially VII was just a radically different setting compared to like IV or V and VI, right?

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
So IX kind of gave a taste of that classic Final Fantasy.

20:11.000 --> 20:24.000
It began to set the trend that VIII followed and so did X and then you see it again in XIII where it's that futuristic kind of neo-science fantasy that you see in a lot of Final Fantasies now.

20:24.000 --> 20:30.000
That thankfully XIV kind of went backwards a little bit and is incorporating more of the fantasy aspect.

20:30.000 --> 20:38.000
Okay, fair enough. Mike, since I didn't ask you this same question about favorite video game of all time, what's your answer?

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
Any of the Metal Gears, except for like Peace Walker.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
So any Metal Gear game?

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
Metal Gear 1, of course, is gonna be my... or Metal Gear Solid 1.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
So not Metal Gear NES, but Metal Gear... because I love Metal Gear NES. The truck have started to move.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
It's one of my favorites.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
But you were probably too young. Were you even born yet when that game came out? Probably not.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
Probably not.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Snake's Revenge doesn't count.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.000
Yes, no, Snake's Revenge wasn't a real Metal Gear game anyway.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
And Snake Rattle and Roll just was a really weird departure of the series.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Snake Rattle and Roll was like what happened when he took LSD.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
So Metal Gear Solid 1, we'll say.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Yeah.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
And why?

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
Just holds nostalgia purposes, but I mean I think it was...

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
Oh god, I don't want to say how old I was.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
Just say it. Fine, I'm over it already.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
I was younger than 10 when I started playing it.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.000
And I don't know what it was. I just thought it was super cool.

21:36.000 --> 21:43.000
And then I've gone back and kind of replayed some of the earlier games in the series.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
And I've got a better appreciation for the plotline and stuff.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
As convoluted as it is, I'll be the first to tell you.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah, it's a clusterfuck and a half.

21:55.000 --> 22:03.000
But if you've stuck with it from one all the way through, it makes a bit more sense.

22:03.000 --> 22:08.000
You can't just jump into four or five and be like...

22:08.000 --> 22:15.000
And really give it a fair judgment because it's like, what is this shit?

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
Tell me, do you believe love can bloom on a battlefield?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
I love that song, Love is a Battlefield.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Thank you, Pat.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
And then Jordan Sparks sang about a battlefield too.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
Oh no. I'll take it back three.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Snake Eater was my favorite.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
Was it the song? Because the song was pretty great.

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
It was the music and the fact that you go back and it finally clears up some things that you've been waiting on for a while.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
And just the origin of it, basically. It was really, really great.

22:46.000 --> 22:50.000
I remember with that one E3 where they gave away the Snake Eater on vinyl.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Do you know how much that must be worth these days?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
I've got two of them.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Oh my god, you should look them up on eBay.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
They're probably worth the money.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
No.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Anyway, out of curiosity, have you played Phantom Pain yet?

23:00.000 --> 23:06.000
I have not. It's on my list to pick up things. I'm always really slow on picking up games.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
That's fine.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
But I played, what was it, the Ground Zeroes?

23:12.000 --> 23:13.000
Yeah.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Yeah. I played that and that was cool, I guess.

23:16.000 --> 23:26.000
It didn't quite scratch that Metal Gear itch for me, but it's essentially a demo, so you can't ask for too much out of a demo.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
So obviously, if you like Metal Gear, you must be a bit of a Kojima fan, so what do you think about all this fuckery between Kojima and Konami?

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
Sad face.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
I think that's the only way to describe it.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
That's like when your computer crashes in Windows 10.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
They got rid of the blue screen to death, now it literally just puts up a sad face.

23:43.000 --> 23:50.000
I'm sad. They took a cue out of Apple's playbook. That's what the Mac always did, right? Like a little sad computer.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
So they have a little sad face that comes up now.

23:52.000 --> 24:06.000
It was just really shitty to see how that all ended because it's just, especially for me, being a big Metal Gear fan and seeing Kojima's name on all the titles.

24:06.000 --> 24:14.000
It's like, man, this guy's done quite a bit with Konami, and then it was just, nah, fuck you.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
They have it all be over.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
Yeah, it was just like a shitty breakup. It was almost like watching a friend go through a horrible breakup.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
It is.

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
It's just disgusting and awkward and sad.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
Yeah, they ran away from home to join a soccer league.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Yes, or a baseball team.

24:34.000 --> 24:40.000
Anyhow, I want to introduce him real fast. He is here in studio. Hand the mic over to Shane. Hi, Shane, how are you?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Hi.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Do you want to say anything about baseball and how Mike's wrong?

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
I want to go into the other room with this mic so I don't have to be in the same room with him.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
How are you doing this week?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
Fine.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
How's Power Rangers toy hunting?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
I'm technically done.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
Alright. Congrats.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
Thank you.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
Good job on that.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
It'll never end, though, for real.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
Tell us the latest and greatest in amiibo hunting because you're kind of our amiibo expert here.

25:01.000 --> 25:08.000
There's no hunting really going on right now. The 3-pack came out today for the fighters and I picked that up and they're not bad looking.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
The end.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
The end.

25:11.000 --> 25:18.000
I'm going to be very mean here and spoil a little bit of what I know Loki's going to talk about in the opening here, but I know you love right now this year.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
You talk non-stop about Until Dawn.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
Because it's so good. It's the best game this year.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
Alright. Well, what did you think when the Sony thing happened this week?

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
I already heard about that.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
Until Dawn in VR.

25:30.000 --> 25:39.000
I heard about that before they announced it and it doesn't look great, but, you know, if it gives them a little more money to make a real game, then that's fine.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
Do you think that they just took this existing idea and just slapped Until Dawn's name on it?

25:43.000 --> 25:50.000
Possibly, but I also think Sony made them make this before they found out Until Dawn was actually successful.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
Interesting. Is it the same studio doing it?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Yeah.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
Huh. Interesting. Did you want to comment on that, Dan?

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
No.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Oh, I saw you, like, pointing. Alright.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.000
I think that's a good point.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
Yeah. That's a good point. Alright.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
Let's see. Anything else to check in on Shane with? Let's see.

26:03.000 --> 26:06.000
I got an epitome, though, also from my non-girlfriend at Toys R Us.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
Okay. Can you tell us about your girlfriend at Toys R Us?

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
There's this girl that I always talk to at Toys R Us.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
And I'm using girlfriend in my quotey fingers.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
I even met her.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Yeah. Yeah, Jamie met her.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
Completely independently of Shane being there.

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
Does she listen to OLR? Because if not, you need to go take the show information.

26:23.000 --> 26:30.000
Anyway. Anyway. So there's this girl at Toys R Us that always helps me with Power Rangers and amiibo stuff.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.000
And I always go, because Toys R Us' layout, Power Rangers is really close to amiibo.

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
So I just head straight back there, look at my Power Rangers, go look at amiibo, and then I'm done.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
And I talk to her a little bit, and she helps me find things.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
Like, that's how I found a lot of the stuff that I've been looking for.

26:45.000 --> 26:51.000
And then I guess her coworkers keep asking her if I am her boyfriend, because I always go back there and talk to her.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
So it got me a pit amiibo.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
So there it is.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Best relationship ever.

26:59.000 --> 27:06.000
Shane goes shopping for amiibo so much that Toys R Us employees think he's in a relationship with the girl.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
Mostly Power Ranger toys, let's be honest, because amiibo only happened when I couldn't find Power Ranger toys.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
All right. Fair enough. Fair enough.

27:13.000 --> 27:17.000
All right. Maybe we'll hear from Shane again later in the show. Maybe we won't. I don't know.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
But I do want to talk a little bit here, get into a kickoff topic for tonight.

27:21.000 --> 27:30.000
And I want to talk about, this is interesting because this doesn't really have to do with video gaming, but it totally does.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
And if you've been watching your blogs and your social media feed this week,

27:34.000 --> 27:41.000
then I'm sure you have inevitably seen that all your friends are watching on Twitch, Bob Ross.

27:41.000 --> 27:52.000
Yes, that's right. The painter from the 70s is now streaming on Twitch TV, the network dedicated to video games and streaming gameplay.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
And you might be wondering, what the hell? Like, what does Bob Ross have to do with video games?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
That's what I'm wondering.

27:58.000 --> 28:05.000
Because, well, I know there was supposed to be a Bob Ross game on the Wii like years and years ago, but I think it got canceled.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
Like it didn't actually end up happening. I just remember a story on that a long time ago, which would have been awesome.

28:09.000 --> 28:17.000
I just want to preface with this. Bob Ross is fucking rad. And like, when this happened this week, this actually kind of made me giddy.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
I was like, Bob Ross is streaming on Twitch? I'm like, I don't even need to know the reason.

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
Like, just, it's fine. Just, you know, that's it. Like, I don't need to know. But here is the reason.

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
So, Twitch is starting to open up a little more and they released this blog post about Twitch Creative.

28:34.000 --> 28:42.000
Now, Twitch was already running creative streams. And by creative streams meaning people doing artwork, maybe that's game inspired.

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
People doing music that's game inspired or just, you know, kind of adjacent.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
It's a really weird gray area because it doesn't have to be about games.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
I know they do, like, live podcasts would sometimes stream through Twitch as well.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
That's a little different. That's considered a gaming talk show. That's not a part of this.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
But that is another, like, non-gaming thing that's there.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
So, let's see. Part of the blog post here.

29:04.000 --> 29:11.000
The Twitch community has included a determined community of artists, crafters, and builders who have been using Twitch to broadcast their creative processes.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
These creative broadcasters share many of the same characteristics as all Twitch broadcasters.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
Passion, engagement, and a community-centric world view.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
Today we're happy to announce our official support for the Twitch creative community.

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
There are a few things that make the creative category unlike anything else on Twitch.

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
So, we along with our launch partner Adobe are excited to see what you can dream up.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
Obviously Adobe, you know, Photoshop, pretty big deal.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
And all the other illustrator and all the other tools they make.

29:36.000 --> 29:43.000
So, they have a new landing page for the creative category to highlight specifically creative broadcasts and so forth.

29:43.000 --> 29:48.000
And then at the end of this they just say, thanks to our friends at Janssen Media and Bob Ross Inc.

29:48.000 --> 29:55.000
We'll broadcast every episode of the original Bob Ross show, The Joy of Painting, in an epic marathon starting at 2 p.m. Pacific.

29:55.000 --> 30:02.000
That's 403 episodes of Bob Ross that will play over the course of 8.5 days.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
And there's a special Bob Ross Kappa emote, too.

30:05.000 --> 30:09.000
So, the Bob Ross tie-in is to celebrate, basically.

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
I mean, even though Twitch already had this creative side, now we're embracing it and taking the next step with it.

30:15.000 --> 30:24.000
Which is so interesting to me because Twitch started as a spinoff of Justin TV, which was more about life casting and so forth.

30:24.000 --> 30:30.000
But I would have expected that most of this stuff, if Justin TV was still around, would be on Justin TV.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
So, it's almost like they're bringing back a little piece of that.

30:33.000 --> 30:39.000
Because there's nothing that says that the music, the art, and all this stuff you do has to be games, necessarily.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
I could be drawing, I don't know, the Golden Girls tattoo I'm going to get for my birthday.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
And that would be art, right?

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
But I guess because I'm still a gamer in the gaming community, it counts.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
But I mean, I'm not slamming it by any means. I think it's really cool.

30:54.000 --> 31:00.000
And I know, DarkSakura, you're a creative individual.

31:00.000 --> 31:07.000
Because then I say, and I'm not, but these sorts of things I know are things that you have done.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
You've done broadcasting of art and so forth.

31:10.000 --> 31:18.000
When I was doing all that Mass Effect artwork, like just the Let Me Draw Your Shepherd thing was going on.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
I think I did like 24 different femsheps.

31:22.000 --> 31:32.000
And I streamed almost all of the artwork I did, either on Twitch or livestream when I moved to livestream.

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
Because livestream I thought was a little bit better for that audience.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Well yeah, and I think you hit the nail on the head what Twitch is trying to say.

31:40.000 --> 31:46.000
Is they're basically, they're literally rolling out the red carpet saying, you are welcome here with this.

31:46.000 --> 31:54.000
It was easier streaming on Twitch. Livestream was kind of not exactly easy, but Twitch was super easy.

31:54.000 --> 32:02.000
So I would be more than happy to go back and do the next artwork if I ever have time to do it on Twitch.

32:02.000 --> 32:08.000
I actually didn't even know Twitch had stuff other than games.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
I mean that's just me not really exploring Twitch.

32:11.000 --> 32:16.000
Because for the most part all I've been doing is watching people play Hearthstone.

32:16.000 --> 32:19.000
Or watch the tournaments and stuff like that.

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
Because Blizzard doesn't do too many tournaments throughout the year.

32:23.000 --> 32:28.000
So it's a bunch of other people doing their own League Championships and all that other jazz.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
But that's pretty cool.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
I think it's probably a lot easier to get into that than what YouTube is trying to do.

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
Trying to get into the streaming with the gaming thing.

32:37.000 --> 32:46.000
Because trying to get people to switch from Twitch where it seems really easy and everybody's already invested in it.

32:46.000 --> 32:57.000
It's going to be a lot harder for them to do that than people wanting to get into streaming creative stuff.

32:57.000 --> 33:01.000
Like the drawings and all that other stuff.

33:01.000 --> 33:07.000
And what you just said I think hits the nail on the head of why I think this move on Twitch is part.

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
And I've been critical of Twitch in the past when necessary.

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
I've been complimentary of Twitch in the past when necessary.

33:13.000 --> 33:17.000
I think this move that they did with the Bob Ross stream is genius.

33:17.000 --> 33:25.000
It just shows that they're not just gaming and that, hey by the way you can do other things on here as opposed to...

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
It got your attention.

33:27.000 --> 33:33.000
Like what the hell is Bob Ross, who is awesome by the way, doing on Twitch TV?

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
That's the reaction I think every person's having this week, right?

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
So I don't know. Shane, you're shaking your head. You don't agree?

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
I gotta hear this. I gotta hear this.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.000
Why are you shaking your head no over there?

33:46.000 --> 33:50.000
Because I watch a lot of Twitch. Let's get that out of the way.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
It's more entertaining than Netflix and Hulu most of the time.

33:54.000 --> 33:59.000
But good on them for opening it up. I don't want to watch Bob Ross.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I guess you don't have to.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
But Bob Ross is awesome.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
That's why I'm shaking my head too. I just don't care about him.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
I think Bob Ross is awesome.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.000
Here's why I think the Bob Ross stuff is awesome.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
Why did live streaming, and this is again why I use that word genius.

34:15.000 --> 34:21.000
And I don't know if this is one of those idiot savant things where they didn't even know how genius this was and they signed the deal.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
But I'm gonna tell you why this is genius.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
Why is live streaming of video games popular in the first place?

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
Because I like watching Until Dawn. That's why.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
What made live streaming break through? Anybody in the room.

34:34.000 --> 34:39.000
What was the game and why did live streaming really break through?

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
Wouldn't it have been like League of Legends or Dota in that instance?

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
I would say that's kind of like one half of the coin, but there's another big half of the coin.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
What's the other game?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
Anybody. Anybody.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
Anybody. It's got the word craft in it.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
Warcraft.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Minecraft.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Minecraft.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
Crafty craft.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
Minecraft is one of the big reasons.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
Craft cheese.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Why streaming is popular.

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
And you may not totally agree with what I'm saying, but hear me out here.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
Why do people watch Minecraft streams?

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Because they're on drugs.

35:12.000 --> 35:15.000
Shane says because they're on drugs.

35:16.000 --> 35:21.000
Well, it's the same reason you sit and play it for mindless hours of doing nothing.

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
Creating. You're creating, right?

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
I destroy.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
How many times were we seeing news posts on game blogs?

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
Somebody made a video game sprite in Minecraft.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
Somebody made this amazing roller coaster in Minecraft.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
Somebody created this whole little universe.

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
Somebody recreated Disneyland in Minecraft.

35:43.000 --> 35:49.000
And it was like, you see all these things that people painted in Minecraft.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
Minecraft was the canvas.

35:51.000 --> 35:55.000
That's why the Bob Ross tie-in is genius.

35:55.000 --> 36:03.000
Because it's so, everything that Bob Ross says in a lot of these things, in his art and about expression,

36:03.000 --> 36:07.000
applies to these creative gaming streams like Minecraft, I think.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.000
I don't know.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
Again, maybe I'm giving it too much credit.

36:10.000 --> 36:18.000
But that was kind of what I saw in it, where I was like, wow, that is a really subtly awesome connection.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Not bad for a former drill sergeant.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Was Bob Ross a drill sergeant?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
Yep.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
Get out.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Also, the fro was all branding.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Oh, I'm sure.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
He apparently hated it.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
Oh, really?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Yep.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
But the hair was recognizable.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
And if you want to see something funny, you should see the guy he replaced on The Joy of Painting.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
Something Alexander.

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
This kind of bitter German guy.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
It was really funny.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
Gotcha.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.000
Doesn't sound very joyous.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
No.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.000
All right.

36:48.000 --> 36:52.000
Well, going back to our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
actdef says, I haven't seen Bob Ross' stream.

36:55.000 --> 37:00.000
It's just twitch.tv slash bobross, and I think the marathon should be going for another couple days.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
So, after tonight's show, you can go check that out for a little bit.

37:03.000 --> 37:10.000
But do remember, it's a 1970s TV show, so don't expect it to be like, you know, but this was the stuff.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
I remember from when I was a kid, because if I got up really, really early on a Saturday,

37:14.000 --> 37:20.000
this is what was on before like square one television and the stuff I was really trying to watch was Bob Ross.

37:20.000 --> 37:27.000
Bob Ross, for me, I forever associate him with watching Doctor Who in the early 80s.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Got it.

37:28.000 --> 37:33.000
I watch both of them on PBS like the same, you know.

37:33.000 --> 37:43.000
And Jason in our chat, vxjasonxv, our announcer says, what Twitch's creative program means is also partnering creative broadcasters.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
A few friends of mine I met in September have already been partnered since this program started.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
So, that's an important little footnote too is that now Twitch is actually partnering with some of those groups as well.

37:51.000 --> 37:59.000
I thought they already had some partnerships with like, you know, celebrities like Darude was obviously the big like kind of tongue-in-cheek one.

37:59.000 --> 38:04.000
Doesn't Skrillex have a stream on there? Am I crazy? I thought that was a thing.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
There was some other electronic musician who had a random stream on there that would do random stuff.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
Maybe I'm blurring the lines here a little bit. I apologize.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
A Minecraft stream?

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
Maybe, maybe.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.000
No, I'm thinking, not Skrillex, I'm thinking of, what's his name, Deadmau5.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
That's it. It's Deadmau5, not Skrillex.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.000
That makes sense.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
My bad.

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
Caijuto in chat says, Bob Ross was on until the 90s, so it's not just 70s stuff.

38:31.000 --> 38:36.000
Yeah, but I don't think a single thing changed on that set in the 20 years the show was on.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.000
So, yes, it was on in the 90s, but it was still the same damn show they were making in the 70s.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
Alright.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.000
Anyhow, there it is.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
Bob Ross on Twitch, and again, I gotta hand it to him.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
You know, credit where credit is due.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
That was a great move to bring exposure to this side of things.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
Alright, we're going to start off now after our kickoff topic, getting into our gaming weeks

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
So, let's go around the room real quick and check out what games have you been playing this week?

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
Darzaka.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer, because it's cool.

39:07.000 --> 39:10.000
You can design their yards and pick the house.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.000
And I had to design a schoolroom because Isabel told me to.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.000
I love Isabel.

39:15.000 --> 39:18.000
And it's just really fun.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.000
And it's not like you have to do it every day, like all the stuff in Animal Crossing.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
You can just do it as you want to, and it's not on the clock like that.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
So, it's really fun.

39:28.000 --> 39:33.000
I've played a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition because I have new mods.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.000
Because it's you.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.000
Shut up.

39:35.000 --> 39:38.000
I say that with love.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.000
Girl.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
Also, Dan and I are going through Super Metroid.

39:44.000 --> 39:49.000
He has learned that he hates playing it with the Wii U controller.

39:49.000 --> 39:53.000
So, we're using our Wii Classic controller.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
And we just beat Ridley before the show.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.000
And we're trying to get the last reserve tank.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
We have all the E tanks and all the stuff.

40:04.000 --> 40:09.000
So, we're going to get the last reserve tank and then go after Mother Brain to Torian.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Awesome. Well, good luck.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Well, it's Dan playing, so it'll be fine.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
I suck at Super Metroid.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Aren't you still there guiding him through?

40:16.000 --> 40:20.000
Surely, I know you and Dan, and you're sitting there telling him what to do.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
I know that's the case.

40:22.000 --> 40:25.000
We've actually discovered a trope.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
I guide him onto spikes.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
I'm like, no, you're going the wrong way.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
I go down, so he'll just jump and land on spikes.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
I'm like, husband.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
So, finally, I led him into this one room.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
And lo and behold, there are spikes.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
And it's the room on the wrecked ship where you jump on the Chozo statue.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
And it carries you down through the spikes and into the ground.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.000
Yes, I remember that.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.000
And Dan's like, we did this.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
We did this.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
I was like, yeah, but did you see that there's a pipe leading under the Chozo statue?

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
Oh, so, yeah, we're playing together.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.000
We're playing together.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.000
Good.

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
And so, next we are going to be doing...

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Crap, what was the one?

41:11.000 --> 41:14.000
Not Zero Mission, because that was the first one.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.000
The one that was on Game Boy Advance.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Oh, God.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
Metroid Prime and Metroid Fusion.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Metroid Fusion.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
So, we're going to be, I think, doing that one next.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
I know Prime was GameCube, but I know they came out at the same time.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
And you know the whole Prime trilogy is on the Wii U store for like 20 bucks.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.000
Not bad.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
Although, we already have three and haven't touched it.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
But, yeah, that's going to be next.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
And then we're going to be doing Earthbound Zero.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.000
Nice.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
So, we bought that right quick.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
Great.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
Sounds like you've had a fun week.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

41:49.000 --> 41:53.000
I didn't play a whole lot because I was working on my costume.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
But I did play a little bit of Minecraft Windows 10 Edition.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
And, I don't know.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.000
I keep playing it, but there's like no point to it, it seems like.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
I just, I don't know.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
The survival is super easy.

42:05.000 --> 42:09.000
And I just don't feel motivated to do anything in it.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
It's definitely a lot more fun with other people.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
I'm actually thinking about going back to the PC version to play with all the mods on there.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
But, it runs so well in Windows 10.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
I was like, why can't you just add mods to this one?

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Because this client runs so much better than your other one.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
But no, they don't want mods on this one, so it's fucking annoying.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
So I did that, and then I played a little bit of Ingress.

42:31.000 --> 42:39.000
And, I reinstalled Burnout Paradise, the box thing or whatever.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
Because I thought I had it on my PC, but I don't.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And I want to play some more of that.

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
And then, apparently I have Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, which I was unaware of.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
So, I'll try that too.

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
Also, I think I downloaded it on Origin for Command & Conquer Red Alert 2, because that's free.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
I'll double check that.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.000
That's it.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Alright. Fair enough.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
My Gaming Week.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.000
We had a conversation on last week's show about Minecraft, Windows 10 edition.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.000
I actually did install that and get it all up and running after last week's show.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
So I was playing that for a little bit.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
I was enjoying it.

43:14.000 --> 43:20.000
It's interesting how you get achievements in that game that are actually tied to your Xbox gamer score.

43:20.000 --> 43:24.000
Which I realize is a thing in Windows 10, but it's just kind of weird how that works now.

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
The achievements are on your PC and your Xbox 360.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
It kind of annoys me though that they don't have the interface like the Xbox 360 one.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
Where if you have the parts, it shows you what you can make.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
Yeah, that I don't like.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
That I don't like.

43:38.000 --> 43:41.000
I guess that's kind of the point you're supposed to discover recipes and stuff.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
No one fucking does that. They just look up that shit on the internet.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
No one does that.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
It's easy. Game facts on the second monitor.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
Alright. Let's see. Other stuff I played this week.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Honestly, more stuff I've talked about before.

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
More Diablo 3. More Final Fantasy XIV.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.000
So really as far as new stuff, I only did some demos.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
So I'm just going to talk really quick.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Because I don't like to give full impression on games based on demos.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
But you know we all do it.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
So Guitar Hero Live.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
I played one of the in-store demos.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
And I actually thought it was kind of rad.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
It's kind of different than the music games from a few years ago.

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
Just in its formula where now you have the buttons for down and the buttons for up.

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
Or sometimes you push them at the same time or whatever.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
And the full motion video I thought was kind of funny.

44:25.000 --> 44:31.000
Even though it's so 1990s with the video that changes depending on how well you're doing.

44:31.000 --> 44:37.000
But the attention to detail and the filming and all the extras and stuff is done so well.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
I was actually laughing and I was enjoying failing a song.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.000
Because the reactions that people have are so funny.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
Like the camera will pan down and it shows the audience.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
And there'll be a girl who's looking up really blankly at you.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
And then she'll just stick her tongue out at you.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
And I don't know why but that just made me die laughing.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
It was so funny.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
And then just the expression on the drummer's face.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
Like, dude, what are you doing?

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
It's so hilarious.

45:04.000 --> 45:10.000
So yeah, I just thought it was more interesting to look at than the characters we've been used to in music games for a while.

45:10.000 --> 45:15.000
So Alan Alchemy also putting out a chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
It's in HD and it's obvious it had good production values.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.000
Full motion video stuff in the 90s was cheap, cheap, cheap.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
Yeah, no, this had some good production values to it.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
So I gotta give credit where credit's due.

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
I'm very enticed by the fact that they have this whole MTV side of things.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
Where you can basically play along to an MTV style network.

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
And it's like we're bringing MTV back.

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Now it's like GHTV or whatever.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
It's very interesting to me.

45:41.000 --> 45:49.000
But then I think, God, I have to spend $80 on another plastic guitar when I just bought Rock Band 4.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I don't know.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
You know, Shane tried though.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Shane tried really hard to get me to get...

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
I did not try really hard.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Wait, hand him the mic here real quick.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
You kept saying...

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
I didn't try hard at all. That was my passive trying.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.000
You said, and I quote,

46:04.000 --> 46:08.000
Look Rob, here's that Guitar Hero game you're gonna go home with.

46:08.000 --> 46:11.000
No, no, but that's passively.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
This is the Guitar Hero you're looking for.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
You will buy this Guitar Hero.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
And then you were so proud you said that you deserved a medal.

46:19.000 --> 46:23.000
I was like, well, it's in the Guitar Hero box. You have to go back and get it.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Anyway, so there was that.

46:27.000 --> 46:31.000
The other demo I played this week was Yo-kai Watch on the 3DS.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.000
And Shane's shaking his head because he knows we disagree on this.

46:34.000 --> 46:37.000
I think Shane did two battles and said this is stupid.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.000
Yup.

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
But I thought it was a lot of fun.

46:40.000 --> 46:46.000
Here's the thing, I get why the battle system in Yo-kai Watch is different.

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
Because it's not like, you know, fight, magic, run type of thing.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
You know, press A to do whatever.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
But the characters auto attack.

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
And what you do is that you have this wheel of six characters.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.000
So you have a line of, you know, three that are in the front and three that are in the back.

47:00.000 --> 47:03.000
So the three in the front are consistently attacking.

47:03.000 --> 47:06.000
And they build up their little meters and they can do a super move.

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
So then you can tap your little thing to do a super move.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
And you play like a WarioWare style game for five seconds to do like a big attack of some sort.

47:14.000 --> 47:19.000
And then if they get knocked out, you cycle them to the back row.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
And then you can do like a WarioWare style game to revive them.

47:21.000 --> 47:24.000
And I don't know, I thought it was kind of fast paced and different.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
Like a WarioWare battle style system. I thought it was kind of cool.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
So, I don't know. I don't know why Shane didn't like it.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
I just thought the demo was too short. That was my only problem with it.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
But it interested me enough to get the full game.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
So I probably will get Yo-kai Watch when it comes out.

47:37.000 --> 47:40.000
So, there you go. That was the other game I played this week.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.000
Let's go to our guest this week. Who has the microphone?

47:44.000 --> 47:47.000
Alright, Dan, do you want to tell us about your gaming week?

47:47.000 --> 47:51.000
Sure. I was, you know, played Hearthstone a bit.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Tried to do that for a little bit.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Nothing as serious as Michael's been trying to do.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
But just my own little thing.

47:57.000 --> 48:05.000
I did log on to Final Fantasy XIV after being off and on very sporadically throughout the month.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Because of the Halloween event, which is fantastic.

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
Anyone listening who hasn't done that event yet but has a subscription needs to tune in and do that.

48:13.000 --> 48:18.000
Because that broom mount that you can get at the end of the event is magical.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
And I want everyone to have it.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
I love that mount too.

48:22.000 --> 48:28.000
But, you know, if you're too lazy to log in, they'll probably sell it for $5 in the store after the holiday's over.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
But it won't be until next year.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.000
Because that seems to be the trend they're doing.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
Is they'll wait until the next year's holiday before they release it on the store.

48:35.000 --> 48:42.000
So you've got 365 days where you can brag that you got that mount and everyone else can just cry.

48:45.000 --> 48:48.000
Alright. Is that it? Final Fantasy XIV?

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
Well, if we're going back further in the month, we did play Until Dawn.

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
Both myself, Michael, and our friend Aaron, who you know.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
The listeners don't, so it's alright.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
There's another guy that you don't know.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Yes, another guy that no one else knows.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
We did play Until Dawn over the weekend.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
And it was a lot of fun.

49:07.000 --> 49:12.000
I mean, we love those 90s horrible horror movies.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I love Nightmare on Elm Street.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
And for some reason, this month...

49:16.000 --> 49:17.000
That wasn't the 90s. It was the 80s.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Well, Scream. That's what I'm thinking.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
I'm thinking Scream was 90s. Yeah, Nightmare on Elm Street was 80s.

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
But still, love those kind of horror slasher fics.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Until Dawn was a great way to kind of reinvigorate that.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.000
And I actually ended up watching a lot of horror movies following that.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Because it kind of just spurred us on.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
And it's very heavy rain.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Very, very similar to heavy rain.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.000
In terms of how you make the decisions and everything.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
But it's a lot of fun.

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
Especially to play that with friends who are also into horror movies.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
And really bad tropes and everything.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
Sorry, I love this comment in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Tigerclaw says,

49:53.000 --> 49:57.000
Scream were horror movies for hipsters.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
Isn't your Twitter handle gaming hipster?

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
It is. It is.

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
So, you got me.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
I'm not going to try to get out of that one.

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
But what's funny though is that even though I don't usually like horror movies.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
Gore is what I have a big problem with. I don't like that stuff.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.000
But I thought the Scream movies were funny.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
They're supposed to be.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
I like that they were tongue in cheek.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
So it made it more entertaining.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
Yeah, it's supposed to be a satire. So that's what's hilarious about it.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Yeah. Alright, cool.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
I bet Shane's very happy to hear that you have a lot of Until Dawn timing under your belt.

50:34.000 --> 50:41.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Undrated with vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, CAMEL.

50:41.000 --> 50:44.000
Alright, how about you, Mike? What have you been up to? How was your gaming week?

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
Let's see, I played...

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
Don't forget that mic.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.000
Like I said, I played a lot of...

50:49.000 --> 50:50.000
Real close.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
I know.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
I played a lot of Hearthstone this week.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
This month, really.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
Actually logged into 14 for the first time all month.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Like two days ago.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
To get that, yeah.

51:02.000 --> 51:07.000
For that broom mount and all that fabulous Halloween gear.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.000
It was awesome.

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
And promptly dyed it because that purple was hideous.

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
Other than that, I just decided to brush off some old games on my phone.

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
I started playing, or tried to replay some Sword and Sorcery, Monument Valley.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
Those are some pretty good, beautiful games.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
I'm the gaming hipster.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
Sorry, I found them on the App Store.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Like, just one day.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
And I was like, ooh, let's try this.

51:38.000 --> 51:43.000
Monument Valley is really gorgeous, and everyone should play that one.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
I forgot to mention, I actually played Hearthstone for the first time in probably like a year today,

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
thanks to your guys' influence.

51:48.000 --> 51:51.000
Because you were like, oh, you should check it out.

51:51.000 --> 51:54.000
And then I actually beat Dan, which I wasn't expecting to happen.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
So I don't know if he just let me win to boost my ego a little bit.

51:57.000 --> 52:01.000
He didn't let you win, but you guys played with similar level decks.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
I see.

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
So it was a fair fight.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Yeah, it was a fair fight.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
So it wasn't like a deck he built or anything like that.

52:10.000 --> 52:11.000
Fair enough.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
Well, I might have to play a little more.

52:12.000 --> 52:13.000
So that was good.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Proud of you.

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
Thank you.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.000
Thank you.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
All right.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Well, I think that's going to do it.

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
Unless Shane wants to jump in with his gaming week, but I'm thinking, I don't know.

52:21.000 --> 52:22.000
Shane, what do you want to say about your gaming week?

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Do I not play video games?

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
Why were you going to skip me?

52:25.000 --> 52:26.000
That's really rude.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.000
I don't know if you want to.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Really rude.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Fine.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
Well, how was your game?

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
I want an apology first.

52:32.000 --> 52:40.000
Shane, I am so sorry that you don't like candy corn.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.000
How was your game week?

52:41.000 --> 52:47.000
I played 14 for the first time in months and months and months.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.000
And then got yourself locked out.

52:48.000 --> 52:55.000
Then I got myself locked out because I had to get a new phone and I attached my authenticator.

52:55.000 --> 53:01.000
But when I got back, my Pokemon shuffle data, which is very important, was not on my phone.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
So I restored it from a backup and that put a different authenticator on.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
So now I'm locked out, which is funny.

53:07.000 --> 53:11.000
But I got my Pokemon shuffle data back because I play that all the time.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
Yeah.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
Priorities for sure.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
It's not hard to fix it though.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
What?

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Your authenticator stuff.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Oh, I have to contact Square.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
I never had to do that.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
I don't have the recovery key because I've had like three different ones now.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
Oh, fun.

53:25.000 --> 53:38.000
And I played and am in the process of playing the download case for the Ace Attorney game on 3DS because I hadn't done it yet.

53:38.000 --> 53:43.000
And I've been watching a guy stream the entire series and it made me want to go back and play.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
And I'm having such a blast.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
Your defendant that you're defending is an Orca.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
It's amazing.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
Wow.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Yes.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
It's so good.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
It's so good.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
All right.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
No one till dawn this week?

53:56.000 --> 54:01.000
I watched people play it and then one guy got really mad because on Twitch they were telling him what to do.

54:01.000 --> 54:05.000
And he stopped playing for like ten minutes and went off on his chat room and was like, you're boring.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I just want to see people happen.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
Why are you streaming your game?

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
Why are you streaming your game if that's the reaction you're going to have?

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Don't stream your fucking game.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
I don't know.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.000
You should ask him.

54:15.000 --> 54:16.000
I'm sorry.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
I find that really gross.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
I don't know.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Anyway.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.000
Yeah.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
Just don't look at your chat room.

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
It's weird.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.000
Weird, weird, weird.

54:23.000 --> 54:24.000
All right.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Anyhow, anything else, Shane?

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
I gave the mic away.

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
You are accordingly invited to share the rest of your week.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
All right.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
You gave the mic away.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
All right.

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Let's get into some housekeeping for this week.

54:33.000 --> 54:43.000
And I don't have a whole lot to say except now that we're in November, I will say that we are not going to have a show the week of Thanksgiving here in the States.

54:43.000 --> 54:48.000
So we will not be having a show on Sunday the, I think it's the 29th?

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
That's my hubby's birthday.

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
Yep.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.000
I think just with Thanksgiving.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.000
Which is an important holiday.

54:53.000 --> 54:57.000
I think some people might go out of town and stuff and I doubt many of our listeners will be around either.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
So we just won't be here that weekend.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.000
So I have the best idea because Dan's going to turn 40.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
Oh yeah.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
Wow.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
I'm going to get him a bunch of 40s.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.000
You should.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.000
He's going to drink a 40 when he turns 40 because that's so meta.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.000
Yo dog.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.000
I heard you like 40s.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
So here's a 40 while you're turning 40.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
I like it.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
There you go.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
Great.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
40 40s.

55:16.000 --> 55:17.000
All right.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.000
So yeah.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
So we will not be here that week, but we'll remind you as that gets a little bit closer here.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.000
Otherwise follow us on Twitter.

55:22.000 --> 55:23.000
Twitter dot com slash o l r.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
We're also on Facebook.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
Facebook dot com slash Orange launch radio.

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
Also very important.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
One of our friends shows.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
One of our friendly shows.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
Another network show here at the voice network celebrating a big milestone this week.

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
So I want to give a big congratulations to Girls Gone Wow.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
And Raven and EJ over at Girls Gone Wow hit 200 episodes.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
They recorded it today.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
Y'all at VOG will hear that on Wednesday.

55:51.000 --> 55:56.000
And how apropro that this week is BlizzCon.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
I don't know how they timed that so perfectly, but they did.

56:00.000 --> 56:05.000
And I thought it was really cute because Raven and EJ were like taking selfies together today and putting it on Twitter.

56:05.000 --> 56:10.000
And I don't think they're usually in the same place when they record, but they kind of came together for their 200th episode.

56:10.000 --> 56:20.000
So if you have even a passing interest in World of Warcraft, I really urge you to go visit the gals over at Girls Gone Wow in celebration of their 200th episode.

56:20.000 --> 56:26.000
And big congratulations to everybody that's involved with that show now, has been involved with that show in the past.

56:26.000 --> 56:31.000
And just able to keep a topic about one game for so long going.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
I couldn't do it.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
I tried. We couldn't do it.

56:36.000 --> 56:40.000
Good job ladies. You did something we couldn't do.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
So there it is.

56:42.000 --> 56:49.000
Thank gosh there's this general gaming show where we can always change and talk about whatever we want.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Because that's how we made it as far as we did.

56:52.000 --> 56:57.000
In all seriousness, big congratulations to Girls Gone Wow. 200 episodes.

56:57.000 --> 57:02.000
Okay, let's get into this week's gaming news.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
We'll start off with Loki.

57:03.000 --> 57:07.000
Yeah, so they have this big Sony Paris event where they announced a bunch of shit.

57:07.000 --> 57:11.000
Mostly just kind of updates on things that have already been announced.

57:11.000 --> 57:17.000
So for example, they talked a little bit about Uncharted 4, like it's going to have multiplayer now.

57:17.000 --> 57:22.000
Which I kind of have to say, wow that's news.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
I mean, kind of figured that it would have multiplayer. Most games do now, even if it's shoehorned in there.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
But it does.

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
A release date for No Man's Sky, tentatively.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
It's supposed to be June 2016.

57:35.000 --> 57:39.000
Yay, another game for 2016 that I thought we were getting this year. Joy.

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
Well, whatever, it's fine. I'll wait longer.

57:42.000 --> 57:48.000
They will have explained the game by that point, right? No, I'm kidding. I know they've done a better job of that recently.

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
I'm interested, I'm interested.

57:50.000 --> 57:57.000
New quadratic dream game was Detroit Become Human, I guess.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
Or Carrot in Detroit.

57:59.000 --> 58:05.000
So it's kind of, I don't know, a quadratic dream game, I guess.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Lots of fangasms over that.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
David Cage, yeah.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Shane's nodding his head over there.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I love Quantic Dream, they're the best.

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
And that Detroit trailer I've watched so many times, I'm so pumped up for that game.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.000
I want it like last month, or the month before.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
Here's the question I always ask, why?

58:21.000 --> 58:27.000
Because it looks like, I don't care what people say about Quantic Dream games.

58:27.000 --> 58:32.000
Like, oh, you know the writing's not good, the voice acting's not good, whatever.

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
I love Indigo Prophecy, I love Heavy Rain, I love Beyond Two Souls.

58:37.000 --> 58:45.000
The storytelling I actually like, and they're always like, the stories are really good, and this one doesn't look like it's not gonna be good also.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
You know what it really is? It's because he likes Until Dawn.

58:47.000 --> 58:53.000
I think he likes Quick Time Events. He is a huge fan, huge boner for Quick Time Events.

58:53.000 --> 59:05.000
I don't like Quick Time Events so much, but I always think, even with the crap that happened at the end of Indigo Prophecy,

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
and basically all of the games always have really bad endings for some reason,

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
they're so good, and I can just sit there and play them all the way through.

59:14.000 --> 59:20.000
I can't think of a Quantic Dream game I didn't just sit down and play from start to finish.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
Because I did that with all three of their other games.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Alrighty then. And I can't believe it's been like, how many years?

59:28.000 --> 59:34.000
Like when they showed that first demo of, was it Carrow? That was 2012 I guess.

59:34.000 --> 59:39.000
Yeah, but that was, I think that was before Beyond Two Souls, and it was just supposed to be like,

59:39.000 --> 59:42.000
because they do little tech demos to show off their stuff.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.000
Like the old guy.

59:43.000 --> 59:48.000
Yeah, like the wizard in the studio that was just like a TV set or something.

59:48.000 --> 59:56.000
But I don't think, even at the time I thought that Android robot thing demo was going to amount to anything.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
But I'm glad it did, because even the trailer tugged at my heart a little bit. It was really good.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Some other things that they announced, they talked a little bit more about, was it the Horizon Zero Dawn,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
which looks pretty awesome, they showed some more gameplay from that, still looking pretty cool.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So I definitely want to check that out whenever the hell that comes out, probably 2016 at this point.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
2017, who knows.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Gravity Rush 2 is supposed to be coming out over here, as well as the remaster for Playstation 4.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
They showed off a little bit more of Dreams, which is that new media molecule game,

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
which I still don't have any fucking clue what the fuck you're supposed to be doing in that,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
but whatever, it's going to be kind of creative and shit.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
So that'll be coming out.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Drive Club is getting bikes, so if you're still interested in that game, cool.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000
They'll be having some motorcycle content soon.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Let's see here, also Gran Turismo Sport.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000
So they're going to be doing a new racing game in typical Gran Turismo fashion.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:04.000
It'll be coming out someday, because they're going to be working on it until it's right.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
So we'll just wait a little longer for that.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
They have this Minecraft-looking thing called Boundless that was shown off.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It's like a mythical Minecraft thing with these different portals that could take you to other worlds and stuff.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
So that'll look kind of neat.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
No real details on that, though.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And then they were showing off some VR stuff as well.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
I like the whole Battlezone reboot.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
That looked pretty sweet.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
So they've got that from Rebellion.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000
They are talking about Until Dawn, Rush of Blood, which is going to be another VR game.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Riggs, which was the one that they showed off at E3.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Or was it Tokyo Game Show? One of those.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
And then they have this game Robinson, The Journey, which is from Crytek.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So all different things.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Still no mention of when the fuck we should expect PlayStation VR.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000
So 2016, I guess.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Hadn't they quoted the 2016 timeframe previously, though?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I think, well, everything's kind of VR for 2016, but I don't know if it's early 2016 or holiday 2016.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I kind of feel like if they haven't dated it now, I know they spoke about early 2016 before,

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
but I really just feel like it's going to be holiday at this point.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
They're going to keep it in their pants until the holiday, and then they'll have something to blow all over Christmas.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Maybe to see what the NX is, and then kind of combat that.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Maybe, but there's a lot of buzz that NX is basically a Wii U with a detachable gamepad that you can take wherever.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So I don't know how true or to what extent that ends up being.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Well, the other thing I would think is releasing the latter half of the year anyways would be a good idea,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
because you're going to have at least people releasing stuff for Oculus when that comes out, I think in the beginning of 2016.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
And then there'll be more content that can be ported over to PlayStation VR,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
so it'd make more sense to have a platform with more content available instead of,

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:03.000
oh, here's a few games, and all right, let's wait until some more stuff comes out. I don't know.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
All right. Anything else to share from Sony Paris Games Week?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.000
They had a game called Vector that's a rhythm game. That looked pretty cool.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
It's with a collaboration of an artist, Avicii.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Funny you mentioned that, because that was actually what I was about to mention,

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.000
was that particular game that, yeah, Avicii is collaborating for this PlayStation 4 game, Vector.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.000
And they have this whole little preview video for it, but it looks like they have a very social kind of edge to this,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
because you can actually design your own levels and then play against other people's levels.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:39.000
So I'm assuming it's kind of like the thing where you can kind of make your own music tracks,

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
and then other people can actually play those tracks.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
That's pretty cool.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
So I guess it's like Mario Maker with music, and Avicii just kind of is there.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And then, last thing I want to add, they have a release date now for Street Fighter V,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
which is supposed to be February 16th, and they announced Dalzim.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
That seems kind of early in the year for such a huge game, but I guess...

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
No, they've been releasing a lot of fighting games around that time, in fact.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I mean, there's got to be something out for people to use their Christmas gift certificates on, right?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
February gets a little busier in March. It's pretty good. I don't know.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I guess that's true. That's true.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Dark Sakura, next. I think we might have touched on this a little bit last week,

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
but we have some clarity on this, what you're about to talk about now.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Yeah, so Batman Arkham Knight is supposed to be...

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Well, it was pretty disappointing, for lack of a better description.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
I mean, so bad that Steam was offering refunds right away.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
I'm sure we recall that, right?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:46.000
So, they actually have relaunched Arkham Knight, and had a bunch of free goodies.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So, anyone who purchased the PC version before 11.59 Pacific Time on November 16th, 2015,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
will receive free digital copies of the entire series.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
So, that's going to be Arkham Asylum Game of the Year Edition,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Arkham City Game of the Year Edition, Batman Arkham Origins, and Blackgate.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
So, you will be getting all of these goodies in your Steam library.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000
And there will also be the Community Challenge Pack, but that's coming out in January,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
and no one knows what it is.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
And WB is working with Valve for a Team Fortress 2 cross-promotion,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
so that they're going to be doing Batman-themed items for Team Fortress 2.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
And Valve will pick the best one and, I guess, put them in the game.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:51.000
So, however, as far as what is said, for the relaunch, there are no improvements from the patch back in September,

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
other than adding support for add-on and season pass content.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Oh, that's important, of course.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
It might be.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
I forget fixing the game, but hey, as long as you can buy DLC, we're happy.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
As long as you can spend more money.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
However, the game's really not going to be getting any better.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000
So, get your money back while you can while Steam is offering refunds.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Let's be clear, everybody. The game's not going to be better. It's just going to work.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.000
So, this whole thing has really tarnished what otherwise has been such a fantastic series.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
It's just kind of depressing.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:28.000
You know what would have made the game infinitely better already?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Less Batmobile.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Less remote-controlled Batmobile.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000
That is true.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
That was, like, the worst.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Yeah.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Alright.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Well, let's move on. Loki, some big news from another company this week, right?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Yes. Nintendo's finally announced what their successor to Club Nintendo will be, which is my Nintendo.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
And my Nintendo's kind of a move towards an account-based system.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:57.000
They're going to allow you to be able to create new logins for this and be able to tie it with your social media accounts.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Right now, they don't really have a system to tie your purchases to your actual account.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
It's really just tied to your consoles.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:15.000
So, it kind of makes it a little bit difficult if your console breaks or if you buy a new 3DS or something like that and you want to transfer your content.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
It's a big convoluted system to do that.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:25.000
So, hopefully, this will kind of allow for better connection between your consoles that you own and be able to transfer that content.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Or, hey, maybe even, you know, those games where you purchase one version of the game, you get the other version of the game for free or something like that.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
So, that would be kind of nice.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:40.000
And then, along with that, they also announced their first mobile game, which is called Miitomo.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
And what is Miitomo?

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Well, it's some weird fucking game that looks...

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.000
It kind of reminds me, like, what's the one that came out back in June where you had all the Miis doing shit?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Tomodachi Life?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Yeah, Tomodachi Life.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
With that same kind of root word in it?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Yeah, pretty much.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:04.000
So, interesting, because I think a lot of people were expecting, you know, Mario, maybe not so much Pokemon.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Because if you think about it, Pokemon is technically with another company that just works very closely with Nintendo.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Or Zelda, you know, one of the big franchises.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
They're just going to keep shoving Miis down your throat until you accept it.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Well, I'm willing to suspend disbelief a little bit and see what it really is.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Because I didn't want them to just make Mario Brothers on the phone.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Because the phone does not have a tangible controller.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.000
So, I think they need to do something maybe a little different.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So, I'm open to this.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
I mean, it's way too early to judge it.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
We don't know what it is.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
But, Dan, do you have any thoughts on Miitomo?

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Yeah, I mean, because Nintendo's known to be very protective of the brands and all of their, you know, Mario, Kirby and everything.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I don't think that their first dip into the mobile market would be something with one of their biggest IPs.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
They'd want to play with something like Miis, which, you know, if it ends up flopping, then...

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
That's okay, because it's just you.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Yeah, it's just you.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000
You're the horrible person.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
This is your fault that the game did that.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Not our fault.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Exactly.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
It's your fault. You're ugly.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
They should have just done, like, Nintendogs.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Actually, that would have been cute.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
That would be brilliant.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
That would be so smart if they went with that.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I'm just saying, I mean, imagine all the fucking microtransactions you could have for all the, like, pet accessories and shit.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:28.000
That's really not a bad idea for a mobile phone type game from Nintendo is to really expand on the Nintendogs plus cats.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Let's not forget cats.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Even though the cat owns you.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:39.000
And, you know, they could probably make a pretty penny off of, like, dippy accessories and things to dress your doggies with, because...

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Or even breeds. Like, you want dalmatians? $4.99.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Yeah, exactly. Throw all your money at the street.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Yes, all your money. Just throw it.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
I wouldn't be surprised if that's something in the pipeline for later on.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
It's been a while.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Yeah.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
And DungeonBuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
It looks like a social app more than anything else.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:02.000
At least there are four more games after that to see what else Nintendo and DNA have in store.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
They're probably testing to see how this does and will go from there.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
So, yeah, I think this probably is a little bit of a test.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
But it also looks like it's not just a platformer.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.000
So that means, you know, there's probably going to be something a little more to it.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000
And I'm kind of curious to see where Nintendo goes with this social element.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Because I know I've been somewhat critical of Nintendo's online presence in the past.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
But this seems to be something that could really kind of break those walls down a little bit.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
So it's a little exciting. I have reserved caution about this.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
But that's all I can really think of for now, because it's way too early.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Do you know if it's going to have any functionality with the My Nintendo thing that they're launching?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000
They're supposed to have some sort of functionality with it, but they really go into detail.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
They didn't say a lot. They had this whole press conference to basically say,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000
So, our mobile phone game that y'all have been waiting for is going to be delayed.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Thank you for coming.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Please understand.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Please understand. Thank you very much. Have a good night.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
So, oh yeah, okay, here's some slides to hold you over.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:07.000
So it was kind of interesting. And then their stock kind of went...

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
You know, because people were expecting that game to come out this year.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
But, you know, stock is stock. It'll recover.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I wouldn't read too much into it.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:23.000
But at the same time, God, some of the Nintendo apologists were out in force on the social media talking about,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
It's okay, Nintendo, you know, they can do it.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And I'm just kind of like, alright, look, can we just say Nintendo is having kind of a mediocre holiday?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
They've got one huge game, Super Mario Maker.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
I mean, in props, it's probably going to be one of the greatest games of the year.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
Hope you like tennis.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
You know, it's not really where they should have been here in 2015.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:52.000
But they can still, like, the stock can come up. 2016 can be a big year for Nintendo.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.000
It could be a big year. We'll release all of our great games in 2016.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Then 2016, we'll announce all those great games to push to 2017.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
And 2017, yeah, you get where it's happening here.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Crackdown, are you ever going to come out? Seriously?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
You have me waiting until 2015.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
I'm not buying your system until it comes out.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.000
And probably even at that point, we probably won't even see the need to that.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Alright, well let's move on and talk a little bit about another series.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
And I know this is a series that's very popular with some people here in the room.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
But it's going to be taking a very different turn.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
The first footage was shown from the next Five Nights at Freddy's game.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
But it's not, like, Five Nights at Freddy's 5. No, no, no.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
It's going to be Five Nights at Freddy's World.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
And you probably heard that they were going the direction of Scott Cawthon,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
who creates the game, is going a different direction with it,

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
where it's more of a, like, cutesy RPG.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
And, yeah, when you see it, it is more of a cutesy RPG.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Pretty much every character that's ever been even obscurely referenced in a previous game,

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
and then some, are teased to be in the game.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Also, it will be out for PC, iOS, Android.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And there will be a demo for the game, they're saying.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000
And it looks kind of like a classic sort of JRPG Super Nintendo type game.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
So, there you go. I'm curious what our Five Nights fans...

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:19.000
It was stupidly cute.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Yeah. No, we got to keep it moving.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I'm going to play it.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Shayne, what were your thoughts of the trailer that you saw?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
It's adorable.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Yeah?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Mangle at the end with a little ball and paddle is so cute.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:35.000
But isn't Five Nights supposed to be scary?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Well, sometimes.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Do you think there will be jump scares?

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Do you think it's going to be, like, one of those, like, twisted things,

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
where at the end everybody goes to hell or something, you know?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
That would be okay. That would be fun.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:47.000
I just want the movie to come out.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000
The Inevitable Movie.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Yeah. I thought they already said that they sold the rights to that.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
I feel like they did sell the rights, yeah.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
We'll see.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Oh, wait. Dan, did you want to say something on this?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I just wanted to say, this guy is known for messing with his fans

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
for Five Nights at Freddy's.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Like, he loves to play tricks on his fans

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
and put all these little hints into all of his stuff.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.000
So I'm not going to be surprised at all if this comes out.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
And it starts out as cutesy in the beginning,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
and then it takes a really dark turn, like, halfway through.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
But then maybe the joke will be it stays cute the entire time.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
You know, we had you on edge the whole time.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I don't know. I don't know. Who knows?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
All right. Moving on. Dark Sakura.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I was in charge of, like, a Hatoful Boyfriend reboot.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I'd play it.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
So, um, this isn't the first time in Nintendo's long history

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000
that they have censored content for Western audiences.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
There is more censorship on its way.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Actually, for Xenoblade Chronicles X,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
they already showed in the European release

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
that this, uh, actually a couple of, like, very, like,

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.000
uh, bikini outfits, very skin-oriented,

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000
have been changed to, like, weird bikini tops with shorts.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000
Um, and I think that part of it was just because

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
they're for younger characters.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
But still, uh, I don't know.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Nintendo's been doing this for a while.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Um, they also did the same thing, um,

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
with, uh, Fatal Frame Maiden of Blackwater

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
when that came out. So, it's not surprising.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000
It's fine for the Xenoblade Chronicles game

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
because that character is 13.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000
So do you need to see her in a skimpy bathing suit?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Because if you do, you're a pedophile.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Why don't you have a seat over here?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
What? Are you a pedophile?

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
No! Why didn't you ever see the To Catch a Predator series

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
where the guy goes, why don't you take a seat over there?

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
No.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I'm sorry you didn't get me.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
But that's not how you did it.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
You're like, why don't you take a seat right here?

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I thought you was talking.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Then I will, I will say this.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000
If you think that the outfit is unnecessary in a video game,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
then you need to be also petitioning, uh,

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000
major clothing chains to stop providing

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
bikinis for young children starting

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
three years old and up.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Just saying.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
They make bikinis for toddlers.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
But if we don't have that, then we don't get a new season

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
of toddlers and tiaras.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
So we need that to happen.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It is a complex question.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000
But, then would you say that that, by the same token,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
would also lead to pedophilia?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Oh, I'm sure it does.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000
I saw an episode of Always Sunny in Philadelphia about that.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Okay, this is going to a dark place,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
so we're going to keep them moving on to a new topic.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Hey, I'm just pointing out some double standards here.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
We're going to travel around the world and check out some

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
release dates and find some things coming.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I need release from this episode.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
A lot sooner than a new season of toddlers and tiaras.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Loki, US.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Yes, we're getting into the thick of it now.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
So, we've got Need for Speed coming out.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Also, Snoopy's Grand Adventure on 3DS and Wii U.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Air Conflict Pacific Carriers on PlayStation 4.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
The Jackbox Party Pack coming out on PlayStation 3,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
That's been out, or is this like a disc release?

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000
It's a disc release.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Totally forgot to mention during our gaming week that

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
we did do some Quiplash and Fibbage yesterday.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Good times.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
That's always a...

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
Man, they do such good party game work over there.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And Game of the Year contender,

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Barbie and Her Sister's Puppy Rescue,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:38.000
also coming out on PlayStation 3, 3DS, Wii U, and Xbox 360.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Shane, have you reserved your copy?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
I think he, I don't know.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Did he reserve his copy?

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000
Hopefully.

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Barbie and the Puppy Rescue.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I love puppies.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I would rescue puppies with Barbie.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
There you go.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
But no, I didn't reserve my copy.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.000
All right.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
We've got Shovel Knight, the disc version,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.000
coming out on Wii U, 3DS, and it looks like PlayStation 4.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
They're doing like a re-release of some of the old Ninja Turtles

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000
games on 3DS.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Master Splinter's Training Pack.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
It's just old shit.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Evolve Ultimate Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
Yes, that's the old DLC included edition.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Same with Lords of the Fallen Complete Edition.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.000
That's also coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox 360.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Tiny Troopers Joint Ops on PlayStation 4.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
World Poker Championship on PlayStation 4.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000
And then finally on Friday, because god dammit,

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I hate companies that have to release everything

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
on different days of the week, but Call of Duty Black Ops 3

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4,

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Xbox One, and PC.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
That's somewhat of a big deal.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Somewhat of a big deal.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000
For retailers, yeah.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
And then Yokai Watch also coming out on 3DS.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
Boom.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Yay, I'm going to be buying that one.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
And then I'm going to tell Shane how awesome it is.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
And then PlayStation 4 is also getting Awesome Knots Assemble

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
on the disc version of that.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Wait, Darsakha, you want to interject something there

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000
at our screening match?

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
No, that's why I shook my head before.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Oh.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
And then, hold on.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Still not done yet, because we got to release shit.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Oh, wait, no.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Yeah, one on the weekend, so Skylander Supercharger

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Starter Pack is getting a release for iPad.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000
That's it.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
All right, let's head over to Japan

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000
and check out the releases over there.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Fairy Fencer F, Advent Dark Force,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
is out on the PlayStation 4 this week

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
in regular and limited edition.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And LEGO Jurassic World also getting its release

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000
in Japan this week.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And a game getting a price reduction from Sega.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Ryu Ga Gotoku Isshin gets a new price version out this week.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000
Traveling over to the Wii U.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:39.000
LEGO Jurassic World is out on the Wii U this week as well.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Hey, it's a game release on the Wii U.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Everybody, pay attention.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000
On the Vita this week,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
To Love Ryu, Trouble Darkness, True Princess,

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
comes out in regular and limited edition on the Vita.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000
And all I can say is there are girls holding hands on the cover,

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
and I don't know, Jamie may take issue with that.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
I don't know.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
But it looks like some type of...

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
I don't even know if it's a dating sim or what.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
Whatever.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Yeah, that's pretty much what I have to say about it, too.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.000
How about the 3DS?

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Looking over on the 3DS real quick

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
to see what's releasing there.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
We have Disney Magic Castle,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
My Happy Life 2,

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
as well as LEGO Jurassic World,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
and Seikaiju no Miku 4,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Denshu no Kyojin,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
and that gets a price reduction.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
That is from Atlus.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:32.000
I'm curious what this Disney Magic Castle,

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
My Happy Life 2 game is.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
And it looks like you actually get to exist

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
with your little Mii with Disney characters.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
And that actually looks super cute.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
That's kind of adorable.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
I don't know, I think I might actually play that.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
I mean, I can't understand the Japanese,

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000
but it looks super...

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Oh, look, the three little pigs are in it.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
It's kind of cute.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I don't know, I might have to get that one.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I'm sure they have it over here under a different name.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Disney Games.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Pretty universal.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
It's Disney Buy Our Stuff edition.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Of course.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000
How about Europe, DarkSaga?

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Some stuff's coming out.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
That's all you need to know.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000
No, on the second, we have Sonic Lost World for PC.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And on the sixth, we have Call of Duty Black Ops 3 for Xbox 360,

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
PlayStation 3, PS4, Xbox One, blah, blah, blah, PC,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000
a need for speed on all the same blah, blah, blah systems,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000
and the Peanuts movie Snoopy's Grand Adventure on everything else,

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
and the major blah, blah, blah systems.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I don't know if it's just my brain or something,

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000
but I swear to God, you just said Peanuts.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
I heard that too.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
I heard that too.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000
But you all are hellbound, all of you going to hell.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.000
I heard Peanuts.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
You know what? Hell doesn't exist in my religion.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Fair enough.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
All right.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
By the way, it's being clarified for us in chat.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Act Def says, it's the Disney magical world game

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
that was like Disney's Animal Crossing.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I remember that from a couple of years ago.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Why do I not own this?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
That's a very good question.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
Why don't you own it?

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
BRB going to Target.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
I don't know if you can find it now.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
You know what? BRB going to Amazon right now.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
All right.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Meanwhile, we have a couple more stories for you guys,

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
and then the classic game of the week,

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
and it's a real good one this week, but I'm being biased.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
All right, Loki.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Oh my God, it's totally time to jump in on that Kinect action.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Yes, you can get a brand new Kinect for $50 cheaper.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
That's right, for a limited time.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Microsoft is taking that integral part of the Xbox One,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.000
and they're reducing its price by $50.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
I think now to what, $100?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Yeah, $100 maybe?

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Yes, $100.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000
And you can play all these wonderful games on it.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
And yeah, it's a limited time offer though.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
So that integral piece of the Xbox One

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
can continue to be ignored.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Yes.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Mike, you want to say something on this?

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
That thing cost $150 fucking dollars.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Are you shitting me?

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Yeah, as standalone it did.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000
$150.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Oh my God.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Oh my God.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
It came with Dance Central.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
It's $30 on Amazon.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Uh-oh.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Yeah, but it came with Dance Central,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000
the fucking Xbox Live game,

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:19.000
not like a disc-based game that had a lot of songs in it.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
It was the piecemeal buy-all-of-our-DLC game.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I know.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
$150 for your Xbox to keep tabs on you.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Yeah, to listen in on you and shit.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.000
That's...

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Oh, come on.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Come on.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Come on.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
But you can play such wonderful games like...

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000
If I want pizza, I will text Domino's the emoji.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Like Zoo Tycoon, or Kinect Sports Rivals,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:45.000
or Rapids Invasion, or Fantasia.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Here's the reality.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I'm happy the Kinect is lower priced,

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:52.000
where it's now in line of where it was on the 360.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
That's good news.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000
What's not so good news is I still don't understand

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
why I need one.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
What games are they releasing that are Kinect games,

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
that are Kinect games that are coming out?

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I will give it this.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I really want to play that Fantasia game.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
But I'm like, it's one game.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
You know what I mean?

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
The only Fantasia game I want to play has to have Fantasia in it.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I think this one does.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000
As in, not the movie, but Fantasia.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Does the Xbox have any streaming, built-in streaming?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
Oh yeah, and you can use X to for streams.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000
Well, don't they have the Xbox 360 version?

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
Don't you have the Kinect for 360?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Yeah, I have the Kinect for 360.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Get that on 360, then.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Maybe I will. I don't know.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.000
So, by the way, an Xbox One might be happening at my house.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Finally.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Hey.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
It goes down with Forza.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Well, there you go.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Forza's a pretty good game.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
I will say this, though.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
I do own a PlayStation camera.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I will say that.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
And it's just about equally as useless.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Yeah, I bought one to do live streaming with.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Outside of that, it's also fucking useless.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
And that's why I don't want to make the same mistake twice.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Yeah, that's what I was about to say.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:04.000
I know for sure that the PlayStation has streaming built-in.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
And at least you can make the excuse of,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
if you're going to get the camera, and you intend on streaming your shit,

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000
that it at least serves some purpose.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.000
But I don't know anything really about Xbox, because I'm a Sony fanboy.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000
Playroom was fun, and that was free.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
So that was kind of cool.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Although some of the best games on it don't actually use the camera.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000
So I'm not really sure why they're on Playroom, but, you know, okay.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000
All right.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000
SHU100Matt in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000
pointing out that Just Dance, that series,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
they don't require the Kinect anymore either.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
You can use your mobile device camera.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
And that's the way a lot of these peripheral games are going.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000
SingStar on Sony, you don't need the mics anymore.

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Use an iPhone app.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
There's an app for that.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.000
And that's where a lot of, you know, if they can build a controller into the phone,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
you know, Jackbox Party Pack, we've talked a lot about on this show,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
because, you know, we had Jackbox games on a couple weeks ago.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
The phones are an integral part of those games.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
That's how you control them.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:12.000
For Android, at least, you can stream to Twitch from your phone now.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
You can, with the new Twitch app.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Which, you know, that's kind of one of the bummers right now

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
about the locked ecosystem of Apple.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Some people can look up your nostrils when you play Hearthstone,

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
or whatever the hell you're going to be playing.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
They don't need to see that.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
They do not need to see that.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
All right.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Well, it's only fair we take a moment, you know,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
to be a little critical of something in Sony's world too,

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
because this is one of those things where we kind of keep looking at this going.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000
This just doesn't make sense.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000
And so apparently what happened this week,

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Yoshida was doing like a Q&A on Twitter,

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
answering some different questions.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
And one of the questions that was asked was,

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
when are we going to be able to change our PlayStation Network names?

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
You know, this is something that's been asked for for a long time.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Can we change our PSN names?

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
And the response that came back was,

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
we're not sure if we can do it.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
We don't know if we can ever do it.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
And, yeah, that has a lot of people kind of going,

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Why?

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Why?

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000
What's the, like, it's really a technical challenge to say,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.000
like, if A, it's now B, like a search and replace,

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
which is in the most basic word processing is not,

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000
I mean, I don't, again, I don't do the tech stuff as well,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
that I would make games and not talk about them if I, you know,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.000
was more tech savvy, but I just can't fathom why this is such a stinking challenge.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
But they're changing their answer.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000
That's what irritates me so much.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Their previous excuse was that they didn't want people to abuse the system

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.000
and change their user tags so that they could continue to harass people

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
that previously blocked them.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Now it seems like they're shifting their position.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
So it's like, okay, why wasn't this your answer in the first place?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Oh, my God, Dan, do you mean that sometimes in the industry,

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000
companies make things up about some sort of what consumers want

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
to hide a technical challenge?

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Oh, my, that, lying in my industry?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Oh, my, never, never.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
No, I know, I know.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Cover-ups in gaming?

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Do you wish to take the technical challenge?

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Yes, Mark Summers, I will.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Double dare.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
It just, it pisses me off so much because I don't know,

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:29.000
my PSN name is from way back in 2011, and by God, I wish I could change it.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.000
And it just, it's frustrating to see them shimmy like this.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.000
I don't know why now they're coming out with this,

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
and I don't understand it either.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:45.000
But as a reminder, PlayStation Plus is available for just, you know, this,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
now I'm going for a low blow, but I just, it is one of those weird things.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000
You kind of have to wonder, like, obviously the technical challenge

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
dates all the way back to when they first implemented it,

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
or it would not be going on this long.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
So I don't know.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
We had issues with the calendar one time that rendered the system

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
kind of stupid for a little bit.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Well, maybe they'll be able to do something in the PlayStation 5.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Or they'll just come out with a new network like Nintendo's doing.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Oh, well, you know, we're going to throw away PlayStation Network

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
and come out with something new, or you can actually change your name

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:27.000
and all these other features too. Who knows? Who knows?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.000
But guess what? The best part about that is you get to buy all your apps again.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Fuck you guys.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Except I don't know that's the case.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
All right. I can see them.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Well, we have no way to tie those old purchases to this new console.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000
And you're fucked.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Well, let's take a trip down memory lane.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000
You know what? We need to go back to a time when you didn't sign into your console.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Do you know how you said hello to your console?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
You blew on the cartridge and then blew inside the Nintendo

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.000
hoping that the two would connect and miraculously work.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:01.000
We're going to take a step.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000
That was the technical challenge was that the cartridges would just stop

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
fucking working at some point.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
We're going to take a step into Dark Sakura's gaming vault

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
where she's going to find a game and she says,

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Hey, you ungrateful little shits.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I just made that up. I don't know if she does say that.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:20.000
But you should play this video game right now, Dark Sakura.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:24.000
What is it? What is the classic game of the week?

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Did you not see where I said play the sound first?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Let's get to it.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Let people guess.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
How can you not know this? How do you not know it?

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
It's because you talk over it, Rob.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
The game is Metroid.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
No shit.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Hell, I've done Super Metroid, but I've not done Metroid.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Hearts.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
It needed to be done.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000
It was the first of a long line of Metroid games

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
and arguably the second best.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
It was co-developed by Nintendo's Research and Development 1 Division

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
and Intelligent Systems and came out for the Famicom Disk System

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.000
on August 6, 1986, and for the Nintendo Entertainment System

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000
in North America, August 1987, and in Europe, January 1988.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
It had a re-release for Game Boy Advance in 2004

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
and Wii Virtual Console in 2007.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:33.000
It was also produced by the late Gunpei Yokoi, who we lost tragically,

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:38.000
also by Okada Satoru and Sakamoto Yoshio,

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
and the music was done by Tanaka Hirokazu,

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:47.000
which is some of the best video game music ever of the 8-bit era, so to say.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:50.000
So basically, you land on the planet Zebes

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:57.000
and you play as Samus Aran, who tries to go basically retrieving the Metroids.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
They were stolen by space pirates who were big lizard people.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Damn you, pirates!

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Yeah.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:08.000
And it's basically just an exploration game.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
It's a very difficult exploration game in some places.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000
You know, it requires on different tricks and things,

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
some things invented by just people playing the game normally

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
that ended up making it into being required pieces of,

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
required skill sets, I should say, for the later Metroid games.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:34.000
And it's in a power-ranked Metroid as number 11 on their list of best video games.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Not high enough.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:42.000
Game Informer listed, it is number 7, and then it was 69th by EGM.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.000
What does EGM know?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Nothing.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000
Nothing.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
Clearly.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.000
We sure say some ballsy things on this show sometimes that we have no business saying.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
We have all the business saying.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:02.000
So the neat thing about this game is that really your path to exploration

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:06.000
is gained not just by the act of exploration,

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:09.000
but by the certain tools and weapons that you pick up on the way.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000
You start off with a very weak power beam and all you can do is jump.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:18.000
You immediately get the morph ball, which, um,

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I mean basically you can't play the game without the morph ball anyway.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000
It's like, uh, how do I get into this really low thing?

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:30.000
Uh, if only there were a way I could turn into a little ball and roll under it.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000
Yeah.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:35.000
So, um, other power-ups that you get, you can drop bombs as the morph ball,

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
which you can also learn how to do the bomb jump,

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:43.000
which was a way to get sneakily into some other places in the game.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Um, you could get the, uh, the screw attack, which is basically like,

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I'm invincible, bitches.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Get out of the way.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Screw it.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Screw you, screw you, screw you, and especially screw you.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.000
I could just imagine Samus saying that.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Um, and so you get, you know, like the freeze beam and rockets and all kinds of shit.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:12.000
So, um, this game also introduced us to some of the, uh,

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.000
most hardcore of enemies, including, uh, Kraid and Ridley,

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.000
because there's a guy at my work.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000
Ridley for Smash Bros.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.000
There was a guy at work who had like a huge perler of Ridley,

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000
Super Metroid Ridley.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
I was like, I have to make that.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.000
I think when you get into the perler bead thing,

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
which every gamer does at some point in their life,

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:39.000
you're like required to make a Metroid sprite.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Like it's just, you have to.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000
You know the first one I made was though.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.000
What's that?

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:43.000
The Guardian Legend.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000
I made the Guardian.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:45.000
Of course.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000
Because the Guardian Legend is the best Nintendo game of all time.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:51.000
I would say Metroid inspired the Guardian a little bit.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000
Didn't it come out earlier than Metroid?

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Um, I don't think so.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Okay, field time for me.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.000
Guardic did, but the original Guardian Legend, which would be Guardic 2,

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:02.000
wouldn't have come out.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.000
Guardic Gaiden came out in 1988.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
So, you're right.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Okay, but Guardic.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
My favorite words in the Ingress language.

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Shut up.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
But Guardic came out in 1986.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
So, anyway.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Guardic Gaiden was fun.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Anyway, so basically it's really just going around.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
He finally, finally, finally reached the Mother Brain,

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
who was also the main bad guy of Captain and the Game Master.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000
And we forget that that series existed because it was mega bad.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Mega bad.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Anyway, so after you destroy Mother Brain, you get a bomb set for 999 seconds,

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:49.000
and you have to escape and fly away with the little Metroid baby.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.000
The last Metroid is in captivity.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
The galaxy is at peace.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
Not for long, bitches.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000
So, anyway.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:06.000
This was basically green-lighted because of all of the games that had just been so successful for Nintendo,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
including here goes Donkey Kong from 81, Ice Climber in 85, Super Mario Bros.,

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
and then The Legend of Zelda, which came out right before this.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.000
So, it gave, it opened up for an adventure game to come out.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:24.000
And Metroid was a, the name came across as a portmanteau of Metro and Android.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
And I guess it evolved from there.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.000
So, the game was, I mean, it took a lot of development.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:33.000
A lot of people were involved in it.

01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Big names in Nintendo and, of course, the late Yokoi.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:48.000
So, the particular game was also meant to be one of the first non-linear, non-RPG games.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Which, I mean, if you look at it, yeah, it is completely non-linear.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.000
You can play anything in any order, provided you have the materials to get there.

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:02.000
So, and it requires a lot of creativity to make your way through the game.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I mean, I was no good at it because I was kind of uncoordinated.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.000
But, you know, that's another story.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:16.000
You also, there's, this was one of the early games to use a password system

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:25.000
because the Famicon disc version had, you could save up to three save files on the disc.

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Which, of course, there was no battery built into the game for the US release.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000
So, they had the password system.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
But the password system gave us two particular special codes.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:44.000
One of them was Justin Bailey, where Samus would run around in a bathing suit.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.000
And then you had a Narpa sword.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Which, it gives you infinite ammunition, health, power-ups, and a modified ice beam.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000
What Dan and I discovered is that if you do the Narpa sword and do the quick beat,

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:08.000
where you can skip right to the Mother Brain level, it's like some trick where you freeze something and jump off of it and make it into the little deal thing.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Then you can go back and play in the bathing suit with the Narpa sword power-up.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000
So, we called it Narpus Bailey.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:23.000
So, you also had up to five endings available.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000
And the third, fourth, and fifth endings, Samus would appear without her suit.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000
So, it was also where you found out that you were playing a female character the whole time.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Which, me being a kid, I was like, oh shit. It was so cool.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:47.000
I think this really was, as far as I can think of, and I'm sure on some of the older systems like Atari I'm neglecting something in the moment,

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:54.000
but really the first big twist ending that shouldn't be such a big deal, but it is.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
It was important.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.000
And now, thankfully, this has paved the way for today where it's really not so much of a big deal.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Right. Because now we look back at it and go, was it really such a big deal? Yes, it was.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Yes, it really was. Which is now why it's also paved the way for us to look at Ubisoft, for example.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Well, yeah, you can have a female protagonist get on it for Assassin's Creed.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:25.000
Although, from what I understand, they are barely catching up in the terms of the sexism market in that series.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:31.000
So, basically, with the music, now, I mentioned the music and how awesome it was.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:39.000
The sound designer, Tanaka, said that he wanted to make the players feel like they were entering a living organism,

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.000
so there was no distinction between music and sound effect.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:51.000
So the only melodic theme that you hear is when the mother brain is defeated, so you get that.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:59.000
But the rest of it is supposed to be more like it's part of your whole experience.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000
So I thought that was pretty cool.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:10.000
And they also acknowledged, the creators did, that the movie Alien influenced the game quite a bit.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I mean, because you've got the character Ripley, and that Samus herself was inspired by Ellen Ripley of Alien.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Also, that the background music, the score itself, was inspired by the score for Alien as well.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:45.000
So, it has sold 2.73 million units worldwide, and it spawned so many different, I'd say, sequels, an entire mythos.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
It has a manga series. It's pretty amazing.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:56.000
And on top of that, this game is one of the ones that is credited with creating the speedrunning genre.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Because of the multiple endings that were based on how quickly you beat the game.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000
So, let's see what we've got.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.000
Yeah, and of course it also influenced Castlevania Symphony of the Night, so that's awesome.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:23.000
The game Metroid Zero Mission is a re-imaging of this game, with more backstory, enhanced graphics, but it has the same game layout.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:29.000
Now there was another thing that, I didn't see a mention of this anywhere, and I've been trying to find it again.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:43.000
The hubby was playing, it had to be like 10 something years ago, but it was called the Metroid Maker, which was a ROM editor for Metroid.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:51.000
And there's a few people out there who have done custom Metroid games that you play via emulator or via ROM players.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:42:01.000
So, those are out there and definitely worth it, but I would say the only game that has surpassed the original Metroid would be Super Metroid.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:04.000
And that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Fair enough. I can agree with it.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000
And that's it.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:12.000
There it is. Your classic game of the week. Really, truly. I mean, they're all classics.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.000
Why haven't I done this yet?

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Yeah, right?

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
I've done like three games in a row that I'm like, what? I didn't know.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I mean, but what a testament to, there are so many great games in the world that here we are, you've been doing this, you haven't done this every week, because we didn't start this segment until about episode 250.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I've named how many hundred games?

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:38.000
That's still about 350 games that, you know, are just classics that are games you should check out at some point.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Even though admittedly a few of them were pretty terrible.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
And I'll admit, I suck at Metroid.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Flat out suck at it.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.000
That's okay.

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I love, I mean, it's like you were talking about what we're doing with Super Metroid, me and the hubby, just, you know, me doing the guide, him doing the playing.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:57.000
But I like when you can do stuff like that when there's things that you can find.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Yeah.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:04.000
And have more about the memories or what it did for future games or like I remember a few weeks ago, you did that LSD game on the PlayStation.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.000
It's like that game actually isn't very good, but it's just kind of like it was something very different.

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:10.000
It was different.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I like to, I like to, I still am trying to find the name of the game that you played with nothing but sound that came on the Sega Saturn and it came with seeds.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Do you remember?

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Maybe somebody in chat knows.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.000
What was the store that was in Burlingame that had all the imports where it got?

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000
Oh, I remember the place. I don't remember the name of the place.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:37.000
But, um, I know it was Game Masters was the one that was in, um, uh, Citrus Heights.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.000
But, um, but they had that game there and I was like, get it and play the weird Japanese game that you had to grow seeds.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:49.000
But yeah, I, I like the obscure, but you can't go without mentioning Metroid.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:57.000
So, you know, Tiger Claw points out talking about like alien and all that in Metroid, one of the bad guys is named Ridley, which I'm sure was named after Ridley Scott, the director.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Indeed.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Yeah.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Very cool.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000
All right.

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
Well, anyhow, we're going to take a quick break, guys.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:08.000
We're having a long show tonight, but with good reason because we've got friends joining us here in studio.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.000
We're going to take a break.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Don't go anywhere.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Live tonight with episode number 620 of our show for November the first of 2015.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000
And if you're just joining us, you missed a pretty exciting first part of the show.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000
We were talking about Bob Ross and a lot of news out of Sony as well as Nintendo.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:48.000
We have some guests in studio tonight, although some of them actually stepped out for a minute, doing the all-important ice cream run that we need this time of year.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
So, or this time of the show.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Well, I mean, you know, this time of year, you start to crave ice cream even more and more with all the holiday treats and things going on.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.000
But a mic is still here. Dan and Shane ran out on the air, and so Mike's still here joining us, of course.

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Having a good time so far, being here on the show?

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Yeah.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Is it weird to, like, listen to it and then now you're here and seeing it all play out?

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Yeah.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Yeah?

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:15.000
What do you think the listeners miss by not being here?

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000
What do you think they'd be surprised to know about the studio?

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
Oh, your lovely faces.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
Me rolling my eyes at you.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Yeah, that too.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Yeah.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.000
Cool posters.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Yeah?

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000
I'm surprised there's Konami stuff in here, because I know recently, at least.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Well, you know, we started as a show about, you know, DDR.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.000
So, you know, Konami's still always going to hold a special place in our heart.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
But now it's like, god damn it.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000
Exactly. It's the old Konami that, you know, we really love.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:53.000
And, you know, I've used this metaphor to death, so I apologize for bringing it up again, but it's the old Tyra Banks thing.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
We were rooting for you. We were all rooting, you know.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:58.000
To see Konami keep going down that path is frustrating.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:03.000
But I love this, this DDR second mix marquee with the Konami seal that is official.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
I love this. It's one of my favorites.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
And sadly, it doesn't translate well to radio.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:11.000
There have been a lot of people always asking, are you ever going to do the live stream thing?

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
People live stream on Twitch TV.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
Why don't you guys do live stream?

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
But I'm always like, it's Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.000
It's like, all you would see is our faces buried in the computers.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:25.000
And once in a while, there might be a thing where we look up and throw something at each other.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
Maybe a special occasion, but probably not like a permanent thing.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. That's how I feel anyway.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Maybe.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
A lot of things that I watch, too, are just like big talking heads on webcams.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.000
And it's like, this isn't, you know, it's not really, with all due respect, it's not a compelling video.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000
I could just look the other way and just listen to the audio, which is far more compelling.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
So, anyway. Little side tangent.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:50.000
But let's get back into some gaming news, because we still have a lot of ground to cover.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.000
We've been running long, and we want to make sure we have time for some of your calls over at 1877 Game OLR.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
So, let's get to some rapid fire news. Loki, start us off.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000
So, Criterion has basically said, hey, guess what?

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:09.000
We are working to make Burnout Paradise backwards compatible on Xbox One.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Which has everybody, I'm sure, excited, because that game is fucking amazing.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
No surprise whatsoever.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
Really, they should just make a new Burnout game.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000
I mean, I know they're making some sports game, or it's like some extreme sports type thing.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
But I'd rather them make a new Burnout game.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Because that would be goddamn amazing.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
But hey, that's something at least.

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:36.000
To go along with that, also, Rocket League is going to be getting a free November update.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000
And they're going to add some mutators to the mix.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000
So, different things that you can have in the game.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.000
Include the size and shape and weight of the ball. Gravitational effects.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.000
If you want the ball to be a cube, you can do that.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
It should make games a little bit more interesting.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000
And also, more opportunities to live stream and stuff.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Because you're going to have weird parameters.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Balls that dwarf the cars.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
That would be kind of funny.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
Yeah, looking forward to that.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:14.000
And then, Fallout 4 is just a couple weeks away.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:20.000
And if you want to get hyped up about it, you can check out the Nuka Cola Quantum.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000
Which is being put out by Jones Soda.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:31.000
And they've got this. It's going to be sold exclusively at Target stores starting November 10th.

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
So, I don't know.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
But I want to know, what does it taste like?

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
It's blue. Is it radiation?

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Punch.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:45.000
I thought the flavor was out there. I thought I remember reading about it, but I don't remember what it was.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Maybe somebody in chat knows.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
It's just Jones Soda, right?

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Yeah, it says...

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Is it pomegranate, maybe? I don't know.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Pomegranate. Pome wonderful.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, bubble gum or punch?

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
Ew.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Ew. I will not drink it if it is remotely gum related flavors whatsoever.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
That is a Nuka Jamie Cola.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
Yuck. Just disgusting.

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Or cotton candy or some nonsense like that.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
Cotton candy would be fine.

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
Gum is nasty.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Gum is just gross.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
She feels about that how I feel about mayonnaise.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
It's like shitty medicine flavor.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I will drink a bottle of Robitussin before I will smell gum.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Alright.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:35.000
Anyway, I know a lot of people are very excited about Fallout 4 and are literally saying goodbye to their life for November.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
I do want to play that game.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I will work and then I will Fallout 4 and that is that.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
I will play Fallout 4 for most of November.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.000
I actually thought my game Call of Duty, but I'm like, eh, I don't have the money right now.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
So I will wait until Fallout 4 comes out, maybe, and spend money on that.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Alright.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Alright, well, hopping around for some other news.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:00.000
The late Satoru Iwata to be honored with a lifetime achievement at the Golden Joystick Awards.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
Actually, I apologize. That actually already happened.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:08.000
That was at the O2 Arena in London and it was the 33rd annual event for games and people in the industry.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:14.000
He was honored with the lifetime achievement award for, obviously, everything he's done with Nintendo and for gaming as a whole.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:23.000
So he was given that award and, you know, I'm sure this is the first of many memorial awards to be given.

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Let's see.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Going over to PlayStation Plus and the releases for November.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000
PlayStation 4 will be getting Dragon Fin Soup, Magica 2, and The Walking Dead Season 2.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:39.000
PlayStation 3, Beyond Good and Evil, Dragon Fin Soup, and Mass Effect 2.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Interesting. I know they had already given away Mass Effect 3, so it's interesting they're going back there.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.000
And on the Vita, Dragon Fin Soup is there as well, and Invisimals.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:51.000
So those games will be out on November 3rd.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:56.000
Xbox, not to be missed, will also have their free games with gold.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:01.000
On Xbox One, you get Numa, I think is what it's called, Breath of Life.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.000
It's a first-person puzzle game adventure.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:09.000
And then on the 16th, you'll be able to get Night Squad, which is a throwback party game type of thing.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:14.000
On the Xbox 360, Dirt 3, and then Dungeon Siege 3.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.000
By the way, don't forget that the Xbox compatibility backwards stuff happens.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:27.000
So these two games expected to be backwards compatible, because they said that all the Xbox 360 games would be backwards compatible.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.000
I wish they had that on PlayStation 4, like where the games are backwards compatible.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Wouldn't that be nice? Wouldn't that be nice? But sadly, I don't think that's the case.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Also, last but not least, this really shouldn't be too much of a surprise,

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:48.000
but Sega is going to be looking at re-releasing the first two Shenmue games.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Which, with all the hype trained for the third game and all the money they made on Kickstarter,

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:59.000
no surprise here that Sega Europe marketing director John Rook, in talking with Marketing Week,

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:04.000
said that Sega is, quote, exploring ways to re-release the original two Shenmue titles.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Quote, we want to innovate and back smartphones and virtual reality,

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:12.000
but our key purpose is to go back to what the brand used to stand for.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000
And I think the buzz around Shenmue 3 shows that people love our legacy.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:21.000
So you can expect those games will turn up at some point along the way to Shenmue 3.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:22.000
You alright?

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Yeah, we love their legacy, not the new fucking Sonic games.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000
Alright, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Well, it's finally happening. There's going to be a Portal board game.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I need to have this. I can't help, but this must be mine.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Oh, and it has GLaDOS in it too.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000
No, Jamie, you don't need it. You need water and a roof over your head.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.000
She gave me the same lecture like two weeks ago. You don't need it.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
No, you're correct. I want it.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.000
I want it very badly to the point that I can confuse it with a need.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:02.000
Fair enough. I had to. I had to. You left me no choice.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000
You had a choice. You always had a choice.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Okay, but it was an easy choice.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
You're number one.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.000
Alright, I got one finger being shown at me right now. Alright.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.000
Hearts, hearts, hearts.

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:24.000
So anyway, it's going to be 50 bucks, and you can get it from the Cryptozoic, or buy it at other places.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
You monster.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Also, Mario Maker has more updates coming out very soon.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:39.000
You'll be able to add checkpoints to existing levels, or to create new ones that include them.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:46.000
For you people that like to make Satan levels that are just ass hard, then you can finally put some goddamn checkpoints in them.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Ass hard.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.000
They won't.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Yeah, except you won't because you're a dick, and you like to make your levels hard.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Speaking of hard.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
But they can clear it. Why can't you?

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:55.000
They probably can't.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:03.000
Because they probably only clear it because they put a little cheat in the beginning, like invisible blocks that lead up to a warp pipe that just drops them on the flag at the end.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Bitches.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.000
So anyway, you can also add status-dependent power-ups.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:16.000
For example, if you put a fire flower block, it can eject a super mushroom if you're small instead.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.000
You know what's funny? I criticized the game for that in the very beginning.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
I said it doesn't work like Mario Brothers works.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Yeah.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Yeah, so it's kind of funny they went back and fixed that. That's interesting.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000
Well, and there's also going to be more Nintendo-designed courses.

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:36.000
So it'll have the winning level from the partnership with Facebook, but you have to use your real name on it.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:44.000
And then you can tackle the level that was in the final round of the PAX Prime Omega-thon.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:48.000
And it's got some official makers. More things will be coming out.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Yes, and the Facebook level will just autoplay, even though you didn't really want to see it on your screen.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
And then you have to install a plugin.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.000
Yep.

01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Also happening is the SSSW.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.000
South by Southwest.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Whatever.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
What?

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
It's South by Southwest.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Okay, fine. I don't keep up with those things.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:21.000
But they did have to cancel two panels they were going to have in response to threats of online...

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Sorry, on-site violence that were set around online harassment.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Ironic, right?

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
But their director, Hugh Forrest, said,

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:41.000
By canceling two sessions, we sent an unintended message that they not only tolerate online harassment, but condones it.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
And for that, we are truly sorry.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:54.000
So, on Saturday, March 12th, they're hosting an online harassment summit that will be taking place in the 2016 event.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
And livestreamed to the public for free.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:03.000
They are going to have a large number of speakers, including Wendy Davis.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Who, I don't know if people remember, she did the filibuster for...

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't remember what it was. I remember she was there on the floor for hours and hours.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000
Although I'm very disappointed that she's a Hillary supporter, and I like Bernie.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Get out of the politics. This is video games.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
It's all wrapped up together.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
And also, Brianna Wu's going to be there.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000
A few other people.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Actually, from all over the political and industry spectrum. So, pretty neat.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:42.000
This whole thing was a bit of a shitstorm online, and if you didn't see any of it, you're honestly for the better.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Because every time I think, I'm not going to see this ever again, hooray!

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:52.000
I'm just like, I'm done with it. It's a big ol' fucking circle jerk. I just don't give a shit anymore.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000
It's like...

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:01.000
You're right. This panel will totally solve online harassment forever. It will do nothing.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000
It will not bring more awareness to it. It will do nothing.

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:16.000
No, no, no. The thing is that by saying something is going to do nothing and immediately dismissing any attempts to rectify it, all that does is perpetuate the same thing over and over.

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:23.000
The more exposure something like that gets, the more people willing to stand up and do something about it, the better chance there is of having something being done.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:27.000
By more exposure, I'm sure you mean more exposure for Brianna Wu, because that's really what she wants.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:34.000
Hold on, hold on. Let me say it this way, because I'm all for intelligent people speaking, but the problem is, nobody's...

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.000
I shouldn't say nobody. That's not true. The people that need to hear it are not going to be listening.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:50.000
However, what I would like to see is a summit discuss on what to do to retaliate. As in, hold the people who pull the shit accountable.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.000
You can only anonymize yourself so much online. There's a way to find most of these people.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
That's why I find Wendy Davis...

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:00.000
That's why you can dox everybody, because that's what they like, right?

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:13.000
But that's why we need to have politicians, and that's why it's encouraging that Wendy Davis is participating, because what legally can we do to hold these doxers and these people who do this shit and get away with it because they can, what can we do to hold them accountable?

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.000
That's a discussion that needs to happen.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:26.000
And see, what my thought is, is that if you find people like this, even just saying... Well, do you remember when I was being harassed, what was it about?

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:31.000
God, it was a while back, and it was one friend of Timmy. Do you remember Timmy, right?

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
No, vaguely, vaguely.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:41.000
But it was one of his buddies, and so I just basically responded back with it, here's your IP address, and here is your physical address. Are you going to stop now?

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Yeah.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:50.000
And it stopped. But the thing is that the moment that you expose who it is to say, I know who you are, and I know how to find you.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Basically cut their balls off.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Exactly.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Well, that's more like accountability. Like, I'm going to make you accountable.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:57.000
That's what I want. I want accountability.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:04.000
You know, even if it's, I know who you are, it will stop more often than not.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:13.000
Once they realize that, yes, you can do something about it, too, you know who they are, it's that whole anonymous having no face to it.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.000
I mean, that's the reason why the KKK freaking wears sheets on their faces.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:26.000
You know, it's the same thing. By being an anonymous, no name, no face person, you can get away in some cases literally with murder.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:37.000
And if you hold them accountable, you remove the masks so that people know who they are, then that removes the safety of being able to do it without, you know, having to deal with consequences.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:48.000
All right. Well, before we get to our FUGL question of the week, I got to roll it back a little bit here to address a comment on something I'd previously said about the whole fact that people are going to be giving up their months for Fallout.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Tigerclaw is pointing out, what about Battlefront? That's coming out in a few short weeks. So say goodbye to your Star Wars fans. They'll be busy playing that game all night.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Well, you know, you can listen to this show and play video games.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Especially if they want their collector's edition, which is $200, they're not going to have any money to purchase the rest of the games coming out in the fourth quarter.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.000
If I can contribute to the show and write fan fiction, then you can listen and play.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.000
All right. Let's get to our FUGL question of the week.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:32.000
Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and we ask a question and we read some of our favorite answers here from you guys, the folks participating with the program.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:39.000
So let's get to this week's question, which this week was about Kinect, the article we talked about.

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
I think Loki brought up in the first half of the show tonight.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Microsoft has cut the price of the Kinect by $50 and reinforced its commitment to the device.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Do you have an Xbox One with Kinect? If yes, do you think it's worth it for the rest of us to spend the money?

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.000
If no, does this recent price drop interest you? What would it take to get you interested if not?

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.000
So kind of a multi-part question, but I really want to know where people's heads was at where if you have one, why?

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.000
If you don't have one, why? And what's going to get you there?

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Tigerclaw starts us off on Facebook saying, I don't have a Kinect and don't have any use for it since my room is too small for one.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:16.000
But I think some people may get one for the voice command features, Skype video chat, and as a mic for in-game voice chat.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:27.000
And I saw a little conversation going on there where it was pointed out that you can do like a little filter, like little thing you put on top of the Kinect to help make a small room bigger in the eyes of the Kinect.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:33.000
But I can also see that in certain spaces it's probably still not going to work. It's probably still not enough.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:41.000
But yeah, certainly if you don't have the adequate room for Kinect it may be more difficult, especially without an extra peripheral.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Brad from Pod Culture over on Facebook says, I got one and outside of the occasional voice command I don't use it. Had it been an option when I got my system I would have got the bundle without.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:02:02.000
Mike C. replies on Facebook and says, I have an Xbox One with a Kinect. I keep it disconnected because voice commands don't work well for me and I don't want Phil Spencer to watch me walking around in my underwear.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:11.000
And lastly, Hitstun says, I don't have an Xbox One and I wouldn't want to use a Kinect as a game controller. I'd like to try one for motion capture for game development.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:18.000
That requires a $50 Windows adapter and a beefy PC, so I still won't get a Kinect until I know it'll do what I need.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:23.000
You know, Hitstun does bring up an important point though that didn't come up in the room when we were talking about this earlier and that was,

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Kinect also has its purposes on PC and some of the greatest advances that Kinect has brought us, especially for science and everything,

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:41.000
and I mean on like the 360, had nothing to do with gaming. Especially the fact that doctors can use them without having to touch anything is really kind of a cool use for that.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:47.000
So that is the fact that you bring up the whole fact of a PC adapter and using it that way to do motion capture for games.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:53.000
That kind of shows another side of Kinect where I go, okay, yeah, that's a really good use for Kinect.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:59.000
So my thing is like, if you want to do the voice commands and stuff like that, why doesn't it work with the headset?

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.000
It's like, why do I need to have a fucking $150 peripheral to do that shit?

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Like it doesn't, I don't think it processes any of that crap.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Give me your money.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:15.000
All right. Redertainment on Google Plus says, I have an Xbox One with Kinect and I use the Kinect nearly every day.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:23.000
The Kinect makes it easy to switch from playing games to watching TV or WWE. I definitely recommend the Kinect to anybody.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Xbox wrestling.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.000
Xbox wrestling. I love it.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Lastly, Act Def says, I don't have a Kinect, but I would like to get one just to get the full Xbox One experience when I get the console.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Granted, I probably won't miss that much if I don't get it, so I'm not that excited over it either.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:49.000
So a very wide variety of answers to our question there over at Facebook and Google Plus. Thank you guys who participated tonight.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.000
All right, let's get back into some gaming news. Loki.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:00.000
All right, so we kind of talked about this last week that Sony wasn't going to be making video games.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Just kidding. They say they still are going to make some video games.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.000
Okay, what? What game are you making? Prove it. I want to see the receipts.

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:22.000
Well, they're saying that, let's see, I think what we said is that we're no longer in the business of AAA development of games for Vita, but there's still first party Vita content being worked on.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:27.000
What the fuck does that mean, though? That doesn't make any sense.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:31.000
That's so vague. Like, what the fuck does that mean?

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Wait, say that again.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:38.000
I think, okay, this is according to Jim Ryan, the Sony Computer Entertainment Europe president.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:46.000
He said, I think what was said is that we are no longer in the business of AAA development of games for the Vita.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Well, that seems pretty straightforward to me, but there's still first party Vita content being worked upon.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:58.000
So you're going to make AA games? I mean, I don't understand what...

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:05.000
If you said, I think what we said is that we're not in the business of AAA development for the Vita, that's okay.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:08.000
I don't think you can get much more clear than that. So you're going to put out other things?

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Two ways to read this comment. There's two answers, I think.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Do you remember last year at E3, not this year, but last year, and I just remember this because I was there.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000
It was the conference that I saw from PlayStation.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:27.000
They started relatively early. They showed this game called Entwined that they were releasing on the store that day.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:35.000
That was a first party game. Sony made that, but it was a very small startup studio that was a lot of students within their company.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:39.000
So I would not call that AAA development, but that's still a first party game, if that makes sense.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
So a game like Entwined would count.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Maybe they're thinking more games like Journey and that type of thing.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Which, you know, honestly, Journey is one of the greatest PS3 games, so I don't care what.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:58.000
AAA, single A, double Ds, killer Cs, whatever it is, I don't care. Just, you know, that game is fantastic.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:02.000
I wonder if, now here's the second way I could interpret that comment.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Does this mean that they're contracting other people to do the first party games for them?

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I think that could be it.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000
That works so well for the Vita and early life cycle list.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Well, I'm just saying, whether it worked or not, have they hired third parties to truly do the first party software?

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:27.000
I think that's an option that I kind of read between the lines and I kind of think that could be where it is.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
So, we'll see.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Anyhow, speaking of studios and the things that they are creating, you know, there's a lot of speculation around what Retro Studios is up to.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Of course, Retro Studios, the company behind the great Metroid Prime series.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:47.000
And their last big release was Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, but that was what, like late 2013?

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
So, what the hell are they working on now?

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Tropical Freeze came out in the beginning of the year. It was like a February release.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Sorry, they finished it in 2013. It went gold and then it came out in the beginning of the year.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000
So, anyhow, apparently the latest rumor is that it could be a new IP.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.000
So, something new. Which, you know, new stuff is exciting, right?

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:13.000
And apparently they pitched this in 2014. This is just, you know, some rumors going on.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:20.000
And what's interesting about this is that the rumor goes on to say, I don't think Retro wants to do Metroid Prime 4.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:24.000
I'd be surprised if Retro pitched that. I think they've had their fill of Metroid.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:30.000
And if it is Metroid, then it would be something different, like maybe a 2D one or something different from Prime.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:33.000
Yeah, that would be awesome. Let's do a 2D Metroid.

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.000
So, interesting.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000
I'm all for original stuff, though. I mean, Splatoon was completely original.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.000
And that's like kind of a must-have Wii U game at this point.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:51.000
I'm all for another sprite-based Zelda, you know, Link to the Past style game for Zelda.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
That would be great, except why does that need to be on the Wii U?

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:59.000
Because it can be huge. Imagine making like the game like really large.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Yeah, we'll see.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Huge map.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Maybe a Metroid game from the top down like that. That would be weird, though. I don't know.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:09.000
There was a Contra game that kind of worked like that, though.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:14.000
But anyway, let's move on. Because that's all rumors, so what else can you say about that?

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:17.000
They'll show it when they're ready to show it. In the meantime, Dark Sakura.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Well, while we were all busy looking at presidential elections and other loudness, I'd say, in the news,

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:34.000
the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act passed Senate 74-21.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Which, before we were really paying attention to a lot of this, and then they just sort of snuck on through.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:52.000
Basically, it's just the whole thing is crappy because they don't understand what information is,

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:59.000
how it affects everybody, the way the Internet works.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:08.000
It actually was, and I'm trying to get the rest of the information on this, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, EFF, issued a statement.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:14.000
I'm just going to read this one as it is because it sums it up perfectly.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:24.000
The passage of CESA reflects the misunderstanding many lawmakers have about technology and security.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000
Computer security engineers were against it. Academics were against it.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Technology companies, including some of Silicon Valley's biggest, like Twitter and Salesforce, were against it.

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:42.000
Civil society organizations were against it. And constituents sent over one million faxes opposing the senators.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:50.000
So, it's passed Senate. It has a different version passed the House.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:56.000
And so, they're now going to need to have a big debate between the two to get a final version running.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:06.000
But, right now, it's just really, really shady, I'd say, all this going on.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.000
And I will be posting a link in the chat room to the list of people who voted for and against,

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:20.000
so that you can let certain people who are in charge of making laws in your state know that they're assholes.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Real quick, because a lot of people are comparing this to the whole SOPA, PIPA thing that happened a couple of years ago.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:35.000
How is this, like, you know, because it would blow my mind that they essentially passed the same thing when they retreated last time.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:39.000
So, how are they saying this is different? Like, how are they justifying it?

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Well, what they said in here that they had, they actually changed a lot of the wording in it.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:54.000
Let me see. There was a little bit more about it. I'm trying to see if I can find where it said that.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:59.000
So, they were supposed to have tightened the definition of cybersecurity threats.

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:07.000
And that they needed to be aware that, and this is a quote, made it reasonably likely to cause damage, as opposed to may cause damage.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:17.000
It's all verbiage, is all it is. So, I'd have to make sure that we have a little bit more information, I think, posted publicly on it.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:25.000
But, basically, any other amendments that were introduced to protect citizen privacy were shut down by the Senate.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:31.000
So, they don't care what our privacy is. They just want to know what we're doing.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Scary times in the future. Alright, but I'm sure, you know.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
That's okay. Big Brother will always be watching.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:42.000
But I'll be watching Big Brother, because that's a trashy great show.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Alright, moving on. Loki.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Thank you for ruining my 1984 reference.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:51.000
No, I enhanced it. Loki.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000
Sorry, I had a hamburger in my hands.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:12:06.000
So, this is kind of neat. Apparently, they're going to be allowing DRM circumvention for abandoned video games.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:15.000
And the Library of Congress has issued exemptions to section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:25.000
That makes it slightly easier to legally circumvent different aspects of DRM for lawful fair use, such as preservation of old video games.

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:37.000
So, the exemption basically allows them to remove server authentication of the game's original server if it's shut down.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
So, that's pretty cool.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:46.000
So, Mario Kart Wii no longer works online, right? Because all the Nintendo Wii games got shut down.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Legally, I can, quote-unquote, hack my Wii to connect that game to a private server to continue to play that game.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:03.000
No, it's online authentication. Like, say, for example, imagine if Steam went away and the game requires Steam to work, you know, you can circumvent it to allow the game to work without it.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Or, if it's a multiplayer-only game, like a mag or something like that, you could hack that to have your own private servers.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Got it. Okay, but in that case, you're talking about there with the whole online servers and Steam specifically,

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Steam has made it well known that should they ever close, which seems so unlikely at this point,

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:28.000
but should they ever close, they have a button they can push that will get rid of DRM completely from all the games that you buy.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:33.000
So, yeah, a big red button that says, do not push in case of bankruptcy.

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Alright. Well, that's interesting. I'm curious to see what's going to come out of that there and what, you know,

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:48.000
especially some of the more questionable stuff that kind of walks the line, see what kind of comes with that.

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Anyhow, speaking of old games and legal, it's completely legal, you can download every Tribe's game for free.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:06.000
That's right, Hi-Rez Studios in the 21st anniversary celebration of the game is actually going to be releasing every game from the Tribe series,

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:11.000
and it's out now. If you go to tribesuniverse.com, you can download all the old games.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:17.000
That includes the most recent game, Tribes Ascend, because that was a free-to-play game anyway.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:22.000
So, there you go. Head on over before they decide to, you know, make those games pay again.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.000
I know literally one person that would be excited about this.

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
One person. Who is the person?

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Oh, my coworker who is like huge in the Tribes.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Well, guess what, Loki's coworker? Today is your special day.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Congrats. You're a winner.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Alright. Hey, I'll check it out. I mean, I know the most new game before, you know, the free-to-play one.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.000
I think it was like from 2007, but I'll still check it out. Why not?

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag. Every week you guys e-mail us.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com. We pick some of our favorite e-mails.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000
And Dark Soccer reads them live on air for our enjoyment.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:00.000
I don't play favorites, Rob.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:03.000
Again, that's participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Yeah.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:13.000
Alright, first e-mail. Quick question. Have any of you tried the Minecraft minigame servers such as Miniplex, Hypixel, or the like?

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Is it at all likely similar servers would be active for console players, or are Sony and Microsoft more locked down than that?

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:31.000
Also, I saw the latest RPG Maker MV, I guess it has to do with the Roman numerals anyway, is available for Windows and Mac.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Does this mean that we'll be seeing more RPG Maker games on Mac now?

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Sorry, this is all too speculative. Robert M.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.000
P.S., like Jim Sally, my primary support device is an iPod Touch 5G.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:48.000
There were a lot of questions in there. RPG Maker on Mac.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:58.000
I think there's a general trend that more stuff that does big business on Steam, which I think RPG Maker is one of them, should be releasing PC, Mac, Linux as much as possible.

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:04.000
So, I actually think, yeah, you probably will see more RPG Maker on Mac.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:08.000
And, you know, hey, yay, more games for more people. That's a good thing.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:18.000
Yeah, given that just, you know, practically every day I look at the App Store, and there are already big titles that are there.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:24.000
I mean, like, if I were to open it up right now, which I just did, waiting for it to load.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Right on the top I have Doom 3. I have Reassembly. There's actually, it's got its whole game section, so.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Transistor. This War of Mine. I got Grim Fandango. All kinds of stuff.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:50.000
Guitar Hero, funny enough, has a release like that, even though you don't necessarily have the controller. It's kind of interesting.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Yeah, you're getting a lot of major titles more often. As far as the Minecraft minigame thing, I don't know.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Yeah, I'm not too sure about that. I have not played on those servers that you mentioned.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:08.000
I prefer to keep it kind of either a solo game or, like, when we had the VoG server where it was a really controlled environment.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:14.000
Like, I thought that was kind of cool, too. As far as the console versus PC, and will the Mega servers come to console?

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Probably not, because that's not usually in the vision of console. And especially now that Microsoft owns Minecraft,

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:25.000
I think you're going to see that they want to take the PC and the Xbox One versions in slightly different directions,

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:32.000
so that you'll have a reason to buy both. Isn't that what it's really all about? That's my thoughts, anyway.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Well, they already have, because the PC version, Windows 10, is based off of the mobile version of Minecraft.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Oh, interesting. I didn't even realize that.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:43.000
But it runs so well.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Yeah, it does run really well. Anyhow, just a quick comment from chat, because I want to make sure over at live.vognetwork.com we get all our voices heard.

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Dungeon Buster talking about tribes, saying tribes vengeance was pretty fun. At least the SP campaign was.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:00.000
The MP not so much from what I heard from more die-hard tribes fans.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:06.000
So, anyway, just a comment there from chat. No comments on that particular email, though, so we can go on to our next email.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I'd like to thank Tom for the pot roast recipe. Yeah, someone sent us a pot roast recipe, but he said don't read it on air.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
You'll need one cup of meat.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
It looks pretty freaking good.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Yeah.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
We'll have to try making it on a later show.

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Dang it, why do you people send me fucking novels? I mean, I love you. Bye.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Hello all, just a few random thoughts on last week's episode.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:38.000
To Loki and anyone who might be thinking about playing a telltale game, such as Minecraft's story mode game of Thrones and Walking Dead, yes, that is how they play.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Completing them is rather easy. Each episode lasts two hours, about two hours, and the majority of the interactivity consists of dialogue choices.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:51.000
I would say that they are more like interactive movies than traditional video games.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:19:00.000
That being said, we recently completed the first season of Walking Dead, and it is one of the more memorable, moving, emotional gaming experiences I have had this year.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:07.000
It kind of makes me think I have not, in fact, aged out of new games as I previously thought.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:13.000
I won't spoil anything, but I'll just say pressing one button has never been so difficult as it is at the end of episode five.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:21.000
The entire first season was recently given away for free on both 360 and Xbox One as part of Games with Gold,

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:27.000
but it's more than worth the asking price as long as you're not entirely turned off by the concept of playing an interactive movie.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Play it with someone you love with the lights off. If you can handle it, you won't regret it.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:40.000
On the subject of Square Enix, possibly bringing back old franchises, I have just two things to say. Einhänder is the first.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.000
But, I love, we just had Shane agree.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Yes, please.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Okay, wait, but to be fair, I just, devil's advocate here, you get Dissida, which is a fighting game.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.000
No, Einhänder's not the fighting game.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:56.000
No, it's Einhänder.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Einhänder's the shooter.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:01.000
Oh, God, I always, never mind, never mind, I always get that and the, never mind, I get the name.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.000
That is such a good game. I love that game so much.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Er, guys.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Yeah, that game's garbage. Einhänder's really good.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.000
I was thinking of similar names.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
No, they're not.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
You know what? I have them both.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I haven't played them since I was like 20.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:18.000
The RPG mode in Er, guys, was pretty fun.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Anyway, but that's really unlikely, so the second is Bushido Blade.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:28.000
So much could be done with that in the modern era. Come on, ScreenX, make it happen.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:34.000
And if a true sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics is ever announced, nothing will be able to contain my glee.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Lastly, I will just mention that I am almost ready to launch my new website and release multitasking.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:47.000
I always say that finishing is the hardest part and this time has been no different.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Thanks, as always, to both you guys and the listeners for all of the support.

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
Please look forward to it, smileface.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:00.000
And to Loki, you haven't mentioned it lately, but I have not forgotten about time to car.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Yeah, it's been really hard to get back in the...

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:06.000
It's just kind of... I've been busy with the costume.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
But Halloween's over now.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Yeah, exactly. I need to get back onto it.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:15.000
The costume did look pretty kick-ass, I gotta say.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Yeah, it was pretty awesome. I was up for 36 hours on Thursday. I did not sleep.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.000
I know the wife will never let you go to Dragon Con, but you would get so many pictures of that costume.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
You would have had a great time.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:29.000
For those who didn't know, or didn't see it, I was Lego Deadpool.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:33.000
Hopefully you're still determined to complete and release it, and we'll all see it soon.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.000
I'm waiting for you. Keep on moving, Aaron YYR.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
I'm looking forward to multitasking by YYR.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:46.000
I already told him I feel like this game deserves a much bigger fanfare release.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:51.000
We'll do what we can to get the word out there.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Alright, last email.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Yay.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.000
And who is this from? Oh, Ragenator.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:00.000
Hi, OLR. It's your friendly neighborhood Ragenator.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
I have some good and bad news for everyone.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:07.000
As everyone may have heard by now, the laptop that I've had since 2012 died at the beginning of October,

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
hence why I've been away from VoG.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:16.000
I've temporarily borrowed a real POS 10 to 12 year old laptop to temporarily hold me over until I can go out and replace my computer,

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.000
but I can't do much of anything with it.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Now for the relatively good news, I have rearranged my budget significantly so I can go get a new computer somewhat quickly.

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:31.000
This does not mean that I'm temporarily shutting off my Time Warner services until May 1st, 2016,

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:36.000
and trying to live off of $75 a month until May 2016.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:37.000
Okay.

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Yeah, it'll be tough as balls to do, but with a little luck and perseverance, I will have enough money to replace my computer by then,

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:48.000
and hence be back to my usual norm of gaming, participating in VoG's live shows, telling bad jokes, etc.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Unfortunately, I'll miss the finale of Understation Live, but it can't be helped.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:54.000
We'll record it for you.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Hopefully we get a podcast of it. Everybody poke Travis to make sure he doesn't get too caught up in Fallout 4. He'll post that.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Anywho, ultimately the point of my email is this.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.000
No, I didn't fall off the face of the earth and nothing's physically wrong with me.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:14.000
I figure that maybe some people might have been worried since it's highly unusual for me to be away from VoG,

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:18.000
and at one point I did disclose that I do suffer from depression. I'm sorry.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:21.000
I actually hear from him all the time on Steam and haven't lately.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:25.000
I am safe, albeit at best moody now.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Sadly, sometimes shit just happens. I will make every effort to be back ASAP.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:33.000
In the meantime, my thoughts will be with the VoG community as a whole,

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:38.000
and I will look forward to participating with OLR, AJS, and Black Wolf Show once again.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Feel free to designate someone to tell bad jokes on my behalf during my absence.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
I always read the P.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:51.000
Anyway, I hope all is well with everyone, and I'll see you all virtually fairly soon. Take care.

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
...or some... I don't know why. I don't know why.

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Learn macrame.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.000
I think because I've been asked to join a bowling league, and it's on Sunday nights, and so I can't do it,

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:29.000
so that's probably why that came to mind. But, you know, people's lives changed or whatever.

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:34.000
But, glad to hear you okay. Sorry to hear about the computer, but life sucks, right? Things happen.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Make the best of it. When life hands you lemons, make lemonade.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
You demand to see life's manager.

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
That's right. You demand to see life's manager.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
I don't need your fucking lemons.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Or you serve that lemon with a nice shot of vodka.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.000
That's tequila.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
That's right. No, no, tequila. Gross.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:58.000
I say the same about vodka, though. For the most part.

02:24:58.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Tangent time.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
I need, like, a bumper noise of a train coming in.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
Choo-choo! It's a tangent train!

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
I'll just go rip a Jim Sally sound clip.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:09.000
Chugga-chugga.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Tangent train.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
I made lemonhead vodka.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Yeah? How was it?

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Fucking amazing.

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:16.000
Yeah?

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
That sounds fantastic, actually.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
It turned out really well, but we had to filter it.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.000
But we found out that it's actually amazingly delicious in orange soda.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:28.000
So when life gives you lemonheads, infuse it in vodka.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
Mr. Candy Corn Vodka.

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:36.000
I gotta say, I had some of that pumpkin spice candy corn vodka that you made.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:39.000
And, uh, you know, we had that at the show a little bit.

02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Super syrupy, but great. Delicious.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:46.000
Because it's basically drinking a candy bar that's gonna get you smashed.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:49.000
Those candy corns weren't that bad, actually.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:50.000
Yeah, they were good.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
I wonder how it would be poured over ice cream.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:53.000
Mmm.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Oh my.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000
I wish I hadn't eaten my entire blizzard already, but it was so good.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
So, alright.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:03.000
Why don't they have alcoholic sundaes?

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.000
I'm sure they do. They just, you know, you have to carry a liquor license when you wanna do that stuff.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:08.000
And things get complicated.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:11.000
There's lots of, like, bars and, like, restaurants.

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Children, ice cream.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Yeah.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:19.000
Also, I don't think dairy and vodka mix too well. Very few situations.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
You can get, like, yours.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000
You know.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Yeah, I guess that could work.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
I have pumpkin spice kalua at home.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Yummy!

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:29.000
Cause I'm totally being...

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:32.000
That's, like, my one nod to basic bitchiness.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:35.000
Is pumpkin spice kalua.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
Alright.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
Tangent train's pulling out of the station.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
The mailbag segment is done.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:44.000
But if you wanna send us emails, participate at orangelauntrader.com is the place to do it.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Well, now that the mailbag is closed, it's time to unleash our anger upon the world in another tangency segment we do on the show every week called the FUs of the Week.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:57.000
It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with gaming, but we've maintained this tradition for 620 weeks.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
And we're sure as fuck not stopping now.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:12.000
Here is punishment.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
This is fucked up.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Fuck you to there not being any more of my blizzard.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:21.000
And that I had to sit looking at my blizzard while I read through all those damn emails.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:24.000
And everyone's like, I've got my blizzard.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Around me like, oh, fuck you, I wanna eat my blizzard.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Sorry about it.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:29.000
Uh-uh, you're not.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Alright, you're right, I'm not.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Also, um...

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Just fuck you to one of my pieces of medication I'm on for making me feel really fucking weird until I adjust to it.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.000
I feel really freaking weird.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Like, not in a happy, oh, I'm weird in a quirky way in the, hi, I'm your brain and I'm going to fuck with you for like three weeks until you get used to this shit.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
That's all it is.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:03.000
So, that's all.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:06.000
Alright, um...

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
I don't really have a lot of FUs.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:11.000
FU to the fact I have to get up early tomorrow.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.000
That's all.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
I like my sleep, I don't like getting up early.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Loki.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:21.000
Um, FU to myself for staying up for 36 hours on Thursday for working on the damn costume.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Oh my god.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000
And, uh, my face has felt like on fire since then.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.000
I hope, I think it's from the spray paint.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Because my laptop has a nice coat of spray paint on it too, like a dusting of it, as well as everything else, as well as my lungs did.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:39.000
So maybe I have like a slight chemical burn in my face.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:40.000
I'm not really sure yet.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:44.000
But all my fingers and stuff are really like dry and everything as well.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:49.000
You might need to see a doctor and just have some lab work done just to make sure you didn't have to...

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Nah, I'm fine. I'm sure.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Alright.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
It's poor ventilation, yeah.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
Fair enough. Who's got the mic over there?

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
Mike, do you have any FUs of the week?

02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Oh, an FU to whoever put together my basketball roster that I coach.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
I've got the smallest team in the league.

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:09.000
I've got 5th and 6th graders going against mostly 7th graders.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.000
That doesn't really work out.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:16.000
You know what though, in the movies, that scrawny misfit team is the one that wins the championship at the end.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Not when your team is like 4 and a half feet tall and everybody else is like at least 5'6".

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Oh, I see. You've got the pre-growth spurt kids.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
Yeah, it's horrible.

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:29.000
Cause you can't say anything to a mother when you've tried.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:35.000
And then you're trying to coach the kids as they're getting their growth spurts and I'm sure that is just a hoot and a holler.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:41.000
A lot easier than trying to teach someone small to get bigger, I guess.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:44.000
Somehow, that doesn't work like that.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
Grow, damn you!

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Dan, how about you? Your FU of the week.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:57.000
I'd say fuck you to this Blizzard that I am not going to be able to finish because it is just too rich for my taste.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
Jamie will finish it for you. If she doesn't, I will.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
No, is it the pumpkin?

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:05.000
No, it's the caramel truffle and I thought the truffles are just too much.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
I'm like ugh.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:10.000
I didn't like the pumpkin one very much.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:14.000
And I don't like caramel or else I actually probably would take you up on that.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
I gotta be honest, I've never had a Blizzard.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:19.000
I thought it was more of like a milkshake thing that you drink.

02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:22.000
It's just ice cream that they blended shit in.

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
It's all it is.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
It's like a McFlurry, except it came before.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:30.000
And they have their little picture where you can turn it upside down and it doesn't come out. I don't think that would actually work.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:33.000
Not when they've been sitting in the car for fifteen minutes on their way over here.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:40.000
But I did try every single one holding it upside down as we drove back and every single one of them was sticky enough to not fall apart.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Alright, fair enough.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
Last but certainly not least, Shane.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:51.000
F you to Nintendo and the way they handle Splatoon and how they try to make this game not fun.

02:30:51.000 --> 02:31:01.000
Because, like, they penalize and Splatfest the more popular team and they upped the percent or the multiplier for wins.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:05.000
So like, this has just been in my gaming week but I forgot but I'm mad about this.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:08.000
So I played about ten times this weekend for Splatfest.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
I was on Ninjas. We lost.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:21.000
We had a seventy percent or like almost seventy something percent popularity versus the twenty something percent pirates.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:27.000
But because of the way they do their online matching, out of those ten games I only fought pirates twice.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
All the other times I fought Ninjas.

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:35.000
And when you're one team versus your same team, it doesn't count towards the results at all. It's a wash.

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:41.000
So all my time playing Splatfest, I don't think I'm a bad player. I feel like I'm pretty decent at the game.

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:44.000
I wasn't really contributing to my team trying to win.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:51.000
So we got killed because it was sixty percent wins for pirates and forty percent for us.

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:56.000
But there was a six times multiplier on that. You can't overcome that. It's stupid.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:00.000
And Nintendo, you just made Splatoon my number three game of the year because of that.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.000
Oh no.

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Yeah, it dropped from number two.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Uh oh, downgrade.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Yup. You better watch it because it might drop to four if you keep this up.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
You're on notice.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Also, we got Pirates versus Ninja for our Halloween event.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Europe, this next weekend, gets Zombies versus Ghosts even though Halloween's over.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:22.000
And Japan for their Halloween was Money versus Love.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:25.000
So I don't understand.

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:28.000
Wow, that's Money versus Love.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Love won overall, but Money was more popular.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:39.000
But every single Splatfest, every single one of them, the least popular team has won.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
Yeah, and that's not how it should be.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:45.000
I mean, they should change the multipliers.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Because I think in the beginning it was times two for popularity and times four for wins.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:55.000
But now it's times nothing for popularity and times six for wins.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
And it doesn't seem right.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Yeah, but it was kind of screwed up when a team won by one percent just because they were more popular.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:05.000
It should be wins. Period. Wins. Period. That's it.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:08.000
But the online matchmaking maybe needs to be a little different.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Yeah. I would rather wait.

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:13.000
ActDeft is pointing out Splatoon is still fun and it's fair.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
It's not fair.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:16.000
He was also Team Pirates.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Yeah, it's not fair at all.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:21.000
That sounds like somebody that's always on the winning side is something they would say.

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Do you know what team I played on?

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000
Ninjas.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
No, the team I forgot to play on was Splatoon.

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Oh yeah, that's right. You did.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:31.000
I guess I was playing the game wrong because I was Team Pirates so I was stealing stuff off the internet.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:36.000
But, I mean, I guess I just don't get how this works.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:41.000
Alright. And ActDeft is pointing out he's lost three SplatFests in a row.

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.000
It's still not fair.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.000
You need to let him have his moment.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:47.000
It's still not fair. Yeah, he can have his moment but to claim it's fair is wrong.

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Alright, moving on.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:52.000
We just got a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to get to your calls.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:57.000
1877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:58.000
But first, Loki.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Yes, so let's talk about another Kickstarter but this one is actually pretty interesting.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:07.000
Don Bluth. He's trying to Kickstarter a Dragons Lair animated film.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
I'm down with that.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:18.000
He needs $550,000 to create a teaser that he can shop to financers to create a full film.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:22.000
And so far, let's see what he's raised here.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Health.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:31.000
He's raised $114,000 and he's got 24 days to go so I'm pretty sure he's going to make it.

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.000
And then let's see if he's got stretch goals here.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:39.000
You can win all sorts of animation stuff.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:42.000
But we can't forget the biggest contribution Don Bluth ever made.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
If you're going to say Xanadu, so help me God.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Who is he? I've never heard of this person.

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
The animated scene in Xanadu.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.000
I've never heard of this person.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:50.000
Did an American Tail?

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:51.000
I know Fievel.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:52.000
Anastasia.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Anastasia.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:57.000
I was going to say, is it this busty maquette that I'm looking at?

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
Because that's a pretty big contribution.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Until he goes west. I don't know if Fievel goes west.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Don Bluth is pretty rad. I wish him success in this.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:09.000
There's a part of me though that kind of thinks the ship has sailed on Dragons Lair.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:13.000
It's like, how many times have we re-released Dragons Lair?

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:19.000
It's been out on, with the arcade version came out on, it was on the DVD to play thing.

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:23.000
And it was on Xbox. They've just released it a million times.

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:26.000
I kind of think the time to make a movie has kind of passed.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:27.000
Really?

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:33.000
But at the same time, and I'm going to argue with myself, at the same time, I'm all for introducing it to a new generation.

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:39.000
I was just going to say, because they've already tried to shove shit down a new generation's throats that don't probably give a shit about it.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:42.000
Peanuts the movie. Smurfs the movie.

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
The Jem and the Holograms.

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:45.000
Jem and the Holograms.

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
The fucking Alvin and the Chipmunks.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:54.000
I mean, no one gave a shit about all those properties. I mean, yeah, it's like, ooh, I love those as kids, but oh God, what have you done to them now?

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:57.000
But what's happened in a lot of those cases that somebody new got the rights.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Like the Jem and the Holograms movie, that wasn't, that was not a Jem script.

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:08.000
That was some other little teeny feel good movie, family film that they fucking just squished, yeah, Jem into.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:11.000
And then like all of our childhoods are weeping.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:18.000
I really would love to see like a franchise like that, just from a movie that's based completely nothing on the franchise at all.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Like have like a fucking just like Dolph Lundgren, you know, action film, Jem and the Holograms.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
You know, it just makes no fucking sense.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
But it would be entertaining because of that.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:36.000
So at least, at least I will say this, Don Bluth is still involved and that means it'll be better for the wear.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Because that means it'll still be his vision, so that's good.

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:43.000
I just can't imagine that they can't do like, I mean, is he trying to do like hand drawn animation?

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:47.000
I mean, why can't they do just computer animation? That's just like fucking cheap.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
Well, some people like the hand drawn stuff.

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.000
I understand that, but like, I don't know. I think people could do it.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:57.000
Maybe they'll have a blend. We'll see. Alright.

02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:01.000
Like I thought I wouldn't like the Disney animated stuff that was, you know, Disney not Pixar.

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.000
But I mean, it looks like the same style.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Yeah, Tangled was fucking great.

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Tangled was okay. Frozen was alright. I mean, I don't know.

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:12.000
And Dungeon Buster pointing out it's hand drawn animation he's doing.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
But you know, there's a place for the hand drawn animation too.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:18.000
That's cool, I guess. I hope he makes it. I just, I don't know.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:19.000
I think he will. We'll see.

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Alright, well lastly, speaking of blasts from the past, who remembers the Dizzy series?

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Anybody ever played the Dizzy games?

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Yeah, well, god, they go all the way back to the ZX Spectrum.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
There were some Dizzy games on Commodore 64.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:38.000
And the last Dizzy game actually came out in 1992.

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Well apparently, the creators, the Oliver Twins, they were going through some old stuff.

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:50.000
And they found the design documents and files to an unreleased NES title called Wonderland Dizzy.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Well, they actually went through and worked on it.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:57.000
And now this ROM is running in a browser emulator.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:04.000
So that's right, all these years after 1992 when Wonderland Dizzy was originally conceived,

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.000
it is now out for free for you to play and catch up on.

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:14.000
So you can check that out at wonderlanddizzy.com and you can play that.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.000
That's pretty rad that an old treasure like that has been rediscovered.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:24.000
Especially for a series like Dizzy that was, those games, there was quite a few of those games on the NES.

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
And I remember those from the early 80's computing days.

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:29.000
So that's pretty rad that there's a new game in that series.

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:33.000
So always nice to see those little gems unearthed.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:38.000
Well, that is going to do it for our mainline news tonight.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:41.000
So we're going to open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR.

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:47.000
Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give us a call and talk about anything we've talked about tonight.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Or maybe we missed something.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Maybe you want to ask our guests a question.

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
I don't know, but you never know.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:57.000
Mike, did you just roll your eyes? I said ask the guests a question.

02:38:57.000 --> 02:39:00.000
You did this to me at Rocky the other night already.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
We won't talk about that.

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
Our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
And guess what? It's already lighting up.

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
So let's get to it with this first call.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000
Hey everybody, it's Rama.

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
Hey Rama, how you doing?

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
I'm pretty good. How about you?

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:20.000
I'm super. Thanks for asking. What's on your mind?

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
I knew you was going to do that.

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:24.000
What's up?

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Not much. I want to say a couple of quick things.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:32.000
First off, I remember playing The Living Daylights out of the Fantastic Adventures of Disney for NES. Loved it.

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:36.000
Those games were kind of like, I think they were much bigger overseas, like in Europe.

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:41.000
I think that was a really big series in Europe than it was here, but certainly it had its following over here.

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:47.000
Yeah, but it didn't help the fact that they came up through, I think, Codemasters and Comerica.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:53.000
And they were unlicensed, so they came in special gold-type style cartridges.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:58.000
That's right. I remember that. They were kind of the Renegade games, some of them.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Along with Tengen games, like, was Gauntlet in one of those cartridges? No, I think Gauntlet was on a regular cart.

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:09.000
Klax, and then Tetris, of course, and so on.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:18.000
Yeah, I mean Gauntlet did come out as an original cartridge, then it came in the alternate cartridge format, you know?

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:20.000
Totally.

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Yes.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:22.000
So what else is on your mind?

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Well, I want to talk about something really cool, really exciting, something that I've been helping with for the last couple of weeks.

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
May I take the floor?

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
The floor is yours, my friend.

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Thank you, thank you. Well, I've been kind of cryptic on my Facebook, personal Facebook, about a project I'm helping with at my job.

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:49.000
And for those who don't know, I work at Microsoft. I'm in their flagship retail store.

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:59.000
And one day, one of the community leaders was asking in the break room if anybody knew any bloggers, cosplayers, gamers.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:03.000
And I raised my hand and I'm like, I know people.

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
All of the above.

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:06.000
Yeah.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:12.000
So, she clues me in on Extra Life, and we all know what Extra Life is.

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Sure, of course, the gaming marathon. It's funny because we started the show talking about Twitch, but broadcasting has really helped the Extra Life marathon gain a lot of visibility.

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:25.000
And a lot of people participate in that from all over the world.

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:33.000
Definitely. And it seems that Saturday, November 7th is Extra Life game day 2015.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.000
And I believe it's going to be a 24 hour stream.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:50.000
And what's happening is from 1 to 7pm at Microsoft's flagship store in New York City, I will be helping with Extra Life and we'll be doing our part in fundraising for Children's Miracle Network.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.000
Hey, that's awesome.

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:52.000
Yeah.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:59.000
Now, I wish I could fly out there and be there, but realistically that can't happen because of money and all that.

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:06.000
But can I see it online? Because I know a big thing about Extra Life is streaming. Is that a possibility or not this time?

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:11.000
Yes. We will be streaming through Twitch.tv on Extra Life's channel.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:12.000
Nice.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:23.000
We'll start at 1 and at our location we'll have some DJs and we'll have some DC cosplayers and we'll be doing some gaming tournaments and it's going to be pretty fun.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:28.000
Well, I get to see you on the stream. Can I go in the chat room and make fun of you when I see you on stream?

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:33.000
Sure, sure, sure. But if you do that, I might have to send a signal to lock down your Xbox One.

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Alright. You're going to push the button to brick my console?

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
No, I'll just lock it down. I just won't brick it.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:45.000
Can you push the button to make Rock Band 4 work? No, I'm just kidding. Low blow, I'm kidding.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:48.000
I'll get a 404 redirect to another company.

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:56.000
Alright, that's fair, that's fair. Alright. No, I think that's great. And yeah, I really wish we could participate in that a little more.

02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:01.000
But maybe next year, you never know, never say never. I am way overdue for a trip to New York City.

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:05.000
It's been like 8 years since I've been out there. I really need to get out there.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:06.000
You definitely got to come out.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:12.000
Alright. Well, I will be, for what it's worth, I will be in DC for MAGFest. That is happening, for sure.

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:16.000
AKA VOGCON WINTER 2016.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Kinda. Kinda. It actually, and isn't, yeah, February would be 6 months away from then Atlanta and Dragon Con.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:30.000
So yeah, I guess that works. So yeah, you got your Winter VOG and your Fall VOG.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:35.000
We're crashing your cons because, you know, we're too broke to throw our own.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:36.000
Woohoo!

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:41.000
Alright, well best of luck with Extra Life. That is, wait, November 7th would be next Saturday, right?

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:49.000
This coming Saturday, it'll be on Twitch.tv slash Extra Life NYC. Tickets are still available through Eventbrite.com.

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:55.000
Just look up Extra Life Game Day 2015 and you'll find all the information there. And kids under 10, get in for free.

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:59.000
Alright. We want selfies with Rama if you make it out there. Send them to our Twitter at OLR.

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:03.000
Yeah, I'll probably be running around wearing my volunteer shirt.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:07.000
Nice. Alright. Well Rama, thanks so much and best of luck to you guys. Hope you raise a lot of money.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:13.000
We will. And you know what, thank you. Thank you for allowing me to come on and just spread the word at us.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.000
Because I've been so excited to be a part of this and help promote something this awesome.

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:24.000
You're welcome. Like, half the things we let get promoted on this show have nothing to do with such a great charity.

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:27.000
So this is even like double awesome. It's a win-win for everybody.

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:28.000
Woohoo!

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:31.000
Alright. Best of luck. Let us know how it goes.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:32.000
Hey, thank you. I will.

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Alright. Take care. Bye.

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:34.000
Bye.

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Alright. Very cool. Extra Life. I'm sure a lot of folks are going to be doing streams to support that in the coming weeks.

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.000
I wish, you know, unfortunately I take a lot of energy and put it into this show that we do every Sunday.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:52.000
So I don't usually participate with my own stream in Extra Life. Not that, you know, never say never.

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:59.000
But I think I'm just going to support other people, I think, for this one. And I think that's how I'm going to prefer to do it.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Alright. We got another call coming in though. Let's get to it. Hi. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
Hey. This is Agdef.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:06.000
Hey, Agdef. How you doing?

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:12.000
Pretty good. Pretty good. You said we could ask questions to your guests.

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
Of course you can ask questions to the guests. What's up?

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:17.000
Why do you hate football? Soccer?

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:23.000
What? Why do you hate football? Because the rest of the world calls it football. You call it soccer.

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:31.000
I don't hate football that much. It's just not on my preferred list, I should say.

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:37.000
It just doesn't grab my attention as much as basketball.

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:46.000
It's like this, Agdef. Some people prefer shooter games. Some people prefer RPGs. Some people prefer platformers.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
Some people prefer to date pigeons.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:52.000
It does. It doesn't in Dark Soccer Raises Your Hand.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:46:01.000
But that doesn't mean you hate all video games. It's just, you know, dating pigeons is just not the game I'm choosing to play right now.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:06.000
Yeah, definitely. And I understand now. He likes basketball.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:12.000
I like seeing people score. That's kind of what it is.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Did you hear what he said? I like seeing people score. That's why he watches basketball.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Me too. Me too.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:28.000
Me too. It has nothing to do with sports. But there are balls involved.

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Definitely.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:35.000
I have a healthy respect for it. It's just not for me.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Alright, fair enough. We'll agree to disagree. What else? What else is on your mind tonight, Agdef?

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Well, I wanted to talk about something about localization and it was done in the new Zelda game, Triforce Heroes.

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:54.000
Oh, yeah. Have you been playing Triforce Heroes?

02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:00.000
No, I haven't actually. I haven't gotten the game. I really want to try it because it looks fun, though.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:05.000
I don't think it would be a great single player. It's more like a multiplayer game.

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:17.000
But aside from that, some people were complaining about the addition of memes in the game's text or in the dialogues.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Oh, yeah. Don't they reference, like, Doge?

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:33.000
Yeah, I was seeing an image with the Dodge meme with such something. I can't remember exactly what it said.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:40.000
I think it's funny when that shit turns up in games. Why is Zelda so sacred?

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:51.000
And not necessarily because it's Zelda. Because Nintendo has done this since the DS era.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:48:00.000
If I remember correctly, I think one of the Mario and Luigi games, the RPGs, had memes on it.

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:11.000
And even then, people praised Nintendo for doing that. And we have seen a lot of memes in Nintendo games throughout the years.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Just watch a Splatoon. It's filled with puns and all that. And even Animal Crossing, too.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:26.000
And people haven't complained about them, but they did it to Zelda.

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:35.000
And oh my god, Nintendo's treehouse are a bunch of idiots, etc.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:45.000
And it's about localization. Here's Nintendo Treehouse trying to do something fun.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:48.000
So people in general can enjoy it.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:53.000
Earlier in the show, Dan was talking about his gaming week, and he mentioned he was playing Guacamelee.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:59.000
And I remember one thing that really struck me about that game was that it has all these meme references in it.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:05.000
There's all these references. There's Grumpy Cat, there's Mario Brothers.

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:13.000
And I thought it was funny. It would be cause for me to explore more areas to try and find all the funny jokes.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:14.000
What game?

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:15.000
Guacamelee.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Yeah, that game is filled with a lot of references. And it's a really great game, and it's really fun.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:28.000
And all the visuals, and especially what they did with all the references, it's fantastic.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:35.000
But again, they did this with Zelda, and I don't know if it's filled with things like that.

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:39.000
I have only seen that one image, so I don't know.

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
And people need to lighten up a little bit.

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:47.000
It's like, oh my god, it's filled with idiotic memes or something like that.

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
People need to lighten up a little bit.

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:52.000
You know what else is interesting is that some of these other games you talk about,

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:56.000
and you mentioned going way, way back to other, way older games.

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Well, we didn't have Twitter then.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:05.000
So that's how sometimes some of these complainers you didn't really see before, and now you can see it.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:11.000
And I'm all for everybody getting their voice, but there are some voices I'm going to look at and go,

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:15.000
okay, well, you said what you have to say, but I really think you just need to get over it.

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:23.000
And my point is that people need to learn that when a company or anyone translates a game,

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:28.000
it's not only the translation. You don't have to just translate the words.

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:35.000
You have to know who's going to play the game, who's going to be watching it,

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:39.000
and try to capture, because it's not only, oh, it's going to be players.

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
You have to sell the game.

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:48.000
You have to know how it's going to capture the audience.

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:57.000
So I know this because I have a bachelor's degree in translation, so I'm speaking of experience and all that.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:08.000
And I know it's not necessarily the greatest thing or the best thing, actually, but it's not really a bad thing either.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:15.000
So I know that people complaining, yeah, it's probably not the best thing, again.

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:24.000
But you have to understand the localization of some things, like in this case, this game.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:28.000
Let me get a quick comment out from our chat room over at live.voguenetwork.com.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:32.000
As 2100matt says, to play Devil's Advocate, why does everything got to be a meme?

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:35.000
Maybe people just feel we're a little inundated by memes.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Well, but to be fair, I mean, it's not like, and he does say, to be clear, I understand both sides.

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:45.000
But I mean, it's not like Zelda, Triforce Heroes is, you know, meme the game.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:50.000
I think they tried that and it was horrible. It was some third-party game on Wii U.

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:55.000
It's like, okay, it's a little joke or one little costume that's cute.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:52:03.000
They took fucking selfies in the remake of Wind Waker. I mean, come on, who cares?

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:07.000
But you can do some really cute stuff with that, you know?

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:11.000
Hey, taking a selfie with Ganondorf, it's the awesomest thing ever.

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Yeah, and selfies in WoW. Mike mentions you can do selfies in WoW.

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:18.000
That was a big thing, was when they put that camera in the game, people could take their selfies.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:24.000
Alright, ActDeft, I gotta let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, but thank you for the feedback.

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:29.000
And let us know if you end up getting Triforce Heroes and what you think of the memes.

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Alright, take care, my friend.

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Alright, we're gonna give time for one more call to try to fit in.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:38.000
1877gameOLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:41.000
While we wait for that call, Loki, I don't know if you have any last-minute stories.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
Yes, I have excellent news.

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Dead or Alive Extreme 3, we'll be getting English subs since it's probably not gonna get released over here.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:51.000
So you can import those buoys right away.

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
Yay!

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:59.000
Yes, and that'll be coming out in Japan, across Asia, February 25th.

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Darsaga, Darsaga, Darsaga, we need to get this game and do a livestream.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Okay.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
Yay! That'll be fun.

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
We need to have the bounce-o-meter.

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:08.000
For the volleyball.

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:09.000
Exactly.

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Oh, boy.

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
Anything else to share?

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:18.000
Yeah, I was gonna say that along with the fact that they're not gonna be allowing you to change your names,

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:21.000
there's also still no plans for backwards compatibility on the PlayStation 4,

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:24.000
so that's also something else to look forward to.

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Game Center CX levels are coming to Super Mario Maker in all regions now.

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
So that'd be cool.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Does that mean we get to also play as the arena character?

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:40.000
I don't know.

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:45.000
I really just, sorry, not to beat a dead horse,

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:50.000
but I really have to express irritation, strong irritation,

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:54.000
that at least PlayStation 1 and 2 games are not playable on PlayStation 4.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
I mean, I get PlayStation 3 a little bit.

02:53:56.000 --> 02:54:00.000
You can play the tech challenge card on PlayStation 3 a little bit,

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:06.000
even though you have the fucking streaming video stuff, but whatever, we won't go there.

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:09.000
But PlayStation 1 and 2 not playable on 4, give me a fucking break.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:10.000
Give me a fucking break.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:13.000
Yeah, PlayStation 1's playable on a PSP.

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:14.000
Come on.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:15.000
Yeah.

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:16.000
It's playable on my phone.

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:17.000
My old-ass phone.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Yeah.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:19.000
I don't believe it.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:24.000
I don't believe that it's not possible and you don't want to try and you don't have the resources in it.

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
So just say, you know.

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:30.000
Because imagine, think about this, PlayStation Plus, the offerings that they've been giving you,

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
they haven't been this great lately.

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:35.000
Imagine if you could dip into that old PlayStation 1 catalog.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Hey, you get Twisted Metal or hey, you get Vibriven or something like that.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
That would be awesome.

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:46.000
Or Final Fantasy 6, because that was on, you know, PlayStation, so that would be pretty epic.

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:47.000
Yeah, I mean, just dip into that shit.

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:48.000
Jet Moto.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:49.000
Yeah.

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:50.000
I don't know.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:51.000
All right, one last call.

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
This is the last chance to get in on tonight's show.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype.

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
Anything else for our listeners tonight?

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:00.000
Yeah, this is kind of unusual.

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:09.000
There's a rumor that SNK Play More is leaving the pachinko business as opposed to joining it or getting more into it.

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
Well, what a refreshing story.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:14.000
Yes.

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
After a lot of news recently.

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:17.000
You know what?

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:18.000
Where did I see this?

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:19.000
Was it on Twitter?

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:20.000
Was it something somebody said in chat?

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:23.000
I'm so sorry, I cannot tie this comment to who said it.

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
I'm so sorry who said this in the moment.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:30.000
But somebody was saying the reason why Konami is making these pachinko machines.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
Maybe this was something Dark Tetsuya said. Was it you?

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
About Silent Hill?

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Yes.

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:36.000
Repeat that comment.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:45.000
The kind of conspiracy theory I have regarding why they're doing the Silent Hill pachinko machine is so that they can show that they're using the IP.

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:54.000
And so no one else can come in and try to claim that IP accusing them of forfeiting it through not use.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Because I'm not sure of the exact legality, but if you don't utilize an IP, you essentially forfeit the rights to it and someone else can pick it up and take it to make a game.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:14.000
So they don't want to lose the IP, but they don't want to actually make anything, so just slap on it on a pachinko machine and there you go.

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:15.000
Thank you.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:19.000
Yeah, but it hasn't been that long since they made a Silent Hill game. It's only been like a couple years.

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:29.000
Yeah, but still just buy some more time and maybe there will be a mobile phone game and I'm sure that's inevitable too. So they'll keep that trademark alive and well.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:34.000
They have a new gameplay trailer for 90's Arcade Racer which looks fantastic.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:35.000
I want to check that out.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:38.000
That's something that's coming to Wii U I think soon.

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:43.000
Well, it looks like no more calls are coming in tonight, so I'm going to go ahead and shut down the Skype line.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:46.000
If you think of something after the fact, go ahead and send us an email.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:51.000
Participate at orangeontruday.com or you can always tweet us twitter.com slash o-l-r.

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:56.000
Some people send us Facebook messages too and I must admit, I know that's how a lot of people talk today.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:02.000
I'm not so good at checking those, but I do read them and I'm sorry if I don't reply timely, but that's usually the last thing I check.

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.000
But I'll get to it eventually if you send a Facebook message.

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:09.000
Alright, is that it for stories too then?

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:10.000
Uh, yes.

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:13.000
Alright, well then I think we're going to go around and wrap things up.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:17.000
It is 9.15 here on the west coast, 15 after midnight on the east coast after all.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:23.000
Hey, I want to thank our guests for being here tonight, especially our newbies to the show here, Dan and Mike.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:26.000
I hope you guys had a good time and had fun being on this side of OLR.

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:32.000
So, I don't know if you have anything you want to plug, I don't know if you have a twitch channel or twitter you want to plug while you're here.

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:36.000
But please plug away before we say bye. So, Dan?

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:40.000
Nothing specific, I'll just plug my twitter handle I guess.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:44.000
It's gaming underscore hipster and you can go ahead and follow me.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:53.000
I talk mostly about video games and to everyone else who I'm following, it's nothing really super specific.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
But yeah, that's all I really have.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:57.000
Alright, awesome. And Mike?

02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:04.000
If you like sports I guess, basketball in particular, football, American football, sorry.

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:18.000
And the occasional gaming stuff, it's not even anywhere near focused but you can follow me on twitter at mnev3. That's it.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:23.000
Awesome. And now of course we always go around at the end of the show and get everybody's final thought.

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:29.000
Shane, I always ask you if you want to plug something, you never have anything to plug. But I'll get your final thought.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:33.000
You're so rude. This is the second time tonight.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:34.000
What would you like to plug?

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:39.000
I was just going to say that, well I don't have anything to plug.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
How could you quit Ingress?

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Because he was going to quit and I was like okay I'm going to delete it from my phone. Delete? There, it's easy.

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:50.000
It was super easy. That's all.

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:54.000
That's what you guys would do. You get me into it and then you all quit.

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
It's all server side anyway.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:59:00.000
I'm not quitting but I'm dialing it back.

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:06.000
I'll do my final thought since you still didn't ask me before you were so rude anyway about plugging stuff.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:15.000
My final thought is if you show up to my Toys R Us this Sunday and you try to get a villager and I don't get one, I will cut you.

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
Because I will.

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:18.000
Thank you for that.

02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:23.000
Before I actually invite people to give their final thoughts, even though Shane decided to give them anyway,

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:26.000
I want to quickly say, as I do at the end of every show,

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:33.000
we don't have a big multi-million dollar budget behind our show or a way to spread the word about our show.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:36.000
So if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry Radio, please help us spread the word.

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:42.000
Tell a friend or five or twenty-five about the show and help spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:46.000
Because if the voices aren't listening and using those voices, then we can't hear them.

02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:50.000
A five-star review wherever you found this show goes a very long way.

02:59:50.000 --> 02:59:55.000
So thank you to everybody giving five-star reviews on iTunes, Stitcher Radio, wherever it is.

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
Soon, I guess now, Google Play.

02:59:57.000 --> 03:00:03.000
I just submitted the show to that because I don't know if you guys heard but the Google Play is going to be launching podcasting.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:07.000
And so they were accepting shows and I'm like, hooray, another place to list OLR.

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:08.000
Sign me up.

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:09.000
So we'll be on that.

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
And I got the email back that we got accepted.

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
So we'll be in that whenever it launches.

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:14.000
So that's exciting.

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:18.000
And if they have reviews, we need five-star reviews there too.

03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:20.000
I would appreciate it.

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
Not if they're out of ten.

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:23.000
Then it should be ten.

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:26.000
Yes, if it's ten, then please ten out of ten.

03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:29.000
Don't leave a five-star review out of ten saying Rob said five stars.

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:30.000
You know what I mean.

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:31.000
You know what I mean.

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:32.000
You're smart people.

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:37.000
Now we can go around to everybody's final thought for the night.

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:40.000
Shane, you're hereby cordially invited to give your final thought for the night.

03:00:40.000 --> 03:00:44.000
I need time to think of another one.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:46.000
So come back to me.

03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:47.000
All right.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
Dan, your final thought for the night.

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:55.000
My thought is I need to take out a loan so I can purchase 90 villager amiibos from a certain Toys R Us.

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
I like you.

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
You come back any time.

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:00.000
All right, Mike, your final thought.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:03.000
I really hope I can hit Legend this month in Hearthstone.

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:04.000
Good luck to you.

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:05.000
God damn it.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
I want to see you on the stage at BlizzCon someday.

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:13.000
Oh, dear God, that would be too much, but got to hit Legend first.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:14.000
Got to hit Legend first.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:15.000
Sounds good.

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:16.000
All right, let's see.

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:19.000
My final thought for the day is I'm not quitting.

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:20.000
I'm just dialing it back.

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:24.000
There's a big difference, although, yes, I did use the word quit quite frequently,

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:27.000
but we all get frustrated sometimes a little bit.

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
Just because there's so many blues in the area, right?

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:33.000
No, it actually has nothing to do with that because actually I like being on the underdog team

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
because you know you're kind of...

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:36.000
You're waiting for Pokemon Go.

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:37.000
That's what it is.

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
That's actually super true.

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
But anyway, it has nothing to do with that.

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:44.000
But anyway, all right, Shane's back with his real final thought.

03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:45.000
Here it is.

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:50.000
I have to go buy a knife apparently to cut Dan with for this weekend.

03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:51.000
All right.

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:52.000
Good luck with that.

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
I'll be his bodyguard.

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:55.000
Cut two people.

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:56.000
Good luck.

03:01:56.000 --> 03:01:57.000
He'll cut two people.

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:58.000
All right, let's see.

03:01:58.000 --> 03:02:00.000
Loki, your final thought for the night.

03:02:00.000 --> 03:02:01.000
All right.

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:04.000
So this guy took the portal that I took on the way over here back,

03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:06.000
but dumbass only left like four resonators on there,

03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:09.000
so I'm just going to have to spend five seconds to blow it up.

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:13.000
Oh, that guy is always around here, and he's...

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:14.000
He'll be fine.

03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:15.000
That's fine.

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:16.000
I'll blow it up.

03:02:16.000 --> 03:02:17.000
Go teach him a lesson.

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:18.000
All right.

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:19.000
It's more points for me.

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:20.000
That's right, more points.

03:02:20.000 --> 03:02:21.000
That's how you have to look at it.

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:22.000
When you're on the underdog team, it's easier to get XP.

03:02:22.000 --> 03:02:23.000
I just don't care.

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:24.000
I don't care.

03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:25.000
That's right.

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:26.000
It's a fucking game, and I don't care.

03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:28.000
That's what I had to say earlier this week.

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:29.000
All right.

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
Last, but certainly not least, dark soccer.

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:35.000
Your final thought tonight.

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:36.000
How appropriate.

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:41.000
What we should do is just drive down to that park down the street and blow that one up.

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:44.000
Okay, you got to be careful when you talk about blow...

03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:46.000
Let's go to the park and blow it up.

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:47.000
Blow up some notes.

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:54.000
Yes, he means with pew pew imaginary laser beams in an imaginary game that is not real.

03:02:54.000 --> 03:02:56.000
We need to preface by saying that.

03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:57.000
All right.

03:02:58.000 --> 03:02:59.000
Hello, NSA.

03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:00.000
Yeah, right?

03:03:00.000 --> 03:03:01.000
Oh, boy.

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:02.000
All right.

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:05.000
And then Loki's going to be left saying something like this.

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:06.000
Oh, wait.

03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:07.000
Damn it.

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:08.000
Oh, wait.

03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:09.000
Damn it.

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:10.000
Yes.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:11.000
That'll be...

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:12.000
I miscued the sound clip.

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:13.000
Loki would say something like this.

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:14.000
God damn.

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:15.000
Ow, my foot.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:16.000
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:17.000
Oh, my God.

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:18.000
It hurts so bad.

03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:19.000
All right.

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:26.000
Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:30.000
We will see you next time in seven days to do it all again.

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
Have a great week at gaming, everybody.

03:03:57.000 --> 03:04:00.000
But you know they were all still true.

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:04.000
See you next week.

03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:36.000
Thanks for watching.
