00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,440
This week Microsoft released the new Xbox experience to the world enabling you to relive

2
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,000
your fondest Xbox 360 memories as backwards compatibility begins again.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,720
We'll catch up with this and last week's news along with your comments, calls and more

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:31,960
and it all starts right now in the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,440
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,400
where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:45,220
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 621 for this November the 15th

8
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,460
of 2015.

9
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,080
My name is Rob Roberts but you might know me on Twitter at Skie S-K-I-E and joining

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,400
me as she always does, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Yo.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Hey Jamie, how you doing?

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
I'm alright.

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Yeah?

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,360
We were just kind of chilling here in studio with no Bobby tonight.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,960
I was decorating a hotel and I kept thinking maybe I could make it look like the one from

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
The Shining.

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,320
So you are playing, I mean we'll get into your gaming weekend a little bit, but you

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,740
are playing Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer like a lot and you were playing that before

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,740
the show tonight.

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,360
I've done my last project so I have a party waiting for me.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,560
Tell us about your band because I thought the fact that you could set up a band was

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
cool.

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,500
I just threw out freaking instruments but like you can, one of your projects is to create

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,240
a concert hall and I was like what instruments can I put in here that don't go together?

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
So I have a piano.

27
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,240
Of course you have to have a piano.

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
I have bagpipes.

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
Uh huh.

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
I have a theremin.

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Uh huh.

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,240
I have an alto sax.

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,240
Uh huh.

34
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,240
I have a sitar.

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,240
You did get a sitar.

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
I did get a sitar.

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
And I have a taiko.

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,240
Okay.

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,240
No marimba though.

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
I suggested marimba.

41
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,120
That's too bad.

42
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,800
There was a xylophone and there was a um.

43
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
No didgeridoo.

44
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
It wasn't a didgeridoo.

45
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
I would have put a didgeridoo if I had seen it.

46
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Fake ass game.

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,360
I did put a xylophone in.

48
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
Okay that's cool.

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,440
So I put the xylophone in.

50
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
Alright.

51
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
Um so.

52
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
Xylophone.

53
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,760
It's the reason for the letter X.

54
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,840
Yes.

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,640
And so I went back into the concert hall and there was a concert in play with an ostrich

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,040
singing and everyone playing the instruments and it was all you know the music that's already

57
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,760
in the Animal Crossing games but they were just switching from it and she was singing

58
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,200
along and you could hear it and you could play along with them.

59
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,280
You could pick one of the instruments and it would play in tune with the music.

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,120
Animal Crossing is so stupid.

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,880
Your butt's cheating.

62
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,040
We do tape live every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network of vog network dot

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,160
com and if you are listening to us you should join our chat room live dot vog network dot

64
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,840
com where Tigerclaw is asking what about a tuba or a cowbell.

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
There wasn't a tuba.

66
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
There was no tuba.

67
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
There was a tuba.

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Somebody needs to introduce the animals.

69
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,120
Oh the other instrument I put in there was a harp.

70
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
There you go.

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Add a harp.

72
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
That's a busy, busy orchestra.

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,120
Uh of course six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern every week right after the Bobby Blackwolf

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,880
show at the voice of geeks network.

75
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,240
Uh joining me here in studio as well say hello to tech master Loki.

76
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Hey what's up.

77
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
Hey not much how you doing Loki?

78
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,320
Not much just haven't been on Humble Bundle in a while so I was seeing what was there.

79
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,520
This is exactly how our last show started.

80
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,920
And nothing really there.

81
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,200
Yeah not yet.

82
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,400
Maybe they're setting up for something big.

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Who knows.

84
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,720
Yeah they have like some sale thing because I guess they're their two year anniversary

85
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
at the Humble store or something like that.

86
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Fair enough.

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,000
You know it's.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,220
So again our pal Bobby was off tonight so we were chatting in studio before usually

89
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,560
we'll be listening to him and you know so we're prepared to chat with him at the end

90
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,000
of the show and so forth but tonight we were just able to kind of catch up and talk about

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,160
some random topics off air.

92
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,440
And you were talking about your son and how you're trying to get your son to watch Marvel

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,880
movies but he's not having it right.

94
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,560
No he doesn't want to watch Marvel movies because he's you know kind of timid about

95
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,920
everything so you know honestly it's a little violent.

96
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,600
I mean I guess PG-13 maybe needs to wait a couple of years you know.

97
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,560
So it's a little violent for children but I found it fascinating what he does watch.

98
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,360
Yes he does watch he's been watching a lot of YouTube lately because they kind of get

99
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,760
I'm well I'm getting sick of what they're watching on TV and so he watches YouTube videos

100
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,120
of Minecraft.

101
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,240
And so it's basically whatever comes up first when you type in Minecraft which ends up being

102
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,800
the diamond mine cart and popular MMOs and so he watches people play mods and that's

103
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
about it.

104
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,080
Yeah I play different Minecraft games and he watches that for hours.

105
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,800
It's fascinating to me to think like this is what let's play culture is becoming because

106
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,520
you know I was a kid raised on what Mr. Rogers neighborhood and what square one television

107
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,080
and Sesame Street and everything on PBS.

108
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,400
Your kid is in part I'm sure he watches some of that stuff too but is in part being raised

109
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,920
by let's plays.

110
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:50,200
Yeah they want like it see the kids they want to watch what they want to watch right away.

111
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,600
It's not oh hey SpongeBob is on.

112
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,760
No that's not going to work.

113
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,000
It's it's I need to watch videos of Olaf right now.

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,360
You know that's what my youngest son is.

115
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,200
Interesting and that's kind of what this video on demand culture is creating.

116
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,360
Yeah it's just like I want to watch Minecraft videos.

117
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Done.

118
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Minecraft videos.

119
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,600
You know instead of like oh hey I got to wait until five o'clock for you ultimate Spider-Man

120
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,040
to be on or something like that.

121
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
That's not going to happen.

122
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,160
It's just you know it just reminds me of the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the

123
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,320
girl Veruca Salt who's the I want it now because you know they had the that was all in the

124
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,320
news this week because there was the 44th anniversary or something they all reunited

125
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,440
on one of the talk shows here and you know I don't know just kind of full circle there.

126
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,480
I want it now and you can get it now with video on demand.

127
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,360
Yeah I mean and that's kind of the thing and I think you know with these channels as long

128
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,280
as they're you know not too explicit.

129
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,320
And I think with most of the Minecraft people that play those they know their audience and

130
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,480
they're not too bad and it's somewhat entertaining.

131
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,520
I mean it's enough to keep them you know occupied for a few hours.

132
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,480
So and it doesn't cost me anything.

133
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,240
Oh and hey I'm not definitely I'm definitely not paying for YouTube reds.

134
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
So there's that.

135
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
I don't blame you there.

136
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,440
Go into our chat room at live dot vog network dot com.

137
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Kaijuto says his son is smart.

138
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,000
Marvel is for chumps.

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,800
Oh that's not a that's not a play so we're starting.

140
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,280
He likes Marvel as well.

141
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,680
I mean he still loves all the Marvel superheroes and plays all that stuff but he's really into

142
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,960
Minecraft Tigerclaw suggesting he should watch the Star Wars movies to prepare him for The

143
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,240
Force Awakens.

144
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,720
He's not going to see The Force Awakens.

145
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,800
He doesn't care he doesn't even know anything about the series and it would be too scary

146
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
for him.

147
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,160
I didn't want to see The Force Awakens but you know that probably won't be until.

148
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Yeah.

149
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,680
No way am I going to go when it first comes out and just all the crazy in January.

150
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,320
I'll wait and see in January.

151
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Let's see.

152
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,760
Weiland saying square one oh man bringing that show up totally isn't dating yourself.

153
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Can you watch math net on demand because I'm telling you that was quality television right

154
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
there.

155
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,120
I'm I'm sure if it's on YouTube you can because I mean what the thing about YouTube which

156
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,120
is great before used to be OK find the video and there you go.

157
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,200
Now you type in something OK watch this video and it just plays the next one and the next

158
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,080
one and the next one and the next one forever.

159
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,240
Yeah which kind of can be annoying sometimes though.

160
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,920
Yeah sometimes it doesn't really like fit like when we're doing Olaf it pulls up a League

161
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,360
of Legends video in the middle somewhere you know because there's some guy named Olaf that

162
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,880
plays League of Legends.

163
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
Let's see.

164
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,680
And lastly before we get into you know the rest of what we have planned for the show

165
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
tonight.

166
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,680
S.S.J. 100 Matt in chat says Minecraft is the game the kids are growing up with.

167
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,520
It's crazy to think about them possibly starting their own podcast many years later reminiscing

168
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,060
about Minecraft and other current games.

169
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,040
You had the way we reminisce about you know math net or whatever it is square one television

170
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,980
and all the rad stuff when I was a kid.

171
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,040
Just you know people will be reminiscing about Minecraft.

172
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,520
It's so interesting to think.

173
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,720
Well here's the funny thing is whenever he sees like an eight bit game or something it's

174
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,320
all yeah it looks like Minecraft because it's blocky.

175
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,560
I'm like no that's what graphics used to look like.

176
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
You know.

177
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Oh my gosh.

178
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,940
It's not on purpose like Minecraft is.

179
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,720
How funny.

180
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,280
OK so let's get into some of the other topics we have to discuss for tonight's show.

181
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,640
First off let's talk about last week because we there was no show on the feed last week

182
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,800
and you know I tried to get the word out on Twitter and Facebook and stuff that there

183
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,940
was going to be a show but I was still getting messages even today like did you guys do a

184
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,940
show last week.

185
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
So here's the thing.

186
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,940
We had a show all set up ready to go at probably at about two o'clock that day we thought we

187
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,460
were going to still do the show and then I definitely felt like I was feeling sick.

188
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,220
Like you know how you just kind of start like all of a sudden you're like oh I feel it.

189
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,980
I feel the scratch in the nose the throat.

190
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,920
So I knew I was getting sick and it was setting in rapidly so I kind of made a call at about

191
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,180
four o'clock like we're not going to do the show because I'm getting sick and I don't

192
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:56,860
want to get Loki sick who would then in turn get the kids sick.

193
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Jimmy was already here because sometimes she gets here early so we can hang out before

194
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
the show.

195
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
But you kind of saw that.

196
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
I was already out in the area.

197
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,120
Yeah you kind of saw that I was starting to get sick and you were like yeah probably not

198
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
doing the shows.

199
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,420
Well that when you started taking a nap I just left.

200
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,780
I was in the middle of sitting in a park blasting a portal but you know that just.

201
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,620
I mean I want to reminisce to the days where Loki hated Ingress and didn't understand the

202
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,620
point.

203
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,860
Well I don't understand it.

204
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,360
It's still like sometimes I wonder why I'm even playing it because it's like it's really

205
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
pointless.

206
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,920
No believe me believe me I've been there about once a week I have that discussion with myself.

207
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,520
Why am I playing this fucking game.

208
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,680
But there are some really rad people I've been playing it but anyway that all that aside.

209
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Yeah.

210
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,460
So so long story short I got sick.

211
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,560
I didn't want to get my co-host sick because we all tape here at my house which where Studio

212
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,560
N7 is located here in lovely Sacramento California.

213
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,400
So you know I hate not doing a show and having an irregular week off because you know anytime

214
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,600
I've done a panel on podcasting or given people advice on podcasting and my advice

215
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,200
continues to be make sure you are regular with your show.

216
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Do a show every week because when you don't do a show that's when your audience find something

217
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,280
to replace you.

218
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,080
So I really I mean I'm OK with missing a show when it's a holiday or something where your

219
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,560
listeners are probably distracted as well and not going to be listening but you know

220
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,560
yeah.

221
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,840
So I really hate missing shows but I know all our listeners are pretty decent people

222
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,200
and you know when they heard I was sick I was getting a lot of nice messages on Twitter

223
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
and stuff.

224
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,640
We understand feel better it sucks but you know you have been more convenient this week

225
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,160
because there's Fallout 4 and people like right to show right.

226
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,160
What day is this.

227
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,000
I was worried some of my co-workers are probably going to think like did he take time off to

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,100
play video games which is funny because I'm not even playing Fallout 4 but no I was legit

229
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,200
sick and I just have to say this be the end of it and we'll get into actual video games

230
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,640
but like this is probably the worst I've been sick since I had the swine flu in like

231
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
2009.

232
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
Right.

233
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,800
But like even Alan was commenting like the whole time we've been together.

234
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,560
This is the sickest you see me I'm pretty sure I had the flu and you might even still

235
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,920
hear it in my voice like I'm still congested even today and it's been a week.

236
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,840
Bobby in chat says canceling a show to play Fallout 4.

237
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,300
Who would do such a thing.

238
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,840
Is that why there's no Bobby tonight.

239
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,840
That's funny.

240
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,840
All right.

241
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,900
Anyway so there you go.

242
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,120
That's what happened with last week's show.

243
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,120
So sorry about that.

244
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,640
So it's funny we had a whole show show role and everything set up for last week and stories

245
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,440
we were going to discuss but that's going to make our kickoff topic very easy tonight.

246
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,340
So to kick off our show tonight we'd like to present last week's news set to Holik.

247
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:38,760
Last week for the week of November 8th in gaming Blizzcon happened over the weekend

248
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,960
before the what would have been the last show and there was a lot of news coming out of

249
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Activision Blizzard.

250
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,880
For one Activision bought the company King the makers of Candy Crush.

251
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,960
They felt that EA was getting too evil and they really needed to up their evil game.

252
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,560
They were diversifying their evil.

253
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,560
A lot of people had a lot to say about Activision buying King which some people see as a one

254
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,480
trick pony but I'm sure Activision sees as a way to tap into the mobile market and a

255
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,960
lot of still loyal Candy Crush players.

256
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,640
Also out of Blizzcon the first trailer for the World of Warcraft movie was released and

257
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,840
I'll just tell you on a personal note what they showed last year looked better in my

258
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,920
opinion but I will still see the movie it looked well enough.

259
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,400
Destiny celebrating 25 million users that game is sure having a renaissance.

260
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,880
Funny coming off of the Activision story and Diablo 3 experienced a very similar thing.

261
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,600
On N7 day November 7th which was last week big day for Mass Effect fans a new teaser

262
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,800
was shown for Mass Effect Andromeda narrated by FemShep which was interesting because they

263
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,240
said that Shepard has nothing to do with the new trilogy but yet there she is narrating

264
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,840
the trailer who knows.

265
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:50,760
Let's see and then Borderlines online cancelled sorry to hear that and then Konami closing

266
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:57,980
their last studio in the US in Los Angeles and that is last week's news in a nutshell.

267
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,360
So there you go.

268
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,360
Anything else big from last week you guys think is worth discussing you want to mention

269
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,040
real quick?

270
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,760
Well the Activision is talking about getting into the movie business but I guess it's not

271
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,360
really that surprising they were talking about making a Skylanders show for a while

272
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,960
now and some of that's going to be a thing Skylanders Academy and yeah and maybe they're

273
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,040
going to be making Call of Duty movies.

274
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,600
Yeah there was a lot of movie news last week which I wouldn't actually be too bad because

275
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,000
they have an okay storyline well and it was one of those things that when they announced

276
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,440
that they're going to make movies out of Call of Duty I was like I thought that was already

277
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,760
a thing that was happening somewhere and to be honest I mean the storylines now with all

278
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,320
the like futuristic tech and stuff is a little bit more interesting than just you know World

279
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
War II.

280
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,960
I think Kevin Spacey will be in it because you know he was in the in the games right?

281
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,760
Probably not but cool.

282
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,080
Yeah so Activision Blizzard forming like some type of like movie studio I guess was was

283
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:55,320
in the news last week as well but not just them doing movies The Witcher was going to

284
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,440
be getting a movie in 2017 but it should be noted that's because those games are based

285
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,680
off a book series the book series technically is what they're turning into a movie but some

286
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,960
you know still see it certainly as you know the same universe as the games so that is

287
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,200
going to be getting a movie out of that and then one other quick thing I want to mention

288
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,800
out last week because I thought this was interesting and it was something we were going to talk

289
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,920
a little more about but Valve kind of got the smackdown from a UK advertising authority

290
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,400
over misleading customers during the Steam summer sale and the reason why and I remember

291
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,000
seeing this on the US store.

292
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,720
It wasn't Val's fault though.

293
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,000
Well they still it was their store it was on their shelf right but here's the thing

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,600
so Grand Theft Auto was on sale for $39.99 but technically that wasn't what was really

295
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,040
on sale you could essentially it was you got the game and the bonus currency for the price

296
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,560
of the game is what it was so people were saying that this discount wasn't genuine because

297
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,120
the product that they were advertising didn't exist before the sale and I thought it was

298
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,360
because they what they did is they raised the price of the game and then discounted

299
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,660
it back to its original price to show that there was a price drop like it was on sale

300
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:13,680
but it was being sold for its original price was the issue yeah because they included the

301
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,960
currency in it that's what they did they did they raised the price by including that fake

302
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:23,840
currency essentially so and yeah that was they got they got in trouble for that so Valve

303
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,120
has to not show those sales in that way ever again and must ensure that future discounts

304
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,080
are not misleading so you know Valve is usually up to as a company that does no wrong you

305
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,720
know all hail Gabe is it steam sale time and all that stuff but you know that was a but

306
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,080
you you say actually it's not Valve's fault.

307
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,600
I think it's Rockstar's fault because they're the ones that deal with you know setting prices

308
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,400
on that stuff it's just a storefront they were doing that not only on Valve's storefront

309
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,440
but on other storefronts as well it was just jacking it up and that's what people call

310
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,280
them out on it like immediately.

311
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,880
Bobby Blackwolf trying to lend some clarity here going the problem with the Valve thing

312
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,280
is that they showed them side by side they showed the game only not on sale for forty

313
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,120
dollars and then they showed the game with the bonus currency on sale for forty dollars

314
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:17,160
next to each other by accident so I mean I remember going onto the store and seeing the

315
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,960
whole sale with the currency and yeah I understand that for an hour it showed something different

316
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,400
and this is where they kind of got caught but I remember even at the time when I saw

317
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,640
that seeing like oh they just jacked up the price of the game by including the currency

318
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,080
and then put that on sale I was like that's kind of shady but I mean the game was brand

319
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,260
new at the time I wasn't expecting it to be on sale but I was kind of like that's a little

320
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,000
you know that brand new just put the just knock five bucks off or do ten percent or

321
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,960
something that's like really really you know not that big a deal you don't have to do one

322
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,720
of the famous you know steam sale deep discounts just do a little discount to get people excited

323
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,520
about it I don't know anyway so essentially that was last week's news some of the stuff

324
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,000
we missed last week so we will get into this week's news but first we always like to start

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,520
off the show talking about our gaming weeks so let's get to it Dark Sakura how was your

326
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,160
gaming week kind of busy we got Fallout 4 which is okay I'm really is more Dan playing

327
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:24,440
it than me we also were playing Animal Crossing amiibo festival which was actually stupidly

328
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:34,360
fun but kind of disarming in how easily one can overtake the other you play for happiness

329
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,640
is it Mario Party I couldn't get the sense what there's no minigames oh but you do little

330
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,640
things along with it like you play the turnip the stalk market you do the turnip thing and

331
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:52,600
you have different special events that happen every random day and you have holiday events

332
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,160
you can play the calendar any time of the year but we did November twice so we had to

333
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,640
help gather ingredients for Thanksgiving and it's all the Animal Crossing characters show

334
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:09,800
up and you can play I've got four amiibos now the villager does not work so that is

335
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,080
so weird the villager is not one of the amiibo I mean I realize they have a whole separate

336
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,880
line for Animal Crossing but it's weird like yeah amiibo have usually crossed over you

337
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,120
know and the other it's weird the Animal Crossing amiibo work in Smash Brothers but in Mario

338
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,920
Maker so but so we got the two that came with it which was Isabelle and Digby and I picked

339
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:37,080
up Mabel and Tom Nook and I want the pack that's got Toto KK in it I mean sorry KK slider

340
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:44,620
I just think it's cool to say Toto KK because it's fun to say so anyway we've been say total

341
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:52,800
bukkake what did you say Toto KK okay so anyway I've been playing that I've been playing

342
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,600
Animal Crossing happy home designer which it's been fun but it's a little disappointing

343
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,460
how short the actual game itself is because I think I'm actually at endgame now which

344
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,600
is I mean you can still play but it's I'm going to get the credit soon I'll put it that

345
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:16,000
way I've done all the town projects I've been playing some Dragon Age Inquisition I didn't

346
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,640
play any Final Fantasy like I said I was you've had a very Animal Crossing filled week actually

347
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,000
question for you from our chat room about Fallout SSJ100 Matt wanting to know if watching

348
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,080
Dan play gets you sick after a while because you've talked about like motion sickness yes

349
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,240
some of that so I figured that when it comes time for me to play it more I'm gonna do it

350
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,080
in the third person perspective so that I don't have to oh yeah that's right because

351
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,100
Bethesda is pretty good about that yeah that's one button it flips it between yeah that's

352
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:52,800
in Skyrim and all that too yeah what else was it that I put yeah I'm playing Undertale

353
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,580
which I haven't gotten too far because I hate the control scheme in it and if I can

354
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,580
figure out how to remap the controls in it I'll have a bit much better time playing it

355
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:07,640
I'm sure that can't be too difficult to do no but it's a cute game it's very like a fucked

356
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,200
up NES game I have a lot of people telling me I need to play Undertale and I do I it's

357
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,520
on my list of things to get to before the year's up we'll see I've also been playing

358
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:23,020
the beginner's guide which is I think I might have talked about it before but basically

359
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:28,760
you're just sort of walked through this one amateur game designers designs you know whether

360
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,320
they be map projects or you know his own little incomplete games but you get to wander around

361
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,840
in the universe and look into some of the guys thoughts on gaming and I just got Dear

362
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,640
Esther today which I had been meaning to play so I'm looking forward to starting that oh

363
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,360
that's by the folks who do Everybody's Gone to the Rapture that's kind of the pre well

364
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,960
the games aren't necessarily related but I guess there's elements of Rapture which is

365
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,360
still one of my favorite experiences in gaming this year so far that game was was I feel

366
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,640
weird calling it a game I would say that experience was I still think it's an interactive experience

367
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:14,840
worth experiencing but yeah so but Dear Esther was only 10 bucks so I got it yeah on Steam

368
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:23,120
I thought there was something else but no you got all the big stuff yeah well no we

369
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,920
got more games we got because we took advantage of the buy to get one free deal at Target

370
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:34,200
so I took back need for speed to get my Animal Crossing because it was actually the same

371
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:46,040
price I got so we got Mario Party Smash Brothers what else did we get oh yeah Dan got Metal

372
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Gear Solid 5 and Fallout 4 and what was the other game that we picked up can't even remember

373
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:59,720
it seriously I can't well he was gonna get me Yoshi and then decided I guess it honestly

374
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,680
enough I've got so many things on the plate right now but oh yeah we got Mario Kart okay

375
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:13,160
yeah so that's one you should have yeah all right there it is Alan alchemy in chat saying

376
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,640
I think Dear Esther started as a half-life 2 mod years and years ago yeah that's true

377
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,640
actually that started as a mod and then kind of spun off into its own thing so kind of

378
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,920
funny the evolution of how that game maker kind of created their stuff let's go over

379
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,360
to Loki how was your gaming week I played quite a bit I see I played a little bit of

380
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,560
Fallout 4 only a couple hours of that because that's all I had time for at the time and

381
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:42,240
I haven't been able to play it since because my wife has been hogging the TV so I need

382
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:49,200
to figure out something to play it so I don't have to have the TV and then I played a little

383
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,120
bit Mario maker I played through all the different event stages that they had so you can unlock

384
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:00,840
the different characters for the mystery mushroom so they have like all the Game Center

385
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,080
CX and the Famitsu and all that stuff those characters you can unlock so I played through

386
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:13,200
all those and what else I played a little bit of Minecraft Windows 10 edition but once

387
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,920
again it's just kind of like no point to it I kind of I'm so wishing that like the regular

388
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,560
game ran as well as it does in Windows 10 on that version but it's so limited because

389
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,280
it's based off the mobile version so like I was trying to figure out like how to make

390
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,880
stairs the other day I was like how the hell I'm like I'm doing the recipe right now why

391
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,520
the fuck is this not working and so I look it up online there's like a separate exclusive

392
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,220
thing for the pocket edition that you have to have to like cut the stone or something

393
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:47,560
like that like this is dumb yeah they really just need to make it regular Minecraft just

394
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,240
like I'll put some regular Minecraft back on there or something like that and just play

395
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,800
that with some mods and stuff because watching those videos you know with my son and everything

396
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,680
I'm like hey that looks pretty cool I want to play that it's you know kind of getting

397
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,960
me back into that a little bit but I just haven't really played it yet and then what

398
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,920
else do they play I played more ingress of course quite a bit actually I had to cut it

399
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,020
back a little bit to this week because I'm running out of data on my plan for one and

400
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,860
I've run out of inventory pretty much now except Rob helped me out by give me quite

401
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:30,140
a few bursters they might be listening and then and then just like I don't know so this

402
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:36,860
week I actually have two days that I'll be able to play so we'll see tell them your plans

403
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,260
they're everywhere I'm almost to level 8 so I'm like 120 get there hundred and sixty thousand

404
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:49,180
away from level 8 but I knocked I think I got a hundred two hundred K in like one day

405
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,940
like for a couple hours so I don't think it'll be a problem now that you are like you know

406
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,800
full throttle on team ingress and all this how do you feel about the book Pokemon go

407
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:02,280
thing is this something you know no not interested not interested I don't like Pokemon what do

408
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,920
you think though now that you have more experience with ingress about the fact that this company

409
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,340
that you know has made this game is going to be making the Pokemon go I don't know what

410
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,820
they're really gonna do with it is just gonna be spots where you go try to find Pokemon

411
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:16,260
I mean how's that gonna work do you battle other people I mean yeah I don't know there's

412
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,980
still a lot of like I think there could be like more excitement to ingress as well because

413
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:25,460
it's kind of just like okay go within proximity hit a button trace some stuff done it's not

414
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,780
like hey there's another player over there I'm gonna battle you or something like that

415
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,220
because I'd be a little more interesting but we made eye contact there like the other day

416
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:38,420
like when I was playing you know I I see the other team playing and it's like it's completely

417
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:44,140
lazy on their part like I'm out of my car you know and like going up to these portals to like

418
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,980
hit different things cuz like I can't hit him with the bursars I have and I see these guys just like

419
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,060
driving a car they literally just stop they're illegally parked playing the thing and then they

420
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:58,020
blow up my portal link a second and then they drive the next one blow up that one in a second

421
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:04,060
and that's it I wave to them no waving back I'm like what the fuck I mean seriously like there's

422
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,260
some that like kind of like tease back and forth and stuff you know like they'll blast my portal

423
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,700
once not really doing any damage like just want to make sure you're awake I'm like yeah I'm awake

424
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,580
you know it's you know fun stuff like that but yeah I don't know these like the other team has

425
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:24,060
seemed very friendly like I think I waved I'm like hey Cobra senior hey how's it going you know like

426
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:30,260
I just kind of waved in like nothing just like blank face driving around yeah you got it like

427
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,780
you're taking it way too serious and there's you know as far as that team thing goes there's bad

428
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,220
apples on every team I'm sure there's people on our side that are that are mean about it too

429
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,180
because I've met some nice people on the other team and what have you but I'm like at the end

430
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:46,020
of the day you know for those people I just say like we're all fucking nerds we're playing a cell

431
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,100
phone game that involves going out in the real world like you're a fucking nerd too as much as

432
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,620
I am so why don't we just say hey and talk about nerd stuff for like five seconds I never understood

433
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:01,060
that was like I am going to inherently have a problem with you because your favorite color

434
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:06,340
and mine are different I just think it's so like I just thought it'd be just like kind of like you

435
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,740
know hey I blew yours up hi you know just like that would have been fine I was because I was

436
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:17,060
trying to be friendly hey ice I know it's you you know hey and now is that I mean it's like nothing

437
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:21,660
and they just look so lazy they won't even get out their car like it's like the portals just a

438
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,380
slightly a couple feet away oh but I can't possibly put anything on it because that would

439
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,820
involve me stepping out of my vehicle it's like whatever I whatever yeah I know and I just don't

440
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,900
have the time to drive around like all day long doing that and like some of them do I guess but

441
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,980
you can't control other can people you can only control yourself and I know that I've seen way

442
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,940
more places because of the game and done a lot more walking and some like whatever I'm getting

443
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:50,420
what I need out of it yeah so that's that yeah anything else for your game of the week I think

444
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,420
does it all right my gaming week not super eventful obviously because the flu is kind of knocked me

445
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,660
out a little bit yokai watch I guess I didn't get to talk about that last week but I did buy

446
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:05,620
yokai watch I've been playing quite a bit of that I'm having a good time with the game I think it's

447
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:12,020
pretty fun and it's it's interesting going around and the way you kind of will use your spy glass

448
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:18,020
to find the yokai and then the battle system I like it's you spin this wheel around that will

449
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:23,340
choose the three characters and they auto battle but you can control their ultra moves and you can

450
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,900
control the targeting but you have to be not only watching what you're doing on the bottom screen

451
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,300
but you want to kind of like watch the top screen because sometimes there might be like items that

452
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,620
flow around that you have to throw a dart at like I know I'm making it sound really complicated

453
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,520
because it is in some ways it's it's it's more in depth than you might have gotten the impression

454
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,820
from the demo because it's just the auto battling in the demo but there's there's a bit going on I

455
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:52,260
think yokai is pretty interesting and I like how you can use the play coins to get extra items or

456
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:58,380
even yokai there's even QR codes out there you can find a tumblr full of them that you can scan on

457
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:04,860
your DS and you can get like special event coins they'll get your random yokai and yeah so I don't

458
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:11,140
know it's like Pokemon in the sense that you know you have these little dudes that you collect that

459
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,420
go with you to fight for you but otherwise the battling is very very different and even the game

460
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:23,700
itself it's just in the fantasy life engine like and it's just a more modern-day setting otherwise

461
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:29,700
but the game looks a lot like fantasy life if you ever played that and just you know kind of plays

462
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,140
a little differently with the battling system but I'm enjoying a yokai watch so I was playing a lot

463
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,180
of that last week this week I played a little more as I've been sick but otherwise I haven't played a

464
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:44,100
lot of new stuff I've just been playing Final Fantasy 14 quite a bit because they had the patch

465
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,300
that came out this week where they have a new raid called the void arc and they have two new dungeons

466
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:56,060
I've been leveling my machinist I was 30 a couple weeks ago which is the starting level for machinist

467
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:03,860
and I'm already now 51 almost 52 probably will hit 52 tonight so you know I've just been doing that

468
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,660
I've been having a lot of fun playing that class that's one of the new classes they released in the

469
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:13,100
heavensward expansion so I think I just like heavensward jobs because my main is an astrologian

470
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,100
now I have a machinist and if I'm gonna play a tank dark knight is actually my favorite so I

471
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,940
think I'm just I'm just the kind of person that really likes the heavensward jobs so that's been

472
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:30,780
playing a lot of that otherwise not a lot of new stuff on PlayStation or Wii U or any of that stuff

473
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:37,340
just mostly Final Fantasy 14 so we'll probably get back into the consoles this week as I'm

474
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,340
feeling a lot better but I'm telling you earlier this week was not pretty I didn't even really want

475
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:53,220
to play any video games that's how you know I'm sick that's how you know anyhow so oh I guess I

476
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:58,380
should say one other thing on on 3ds because I have some opinions about this so I mean we're

477
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,620
gonna get into this in the news in a little bit but Nintendo released this badge arcade thing if

478
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,260
you guys seen this on the 3ds the badge arcade which is in Japan they've had it for a while I

479
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,700
know this cuz Shane was talking to me about this before cuz he had a Japanese 3ds and so he was

480
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:18,580
telling me about this and so I guess it finally came out here so I was checking it out and it's

481
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:24,260
an interesting concept if you haven't played it at all it's a free app that you download on your

482
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:30,700
3ds and it's like crane games it's free to start yeah yeah I'll get there so it's it's these crane

483
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:37,140
games and so you can control these cranes and you can like pluck these little badges and if it

484
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,860
grabs them and you know it gets gets them out at the crane crane game then you can actually use

485
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:47,020
these badges on your 3ds home screen to like decorate folders or you can actually use them

486
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,660
on any of the empty spots to actually kind of create like you know like a little pattern so I

487
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,740
guess and then there's like backgrounds you can buy of course that you can then kind of mix and

488
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,820
match some of the badges to kind of get these full-on like Zelda themes or other like retro

489
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:08,300
Mario Brothers or even Splatoon and some of the other newer Nintendo stuff and some of the crane

490
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,860
games are different too because like there's like a hammer one where instead of a crane like a hammer

491
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,660
will come down and go thwunk and it'll knock all the badges hopefully into the chute like if you

492
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,580
time it right and then I saw one today that was like a bomb or something where you drop a bomb

493
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:28,140
and the bomb explodes it makes the badges go everywhere so but here's the thing um you have

494
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:37,500
to pay one dollar for five plays on a machine now every day you can do a practice machine one time

495
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:44,380
and the practice machine if you do well will get you anywhere between one and like five free plays

496
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:49,580
and I think you know usually the bunny will just end up giving you one free play a day anyway so

497
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:55,180
usually end up with like two to five free plays a day but I gotta say I don't know I think it's

498
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,980
kind of shady the fact that they're selling the plays for a dollar and you're not even

499
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:05,220
necessarily guaranteed to get anything out of it and it's kind of like the prizes I don't think

500
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:11,300
the badges are that exciting like big deal so you can decorate your home screen with sprites I just

501
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,340
I don't get it and I just I don't know so I've been kind of lazily checking it once a day the

502
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,660
past few days just to kind of see like oh what can I get for free out of two plays but then it's

503
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,740
like I win stuff and it's like great things I don't really want to use because I have this

504
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:33,220
awesome NES remix theme on my DS and it's like I'll just stick with that it's fine the other

505
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,140
thing I just thought was interesting about the whole badge arcade is that when you when you log

506
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,020
in for the first time in a day the bunny will start telling you about the featured game and

507
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:48,140
it's like a fucking commercial it's like did you know it's the 30th anniversary of Super Mario

508
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:53,060
Brothers and did you know there's this game called Mario maker that's out right now and look at all

509
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,860
these cool things you can do a Mario maker and right now we have these crane games to celebrate

510
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:03,800
Mario maker so you should check out Mario maker it's available in the Wii U eShop right now tell

511
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:11,140
me have you played Mario maker and it's like oh my god bunny die like just leave me alone it's it's

512
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:18,180
like you have to sit through this commercial to get one free play where you might win a Zelda

513
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:23,820
badge but you're not gonna get link or Zelda from the crane your first go you're gonna get like one

514
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,460
of the shitty little rocks that you can push to maybe see a staircase under like if you want to

515
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,420
actually have enough place where maybe you can pluck the link badge for your profile give me a

516
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:41,340
dollar it's just I don't know it's a little bit ridiculous and I don't like it I get that this

517
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:48,500
might be like a mobile phone thing or maybe bigger in Japan or whatever but I still don't like it so

518
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:56,580
that's all I have to say about that why why are in chat at live.vognetwork.com has some comments

519
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:02,300
on this saying I've been playing this on my Japanese 3ds for ages the crane physics are

520
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,500
pretty realistic if you buy two dollars in plays on the same day you get a theme that matches the

521
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:13,740
badges you're playing for if you're into themes it could be a good deal and he says something sales

522
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:19,900
bunny overdrive sales bunnies my man my homie my wife but he's got no place in ingress thug life

523
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:26,140
I have no idea what that means if you read up higher he was doing like a little oh was he right

524
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:32,980
sorry that's I'm doing I'm reading is ingress like smashing your portals we don't give a fuck

525
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,900
yo batter he's whacked dead phone out of luck do any of those guys as they drive up and blast your

526
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,420
portal they like blasting music from there no they're not blessed see that would be more

527
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:44,900
interesting then they're just driving by saying well you think because you think you know they're

528
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:49,420
not gonna be blasting like rap music or even country music they'll be blasting like the

529
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:54,940
soundtrack to Tron or something you would think I don't know at least maybe that's just me that's

530
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:00,860
how I roll I don't know all right let's see dungeon buster and chat says well if it helps

531
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:09,780
there aren't any bunnies in fallout 4 not even mutated once there it is all right that's gonna

532
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:17,220
do it for our gaming weeks as far as housekeeping goes we don't have a whole lot to say except that

533
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:22,140
we actually we won't have a show over Thanksgiving week so I know that's two shows gone in November

534
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,580
so I'm sorry guys but the last one wasn't planned but as far as the holiday weekend goes the show on

535
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,780
the 29th wouldn't really surprise me a lot of you guys are gonna be out of town and doing other

536
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:36,580
stuff anyway so we won't be here in two weeks but we will be here next week of course for episode

537
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:42,220
number 622 and then we should be here through most of the holiday period I didn't look to see

538
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:48,180
what days this year the holidays were on what day are the big ones on the towards the end of

539
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,700
the week but it's not the weekend looks like Christmas and New Year's Day are both Fridays

540
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:57,620
this year so there you go and dark soccer what do you do you have services for Hanukkah on any

541
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:03,220
Sundays no why would they be on Sunday I don't know it's on Friday right that's Shabbat yeah so

542
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,580
just checking next year it's supposed to be on Sunday I think or Saturday Sunday is it yeah

543
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:16,340
it's it's my synagogue usual do either like a first night or last night service or do like a

544
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:23,420
Shabbat service for Hanukkah um if I can make it out there I'll of course I'll be going but well

545
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:29,420
actually and actually now that I'm thinking about this we probably won't be here on December I think

546
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:37,460
it's 14th because dark soccer and I are gonna be a gamer X in San Jose which vog network is a little

547
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,500
little sponsor of we're actually gonna have a table at the show I actually filled out a little

548
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,340
forum I didn't talk to you about that they're sorry you talked to that off-air but we December

549
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:51,420
13th it's funny I'm gonna be bringing my menorah with me oh is it during Hanukkah it's during

550
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:57,940
Hanukkah how funny so they um but I might try to find a little do they have dreidel drinking games

551
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,700
or is that like we could come up with that cuz I'm totally down for a dreidel drinking game if

552
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:08,500
that's not like offensive or whatever it's just jam it's just gambling it's all it is I'll teach

553
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,860
everyone how to play the dreidel game and we'll play with you know pills can we play for like

554
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:18,580
y'all flavored shots oh my gosh well guilt chocolate well chocolate shots will bring it will bring guilt

555
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:24,420
all right and then like the winner gets like I don't actually if you play for shots I'd be fine

556
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,940
but then when you have to put that put your your guilt back then what do you do throw up just put

557
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:36,500
the glass back I don't know we'll figure something maybe someone gets a double shot I don't know

558
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:42,380
dreidel drinking games coming I'm gonna look this up yeah Hanukkah ends on the 14th or GX as they

559
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:47,580
they call it because of course everybody games and you know I have that Thursday through Monday

560
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:52,500

561
00:38:52,500 --> 00:39:00,420
got a sweet yo we're gonna party by the way I have to say so so I am I talked to Victoria about

562
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:06,380
doing the lady Ness mm-hmm so she's gonna help me with a circle skirt oh nice and I've ordered

563
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:11,980
a blue and white striped shirt and I'm gonna dye it yellow huh the blue is Navy blue so it shouldn't

564
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:18,740
turn green mm-hmm so and it's a like a scoop neck shirt so I'm gonna do lady Ness nice so you're

565
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,420
gonna be a cosplay queen that weekend it's gonna be the casual cosplay because sometimes somebody

566
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:28,060
you know one can get tired wearing you know gray warden armor and that shits heavy even for being

567
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:34,140
made out of felt so all right so there you go so we will be there in San Jose so probably not gonna

568
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,060
have a show that weekend I know Loki can't make it out because it's hard to get him away for a

569
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:45,940
whole weekend but we probably just if I want to like keep my life you know that's we realistically

570
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,620
just wouldn't be able to probably be back in time on Sunday because things will probably be closing

571
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,220
down Sunday afternoon I don't know we'll let you know a little closer to the day it's just a maybe

572
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,500
on us not being here that weekend cuz I seem to remember last year we were kind of out of there

573
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:06,740
by noon on Sunday I would say is that again December 13 13th yeah you're like I'm not gonna

574
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:14,620
be here anyway no no no no I was just curious I couldn't remember when that that event was going

575
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:20,940
on in Oakland oh it's the same day same day yeah no I can't do the big Ingers stuff in in Oakland

576
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:28,020
because gamer X is the same weekend so it's fine what times your event uh oh god I don't know they

577
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,500
it's like four hours long I'm not gonna skip out gamer X to go do the Ingress event I'm sorry I

578
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:40,340
draw though I draw the gamer X is more important no I draw the line all right even do they're just

579
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:47,020
like hack a poorly it's everybody it's it's like you know the video of Pokemon go where everybody

580
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:52,100
was standing in Times Square trying to capture Mewtwo that's an Ingress thing it's just a bunch

581
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,020
of nerds all standing around historical sites looking at their phone pew pew battling back

582
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:01,580
and forth it's pretty much what it is what I've been told I have not been to one they had one here

583
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,340
in Sacramento and I couldn't even go because I was in the bay I think I was at another fucking

584
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,140
con that weekend or something it's just like there's always some convention getting away my

585
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:13,740
Ingers but that's alright that's alright gamer X is gonna be a ton of fun we're gonna be there with

586
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,740
the table I think dark soccer and I think the plan is we're gonna have some classic games for

587
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,660
you to come over and play that's right and then you can talk to us about vog because we'll be

588
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:29,580
there which reminds me I might get the okay to bring my we just got super ever drives nice so

589
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:34,380
I might be able to bring some I'll bring the retron for sure and that'll take care of most

590
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,820
of the classic stuff to bring you some of my Famicom cartridges oh and I forgot to mention I guess

591
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,780
this part of a game week I'll just mention this real quick this is more of a last week thing but

592
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:47,660
I went to um I went to the flea market here locally and I actually picked up for my retron

593
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,980
five that I bought a couple weeks ago because you know those things will play all that does

594
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,340
those retron fives they are just an emulator but what it does it dumps the cart and then instantly

595
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:04,940
emulates it so I actually bought blaster master on cartridge goonies to star tropics and blades

596
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:11,540
of steel so like I have an awesome collection I want to see ever drives work on the retron

597
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:17,540
bring lower that would be interesting fun so I'll probably bring the retron over to gamer X so we'll

598
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:26,060
have some classic gaming set up at the table do you vote like a non Apple laptop yeah I have my

599
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:32,420
old old it's kind of old but it works the point why I was curious what are you gonna do with it

600
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,780
I'm not doing anything with it you asked for a reason cuz you're plotting something by the way

601
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:43,380
I'm donating your old iBook g4 to the little Apple museum that's at my work great my old

602
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:50,820
computer ends up in a museum somewhere it's a tiny use litter great great dark stalker just

603
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:57,660
told me that something I once owned is going to be in a museum how does that make me feel age wise

604
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:10,620
it's gonna be a testament to technology all right anyhow let's get into this week in gaming news

605
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:17,220
we've got a lot going on in the gaming world so we'll start off with Loki yes so this is kind of

606
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:24,580
cool you know it's finally out of like their beta testing so now they have the first 104 titles that

607
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:31,260
are gonna be backwards compatible on the Xbox one for the Xbox 360 and quite a few titles most of

608
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:37,620
those you kind of played before as part of that beta test some more notable ones on there of

609
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:46,060
course you know like fable 2 you know the Gears of War series they've got let's see just cause 2

610
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:57,660
which is pretty awesome let's see some of the Tom Clancy games a lot of the XBLA games so those

611
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:03,580
are available on there I will tell you I powered up my xbox one this week to check this out I had

612
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:08,300
15 new games available to just get in my queue and download and I was actually playing quite a bit of

613
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,820
luminous today yeah luminous that would be good and then Borderlands the original Borderlands was

614
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:21,100
one of those castle crashers kind of cool crazy taxi get ready to make some crazy money see I

615
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:27,660
played some luminous this week original mass effect you can you can even still if you flagged DLC back

616
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,500
in the day it's a little tricky it took me a minute to figure this out because I tried to get

617
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,940
it through the game by going to download content but what you do is on your Xbox screen where you

618
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,940
have all your games you hit the not the start button but I guess it's where the start button

619
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,860
would be the menu button and there's an option in there to like manage the game and that's where

620
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:50,460
you can pull down all the DLC that you may have had on your 360 so that's how I was able to get

621
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,140
like heavenly star and like the Tokyo Club stuff that was in luminous because remember they it is

622
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:59,460
the DLC so you can still get that so that that was cool because I was expecting that it was just

623
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:05,580
gonna be the playing game because it was you know just pulling down what they could emulate but I

624
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:12,060
guess you can still actually get the DLC which is great intron evolution which is an okay game yeah

625
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:21,700
not bad yep and then yeah that's it so is there gonna be more in December or have they said when

626
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,380
we're getting more they're working on more there you know they're gonna include some more I guess

627
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:31,380
starting in regular updates are gonna start and eventually they're gonna include Halo Reach Halo

628
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:39,100
Wars Call of Duty Black Ops the Bioshock series and Skate 3 and they're saying all future games

629
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:46,460
with gold titles would also backwards compatible as well and yeah and I know a lot of people are

630
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:52,460
trying to get Red Dead Redemption as one of those title sets backwards compatible two words Lost

631
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:58,380
Odyssey I know it was a multi-disc game that's gonna make it harder but I don't care that has

632
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:03,620
to be one of them that give us Lost Odyssey there's anybody from Microsoft out there if I

633
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,380
still have that somewhere oh I know I've got to have it somewhere here if not I'll go rebuy I

634
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:16,260
don't think I yeah Lost Odyssey is like the it's it's it's such a good JRPG and I I just think it

635
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,700
was just overlooked because you know lol Japanese game on the 360 well it's like you know when you're

636
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,900
playing like Final Fantasy 13 and stuff or even there's like other Final Fantasy games and it's

637
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,060
like didn't quite feel like the old school Final Fantasy games as far as like turn-based and stuff

638
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:34,660
mm-hmm but Lost Odyssey felt like the old school Final Fantasy games yeah it did I would even take

639
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:40,900
blue dragon I know blue dragon had its shortcomings dark soccer was a fan of blue dragon though you

640
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:45,900
kind of stuck up for that I was also high on coding a lot it was right remember it was right

641
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,220
after I had hand surgery yeah blue dragon just kind of felt like a Super Nintendo RPG that was

642
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:57,060
like on a Xbox 360 it was fun yeah so no I liked it I I would I would revisit blue dragon if they

643
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,980
would they would make that backwards compatible but we'll see I'm sure a lot of people have their

644
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:07,140
demands but I just send your tweets to Microsoft that Lost Odyssey needs to be in there as bad as

645
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:13,260
Red Dead Redemption does so just except Ron was also another backwards compatible game was it I

646
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,460
don't you know what's funny I think I had the original Tron but I don't know if I ever bought

647
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:26,020
discs of Tron on 360 so anyway um let's move on to some Nintendo news Nintendo had a huge week this

648
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:31,340
week obviously had a lot of people talking about their direct that they did on November 12th this

649
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:37,300
was the first Nintendo direct since the true Iwata is passing so it opened of course with Reggie

650
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:43,460
Fils-Aime and they went into a lot of different news so let's just try to skim the surface of

651
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,260
what was covered I'm sure a lot of you guys have already heard about a lot of this so let's talk

652
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:55,060
about it Twilight Princess HD confirmed for Wii U complete with a wolf Zelda amiibo there I'm sorry

653
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:02,020
wolf shame on me wolf link for the Legend of Zelda amiibo that was announced as well that will do

654
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:07,180
what um I didn't catch exactly what it does I don't know that I think it's supposed to work with

655
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:13,980
the new Zelda game but aside from that what will that do who cares amiibo right it'll look nice

656
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,940
maybe it works in other games but I will say yeah Brad from pop culture in our chat at live

657
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:24,020
dot vog network com says that amiibo looks awesome and it does look awesome I mean it kind of doesn't

658
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:32,020
doesn't need to do anything it's just you know it looks awesome so they also talked about Pokemon

659
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:37,180
super mystery dungeon which will be out on the 20th of November which is a baumannii holiday for

660
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:43,900
those you old-school fans of the show let's see there's gonna be a new online portal for Super

661
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,980
Mario maker which I don't understand why they couldn't just build that into Mario maker that

662
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,300
is a little weird isn't it you know it's like you know hey little big planet had a way to search for

663
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:59,300
levels Mario maker no you have to go to an external web portal which makes me wonder once again why

664
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,340
don't they get online I mean if this new console that they're coming out with is supposed to be

665
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:09,740
really online centric and no one I have a disk drive everything that kind of scares me yeah the

666
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:15,820
free to start Pokemon p cross coming out in December so another Pokemon game on 3ds that's

667
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:23,060
free to start as a lot of them tend to be poke poke and tournament coming out on Wii U for spring

668
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:29,860
2016 there will be an amiibo card for shadow Mewtwo that will be released with that a game

669
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:37,660
looks weird I'll try it release date for Star Fox zero April 22nd is the release date for Star Fox

670
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:43,380
zero and I know a lot of people looking forward that Mario Luigi paper jam dated for January 22nd

671
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:49,660
2016 Final Fantasy explorers was shown and it will be launching in January with all of the Japanese

672
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:56,220
DLC included so that's pretty cool something to give to us for making us wait for the game

673
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:03,180
Mega Man legacy on the 3ds will be coming with a gold Mega Man amiibo because Loki loves amiibo

674
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:09,980
February the 23rd my mom's birthday February 23rd of 2016 I will buy my mother a gold Mega Man amiibo

675
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:14,100
for her birthday and she will love it what's this rom well this looks like crap did you spend your

676
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:21,580
money on this you should save it Pokemon red blue and yellow going to be coming to the 3ds as kind

677
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:32,420
of like a virtual console release Lucas the amiibo coming out on January 22nd Dragon Quest 7 and 8

678
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:38,860
are coming to the US in the summer of 2016 on the 3ds yay I was so excited when they announced this

679
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:43,900
especially like Dragon Quest 8 and I'm happy for the chance to be able to play 7 again so

680
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:49,260
yeah that was really exciting news I'm very happy about that dark soccer you Dragon Quest kind of

681
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:55,260
girl you know really you know I thought you were I'm gonna check that out 7 and 8 on the 3ds for

682
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:02,420
sure and this had a lot of people talking new character announced for Hyrule Warriors 3ds

683
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:11,900
linkle the female link concept art it got such a buzz when they released that before she is now a

684
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:17,660
canon character for Hyrule Warriors there's already been cosplay I know right I gotta say

685
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:23,020
for what it's worth lingo does look badass like you know I love the character look as well and I

686
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:29,220
love the fact that they kind of took a different approach and they gave her crossbows instead of a

687
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:34,900
sword and shield so that she could kind of exist but be different you know if that makes sense so

688
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:40,820
I don't really see her as a female link because she isn't really using the same weaponry she's

689
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:47,500
just you know a female protagonist that has a lot of linked traits but she's wielding crossbows so

690
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:53,340
I just think she's she's cool and her name sounds like tinkle yeah right but here's the question now

691
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:59,900
are they gonna make a game that stars lingo because I'd actually be all for that I want to

692
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,740
know more about this character so I'm all for a lingo game but then what's gonna be the plot is

693
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:13,900
she out to save princess or Prince Zordla I don't know who's the Zeldorf I don't know what's gonna

694
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:19,080
happen is there gonna be a prince that she has to save or or what's the plow the goal is what

695
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:24,540
Zelda cool Zelda cool Zefram Zefram that's a that's a male name that starts with Z it could be could

696
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:30,820
be Zach Zell the legend of Zell Oh wasn't Zell characters father's day right that wasn't that's

697
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:37,180
not a real name though Zelda and link are actually real names Oh speaking of Final Fantasy this was

698
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:43,300
kind of a big deal by the way this was the one where the internet just shit itself and that was

699
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:50,100
the announcement of cloud strife as a playable character in Super Smash Brothers I know it's

700
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:55,340
about time after all the Nintendo games he's been in it's about time that you know he gets some

701
00:52:55,340 --> 00:53:03,820
representation on I think it's fair to say nobody saw that coming that was quite the surprise hey

702
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,380
you know what in all seriousness props to the smash team for keeping that leak under wraps

703
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:13,340
because remember the right you thing got spoiled because it was in some of the data files so they

704
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:20,580
kept this one under wraps I can't wait to see Master Chief in smash net right let's let's think

705
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:25,580
what other Nintendo centric characters should be in smash next how about Lara Croft nice thing you

706
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:30,220
know when I think of Nintendo I think of Lara Croft who but see the thing is I I say that but

707
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:36,860
I'm like actually that would be a badass character for Smash Brothers oh my gosh huh I just realized

708
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:44,860
we've already had a male version of Zelda have we we've had chic I didn't think of that okay yeah

709
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:52,380
there you go are you thinking so what we're gonna get Sackboy next in smash how many more

710
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:56,820
characters do we have to add before it becomes PlayStation all-stars well we may find out when

711
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:02,580
there's a special broadcast next month for Super Smash Brothers Wii U seeing here we're all

712
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:06,140
thinking at least and I still think this that shovel knight would have been a sure thing with

713
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:11,500
the amount sure it's coming yeah it's too obvious so maybe it's just those two or maybe it'll be one

714
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:18,460
more who knows here's what I just want to Captain Rainbow so that was the Nintendo Direct and I'm

715
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,980
sure a lot of you have heard this news and all the joking aside about the cloud stuff and you know

716
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:28,900
wow it's kind of interesting that they chose a character from what was notably so the first

717
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:34,260
Final Fantasy game not initially released on a Nintendo platform wasn't it supposed to be like

718
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:38,380
you didn't like Final Fantasy 6 that they were supposed to be redoing or something like that

719
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:43,100
end up being that was just a tech demo that if you're thinking about the fantasy 6 Nintendo 64

720
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:48,980
thing that was just tech demo but anyway all that stuff aside here's the reality check though if

721
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:53,780
they had come and said that the character that was going to be in the game was going to be I

722
00:54:53,780 --> 00:55:00,700
don't know lock from Final Fantasy 6 is the game like it would not have had that same impact I

723
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:07,620
think it would have been like oh shit cool Final Fantasy character but like like Final Fantasy 7

724
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:13,660
or hate Final Fantasy 7 cloud is a fucking identifiable character that you just you know

725
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:20,100
him it is a little weird when you consider that you know that game actually was quite significant

726
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:27,660
in a non Nintendo kind of way but but all that aside you know what whatever Solid Snake ended up

727
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:33,740
being in a Smash Brothers game and you know I kind of associate that series more with Sony yes I'm

728
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:39,100
well aware of the GameCube game but come on that started as a Sony game here's where this gets

729
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:42,740
interesting though so you all I'm sure many of you listening to this show already knew about all

730
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:49,460
this Nintendo Direct stuff but here's where I kind of wanted to go with it is isn't it interesting

731
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:56,460
how much focus there was on Square Enix products in this Nintendo Direct think about it what are

732
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:03,180
the third party got that same type of frontage in this Nintendo Direct than Square Enix did well

733
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:08,060
the reason why I think is because a lot of times they do publishing for them like I think one of

734
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:14,780
the Dragon Quest games that came out recently was published by Nintendo instead of Square Enix for

735
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:20,700
when they brought it over here mm-hmm or like I know I there's some Square Enix games that were

736
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:26,780
published by Nintendo I know that but just saying there's the Final Fantasy explorers was in there

737
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:31,980
there was the Dragon Quest 7 and 8 was in there and now we have cloud and Smash Brothers which

738
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,900
is a pretty big deal that was a lot of Square maybe they're just not getting a lot of support

739
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:40,980
from other third parties well it's funny you mentioned that now does anyone else remember a

740
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:46,580
couple months ago on the show there was a rumor and it was one of those you know Tim Foil have

741
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:52,140
things there was a rumor that there is a third party party publisher that is getting in bed with

742
00:56:52,140 --> 00:57:00,700
Nintendo for NX in a big way that some third-party publisher is stepping up and will be providing a

743
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:07,300
huge chunk of content for the NX and I even remember at the time somebody had called out

744
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:12,860
the Square Enix was a likely candidate and now after watching this direct I'm like okay Square

745
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:18,460
Enix and Nintendo they fucking or something's going on here's why I would think that that would

746
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:23,060
be a good candidate because look it's out of all of these like third major third-party companies

747
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:30,020
that do publish on consoles which of them are really heavy in the mobile market you've got EA

748
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:34,740
which doesn't give a shit about Nintendo right now and you've got Square Enix even though they

749
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:39,460
were ironically trumpeted when the Wii U was released and let's not forget that the EA got

750
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:47,500
up on stage it was like we're gonna back the Wii U in a big way for 60 days yeah so but Square Enix

751
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:52,260
you know they're pretty have they have a pretty large mobile presence and this new platform is

752
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:57,380
kind of I don't know I think a lot of people are thinking mobile with that so maybe that's why

753
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:01,620
they're kind of jumping in on board of that because it's something that they're doing already

754
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:11,060
Tiger Claw in chat asking what if the Final Fantasy 7 remake comes out on the NX well that

755
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:19,460
would be awesome in 2018 or 2019 where the fuck that comes out yeah I mean did now I have to kind

756
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:25,180
of go back in time to the e3 press conference this year but did did Square announce that as

757
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:32,500
an exclusive for Sony cuz I'm not sure I mean and a lot of the square stuff that comes out

758
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:41,020
on PlayStation 4 like I don't know Final Fantasy 13 games or like Dragon Quest Heroes or or Final

759
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:48,660
Fantasy type 0 and Final Fantasy 15 they're on both Xbox one and PlayStation coming out

760
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:55,740
after they announce Gordon Freeman as the next character for smash hmm why are in chat says none

761
00:58:55,740 --> 00:59:00,100
of the square stuff announced in that presentation was exclusive at all and as the show under Matt

762
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:07,420
says I think they said you can play it first on PlayStation hmm who knows so game grew in chat

763
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,060
with another perspective on cloud and smash saying the whole thing about cloud strife is

764
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:16,660
that he is the protagonist of the best-selling JRPG ever that isn't Pokemon cloud is a pretty

765
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:21,820
iconic well-known character and I I definitely agree with game guru I mean we can talk all the

766
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:26,180
day about like Solid Snake last time I mean you know it wasn't really on Nintendo platform is

767
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:32,260
yeah old NES games at least there is some sort of tie and it's it's just more the fact that you

768
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:38,380
know if they had said it was going to be you know lock or I don't know see solar Rosa from

769
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:43,740
Final Fantasy 4 it would not I mean it would still been like a oh hey Wow cool type of mode

770
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:47,740
yeah I would have been like oh wow neat type of thing but I don't think it's gonna have nearly

771
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:54,660
that impact that cloud has it would have been interesting if it was a character like lightning

772
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:59,260
or something but I think maybe that's a little too new and so I think cloud is kind of that

773
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:05,820
perfect blend of like classic character but yeah it's it's interesting because you know cloud was

774
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:11,660
not really on a Nintendo console although of course in chat over at live dot vognet or dot

775
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:16,140
com why we are pointing out cloud has been on a Nintendo console before theater rhythm

776
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:23,620
that doesn't really count and are they gonna announce gex coming next is that gonna be the

777
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:28,660
next who know crash bandicoot will be the next anything's possible you know what though man

778
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:33,380
somebody made a great there was some some meme floating around out there I mean think about it

779
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:44,100
like somebody has made a game where you can have Mario link Pikachu mega man pac-man Sonic were you

780
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:53,580
and cloud all doing battle against each other like that this is like a huge game in gaming history

781
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:59,060
the fact that they're able to bring these different franchises into it is really nothing short of

782
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:04,060
amazing but also speaks you know really highly of Nintendo's ability to create a fighting game that

783
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:09,740
people really love one other thing I have to say that hasn't been said yet about the whole fact

784
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:16,700
that cloud is now gonna be in Smash Brothers so how about that cloud amiibo when's that coming

785
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:22,900
out cuz that's gonna be a thing right it's got to be it's got to be part of the agreement Ryu ones

786
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:29,300
coming out why not a cloud one so I'll be a show that amiibo or maybe I'm just thinking of two

787
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:34,700
different costs you probably saw like a fan wank thing but now it's gonna be a real deal there were

788
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,820
two different costumes but it's you know in in Smash each character has what six or seven

789
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:44,060
different outfits anyway so yeah but yeah they had cloud in the regular garb in the Final Fantasy

790
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:49,260
Advent Children garb for sure and who knows what other looks they'll have for cloud in the game

791
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:55,660
probably give us some different skins and so forth so why why are in chat says pre-order now up sorry

792
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:02,740
all gone Bobby Black Wolf saying cloud amiibo is a PAX exclusive better not I'd be so upset

793
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:07,820
all right I don't think there'll be a I don't think they'll be that crazy to make it exclusive

794
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:15,100
to evil gene exclusive ah yeah that that is the level of crazy that could definitely happen so

795
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:19,820
anyway very busy week for Nintendo and that direct and a lot of news this week to keep

796
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:28,500
Nintendo fans going into next year dark Sakura well and I like how the news is delivered on

797
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:38,860
this one get that phthalo blue ready Bob Ross you know we had the whole Bob Ross marathon on

798
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:46,500
twitch well looks like we're gonna have regular episodes of the joy of painting yay there is

799
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:52,660
going to be a Bob Ross channel every week twitch is going to show an entire season of the joy of

800
01:02:52,660 --> 01:03:01,820
painting on the Bob Ross channel and that's starting on I don't see the actual start it

801
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:06,500
already started okay it's on Mondays it was like last Monday the marathon is also gonna happen

802
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:11,420
again every October 29th oh where they're gonna show everything back to back to back yeah nice

803
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:17,180
so so you can beat the devil out of that brush along with Bob Ross for years to come no no he

804
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:20,980
doesn't be he just makes gentle stroke no he actually says I'm a beat the devil out of that

805
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:25,100
brush just beat the devil out of that brush when he hits it on his on the stand yeah that's one

806
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:31,940
thing but that's when everybody in chat goes devil equals wrecked I'm sorry but have some happy

807
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:36,380
little clouds and leave it at that look I probably had a lot of happy little clouds I

808
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:41,180
talked about this two weeks ago on the show and I you know continued to watch the Bob Ross marathon

809
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:45,340
quite a bit until its conclusion and I would probably talked about this more last week if

810
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:50,900
we'd had a show but that Bob Ross is my favorite thing to have ever happened on twitch like for

811
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,700
real it's it's almost one of my favorite things to have ever happened on the internet like the

812
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:59,260
chat room was actually it's like I can't believe I'm saying this about a twitch chat room was

813
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:04,460
actually a lot of fun to watch it's like your twitch plays Pokemon you know with all the crazy

814
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:09,220
shit coming out of that there was so much spam with a whole like up left down right that and all

815
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:13,420
this stuff but like the stuff that was going on with Bob Ross was really funny like you know

816
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:18,660
anytime he says you know oh let's go a little crazy with this painting then the chat room you

817
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:23,780
know oh shit he going crazy crazy mode activated done it and then like he'll he'll paint a tree

818
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:28,420
right in the middle of the painting and the whole chat room ruined ruined ruined ruined and then

819
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:33,580
he'll finally make it like he'll fit it into the painting and they'll go saved say clutch save

820
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:40,300
hype back about that ban him for cheating and also it's just holy our soccer's rolling her eyes so

821
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:46,300
hard over there it was really funny and like but I mean but in a respectful kind of funny we're

822
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:51,860
like we're laughing with him and not at him and there's a huge difference trust me and I just I

823
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:57,220
just think that I I really love how long is it gonna take me for the joke isn't funny anymore

824
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:04,900
I I don't know I think there's something about that particular series and just Bob Ross's

825
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:10,340
attitude and everything where I mean maybe there's only gonna be a hundred people watching the

826
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:15,940
marathon instead of like 60,000 or whatever was watching close it out but it's still probably

827
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:20,420
more people than are watching it on PBS at like Saturday at 3 in the morning or whenever they

828
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:24,540
air at these days yeah I wonder what they would do though if they had like a side-by-side stream

829
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:34,620
with William Alexander who is the Bob Ross's mentor oh the he's he did the magic of oil

830
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:40,660
painting and the art of Bill Alexander which was the precursor to the joy of painting and he was

831
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:48,140
this grumpy German man and he was so great to watch he was so hilarious well it's you know we

832
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:52,620
were talking at the beginning of the show Loki about how your kids are growing up on Minecraft

833
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:58,020
let's plays I think there were a ton of people like you know obviously I'm old enough to remember

834
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:02,180
Bob Ross when he was on TV early in the morning but I bet a lot of people that were watching the

835
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:07,820
marathon and having fun with it and everything were totally not aware of who he was in fact I

836
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:12,420
even seem to remember reading some blog posts about like people from the UK were watching it

837
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:16,860
you know they never had Bob Ross over there but they kind of got to see it and we're kind of like

838
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:21,820
you know this guy was pretty awesome and and got to you know see a lot through that so I just I

839
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:28,860
just think it wasn't I you know is it gonna work for every great PBS thing that's happened in the

840
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:38,540
past 20 years probably not mr. Rogers man that's gonna be crazy oh no there it is dungeon buster

841
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:43,940
and chat says Bob Ross beat the devil out of internet negativity mr. Rogers neighborhood was

842
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:48,420
gonna be fucking insane if they do that yeah but it has to how's that gonna I don't know it has to

843
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:54,700
tie into creative somehow we'll see so all right so dark soccer is sending me a YouTube that I guess

844
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:59,900
I'm gonna try to play here is it just right at the beginning of this yeah I think so was it not

845
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:18,980
Iron Chef is this somebody doing in my mind I remember this is Bob Ross's precursor and then

846
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:25,460
you when you actually looks newer the whole like little he died in 97 oh that's sad oh there you

847
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:30,860
go I thought someone was like making his voice up at first I know I throw my first product is

848
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:35,140
this one of those lame things or somebody does the voiceovers of the real is watching him as a

849
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:43,660
kid too sorry all right that's awesome anyway yeah I Bob Ross I'm glad that's gonna live on on

850
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:47,260
Mondays even if not as many people are watching it's still it's still out there for somebody to

851
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:51,820
enjoy for the first time so I love the message he gets out he puts out there to that he's just

852
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:55,940
like anybody can paint you can just you just go down to the store get this get yourself some

853
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:02,100
patella blue and anybody can paint I still feel like I can't paint but watching him like I feel

854
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:06,460
like I could if I wanted to so who knows all right let's move on with some more news back to some

855
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:14,060
other gaming stuff Loki so the Xbox ones doing pretty well they've seen a 81% growth over the

856
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:20,140
sales from last year and you know they said you know commenting on that the strength of the

857
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:27,740
greatest games lineup in Xbox history drove record Xbox live usage for October and made Xbox one the

858
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:35,500
best-selling console in the US with an 81% growth compared to October 2014 and you know I have to

859
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:42,900
agree they do have quite the lineup as far as first party tile goes Sony what the fuck I'm

860
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:48,620
coming out uncharted that's about it yeah they've got fucking halo forza you know all this shit

861
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:54,980
coming out so Microsoft have war Microsoft is definitely seeing the payoff from you know

862
01:08:54,980 --> 01:09:00,140
investing in these exclusive games you know and now they've got halo 5 and rise the tomb Raider

863
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,820
and you know some of the other stuff they've had this year sunset overdrive or a replay I mean you

864
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:07,660
have to admit they do have a pretty impressive lineup of exclusives so I think this is finally

865
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:13,100
getting some people on board yeah maybe other people like me too who are finally completing

866
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:18,820
the trifecta at home by picking up an Xbox one and now they have every you know next-gen console

867
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:23,500
I know not everybody's crazy gamer like me but I bet there's some like me out there that are

868
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:27,780
finally you know using these exclusives as a reason to pick up the Xbox one after all this

869
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:33,020
time and of course rise of the tomb Raider you know temporary exclusive well yeah but still

870
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,940
exclusive enough and I'm hearing really good things about the game I haven't played it myself

871
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:41,060
yet I hope to get around to it soon but I'm hearing a lot of great things about it people

872
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:49,940
on my Twitter that are playing it seem to really enjoy it so there you go um let's move on with

873
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:55,620
some more stories this one is definitely a controversy for Nintendo you know they've got

874
01:09:55,620 --> 01:10:00,580
a game coming out soon Xenoblade Chronicles X I'm definitely looking forward to this because

875
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:05,700
the last Xenoblade game was great and I'm sure it'll be a great JRPG on the Wii U however

876
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:14,260
controversy because the localization of the game here in the States for Xenoblade Chronicles X in

877
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:24,900
the character customization section the breast size customization slider has been removed they

878
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:33,580
just don't like tragedy you can no longer create gigantic boobies or you know if you're into the

879
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:38,940
itty-bitty titties you can you can't slide the slider all the way outside that to that side as

880
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:44,100
well no longer will you have customizable breasts my question is so where did they freeze the boobs

881
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:52,900
at do they all have the biggest level boobs that would be funny like why are you all upset we froze

882
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:59,060
it at the biggest level so fucking calm down bitches I don't know dark soccer are you upset

883
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:04,180
you cannot increase and decrease the size of the breasts on your characters in Xenoblade Chronicles

884
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:13,220
not upset by it but it's stupid yeah yeah hackers will find a way hackers gonna hack well I will

885
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:18,660
have my big breasts I will tell you this in Dragon Age Inquisition one of the mods out there for the

886
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:25,860
PC is a custom body shapes rather than just the cookie cutter that they put out so

887
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:32,900
anything's possible well the good news is the rest of the game appears to be largely unchanged

888
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:38,860
unchanged so that is this the one thing that they've changed something about a swimsuit as

889
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:43,660
well considering the age of the characters probably not such a bad change they made in

890
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:47,540
that case so which is weird because you know those types of swimsuits are sold to those

891
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:52,620
age of children even though we feel that's inappropriate but you know let's not represent

892
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,540
that in the game either all right let's move on before we get to some release dates dark

893
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:06,940
Sakura well I'm the creator of Eve online CCP games has raised 30 million dollars in investments

894
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:17,500
to create content for virtual reality games they've got the money set aside they're also

895
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:23,740
going to continue to develop and promote Eve Valkyrie which is going to launch for oculus

896
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:31,900
rift in 2016 and PlayStation VR for the first half of 2016 and gunjack that will be on Samsung's

897
01:12:31,900 --> 01:12:39,540
Samsung's gear VR so it looks like they're really pushing it a quote here saying is that we believe

898
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:45,460
VR will revolutionize revolutionized not just video games with the wider technology and media

899
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:55,220
industry as a whole so cool I won't be doing any of it or else I'll throw up on everyone do you

900
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:59,060
think there might be a way that they can make this more accessible for somebody like you nope

901
01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:04,820
no it's gonna be too much no matter what probably what if it was a lower frame rate or would that

902
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:10,060
doesn't matter I think it's actually worse if it's a lower frame rate have you heard my stories

903
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:17,580
of Goldeneye no I know I know what if it was still a third-person experience but it was just

904
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:23,860
that the glasses allowed you to look at it everywhere no they try and they normally try by

905
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:27,820
like having something that doesn't move like in the center of the screen so that you can kind of

906
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:32,900
focus on something yeah yeah if I have like like an overlay sensor or something like if you were

907
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:39,780
like the shot crosshair yeah like a not even just that because I mean I can have a crosshair in the

908
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:45,100
middle of I mean there was one in Goldeneye and I still got sick I need something bigger to focus

909
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:52,060
on but I don't know I think I would just be sick no matter what hmm do you think you'll try it just

910
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:58,660
see or I will if you have a bucket handy this sounds like something it needs to be on YouTube

911
01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:06,260
the bucket challenge all right that's gonna be a little bit different than ALS all right let's

934
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:54,780
release new games that we know they don't give me they don't usually yeah they don't typically do

935
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:58,820
that the only one time that I've seen an exception for that was back when the original rock band came

936
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:04,740
out that was on like November 20th or something hmm all right well let's go over to Japan where

special price reduction in Japan as well and then there's a Monster Hunter Frontier g9 premium

945
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:01,060

01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:10,220
but does Butsu no Mori amiibo festival is out in Japan this week as well so that is out on the

950
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:39,260
comes out in regular and limited edition bad Apple Wars also released on the Vita I don't think that

951
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:44,900
has anything to do with you know the makers of the iPhone and the iWatch in fact this looks to

952
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:53,620
be based more often anime series so watch bad Apple Wars and lastly on the 3ds this week Mina

963
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:24,140

964
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:33,380
tempted to purchase that and I'll have to check it out all right one more story for you guys on

965
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:42,260
Dragon Quest Heroes Dragon Quest Heroes apparently was confirmed for the PC there was a message on

966
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:47,420
Steam that showed that Dragon Quest Heroes will be coming out on the PC so for whatever reason you

967
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:52,940
didn't pick this up on PlayStation 4 Xbox one it was when it was released recently you can pre

968
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:58,180
purchase the game if you want so but the interesting thing is I guess when this was

969
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:03,020
first spotted they tried to click on it and nothing was seen so maybe this ad went up early

970
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:07,540
I don't know just a quick warning huh you know as much as Dragon Quest Heroes is probably an

971
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:15,260
awesome game uh-huh Tecmo koi this really really really shitty PC ports yeah so just consider that

972
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:19,940
before you consider yourself warning that all right fair enough maybe maybe wait for somebody

973
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:26,700
else to buy it I mean watch you know total biscuit talk about some of the PC ports of that or I saw

974
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:32,380
like Jim Sterling talked about and he's a huge fan of like the you know dragon well the different

975
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:39,860
samurai warrior series or Dicey warriors and their PC ports are fucking terrible yeah all

976
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:46,060
right well we'll keep an eye on it then and we'll see to register participation for this week's

977
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:52,140
episode of orange under 80 with vog network.com use the passphrase smoke all right well let's get

978
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:57,420
to it we're gonna take a step back we're gonna go back to a time when you couldn't really go to

979
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:02,940
YouTube to express your opinions on games because it didn't exist you could maybe write a letter to

980
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:09,220
a magazine the classic game of the week the chance for us to step into dark soccer's gaming vault and

981
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:14,420
find a game that she thinks hey I wish I had this one you should check this out so dark soccer

982
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:20,300
picky one she doesn't actually have in the vault I wish I had it she did here is the classic game

983
01:22:20,300 --> 01:22:29,260
of the week this game is Musha which in Japan was an as Musha a last full metal fighter Eleanor and

984
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:37,420
it came out in 1990 it was a vertical scrolling shooter that was done by compile for the Genesis

985
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:44,700
or Mega Drive as it was known and it was published by toa plan in Japan and by seismic in North

986
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:53,860
America it is one of the a left series of one of the games in the LS series so Dan's asking me

987
01:22:53,860 --> 01:23:05,900
if I fed the cat no oh I just replied on my Apple watch so I didn't have to pull out my phone Musha

988
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:12,900
yes anyway so basically it's just an amazing little shooter I thought that the inch the

989
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:19,020
intros on it had some very interesting graphical things they did like from the reflection of the

990
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:25,980
bat of the scenery on the the pilots visor and everything it did some really neat stuff music

991
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:35,060
was pretty great to you anyway you play as one of the Mecca in the series and you go through and

992
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:40,660
obtain power powerups called P chips and you can make your Mecca change color and get sub weapons

993
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:50,740
and they can also act as a shield if it gets hit then you lose the weapon then you get the Mecca

994
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:59,060
gets damaged so your sub weapons will include an energy shield a beam weapon a beam cannon and

995
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:05,780
missiles so you can also get helper drones that have these customizable attack modes you can get

996
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:12,820
up to two during combat and when one is destroyed anyone appears if you've got any saved in reserve

997
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:23,140
so you can save up your drones there so anyway the game is actually considered one of the best

998
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:30,660
I'd say shooter games that came out during that era it has been re-released on virtual console and

999
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:38,100
the original copy if you can get the others put this way an unboxed North American copy of this

1000
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:49,900
just the loose game easily can go past 200 plus on eBay so it is really really difficult to get

1001
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:58,500
your hands on one if you've got it give it to me but I mean even after I just love your demand

1002
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:03,860
there if you own this give it to me now we're looking at the game 25 years later is still

1003
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:10,660
considered one of the top 10 classic shooters of all time and the best that compile has ever done

1004
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:16,300
I think it does look pretty great and I'm even saying that the shooting segments of this keep in

1005
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:21,700
mind compile also did the Guardian legend and the shooting aspects in this I think are far better

1006
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:27,100
than the Guardian legend I will go on record saying that although the Guardian legend overall

1007
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:35,300
still a game I would better play so it's also I'd say to me one of the the best mega drive games

1008
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:41,940
that ever came out in the 90s so there you go that's all I can say about it all right there

1009
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:49,420
it is your classic game of the week MUSHA even if someone wanted to send me a Japanese copy I

1010
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:54,700
wouldn't say no that way even if somebody wanted to send me a dollar I wouldn't say no to that

1011
01:25:54,700 --> 01:26:00,740
God someone sent me a dollar before I didn't tell you that really well back when Loki made my intro

1012
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:06,260
for pump up the volume mm-hmm it said like give her a dollar yeah someone sent me a dollar nice

1013
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:11,180
so are you one of those people that takes your first dollar and frames it and put it on the wall

1014
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:17,740
I don't know about a soda there you go you spent that dollar I spent it I was poor there it is your

1015
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:22,620
classic game of the week we are gonna take a quick break but don't go anywhere we'll be right back

1016
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:27,380
one thing about Muscha the reason why it's an acronym for the u.s. one is because it was called

1017
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:35,020
metallic uniframe super hybrid armor okay oh that's that's what she stands for yes for the

1018
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:40,220
u.s. right there it is all right we're gonna take a break when we come back with more of orange

1019
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:43,820
lounge radio some rapid-fire news the frugal question of the week we got some emails to catch

01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:09,980
everybody to orange lounge radio live tonight with episode number 621 November the 15th of 2015

1023
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:15,660
after an unexpected week off last week due to a sickness sorry about that if you're just joining

1024
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:20,060
us live at the voice of East Network a vog network.com we recapped a little bit of what

1025
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,940
did go on in the world of gaming last week and talked about some of the big news from this week

1026
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:30,660
like the you know the OMG cloud is going to be in Smash Brothers and all that stuff we were talking

1027
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:37,380
about there so we're gonna get into some rapid-fire news now I think is a good time so we'll start off

1028
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:44,460
with Loki all right so let's talk a little bit about roller coaster tycoon now not necessarily

1029
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:50,500
a game I'm too excited about but it looks pretty cool and unfortunately you're gonna have to wait

1030
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:54,180
a little bit longer to get it because like most games that are coming out or we're supposed to

1031
01:27:54,180 --> 01:28:02,540
come out this year it has been pushed out of 2015 to 2016 and no actual date has been given yet but

1032
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:10,260
we expect it next year because it ain't coming out this year mech warrior online is going to be

1033
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:17,980
coming to steam starting December and this is the next project that they were working on after the

1034
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:27,740
shadowrun game and you can expect this on December 10th so that looks pretty awesome I am a huge mech

1035
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:34,140
warrior fan or at least I used to be so kind of want to check that out finally I'm not surprised

1036
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:40,860
at the least about this but dead or live extreme 3 is getting a collector's edition and what would

1037
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:48,340
be most apt for that game but of course booby mouse pads and that's what you can expect when

1038
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:53,460
you get the dead or live extreme 3 fortune collector's edition for PlayStation 4 it's

1039
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:58,580
gonna come with playing cards featuring the characters in there a sexy photo book

1040
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:08,740
and 3d mouse pad featuring Mary Rose but what Alan yelled from the other room it's classier

1041
01:29:08,740 --> 01:29:18,140
than Kleenex and lotion much classier all right you're gonna get some booby mouse pads no I don't

1042
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:24,180
even know if this game is coming out here yet so probably not I don't know if we can't get slider

1043
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:29,180
bars in Xenoblade then maybe not I don't know and it's it's like you know yeah it's kind of cool to

1044
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:32,940
see like boobs in video games but the game doesn't really have a lot of content to it I just don't

1045
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:38,620
feel like playing like beach volleyball and yeah you don't enjoy the Barbie modes no not really

1046
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:44,740
all right well moving on to something a little more serious but still a lot of tongue-in-cheek

1047
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:49,540
fun because it's about one of the worst video games ever made the desert bus for

1048
01:29:49,540 --> 01:30:01,900
hope campaign is underway desert bus 9 just started oh yeah so is are they involved because

1049
01:30:01,900 --> 01:30:06,460
I know they've dropped in pretty much every year at some point made a cameo yeah that's

1050
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:12,460
fun so cuz you know the game the desert bus the game itself is not desert bus there was like a

1051
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:18,900
Penn and Teller like collection that's it smoke and mirrors that was gonna come out and actually

1052
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:25,260
never did so technically this game actually didn't come out something like that or like commentary on

1053
01:30:25,260 --> 01:30:30,860
the censorship because remember how that was like huge in the late 90s yeah so anyway it's it's

1054
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:37,260
interesting that you know this group desert bus for hope has turned this game into a you know

1055
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:43,180
yearly this annual event where they raise quite a bit of money for child's play last year 2.4

1056
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:48,820
million oh no I'm sorry cumulatively over the years 2.4 million that's still no small chunk

1057
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:54,300
of change and last year they went for a hundred and fifty eight hours that's darn near a full

1058
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:59,540
week probably will top it this year I imagine so we'll see and then if you think it next year will

1059
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:07,100
be ten years of this game that's great for charity though so there it is desert bus 9 underway so you

1060
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:13,460
can check that out I think it's think it's desert bus org is the website do you know the website

1061
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:19,460
offhand our soccer you're looking at this it is desert bus org there it is you look at the space

1062
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:26,940
jam website like the movie it still exists is your mic on dark soccer I think we haven't been

1063
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:33,940
hearing you there you go oh my god okay nobody in chat said anything about that whatever right now

1064
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:40,140
the space jam website still exists I was I have never seen that movie all the way through and I

1065
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:46,180
don't even know I was reading about it but it was hmm I'm sorry I got completely distracted

1066
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:51,820
by space jam that's fine was there any reason to shut it down who knows right mm-hmm guys you know

1067
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:56,940
says I thought she was in the kitchen no Alan is in the kitchen not dark soccer dark soccer's at

1068
01:31:56,940 --> 01:32:05,220
a computer all right anyhow let's talk about moogles moogles in Final Fantasy 15 I mean duh

1069
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:10,620
of course moogles are going to be in Final Fantasy 15 but I guess a Twitter poll went out where

1070
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:16,460
people were asked do you want to see Final Fantasy 15 have moogles in the game and of course yes

1071
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:23,620
overweight no and according to the game's director it'll be a fun little incorporation and it won't

1072
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:27,700
be very chatty or anything so it sounds like it's gonna be more of a reference than a full-on like

1073
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:32,300
it'll be a fun incorporation they run across the street as your car hits them like a raccoon and

1074
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:38,940
they just fly off the windshield oh that's sad Kupo don't say that all right let's see let's

1075
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:45,020
talk about that game Yuka Lele I don't know how many of you guys kick-started that game but you

1076
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:51,540
can look forward to a new retro inspired character that has been added to the game rextro 64 us

1077
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:59,340
okay is a pretty great name rextro 64 us is a new character that's set to appear in the game

1078
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:06,180
it was designed by Mark Stevenson and is resembles what you would see in most 90s 3d platformers a

1079
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:12,220
very blocky polygonal scan lined body there he is the guardian of the arcade machines that are

1080
01:33:12,220 --> 01:33:17,180
hidden in the level each world has at least one arcade machine and if you complete the retro

1081
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:24,100
challenge you get another pagey so there you go retro rextro I keep want to say retro 64 us

1082
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:34,940
it's rextro 64 us a new character in Yuka Lele dark Sakura well um Metal Gear online is getting

1083
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:44,860
what I would say has should have always existed in every game ever cat hats oh my god that pictures

1084
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:54,020
hilarious yeah they are getting cats on their heads like what we used to get on the private

1085
01:33:54,020 --> 01:34:04,460
servers for Ragnarok online it's pretty funny also mother 3 is gonna be coming out on Wii U

1086
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:13,060
Virtual Console but only in Japan which sucks because I really want to play it and then maybe

1087
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:20,300
they'll release it here when they release the Lucas amiibo maybe we can dream and now this is

1088
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:31,260
something that I think is pretty scary here in the US is that basically the best spy we have the

1089
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:42,740
best I'd say entity infringing on privacy is the US government they were supposed to have disband

1090
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:52,500
replaced their surveillance program and did not and so this is now getting a lot of international

1091
01:34:52,500 --> 01:35:01,540
ire and what this means at least as far as gaming goes is that they also pull up personal data

1092
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:11,300
internet transmission sometimes that even applies to your games so just saying all your sexting

1093
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:16,540
that you do in the World of Warcraft I can see it listening to you call other people bitches

1094
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:23,980
well yes somebody needs to hold Sam's looking at your dick pics okay keep it in your pants

1095
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:39,980
all right let's get to the frugal question of the week you should be our friend if you're not

1096
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:44,340
our friend why aren't you our friend you've been listening to this show for almost two hours now

1097
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:49,420
and you're still not our friend I don't understand so you can officially be our friend over on

1098
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:56,340
Facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio is where you can be our friend what Facebook not

1099
01:35:56,340 --> 01:36:01,300
good enough for you are you more of a Google person that's fine we're on Google Plus as well

1100
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:07,220
google.com slash plus orange lounge radio and every week we ask a question of our Facebook

1101
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:13,340
and Google Plus communities when you slam those words together you get boogal well this week we

1102
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:20,540
asked about the topic announced that cloud for Final Fantasy 7 this week would be joining the

1103
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:25,820
roster for Super Smash Brothers only you and 3ds and of course this leads to discussion that this

1104
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:31,660
character was an interesting choice because Final Fantasy 7 of course is the first Final Fantasy

1105
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:37,380
game to not release on a Nintendo console that being said do you think cloud was the best

1106
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:42,900
character to represent the Final Fantasy series if yes why if no what character do you think would

1107
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:48,220
have been a better selection represented the gamers everywhere so let's start with Andy are

1108
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:52,660
who replied over on Facebook say in terms of representing Final Fantasy it was probably a

1109
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:58,860
good choice but in terms of celebrating all things Nintendo it's a very poor choice I feel like Smash

1110
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:04,300
is more about celebrating Nintendo so that should override representing Final Fantasy Square

1111
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:08,900
Nintendo should have gone with something more associated with Nintendo someone from a Final

1112
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:14,380
Fantasy that was on Nintendo system or another of their games dark Tetsuya says I would have

1113
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:19,260
definitely nominated somebody from Final Fantasy 6 even though the only 3d models of them I can

1114
01:37:19,260 --> 01:37:25,060
think of were from that old n64 demo from years ago lock Celeste or Tara would have been my

1115
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:31,780
choices degenerate Johnny says personally I would have thought that a moogle or black mage you know

1116
01:37:31,780 --> 01:37:36,060
something a little more generic would have been more fitting for a Nintendo game also because

1117
01:37:36,060 --> 01:37:40,300
there were final fancy characters featured on Nintendo consoles however Nintendo is known to

1118
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:44,900
utilize non Nintendo characters and Smash Brothers from game series they used to be on their consoles

1119
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:50,740
for example solid snake instead of big boss so why why not use cloud as far as mainstream is

1120
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:57,780
concerned he's the face of Final Fantasy I also thought of the moogle thing where why didn't they

1121
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:03,300
just maybe use something like super generic like that from the series or a chocobo or something

1122
01:38:03,300 --> 01:38:09,220
then you know I do get the cloud thing but I am surprised they didn't just use a moogle

1123
01:38:09,220 --> 01:38:15,300
entertainment over on Google Plus says cloud is the most recognizable character from the

1124
01:38:15,300 --> 01:38:20,580
Final Fantasy series and his giant Buster sword would be an interesting thing to wield in any

1125
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:25,980
fighting game however part of me wants to see more female characters and all of the things so

1126
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:32,220
I would have included either Yuna from Final Fantasy 10 Tifa from Final Fantasy 7 or Fran from

1127
01:38:32,220 --> 01:38:39,020
Final Fantasy 12 yes to Fran for sure but and technically I was the Final Fantasy 12 game on

1128
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:43,980
the 3ds well I guess that's true that's a good that's a good reason to have Fran in the game

1129
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:49,340
and I love Fran but you know the thing about Fran is that whenever I think of Fran I think of

1130
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:54,180
both the air and Fran and that goes I can't think about the air without thinking of Fran as well

1131
01:38:54,180 --> 01:39:00,580
like they're just they're just a wonderful twosome from that series so yeah I just I couldn't have

1132
01:39:00,580 --> 01:39:07,140
one without the other maybe could be like ice climbers where you would control both so there

1133
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:12,660
you go Kai's you know in our chat room over at live.vog network.com agrees with Tifa I want Tifa

1134
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:18,580
she'd kick ass and also I agree with the female characters well that begs the question where's

1135
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:23,300
Linkle cuz can I go back and change my vote cuz I want Linkle and Smash Brothers now at this point

1136
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:27,700
I think it's just a matter of time it's just a matter of time maybe I don't supposedly this is

1137
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:32,020
it the December thing we're gonna hear about this is it that's it for Smash Brothers done no more

1138
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:38,260
they're gonna move on to something else Smash Brothers for the NX probably after this we'll

1139
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:43,100
see but I can't imagine that that won't be a thing so all right there it is thank you guys for

1140
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:49,220
answering the food goal question of the week appreciate that we'll ask another question next

1141
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:53,140
Sunday that usually goes up during the day at some point in the afternoon or the morning whenever I

1142
01:39:53,140 --> 01:40:00,100
begin working on the show all right let's get back into some other news Loki all right so there was

1143
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:05,900
apparently a game that was gonna be made for Jurassic World and I'm talking aside from the

1144
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:13,060
Lego game that they had it was being worked on by a cryptic studios Seattle location but it was

1145
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:19,780
shut down unfortunately by the owner perfect world and now footage of that is coming out from demo

1146
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:26,100
reels from some of the people that worked on the game and so now they have like some you know there

1147
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:32,060
was some footage on YouTube which of course taken down already they had some images of like the t-rex

1148
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:38,540
as well as a character that looks pretty similar to Christopher Pratt's character so I don't know I

1149
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:46,700
not sure if I'd be that excited about that game I mean the movie's okay but I don't see them doing

1150
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:53,420
like a huge game with that I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like a big online game or what the

1151
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:58,540
case would be they said it was described as like an open-world game and that it was gonna be headed

1152
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:08,500
to PC and current gen consoles and it was a triple-a MMOG so too bad when that in that movie ended up

1153
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:14,380
being so freakin huge it's like one of the biggest movies they've ever put out and could have had

1154
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:18,580
this huge game behind it but I guess they had the Lego game so that's something you know a game what

1155
01:41:18,580 --> 01:41:24,180
I don't think was that great but and now that well don't and then they also have some of the

1156
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:29,420
characters in Lego dimensions yes that'd be cool yeah there is that so I don't think there's a

1157
01:41:29,420 --> 01:41:36,180
whole world or anything like that though so some clarity on Nintendo's smartphone games some folks

1158
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:40,140
wondering how much is it gonna cost to play Nintendo's new smartphone games and guess what

1159
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:48,380
in a financial dealing with DNA this week it has been mentioned that they will be free at least to

1160
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:54,860
start but you can you can guarantee that there will be plenty of transactions within the game to

1161
01:41:54,860 --> 01:42:01,020
help get your money there that was confirmed in an earnings briefing that was attended by the Wall

1162
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:08,220
Street Journal the CEO of DNA Isao Moriasu said games currently in the pipeline are all free to

1163
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:14,700
play there are five smartphone games being planned to launch before 2017 and we talked in a prior

1164
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:20,380
week about me Tomo which was revealed previously that was supposed to be this year but it's been

1165
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:27,660
delayed to March 2016 remember not included in this is Pokemon go and I know a lot of people

1166
01:42:27,660 --> 01:42:32,740
looking forward to that but that is a Nintendo adjacent thing but technically the Pokemon company

1167
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:38,380
is a separate company they are working with Niantic which Ingress which looking I've talked

1168
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:43,940
a lot about they're already involved with remember that is all separate from this so Pokemon go does

1169
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:50,100
not count as one of the five so anyway in that original briefing though Nintendo said other

1170
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:55,900
games might be paid a download but it seems like DNA clarifying that that is not the case at least

1171
01:42:55,900 --> 01:43:03,540
for whatever is planned right now so there you go certainly no new information on what those other

1172
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:09,380
games could possibly be at this point but we'll see I'm very curious to see if there's a you know

1173
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:15,780
Zelda esque type of game or Mario if they go full throttle on that or if they kind of stay with

1174
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:21,500
things that are more on the outside more like the advance wars the Pikmin you know things that are

1175
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,500
like they're definitely Nintendo properties but they're kind of on the outside maybe a splatoon

1176
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:31,300
finger paint wouldn't that be funny you can you can finger paint on your touch touch screen or

1177
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:36,020
something who knows I guess anything's possible we won't know until next year for sure Dark

1178
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:48,220
Saga well as I had mentioned two weeks ago we had the South by Southwest overcoming harassment

1179
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:56,540
and games discussion this has actually been expanded it was it had been canceled before

1180
01:43:56,540 --> 01:44:01,420
because of online threats and they decided to bring it back because it needs to be done so

1181
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:08,420
they've added nine additional speakers now which include Susan Benesch of the dangerous speech

1182
01:44:08,420 --> 01:44:18,220
product Alan Barr David the founder of red button Michelle Dennedy the vice president chief privacy

1183
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:25,260
officer at Cisco so they've got some big names on here but also save point that had been canceled

1184
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:31,900
before say point a discussion on the gaming community will take place Tuesday May 15th so

1185
01:44:31,900 --> 01:44:38,860
if you go to SX SW comm you can see where the changes are and what's been expanded and I think

1186
01:44:38,860 --> 01:44:45,100
it's great and I hope they don't buckle this time and you know let the assholes online think that

1187
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:50,260
you know you can threaten people and get away with it I get that there's been a lot of vitriol

1188
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:56,460
and hateful crap on Twitter and and on certain dark places of the internet and reddit and all

1189
01:44:56,460 --> 01:45:01,020
that stuff and you know all that crap aside which I don't really want to touch with a ten-foot pole

1190
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:07,180
at this point I'm curious about is this forum when we talk about online harassment and game

1191
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:12,620
harassment is this going to address it all like what sometimes people put up with in multiplayer

1192
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:19,500
spaces like what we see on you know Xbox Live playing Halo where the you know or Call of Duty

1193
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:26,100
where the n-word and you know and things we see in the MMOs that's really ugly like are we gonna

1194
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:32,620
be talking about that as well like I just I feel like there's a lot of touch points besides that

1195
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:37,980
other bit of ugliness that has happened online in the past year you know what I mean I hope so

1196
01:45:38,020 --> 01:45:43,540
yeah I mean I think it should be addressed I feel like those are some of the roots wherein

1197
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:47,500
the other stuff all comes from I don't know like when we talk about online harassment I just hope

1198
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:54,220
we we talk about what happens on a small scale as well as what happens on the you know large very

1199
01:45:54,220 --> 01:46:01,780
vocal scale so anyway all right let's move on something else Loki all right so we're right

1200
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:07,020
around the corner from December which means the next game awards are gonna be happening and of

1201
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:13,700
course got some details on that let's see it's supposed to be taking place once again I guess

1202
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:18,740
that the Microsoft theater in Los Angeles on December 3rd and with that they're gonna have

1203
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:29,380
an advisory board of industry experts and this year they're gonna be including let's see Reggie

1204
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:40,980
fisa Mae he's a Gilmont from Ubisoft Hideo Kojima and Kojima productions they put the word Konami

1205
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:48,740
next to Kojima just curious Nintendo's gonna be coming back as well this year and they may be

1206
01:46:48,740 --> 01:46:55,380
announcing new titles no words but they you know like last year they had like a lot of game

1207
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:59,420
announcements and trailers and stuff so hopefully we'll see something come out of that as well also

1208
01:46:59,420 --> 01:47:04,660
have a list of the nominees for this wait will they honor Roberta Williams again and Ken Williams

1209
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:11,180
to be fair will they honor them again I don't know cuz they they should game of the year your

1210
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:19,380
nominees are blood-borne fallout for Metal Gear Solid 5 the phantom pain Super Mario maker and

1211
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:26,180
the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt I think all pretty good choices there let's see very obvious choices for

1212
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:31,180
game of the year I mean to be honest like if I hadn't even looked at that story or read that

1213
01:47:31,180 --> 01:47:36,700
story I probably could have guessed at least four of those five that would've been on the list some

1214
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:43,380
of the let's see developers of the year Bethesda CD Projekt Red from software Kojima productions

1215
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:47,140
and Nintendo pretty much all the same companies that make those games that are in the top there

1216
01:47:47,140 --> 01:47:54,260
gee yeah I like how congeum productions is on there what game do they make this year I don't

1217
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:58,660
believe they were on you know well that's right they were removed from yeah that I gave me the

1218
01:47:58,660 --> 01:48:02,700
year title huh that's unfortunate anything you know all the same normal categories that they

1219
01:48:02,700 --> 01:48:09,580
have there also of course they've got some like this best fan creation as well so one of the

1220
01:48:09,580 --> 01:48:16,860
nominees on that GTA 5 targets which is kind of like a cinematic movie made with the game engine

1221
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:22,940
real GTA from corridor digital portal stories Mel which I thought was pretty awesome that was

1222
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:30,480
that kind of standalone game that was free if you have portal or any source engine game super

1223
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:35,540
mario maker the e-reader levels so those you know levels that were made by that one fan there and

1224
01:48:35,540 --> 01:48:41,220
then twitch plays Dark Souls it's kind of an interesting little side category yeah about Bob

1225
01:48:41,220 --> 01:48:49,020
Ross twitch Bob Ross which is not on there unfortunately let's see if you don't acknowledge

1226
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:55,180
the Bob Ross twitch thing you failed this year you failed all of us make it happen and then of

1227
01:48:55,180 --> 01:49:01,100
course best perform the devil out of these awards which this is weird because I didn't I wasn't I

1228
01:49:01,100 --> 01:49:06,580
didn't remember that Mark Hamill was playing this character at this time but they had best

1229
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:13,020
performances Ashley birch as Chloe price and life is strange Camilla Ludington as Laura Croft and

1230
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:20,220
rise of the Tomb Raider Doug cockle as Gerald from Witcher 3 Mark Hamill as the Joker I thought

1231
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:26,540
Mark Hamill wasn't doing the Joker anymore I thought it was Troy Baker now doing I thought

1232
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:36,420
to in back Batman Arkham Knight and then Viva Seifert in her story going to our chat room over

1233
01:49:37,260 --> 01:49:42,780
at live.vognetwork.com Rama says back the fuck up fallout 4 just came out yes we keep in mind with

1234
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:48,820
the press and all this stuff they've had the game for weeks doing the reviews and evaluations in

1235
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:53,060
advance in fact there was a lot of talk about the embargo because I seem to remember there was an

1236
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:56,780
embargo about the embargo that was something that happened last week when we weren't here but

1237
01:49:56,780 --> 01:50:04,500
basically it Bethesda came out and said you can tell people on this day that your embargo will

1238
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:08,780
be up on this day it was something really ridiculous and of course you know a bunch of

1239
01:50:08,780 --> 01:50:13,220
eight if a screenshot showed up on Twitter and it was kind of one of those you know thing we all

1240
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:20,260
pointed and laughed at but anybody that's you know voting or whatever the advisory board in these

1241
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:25,940
award shows they've been playing fallout 4 for at least a few weeks now but Splatoon has got quite

1242
01:50:25,940 --> 01:50:35,220
a few nominations they have best family game best shooter game best multiplayer game and I think

1243
01:50:35,220 --> 01:50:40,420
that's it SSG100 Matt clarifying the Joker thing I think he did the Joker in a couple of flashback

1244
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:44,580
scenes I just thought it was Troy Baker from now on I thought he was done doing that maybe they

1245
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:49,060
used some old footage or something who knows most anticipated game voices at conventions

1246
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:54,980
though for fun all Sony to almost all Sony titles there that's kind of funny so most anticipated

1247
01:50:54,980 --> 01:51:01,100
game horizon move three Final Fantasy 7 remade no it's a horizon zero dawn no man's sky quantum

1248
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:06,980
break last guardian uncharted for all of but one Sony titles those are all like so that's a little

1249
01:51:06,980 --> 01:51:12,020
for quantum break ridiculous no Zelda no Zelda game I'm yeah surprising Zelda's not on there a

1250
01:51:12,020 --> 01:51:20,300
little bit no Final Fantasy 15 nothing nothing all right well I mean I don't know I'll check it out

1251
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:26,940
it wasn't bad last year it was just some of it was just weird but I appreciated it more than like

1252
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:31,380
some of the really awful pandering that happens with some of the televised award with all these

1253
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:38,340
celebrities that have obviously never picked up a controller in their life so I liked the awards

1254
01:51:38,340 --> 01:51:43,340
last year wasn't that the show last year too or Trey Parker got up and said I beat Kevin Spacey

1255
01:51:43,340 --> 01:51:47,820
at something and like it was really yes yeah that was pretty awesome so I hope there's more moments

1256
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:51,900
like that and again I want to know who they're honoring this year maybe somebody in chat knows

1257
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:55,900
cuz I don't know if it was in that story who are they honoring this year is that Roberto Williams

1258
01:51:55,900 --> 01:52:04,060
and Ken Williams it's pretty probably a miyamoto I'm guessing or Iwata what I mean yeah but I don't

1259
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:09,260
know I don't know if they would do somebody that's already passed I mean I can't imagine they'll get

1260
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:13,780
through the night without saying something about Iwata but will he be that tribute that lifetime

1261
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:19,820
achievement award maybe not I think they might get Jima Kojima that would be kind of interesting

1262
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:25,860
with this year and everything I'm all for the classic PC developers though as well you know I

1263
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:32,020
love my Michael maybe an Atari 2600 maybe like a David Crane or uh I don't know Howard Scott

1264
01:52:32,020 --> 01:52:36,220
Warshaw or something that you know really influenced that old era of games we'll see

1265
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:46,460
all right anyhow let's move on to talk on JJ Abrams he's a busy guy you know when he's not

1266
01:52:46,460 --> 01:52:52,220
rebooting Star Trek or or making a new Star Wars episodes contributing to some of the hugest nerd

1267
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:59,660
franchises of all time for better for worse now he's moving on forget two games bad robot which

1268
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:07,100
is his studio teaming up with infinity blade creator chair on spy jinx spy jinx will be a

1269
01:53:07,100 --> 01:53:13,420
game on PCs and phones in 2016 it's an espionage game there's not a lot being said about this maybe

1270
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:18,420
this is a game that we might see at the awards who knows but they're saying it's gonna be action

1271
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:24,420
role-playing strategy world-building so I guess maybe it kind of looks like Team Fortress 2 but

1272
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:31,900
it's it's gonna be a lot more than that so there you go something that JJ Abrams is working on so

1273
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:39,060
we'll see hopefully it will be better than the second Star Trek film was at least that's my

1274
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:48,700
opinion anyway Kaijuto says oh shit espionage game I'm in oh no JJ maybe not let's see I love

1275
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:53,540
this going back to the talk about who should we who should we recognize at the Game Awards

1276
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:59,380
Akuma JP in our chat saying leave Kojima alone you're lucky he even performed for you bastards

1277
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:04,300
leave him alone please we're seeing the honor and they always say we should honor this you know

1278
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:10,900
spike Konami just like say oh yes he is the reason that this game is awesome fucking oh me that's

1279
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:16,580
fair it's a good clarification all right let's get to you guys each week you guys email us at

1280
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:23,420
our mailbag participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us emails and dark soccer's

1281
01:54:23,420 --> 01:54:28,500
gonna open up the mailbag dive in their head first there's two weeks two weeks worth it's

1282
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:34,540
collecting if you hear last week it really means last episode okay fair enough last episode so hey

1283
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:40,180
all are just writing into weigh in on the meme topic from last week's show while I understand

1284
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:45,860
what act-deaf to sorry I'm not sure how to spell his handle you actually got it right is saying

1285
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:52,100
to me memes and games just a week of lazy writing instead of writing something original or

1286
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:57,420
interesting it's just cribbing on some popular quote joke and quote oh god it took me a minute

1287
01:54:57,420 --> 01:55:02,540
to realize that this was even about it the meme thing and get real return guacamelee and stuff

1288
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:07,860
that has the memes okay yeah yeah I think about cases when stand-up comedian gets cost caught

1289
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:12,900
taking content from other comedians they usually get dumped on for being unoriginal and often end

1290
01:55:12,900 --> 01:55:17,860
up having trouble landing gigs I feel like this is a similar situation where one half of the

1291
01:55:17,860 --> 01:55:22,060
internet finds it okay because they're laughing more the novelty of recognizing the meme more

1292
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:29,220
than anything else honestly that's what I like about them to exacerbate things even more double

1293
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:34,420
anyway most of the means that make it into a game are already done to death anyway I might laugh at

1294
01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:39,180
something once or twice and then again if someone twisted in some novel way but by the time a game

1295
01:55:39,180 --> 01:55:45,620
in development comes out the means are at least a few months old assuming the game is even taking

1296
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:51,820
something more modern and not an over 9000 reference from 2006 so yeah I'm generally

1297
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:57,460
against games leaning on memes too much they won't stop me playing an otherwise amazing game guacamelee

1298
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:03,260
comes to mind because that game is exceptional and I loved it in spite of the memes I just wish

1299
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:09,260
game devs would think a little harder and come up with something original thanks Andy are I don't

1300
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:13,820
know I mean I I respect your opinion I think you're being a little harsh I don't think there's

1301
01:56:13,820 --> 01:56:20,180
anything wrong with like a little reference a wink and a nod is all it is if the game's entire plot

1302
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:27,100
is based around a meme or like a whole quest that's you know games based around memes wasn't

1303
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:33,020
that script scribble knots hi you know what's interesting about the scribble knots thing though

1304
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:39,660
is that the memes became a meme about that game you know that the memes weren't the game but the

1305
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:45,940
memes memeify the gate is very meta it's very meta scribble knots is a very meta example but

1306
01:56:45,940 --> 01:56:50,220
like you know when it's a wink and a nod a very tongue-in-cheek thing I don't think it's I really

1307
01:56:50,220 --> 01:56:54,180
don't think it's a big deal and I get a chuckle out of it and it's it's interesting because I had

1308
01:56:54,180 --> 01:56:59,140
the same reaction you had Jamie where the emailer called out the whole like some people get it and

1309
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:04,500
some people don't and it's it's not cool people think it's funny because of the novelty of finding

1310
01:57:04,500 --> 01:57:10,020
it yeah and I'm kind of like yeah I kind of like that I I mean I'm not gonna sit there and be like

1311
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:14,900
haha I think I got it and you did it I liked how they did it in World of Warcraft with the characters

1312
01:57:14,900 --> 01:57:20,860
that you would see like my favorite was and or a Moorhead yeah who was based off of the name from

1313
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:27,060
Agnes Moorhead who was in Dora in bewitched yeah and I like that they would throw in just kind of

1314
01:57:27,060 --> 01:57:34,940
obscure Harrison Jones same thing right or how you would find Harris Pilton and then you'd find her

1315
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:42,340
little invisible friend if you had that visibility spell that shit was funny I know see that that was

1316
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:51,620
funny and then in in Final Fantasy 14 the quest to fight Titan extreme is called quake me up before

1317
01:57:51,620 --> 01:57:57,700
you or a Magomo or something like that and it's really funny but like you know I don't know it I

1318
01:57:57,700 --> 01:58:03,660
but I think there's also the point I want to make with the part that he thought was not okay that

1319
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:10,100
you and I are like it's not so bad I think there's a lot of stuff out there that is like humor have

1320
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:16,380
you ever seen like movies that are for kids that have a lot of very adult jokes in them well yeah

1321
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:21,220
actually let's take that back a little bit Rocky and Bull Eagle okay sure I'll just say

1322
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:26,780
Animaniacs but sure Animaniacs I mean it's it's that same type of thing you know I mean if you were

1323
01:58:26,780 --> 01:58:32,660
paying attention to the politics you know when Rocky and Bull Eagle was on TV yeah the antics

1324
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:39,060
were were geared toward kids but so many so much of the content and commentary is pure satire aimed

1325
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:46,340
at adults or you know like you're saying with Animaniacs like when she pulls out Prince's as

1326
01:58:46,340 --> 01:58:51,460
goodnight kids you know that type of thing you know that joke yeah yeah yeah no it's like like

1327
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:57,860
you need to get fingerprints and she comes out with Prince and goodnight kids now to be fair to

1328
01:58:57,860 --> 01:59:02,340
the email or to be fair dark Tetsuya in chat over at live.vog network.com says reminds me of that

1329
01:59:02,340 --> 01:59:07,700
Wii U eShop game meme run I think it got taken down but yeah that was definitely a one-note

1330
01:59:07,700 --> 01:59:13,900
joke that got old in five seconds and yeah I agree when like the entire joke is the meme okay

1331
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:21,660
it gets old it's stupid it's not funny you're beating a dead horse it's not clever and I think

1332
01:59:21,660 --> 01:59:26,060
that's a clear difference when it's like that you're using the meme for the sake of using the

1333
01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:33,540
meme it's not clever but when like you kind of maybe twist what would be in the game anyway to

1334
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:37,100
sort of reflect a pop culture thing like the Harris Pilton thing in her invisible friend I

1335
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:41,940
think is a great example that that's a little more like tongue-in-cheek and I think that's

1336
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:47,540
where it's at its best yeah so anyway but thanks for the email even if we disagree a little bit on

1337
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:52,980
that yeah the run my episodes used to kind of do something like that where they're in the US

1338
01:59:52,980 --> 02:00:01,480
anyway there are episode names were the names of like movies or books only done with Ron my

1339
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:05,860
character names or something more having to do with the thing yeah and you know to be fair I

1340
02:00:06,060 --> 02:00:10,220
wonder if and to be fair to the email or two I bet I because I wonder if they're sitting there

1341
02:00:10,220 --> 02:00:17,020
going you guys are saying pop culture I'm saying memes and maybe to be fair there there is maybe a

1342
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:21,220
difference between pop culture references and internet meme references and so maybe I should

1343
02:00:21,220 --> 02:00:26,660
call that out ties into the same thing though I I sort of think memes in a way are pop culture

1344
02:00:26,660 --> 02:00:31,460
it's internet culture but it's really just the whole thing has gone wrapped up into each other

1345
02:00:31,460 --> 02:00:37,820
so yeah I know remember his kids are growing up on minecraft let's place it's those two are coming

1346
02:00:37,820 --> 02:00:41,740
closer together Julian yeah closer anything I went over there to hang out with Becky and he

1347
02:00:41,740 --> 02:00:47,380
was watching minecraft things I'm like okay I quit playing minecraft like a year ago I'm in the

1348
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:52,620
wrong business I should be doing minecraft let's plays but I should do it as crazy Rob Roberts no

1349
02:00:52,620 --> 02:00:58,540
I like your idea from earlier oh yeah before we were on air okay tangent time before we were on

1350
02:00:58,540 --> 02:01:02,420
air tonight and talking about this story I kind of I had this random thought I was like are there

1351
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:06,980
any drag queens that do let's play videos like do they do they get out there and actually sit there

1352
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:10,740
and do the let's plays in there in their drag persona because like I was thinking like like

1353
02:01:10,740 --> 02:01:17,900
a Dame Edna that plays video games hello my puppets or my pixels well you know we do know a drag

1354
02:01:17,900 --> 02:01:24,220
queen everybody knows a drag queen is several but we know gamer one apparently there is actually is

1355
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:31,500
there there is oh there's you know I have seen and I wonder if this is it what God not not Coco

1356
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:39,140
Montrese Coco Peru Coco Peru Coco Peru does the Grand Theft Auto but that's different because I

1357
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:45,280
feel like her let's plays are like do you do you guys remember from Michael and I wish I had the

1358
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:49,780
audio clip when I bring this up do you guys remember from like like five years ago when I

1359
02:01:49,860 --> 02:01:58,380
made my mom watch me play Mortal Kombat and she's like Rob oh that is gross what does she do Rob

1360
02:01:58,380 --> 02:02:05,080
that is that game is so gross that's kind of a Coco Peru does in those videos like what's going

1361
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:09,940
on what did you just shoot her did you just shoot that innocent person that's there on this like

1362
02:02:09,940 --> 02:02:14,560
this is a way to get out some aggressions you know that's because Coco Peru's big thing is

1363
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:20,360
tension tamer tea and I'm gonna need some tension tamer tea after watching that anyway so it's a

1364
02:02:20,360 --> 02:02:25,080
little different because with all due respect to Coco Peru I don't think she's really a gamer I

1365
02:02:25,080 --> 02:02:30,560
think that's more one of those somebody is having her watch those to react to them for the shock

1366
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:35,640
value I think it's a different drag queens react to yeah it's like a drag queens react to type of

1367
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:43,720
thing yeah if I'm wrong on that I apologize Coco Peru I'm a big fan all right hello LR

1368
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:50,680
on last week's episode you mentioned the Xbox one Kinect price cut to $100 Rob asked a question why

1369
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:57,400
do I need it I'm fairly passionate about my Xbox one which I bought on launch day with the Kinect

1370
02:02:57,400 --> 02:03:02,560
I use both on a daily basis I will answer your question with this you don't seriously you don't

1371
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:07,760
need it if you just want to use your Xbox one as a gaming console and nothing more there's no need

1372
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:13,000
for it as future support has all but disappeared that being said I can't imagine my life without

1373
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:18,880
it anymore my cable box is connected to my Xbox one and it's become the center of my living room

1374
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:25,040
the Xbox pause and Xbox play commands are worth the price of all by themselves the fast forward

1375
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:32,120
and rewind commands get love too when when your hands are covered in chicken or pizza or who knows

1376
02:03:32,120 --> 02:03:39,280
what or even when they aren't not having to reach for a remote is awesome but I also use the voice

1377
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:44,080
commands daily to switch channels launch games and jump between apps we can go to crunchyroll

1378
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:49,080
and watch the next episode of an anime or jump to Netflix and start whatever all without touching

1379
02:03:49,080 --> 02:03:55,320
anything browsing the integrated game store is also super easy I always check out the weekly

1380
02:03:55,320 --> 02:04:01,820
sales using only my voice I will pause and say that that's actually why I waited to get why I'm

1381
02:04:01,820 --> 02:04:06,760
waiting to get my new Apple TV because of the Siri commands that do all the same stuff so it sounds

1382
02:04:06,760 --> 02:04:10,960
like if you're willing to have the Xbox one be that centerpiece of your living room that a lot

1383
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:15,320
of other stuff kind of goes through then you got to get a lot more value out of it than say maybe

1384
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:21,520
me who's switching between like four different things to really get everything I'm kind of getting

1385
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:27,560
that but see my thing is that I play games on my systems and I don't do much else with them can I

1386
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:30,400
take a quick tangent I'm sorry because I know you're not done with email but this is relevant

1387
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:35,560
I promise so the new Xbox one dashboard came out this week as well along with the Xbox backwards

1388
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:41,840
compatibility I'm not a fan I am I'm not really a fan and maybe it's because I'm not integrating

1389
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:47,880
the way that Microsoft wants me to integrate but I have to be honest I'm just I'm really not liking

1390
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:54,160
it like the Xbox dashboards have gotten worse and worse over the years like I missed when it was

1391
02:04:54,160 --> 02:05:00,680
just simple like when it's you know go left and right for the different menus and then up and down

1392
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:05,440
for whatever which I understand is is kind of where this new dashboard is going so maybe but

1393
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:11,520
but I just feel like there's a lot of stuff that's still really buried and like even to like redeem a

1394
02:05:11,520 --> 02:05:16,000
code on the store it took me forever to figure out where to freaking find that I don't know I

1395
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:22,840
just not everybody's gonna agree with me there but I personally feel the new dashboard is really not

1396
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:28,440
cutting it but at least I can play rock band and whatever game I need to play there are a few other

1397
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:34,200
bonuses to the Skype experience is pretty great I've heard a lot of people praise the Xbox fitness

1398
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:39,040
app and it's many available workouts though I admittedly haven't tried it yet Kinect is required

1399
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:43,920
for it and of course there are a few games you can play on it but that's all gravy as far as I'm

1400
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:49,880
concerned Kinect makes me feel like I'm in the 21st century I absolutely love using it and I enjoy my

1401
02:05:49,880 --> 02:05:54,080
Xbox one a lot more because of it do you need it absolutely not but I sure as hell love mine

1402
02:05:54,080 --> 02:06:02,040
Kinect is dead long live Kinect that's from YY are thank you for the perspective I appreciate the

1403
02:06:02,040 --> 02:06:06,280
honesty where it's like what you don't really need it but if you're gonna if you're gonna put

1404
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:10,040
everything through your console then there's there's a lot more you can do so I appreciate

1405
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:15,720
that perspective you know it has gotten me closer and closer to Kinect is the fact that it's a way

1406
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:20,880
that you could do the live streaming on Xbox one and you know have your face they're kind of

1407
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:25,440
similar to how you have to have the PlayStation camera on the PlayStation 4 to do streaming which

1408
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:31,360
I have to admit in both cases is pretty stupid why can't I just hook up a USB camera to one of these

1409
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:36,080
systems and have that be my camera I mean I get it they're not gonna sell as many of these cameras

1410
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:41,560
by letting me do that but I still don't have to like it in both cases like I just I just wish I

1411
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:46,240
could just hook up a camera and use that for the streaming but with the Xbox 360 backwards

1412
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:51,800
compatibility stuff one cool thing that Microsoft has done to their credit not only is it simply you

1413
02:06:51,800 --> 02:06:57,960
can play these games on your Xbox 360 but you can do the Xbox one stuff with it like stream it like

1414
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:03,400
do the caps and the videos and stuff that's pretty rad I gotta say and and really breeze just a

1415
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:10,480
little bit more life into some of these older games all right we have two emails left greetings

1416
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:14,800
peoples there's something I wanted to email you about in reference to last week's episode that is

1417
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:19,000
until it did my research it involves Metroid there's a tidbit I thought I knew about this

1418
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:22,880
game a tidbit that I thought would never go and mention while discussing the impact this game's

1419
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:28,320
had on gaming landscape I thought that the term boss as it relates to video games came from the

1420
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:34,240
original and NES Metroid's instruction manual as it turns out this is wrong and likely comes from

1421
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:39,840
a fountain of bad information twin galaxies oh snap so why do I bring this up I'm curious if

1422
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:43,760
there's anything gaming related that any of you believe to be an absolute fact that turned out

1423
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:48,200
to be wrong stay care of entertainment this message is brought to you by Xbox wrestling

1424
02:07:48,200 --> 02:08:02,040
this is a tricky one to answer on the spot um I would say back before we had the internet which

1425
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:08,880
maybe some of y'all can't remember that far back but you know when we didn't have Japanese games

1426
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:17,520
here in other words like we didn't know that there was necessarily a Mario Brothers 2 that

1427
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:21,480
was different than ours you know maybe if you were into the right cultures and had the right

1428
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:27,440
magazines you kind of knew that but I want to say I was convinced at one point there was like a

1429
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:32,160
legit like Super Mario Brothers 4 that released in Japan that we didn't have here and that turned

1430
02:08:32,160 --> 02:08:36,200
out to not be true once I had the internet was able to figure that out but I feel like that was

1431
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:39,520
something that was going around back in the day as a Japan had a Mario Brothers 4 and we didn't

1432
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:46,600
or we'd get ads for games that were gonna come out and then they never did yeah whereas now you know

1433
02:08:46,600 --> 02:08:53,760
when they're on on the internet we find out about it right away or here was one that I spent hours

1434
02:08:53,760 --> 02:09:00,600
trying to do this in Final Fantasy 7 was to get the test zeros to show up which they were in Maya

1435
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:09,640
the what manual was the versus books manual for Final Fantasy 7 talked about the test zeros which

1436
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:14,480
apparently they were only in the Japanese version I guess stuff like that but nothing that I took to

1437
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:22,280
be actual gospel I know how about the blood code on Mortal Kombat for the Super Nintendo that was

1438
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:27,920
something everybody was convinced was there and like my friend put it in and saw the blood and

1439
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:32,480
it's there in the Super Nintendo version of the game and dah dah dah and it's not there like that

1440
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:40,000
was just like a game genie code that turned the sweat red exactly it turned the sweat red and but

1441
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:46,320
you couldn't decapitate technically the sweat was just blood anyways it was turned gray so I still

1442
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:51,520
have my Final Fantasy 7 strategy guide the versus one is the one I'm talking about that actually

1443
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:57,600
book if you have it intact it'll go for money that particular one will which I was very mad

1444
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:02,960
at dance friend Eric for slashing through my cover when I loaned it to him I was mad I got

1445
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:10,000
another copy of it by the way um but ask Jeeves but I will say this that I've played through the

1446
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:14,800
Japanese original Final Fantasy 7 because it's a fuck of a lot easier and the test zeros are in it

1447
02:10:14,800 --> 02:10:22,120
so just saying they beg you not to kill them it's adorable these they're like Doberman creatures

1448
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:29,960
anyway um last last email yes okay dear olr I tried out the new Nintendo badge arcade this

1449
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:36,080
weekend it has a cute pink bunny that entices you and then extorts you for cash yes I've seen I paid

1450
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:43,360
for the VIP thing by the way what's the VIP thing get the VIP me garden thing where you can add

1451
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:48,880
people as a VIP oh yeah I bought that too yeah that was a while ago that came out but yeah yeah

1452
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:53,720
I know what you're talking about you're a VIP in my 3ds just you know you're online too yeah you

1453
02:10:53,720 --> 02:11:00,120
and Shane and Dan are the three that I have yay Loki's sold his I have a few I think I have Bobby

1454
02:11:00,120 --> 02:11:07,460
black wolf in there I have some I had to go back and find other people yeah um he even turns on the

1455
02:11:07,460 --> 02:11:12,360
demon eyes and flames when you consider not spending money in macro transactions why macro

1456
02:11:12,360 --> 02:11:18,320
the cash cost for five plays is a dollar anything over 99 cents is not a micro transaction if you

1457
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:24,440
want to be literal literal anything over a millionth of a dollar is not a micro transaction if this

1458
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:29,920
game was only played by adults I'd be sort of okay about it I mean you can spend your money as

1459
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:37,120
you wish but children especially very young ones are being hit with very psychologically intensive

1460
02:11:37,120 --> 02:11:42,200
addiction methods aside from the very threatening rabbit it makes it clear you're spending real

1461
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:48,140
money but ignores the fact that you're getting very virtual rewards also the first hit is free

1462
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:54,140
and then they let you play a fake game once a day for the random chance of free plays the result is

1463
02:11:54,140 --> 02:12:00,180
the free games after the first hit are intentionally diluted and set up on a random delivery schedule

1464
02:12:00,180 --> 02:12:05,300
it's all extremely addictive is it tied to the internet can you let just change your clock in

1465
02:12:05,300 --> 02:12:11,580
your 3ds um it keeps telling you not to turn the power off once you've started and I noticed like

1466
02:12:11,580 --> 02:12:15,580
as soon as you operate the crane there's an instant like loading type of thing or something

1467
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:21,340
so I don't know I don't know but I'm I mean hackers gonna hack I'm sure somebody's finding

1468
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:27,460
a way around this but and I'll kind of laugh when they do and somebody will find a way to

1469
02:12:27,460 --> 02:12:32,380
just unlock all the badges for free wait but anyway I don't want to I think the appropriate

1470
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:38,300
fate phrase here would be chasing the pink bunny I guess instead of the white rabbit I'd recommend

1471
02:12:38,300 --> 02:12:43,380
parents guide their children through the game and explain why each thing is designed to be addictive

1472
02:12:43,380 --> 02:12:48,820
I would recommend not letting children play the game I'd straight up I'll sell just don't go down

1473
02:12:48,820 --> 02:12:53,980
that don't don't save your payment information on that 3ds sorry I also have your parental

1474
02:12:53,980 --> 02:13:00,060
controls on or watch your money or watch your money disappear Nintendo for the record for the

1475
02:13:00,060 --> 02:13:05,660
record I don't think explaining it to children is gonna be necessarily a valid tactic because

1476
02:13:05,660 --> 02:13:12,140
and I'm gonna go a little bit into neurobiology right now a children children's brains are not

1477
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:17,340
developed enough to understand the difference between long-term consequence their brains are

1478
02:13:17,340 --> 02:13:24,660
wired for immediate satisfaction the brain stays this way for men up it can be up until the 27

1479
02:13:24,660 --> 02:13:29,460
before their brains start looking more for consequence I don't think some ever grow out of

1480
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:36,380
it but I'm saying the general range for males is between 21 and 27 and for women is between like

1481
02:13:36,380 --> 02:13:44,860
21 and 24 it's a smaller window at the end but yeah that's just biology Nintendo badge arcade

1482
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:49,260
is also the perfect time to open a dialogue with children on gambling and drug addiction and why

1483
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:57,300
they're similar hating the bunny Robin I'm glad I'm not alone in feeling that that Nintendo badge

1484
02:13:57,300 --> 02:14:02,700
arcade is shady as hell like I think that's really the best way for me to put it it's shady as hell I

1485
02:14:02,780 --> 02:14:09,780
think though again some children just aren't going to get that concept their brains aren't wires to

1486
02:14:09,780 --> 02:14:14,940
get it don't know the good news is that doesn't automatically install your 3ds just don't know

1487
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:19,540
what it the hammer on it just keep the print controls on and don't save your credit card

1488
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:28,140
information yeah you know that's one thing and I I normally don't have this discussion this one

1489
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:36,300
thing I've liked about the family sharing with my iTunes and with my App Store is that if you've

1490
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:44,060
got kids you actually can enact a parental control that makes them have to ask you every time they

1491
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:50,300
want to buy an application or make a transaction in an app so I think that more systems need that

1492
02:14:50,300 --> 02:14:57,340
you know and not enough of them have it so just my two cents fair enough I don't like having to

1493
02:14:57,340 --> 02:15:02,300
put my like password information in like for purchasing a free app though that pisses me off

1494
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:10,300
on any format I kind of get it in a way though because like maybe you don't want the kid filling

1495
02:15:10,300 --> 02:15:16,340
up your device or whatever with crap you know you still want to have some sort of say about what

1496
02:15:16,340 --> 02:15:23,660
they're putting on your device especially if there could be a you know a scandalous type of free to

1497
02:15:23,660 --> 02:15:29,100
play thing out there that maybe you don't want kids around I'm just saying I can store it's

1498
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:36,620
annoying but I can sort of see the reason for it a little bit at least so anyhow there you go

1499
02:15:36,620 --> 02:15:41,540
emails thank you guys so those emails participate at orange lounge rated calm if you have an email

1512
02:17:36,060 --> 02:17:44,900
create some Metal Gear Solid 5 theme prosthetics for a double amputee and this person that James

1513
02:17:44,900 --> 02:17:55,540
Young he lost his arm in his leg in 2012 I guess when he was dragged between two rail carriages

1514
02:17:55,540 --> 02:18:03,820
and so now they are creating this highly stylized multi-functional limb for him that's pretty

1515
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:10,780
awesome I kind of want to see what that looks like once done and then that's how somebody

1516
02:18:10,780 --> 02:18:18,780
actually becomes solid snake he's gonna take up no cigar smoking and start you know overthrowing

1517
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:27,060
evil plots with their government too yeah all right well I don't know I dark soccer I think

1522
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:54,900

1523
02:18:54,900 --> 02:19:00,580
or remember when Tupac showed up at Coachella and the whole hologram thing that's basically

1524
02:19:01,220 --> 02:19:06,780
Hatsune Miku yes I have compared Tupac to Hatsune Miku and I'm not going to apologize for it so

and drink what are you gonna do I don't know sitting at home at drinking is kind of what I

1540
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:48,860
do anyway this is what you'd combine both you're gonna drink and go to Hatsune Miku concert and be

1541
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:53,780
around all those Japanese girls that'll you know be screaming and everything and we'll be right

1542
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:59,300
there up front with them won't that be fun that sounds fun I bet you we could get like Captain

1543
02:20:59,300 --> 02:21:04,060
Spike from game buoy org to go with us I'm sure he's already looking at tickets if nothing else

1544
02:21:04,060 --> 02:21:10,300
we should get grandpa from starboard power coupling to go and so he can be just be all

1545
02:21:10,300 --> 02:21:19,740
like what in the actual fuck is this what is this shit all right cuz you know he won't get it

1546
02:21:19,740 --> 02:21:29,300
what hate seven seven a game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio the skype line is

1547
02:21:29,300 --> 02:21:33,380
open if you want to talk about anything we've talked about so far tonight or maybe something

1548
02:21:33,380 --> 02:21:38,300
different there it is again one eight seven seven game olr or a username on skype orange

1549
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:45,020
lounge radio all one word looking over to Loki to see if there's any last-minute stories to get

1550
02:21:45,020 --> 02:21:50,780
out here before we or while we wait for some calls I suppose I really need to play more Fallout 4

1551
02:21:50,780 --> 02:21:55,020
there's so what is it that you're seeing that's so awesome that's blowing your mind well this is

1552
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:59,820
just a lot of the VAT stuff so like there's one guy that you know focused in melee and so they

1553
02:21:59,820 --> 02:22:05,460
had like a power power arm thing that he just punched the guy's face off and this one now it's

1554
02:22:05,460 --> 02:22:10,020
a wild mongrel and they shoot the face off of this one too it seems like the type of thing that

1555
02:22:10,020 --> 02:22:14,980
Alan would be really into that game because I know he's really into Skyrim with mods everything but

1556
02:22:14,980 --> 02:22:19,180
I don't remember him playing Fallout 3 I don't know if he'll play this one or not we'll see

1557
02:22:19,180 --> 02:22:24,260
anyway it's just like yeah I didn't really play through oblivion very much and then then Skyrim

1558
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:28,380
you played the crap out of exactly all right well we are getting a phone call so let's get to it

1559
02:22:28,380 --> 02:22:33,100
hi you're on orange on radio who's this hey everybody it's Rama hey Rama how you doing I'm

1560
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:38,900
good but more the bigger question is how are you feeling sir I'm not a hundred percent but I'm well

1561
02:22:38,900 --> 02:22:42,420
enough to be doing this show for you all tonight and that's a big improvement over where I was

1562
02:22:42,420 --> 02:22:48,580
Monday or Tuesday night so I do understand because when I did my show Tuesday night I

1563
02:22:48,580 --> 02:22:56,500
did not realize how bad Mako Chan's voice was it was bad everything I've had wrong is in my

1564
02:22:56,500 --> 02:23:02,460
sinuses so like even still you probably heard me sniffling and I apologize for being gross but it's

1565
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:08,660
just like that's like what I'm dealing with and like Monday Tuesday was bad like it was just snot

1566
02:23:08,660 --> 02:23:13,340
fountain everywhere now I'm being gross on purpose but it was just like it was so bad and like you

1567
02:23:13,340 --> 02:23:22,140
know no matter what and you believe me steamy spicy soups taking sinus pills long hot showers

1568
02:23:22,140 --> 02:23:27,940
um you know all the tricks trust me I was doing short of the neti pot that is the one thing I

1569
02:23:27,940 --> 02:23:33,740
can't do that's that chick that pours the rub that I can't do that there's a much better one

1570
02:23:33,740 --> 02:23:38,500
than the night I hate doing the neti pot myself but this other one squeezes uh-huh and it's a

1571
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:43,180
quick flush it's not like this long slow I still feel like I'm gonna like inject it into my brain

1572
02:23:43,180 --> 02:23:50,860
by doing that trust me it it helps so much anyway but yeah so luckily I'm slowly getting on the

1573
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:55,020
other side of it but you know what's what's interesting so Wednesday was a holiday from

1574
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:59,180
work so thankfully I didn't have to take it as a sick day but a good friend of mine was having

1575
02:23:59,180 --> 02:24:05,140
surgery on Wednesday so and I volunteered because I'd had the day off work to take this person to

1576
02:24:05,140 --> 02:24:09,860
the hospital and then take them back after the surgery so it's like I'm going to a hospital and

1577
02:24:09,860 --> 02:24:13,820
I'm like sick and I'm like trying not to get my friends sick who's having the operation it's just

1620
02:28:33,180 --> 02:28:44,340
anything else for us no no sadly that's okay 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio

1621
02:28:44,340 --> 02:28:50,820
I was gonna bring this up earlier cuz during the break we were playing some music from you know we

1622
02:28:50,820 --> 02:28:57,500
just did some different game music random stuff and I I happen to play that song from Final Fantasy

1623
02:28:57,500 --> 02:29:05,020
10 that you hear in the very beginning of the game where they're doing the tournament you what's it

1624
02:29:05,020 --> 02:29:09,740
what's the name of that song oh what's the name of the song from Final Fantasy 10 the big big rock

1625
02:29:09,740 --> 02:29:17,060
song other world that's it that was the song I was playing during the break and Loki had commented

1626
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:21,460
that that song you had hacked into Final Fantasy 11 they had a thing where you could swap up the

1627
02:29:21,460 --> 02:29:28,260
music so that was my in-party battle music is like totally awesome and then my solo battle music was

1628
02:29:28,260 --> 02:29:33,060
smacked my bitch up and that was awesome too and then of course they changed the chocobo writing

1629
02:29:33,060 --> 02:29:38,580
music from the chocobo theme to the foul course theme from never in story which it was even more

1630
02:29:38,580 --> 02:29:44,980
awesome it just made that game even better nice nice you know Final Fantasy 11 got its last patch

1631
02:29:44,980 --> 02:29:50,180
this week or its last major story but I keep hearing that they'll still be like little quality

1632
02:29:50,180 --> 02:29:55,540
of life patches for a little while but this is the last story patch essentially at this point the

1633
02:29:55,540 --> 02:30:01,300
game will not be changed and that was released on 11 11 or got that that patch and then of course

1634
02:30:01,300 --> 02:30:08,460
the service for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 2 going to be ending in like March or April I think and

1635
02:30:08,460 --> 02:30:13,980
then PC service will continue and then there'll be whatever is happening with the mobile expansion

1636
02:30:13,980 --> 02:30:17,660
or whatever the hell they're gonna do next for Final Fantasy 11 I look forward when it goes to

1637
02:30:17,660 --> 02:30:24,380
free play yeah you hope you're hoping it's uh it's gonna be interesting but also there's a Final

1638
02:30:24,380 --> 02:30:31,340
Fantasy 11 event in Final Fantasy 14 one of the characters from 11 shows up in 14 and there's like

1639
02:30:31,340 --> 02:30:34,780
this whole little like cross-promotion thing going on although it's a newer character so it's not

1640
02:30:34,780 --> 02:30:39,180
anybody I recognize but I thought it was funny because you do all these different fates in 14

1641
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:44,860
and one of them is you go to the beach and you fight all these crabs and the dialogue actually

1642
02:30:44,860 --> 02:30:49,820
says when I needed training I would get together with some friends and go to the beach and we would

1643
02:30:49,820 --> 02:30:54,860
fight all these crabs and then that's the that's the fate that you do and it actually plays the

1644
02:30:54,860 --> 02:30:58,780
old battle music from 11 while you're fighting all the crabs so I thought that was really funny

1645
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:04,380
so it was a cute little event that they had in 14 and then at the end of it you get the person's

1646
02:31:04,380 --> 02:31:10,540
armor that you can not transmogrify what do they call it again glamour you can glamour your gear

1647
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:16,700
into that gear which I thought was pretty cool so yep all right wow it's quiet tonight on the

1648
02:31:16,700 --> 02:31:22,380
phones 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio give you one more chance to get

1690
02:35:07,500 --> 02:35:12,780
sounds radio who's this hey this actdeft hey actdeft what a surprise to hear you on the show

1691
02:35:12,780 --> 02:35:15,900
yeah I'm just I'm just giving you crap what's up buddy what's on your mind

1692
02:35:17,180 --> 02:35:23,420
uh well um you were talking about amiibo festival uh you haven't played it yet right I have not I've

1693
02:35:23,420 --> 02:35:28,380
only seen what they teased on those directs and I was like I don't think I'm really into this but

1694
02:35:28,380 --> 02:35:32,460
I don't like jamie's telling me I might be wrong shane's even telling me I might be wrong and I'm

1695
02:35:32,460 --> 02:35:39,180
assuming you're calling in to tell me I'm wrong yeah pretty much all right well tell me about it

1696
02:35:39,180 --> 02:35:46,060
what is what is the game what is amiibo festival animal crossing um it's it's kind of hard to

1697
02:35:46,060 --> 02:35:53,820
explain it's definitely a party game it's uh you have to play it uh with other other people but

1698
02:35:54,620 --> 02:36:02,220
it's it's like I don't know I I thought it was it was uh way more fun than mario party

1699
02:36:02,220 --> 02:36:08,700
uh whereas when mario party uh it's more like a competition with with other people

1700
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:18,700
with um an amiibo festival it's just enjoy the game uh and and if you win it's okay it's good

1701
02:36:19,260 --> 02:36:26,220
it's like more like a feel-good game yeah rather than a competitive one so it's really fun

1702
02:36:26,620 --> 02:36:29,820
saying it's a hippie dippy everybody wins type of thing

1703
02:36:30,780 --> 02:36:36,700
kinda you still there's still a first place a second place and that but see but you're not

1704
02:36:36,700 --> 02:36:41,740
going to threaten to kill the person playing as princess daisy for taking your star everyone does

1705
02:36:41,740 --> 02:36:46,300
get points in it that they can power up for outfits and stuff and unlockables and you can

1706
02:36:46,300 --> 02:36:50,220
unlock mini games you can play with other people because you know how mario party goes like if

1707
02:36:50,220 --> 02:36:57,420
somebody steals your star like you may actually hurt them yeah you're like motherfucker exactly

1708
02:36:57,420 --> 02:37:04,380
but what what this uh this game you're not a you're pretty much enjoying the game so

1709
02:37:05,740 --> 02:37:11,980
like i said it's really hard to explain it in uh in a simple way but basically it's like it's like

1710
02:37:12,220 --> 02:37:16,380
monopoly where uh wasn't like uh life threatening

1711
02:37:18,300 --> 02:37:25,500
basically you guessed that okay okay uh yeah i like that well okay i'll i'm gonna check it out

1712
02:37:25,500 --> 02:37:31,180
i just i was a little put off by the price but i do really want that isabel amiibo i think i've

1713
02:37:31,180 --> 02:37:34,940
actually lost count of how many amiibo i have don't laugh at me um i need to count them up

1714
02:37:34,940 --> 02:37:40,860
again but i think i could be up to just about 50 now because i just bought five of the animal

1715
02:37:40,860 --> 02:37:47,180
crossing amiibo you're getting there you're getting there i'm so disgusted with myself i

1716
02:37:47,180 --> 02:37:53,100
really am hey at least you don't have an almost complete collection so oh well then yeah i'm more

1717
02:37:53,100 --> 02:37:57,500
disgusted in you no i'm just kidding well you saw you probably saw maybe you didn't see because i

1718
02:37:57,500 --> 02:38:01,900
think i only put this on instagram i don't think i put it on twitter or anything but i actually have

1719
02:38:01,900 --> 02:38:08,460
not just the american rob the robot but i got a japanese rob the robot or as they call it over

1720
02:38:08,540 --> 02:38:13,340
there just robot because it's a different color and so i actually got the two and alan was like

1721
02:38:13,340 --> 02:38:18,780
wait a minute i thought you weren't going to be buying two characters in different poses because

1722
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:24,220
i have like i have a mario from smash brothers i didn't get the mario from mario party i don't need

1723
02:38:24,220 --> 02:38:28,620
it i don't need to go that far with it where i have every figure right um yeah but i did buy

1724
02:38:28,620 --> 02:38:36,300
two robs but i'm like my name is rob he's one of my favorite characters and the japanese one does

1725
02:38:36,300 --> 02:38:41,100
look cooler than the american one and i thought it's cute when you have two of them side by side

1726
02:38:41,100 --> 02:38:48,460
because you know rob rob like my online name rob roberts yeah anyway it's it's it's like obvious

1727
02:38:48,460 --> 02:38:55,180
you have to have it exactly i have to have it yeah i also got it too it's it's it looks really

1728
02:38:55,180 --> 02:39:01,340
pretty great better than the american one yeah so now it's good that i don't know if you reported

1729
02:39:01,340 --> 02:39:08,940
on this but the famicon robot uh is also coming to america so you don't have to i know right i

1730
02:39:08,940 --> 02:39:13,020
heard it if you don't want it i heard that that it showed up in a target ad or something that it's

1731
02:39:13,020 --> 02:39:20,140
gonna yeah yeah and the weird and one of the amiibo kiosks uh it appeared that the the sorry

1732
02:39:20,140 --> 02:39:27,660
the famicon robot it's coming to america so yeah you it's it's not that expensive it's like 20

1733
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:34,140
dollars on amazon so it's not really that much a lot of you if you want to wait yeah yeah i

1734
02:39:34,140 --> 02:39:40,860
actually have more japanese amiibo than you'd think you know let's not forget in some ways

1735
02:39:40,860 --> 02:39:46,300
akuma jp is to kind of blame for some of this i'm just saying because and i'm always saying that

1736
02:39:46,300 --> 02:39:51,820
because i know he's listening but remember one of the first amiibo was that we fit trainer and i was

1737
02:39:51,820 --> 02:39:56,620
here crying and bitching and moaning and bellyaching about what a fucking pain in the ass it

1738
02:39:56,620 --> 02:40:01,100
was to get a we fit trainer because there wasn't enough of them and that you know the the stock

1739
02:40:01,100 --> 02:40:06,620
shortages and all that stuff or whatever they were uh talking about and then you know akuma jp being

1740
02:40:06,620 --> 02:40:10,300
the cool guy he is is like well i can just walk into a store in japan and get one you want me to

1741
02:40:10,300 --> 02:40:13,740
get you one here i just show up in the mail and sure enough he sends me a we fit trainer and it

1742
02:40:13,740 --> 02:40:19,580
was suddenly like the clouds parted amiibo collecting can be easy you just have to be

1743
02:40:19,580 --> 02:40:25,500
willing to import from japan and now a lot of figures of might have come from japan not even

1744
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:31,580
just like akuma jp ended up sending me like a pac-man later on but like you know i got that rob

1745
02:40:31,580 --> 02:40:36,460
i bought one of my other figures came from japan my tune link came from japan because i couldn't

1746
02:40:36,460 --> 02:40:43,100
find them here anymore because they're kind of like gone but they were on uh um uh amazon for

1747
02:40:43,100 --> 02:40:47,180
like 12 bucks because i guess a japanese store was trying to clear them out so i bought a japanese

1748
02:40:47,180 --> 02:40:53,020
too i just wanted tote kk without having to spend 35 for the three pack when they sell him as a

1749
02:40:53,020 --> 02:40:58,860
single in japan uh keep i'm telling you keep an eye on amazon because at some point you may have

1750
02:40:58,860 --> 02:41:05,660
to pay like 15.99 so 12.99 but it's 20 bucks on um playasia so it may cost a little too much it

1751
02:41:05,660 --> 02:41:10,780
may come down you'll never know but they do have a couple of the other ones yeah yeah like the

1752
02:41:10,780 --> 02:41:16,860
duck hunt amiibo uh the japanese version on amazon is ten dollars which uh free shipping oh yeah it's

1753
02:41:16,860 --> 02:41:23,980
not bad yeah here you have to buy the the retro pack with robin and game and watch so if you

1754
02:41:23,980 --> 02:41:28,940
only want the duck hunt yeah yeah and i love the duck hunt amiibo and i love the rob amiibo

1755
02:41:28,940 --> 02:41:34,060
obviously but i i truly think the mr game and watch amiibo is probably the worst amiibo in

1756
02:41:34,060 --> 02:41:40,220
my entire collection it really is like no no i like it but i i that's i think that cheap plastic

1757
02:41:40,220 --> 02:41:45,340
thing they did i mean i get the cute idea behind it but i think it's kind of executed poorly

1758
02:41:45,420 --> 02:41:50,540
and like okay when you when you use mr game and watch and yoshi's wooly world to get the skin or

1759
02:41:50,540 --> 02:41:56,220
whatever it's just a pure black yoshi like it's kind of dippy i'm i'm not a fan of the mr blackface

1760
02:41:56,220 --> 02:42:03,660
yoshi no no don't go there no there so yeah i was not uh not pleased with mr game and watch so he

1761
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:11,340
sits in the back of my collection but then also most of my amiibo come from imports uh i think i

1762
02:42:12,220 --> 02:42:20,940
what probably uh like a third of my amiibo come are american uh another part uh another third

1763
02:42:20,940 --> 02:42:28,540
could be from europe and most of them yeah from japan because they they sometimes are cheaper

1764
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:34,540
even than the than msrp here in america so yeah it's gotten a lot better this year than it was

1765
02:42:34,540 --> 02:42:39,020
last year because it's i bet if i go back and listen to some of my amiibo rants from last year

1766
02:42:39,020 --> 02:42:43,660
i'm gonna be so ashamed of myself that how full throttle i've gone on this but now it's much

1767
02:42:43,660 --> 02:42:47,420
easier to get on amazon and once in a while you can kind of find what you're looking for you know

1768
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:54,700
except i guess you know there's some amiibo i have that shane is actually like really irritated that

1769
02:42:54,700 --> 02:42:58,860
i have them and he doesn't because now he can't find them and one of them is that we fit trainer

1770
02:42:58,860 --> 02:43:05,020
so thank you akuma jp seriously you don't know how much that that little piece of plastic figure

1771
02:43:05,020 --> 02:43:08,860
means to me because that's something i can hold over shane going i have this and you don't

1772
02:43:09,020 --> 02:43:15,420
but also this apparently samus really hard not zero suit but original samus is apparently really

1773
02:43:15,420 --> 02:43:20,380
hard to find now and he's like i can't find a samus anywhere do you know what other figure

1774
02:43:20,380 --> 02:43:26,700
or amiibo figure is really hard to find right now what's that kirby i don't have a kirby in

1775
02:43:26,700 --> 02:43:33,580
my collection and i i right now you it's like uh at least an american one i think it costs

1776
02:43:33,580 --> 02:43:39,500
like 35 dollars yeesh so yeah i'm like it's the first one i got

1777
02:43:42,460 --> 02:43:50,220
but yeah i think the japanese version is like 18 16 so it's not that uh difficult to find but

1778
02:43:50,220 --> 02:43:55,580
yeah it's kind of expensive all right awesome yes it's because it's getting rare to find

1779
02:43:58,940 --> 02:44:02,780
all right well uh akuma jp i'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up the show all righty

1780
02:44:04,380 --> 02:44:10,700
oh i'm sorry i'm having a arigato sorry i'm chatting with akuma jp in chats right now

1781
02:44:10,700 --> 02:44:14,140
that's what i get for multitasking during the show is he sent me a message on something else

1782
02:44:14,140 --> 02:44:19,420
so sorry about that sorry act deft uh anything else on your mind before i let you go

1783
02:44:20,780 --> 02:44:22,860
okay thanks for having me thank you bye

1784
02:44:24,780 --> 02:44:29,260
i can't handle it i'm malfunctioning rob the robots breaking down we gotta end the show

1785
02:44:29,340 --> 02:44:34,540
calling people by the wrong name that's what you get when people private message me during the show

1786
02:44:36,220 --> 02:44:40,540
usually i just won't even call him dark sakura usually i was messaging you usually i don't even

1787
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:43,820
look at my private messages during the show but sometimes i'm like all right i'll try to

1788
02:44:43,820 --> 02:44:48,620
multitask a little bit and then that's what happens i call somebody the wrong name but anyway uh

1789
02:44:48,620 --> 02:44:53,340

1800
02:45:45,740 --> 02:45:51,740
i'm done i'm over it i've had it officially loki your final thought tonight um since i am kind of

1801
02:45:51,740 --> 02:45:56,620
low on data for my plan and probably won't be playing too much ingress on wednesday maybe i'll

1802
02:45:56,620 --> 02:46:01,340
work on my game instead all right that seems like a fair compromise we'll see all right we'll see

1803
02:46:01,900 --> 02:46:05,980
but then level eight is so maybe there's a wi-fi somewhere that you could use

1804
02:46:07,420 --> 02:46:12,700
and well it's just i am now we'll see all right and last but not least dark soccer your final
