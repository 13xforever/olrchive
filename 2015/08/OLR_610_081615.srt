Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Another gaming event comes to San Francisco. With a mere four and a half months left in the year,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Sony announces that the PlayStation experience will happen this December in San Francisco's Moscone West.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There's this, Disney, Nintendo, and more, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 610 for this, August the 16th of 2015.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You can find me on Twitter, at SKIE, and over there, joining me in Studio, live as she always does,

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
say hello to the one and only, at DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, who just leveled up according to her phone beep up there.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No, that's my husband texting me, because he's weird.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I feel, am I out of place, because I'm like the one person who doesn't have video gaming noises as the text message alerts on the phone.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, get with the program.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I know, I need to get with the modern times, I guess. I don't know, I just, I hardly ever have the sound on anyway,

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
because I hate being that, not that I'm, I'm totally not criticizing you, I'm just going to sound bitchy and it's not,

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but I hate being that guy who's like, phone goes off right in the middle of something else.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So it's like, I'm always on vibrate, so I don't know.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It was just like, right at perfect time too. Well, your sound on my phone is the Enkindle This from Blasto.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh. In Mass Effect. I thought at one point you had me as, it was either a Golden Girls thing, or it was Shoes from Kelly.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I never had either of those on my phone. I thought for some reason. Your ringtone was, let me borrow that top.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, alright. But now I think I gave you Castlevania. So I was in the right ballpark.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No, Dan is Castlevania on my phone. I was going to give you the Metroid level up. I'll take that.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It was too long to make as your text sound. I'll take that. So I gave you something different.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But like Becky, she has, there's a new message for you at your private terminal.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And then like, Grandpa is the Star Trek communicator sound. And Dan's the one up.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alan sets all those little text tones on his phone and he has a specific one set up for Ingress.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You know that little GPS game we play? So he actually has one that says...

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Does it go NERD?

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh hi, Techmaster Loki. How are you? Here to make your witty, insightful commentary as always, I see.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I am.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hold on, I don't know what the hell I have for you.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It does not say nerd. It says, it's Joker from Mass Effect going Commander, we're under attack, or something like that.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So anytime we hear that, it's like, jump, get the phone, recharge, recharge. Somebody's trying to take our nodes.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay, your ringtone is Brinstar from Metroid.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, I'm alright with that. When do I ever call you though? Like not to...

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You don't?

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Well it's text message, but I text you all the time.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah, and because I have my watch now, I usually just voice text back.

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There you go. The whole Dick Tracy thing going on there with your little watch. Anyway...

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Bold. It's Power Rangers. Use the terminology the kids will understand.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Sorry, excuse me. Back when I was your age, it was all about that Dick Tracy movie with...

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I almost said with Dick Tracy. No shit Sherlock. Warren Beatty and Madonna. Remember Madonna? Vogue?

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That was Dick Tracy.

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That movie was pretty awful.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It was very awful.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But she was amazing because it was Madonna as Breathless Mahoney.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's right. Anyway, hi chat room. We do tape live every Sunday night, of course.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
At the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com. V-O-G network.com.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And if you are listening live, you should be participating in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Where people are actually talking about their various ringtones.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Act deaf saying, I have Balloon Fight and Super Smash Brothers. 64 sounds for my notifications and stuff.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I think a lot of people, you know, not to bring up, you know, it's still a sore spot for a lot of people,

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
but with the Iwata passing, you know, a lot of people, I think, did things related to Balloon Fight and Kirby

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and some of the things he was very very heavily involved with, as a bit of a tribute.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So, I totally get that. I think that's really cool.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's see, TigerClaw says, my phone's ringtone is a dubstep remix of the Zelda theme.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Dare I ask what a dubstep remix of the Zelda theme sounds like?

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So I have to pause because I'm gonna have to link this to the chat room.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Okay.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I found the picture, I was looking at the, 15 years ago was the first Teen Choice Award,

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and I found the picture of Christina Aguilera that they got the inspiration for Maria in, or was it Mary or Maria?

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Either the character in Silent Hill 2.

64
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Mmm.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The outfit.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
So I'm gonna post that in the chat room.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Alright, that's very random, but okay.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's video game related, shut up, don't touch me.

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Okay, here's the thing. Now I have to give background, because the internet's gonna be like, that woman has Tourette's,

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
she always just jumps in with something really random.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Before the show, DarkSakura and I were talking live in studio about cosplay.

73
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So now she has cosplay on the brain.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Because I was talking a little bit about how I'm going to do my first, like, major cosplay effort I've ever done.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And, you know, I've dabbled in cosplay, I've experimented with cosplay.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I hung out with cosplay in the closet for two minutes for a little bit.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Coffee with it.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yeah, when Rama and I, er, Rama loaned me his Black Mage costume.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I wore that around Katsucon many years ago.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And I've done, like, a few things here and there.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But, like, my first, like, actual cosplay, I'm doing a DragonCon.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So if you're gonna be in Atlanta in a few weeks, check that out.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There's gonna be actually some panels on the podcasting track you're gonna wanna check out.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm gonna be on a panel about podcasting past, present, and future.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And then Bobby Blackwell's gonna be on another one Monday morning.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And you can hear these all live, and I'll reiterate all this with the times and everything when we get a little closer to the show.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But I will see you there, of course, Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So I'm gonna be doing my first cosplay, but I was talking about how, well, I can use this cosplay since, you know, I'm paying good money for it.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I am having it made. A seamstress here locally who does great work.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She's done stuff for the Rocky Horror Group here.

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I commissioned her to do it, and we went shopping and bought all the fabric and did all that stuff.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So I said, since I'm putting money in this, I'm gonna use this not just for DragonCon, but I will use it for GamerX.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And I'll use it for MagFest and whatever other cons happen to happen in the next few months.

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And so Dark Soccer is like, well, what am I gonna do for GamerX? I gotta think of something I wanna do for GamerX.

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I already had a plan to do this one.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yeah, well, but now you're talking about-

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I have a new idea.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Can we talk about it on the show?

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, let's talk about it. Why not?

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You wanted to do a cross-

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Crossplay.

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Crossplay of Ness.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But you said you've looked up other girls that have cosplayed Ness, and they do the boy Ness, they just happen to be girls.

105
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But you wanna actually kinda give Ness femininity, which is very unlike you.

106
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I know, but I wanna grow up Ness. That's why it's cosplay.

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah.

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So I cannot be me.

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So you're talking about doing like a jean skirt.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No, no, no. I'm talking about doing like a full-on blue circle skirt.

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
A little blue and yellow scoop neck top. I found the t-shirt to modify.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Mm-hmm.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And, you know, like a belt, and maybe some girl shoes.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Ooh.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But then I was talking about, well, then I should do Paula.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Obviously.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We'll have to get you a yellow mullet.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Which is gonna look weird, because I really don't wanna shave my red beard, but if I do it, I'm gonna do it for art.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No, no, don't bother with shaving it. Just leave it.

123
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Just leave it?

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Just leave it.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yeah. There is red in her.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But we were thinking doing, what, red headphones instead of like the bow that she has.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yeah.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And then like a peach sweater type of thing instead of like the dress. It would be like a sweater with a white collar.

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Pop the collar, bro.

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah, exactly.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
So anyway.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You're gonna be bro'd out Paula. You'll just be Paul.

134
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And I'll be Nessa.

135
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Kaijuto in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says,

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm gonna be dressed as a rare amiibo and not show up to the con.

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, there you go. Or you would be-

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Wait, you show up to GameStop instead?

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Or will you be stuck in the port of San Francisco in the midst of a strike? Isn't that the old excuse?

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
All right, look, we can talk about cosplay and so forth, but I want to get into the show and get into tonight's gaming news.

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And I want to get into our kickoff topic tonight.

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There is a lot going on this weekend with the Disney-centric expo, D23, which-

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And here I thought it was just a really oddly shaped dice.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a brand new thing they're using. It's Dungeons and Dragons 5.0. Get used to it.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
D23 is happening.

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And speaking of cosplay, our pal Victoria and Bobby, they do some mean- not Bobby Black Wolf, but this is a female Bobby, Barbara.

147
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
They're doing some mean cosplay at D23 right now.

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They did characters from Inside Out yesterday, right?

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because Bobby did let Sadness and Victoria was the despair.

150
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Disgust.

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Disgust.

152
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I haven't seen the movie. Don't judge me.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I want to.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Judging.

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I want to, but I just never get out of the movies.

156
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And then today, Victoria went as a Mouseketeer, but she did the whole, like-

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
She went as one of the Mouseketeers.

158
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes. She went and she painted her entire body in the black and white makeup.

159
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
For those of you that happen to watch RuPaul's Drag Race, because you all know that's my favorite show on TV,

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
if you remember what Detox did for the Season 5 reunion, that's what Victoria did for Mouseketeer.

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Imagine troll cosplay, but as a Mouseketeer with no horns.

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Something like that. Something like that.

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So anyway, so D23's happening and our friends dressed up, but there's a lot of announcements coming out of D23, right?

164
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
For one, I know this is a video game show, but inherently, if I love Disney and I love video games,

165
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm going to love Wreck-It Ralph, probably.

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And I'm also probably going to love Tron, probably depending on my age, or I'll love both.

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And can we just talk about the ride in Shanghai?

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And how, like, you know, I think China would be a really beautiful place to see,

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
and the Great Wall I'm sure is one of the most fantastic, majestic things you'll ever see.

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But it was like, am I really going to be able to save the money and go to China? Probably not.

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But now, now that I know there's a Tron light cycle ride in Shanghai, do we have any listeners in China?

172
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Or are we blocked in China? Because if we have any listeners in China,

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I need you to take me to Disneyland in Shanghai and ride the Tron thing, because that is going to be amazing.

174
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So that's one great thing that's coming out of D23.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And, you know, if you do follow the parks, what, they talked about Star Wars land is going to be happening?

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's a real thing. And there's some other gaming things we're going to get into a little later.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But of course, Disney video games, they come together into a franchise I'm sure everybody out there knows

178
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and probably has played a lot of, Kingdom Hearts. And so, Kingdom Hearts 3, everybody's really anticipating this game,

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
even though it's probably not coming out until the year 2021.

180
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I will probably get to Shanghai before Kingdom Hearts 3 actually releases, but we'll see.

181
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And so there's been a lot of talk about, well, what worlds are we going to see in Kingdom Hearts 3?

182
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We can kind of guess some from the trailer, and I think they did say the world of Tangled previously was going to be one.

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Wasn't that their big E3 announcement about Kingdom Hearts 3? Was it Tangled?

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That world is going to be Flynn Rider and Rapunzel and all that was going to be in Kingdom Hearts 3.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I think they said that at E3. Now at D23, they actually said that now Big Hero 6 will be one of the worlds as well in Kingdom Hearts.

186
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And that's pretty awesome. You know, I have to be honest again, because I hardly ever get out to movies anymore.

187
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I did not see the movie, but I heard a lot of great things about it. I want to see the movie.

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And I like the fact that it's something really different. Not that, you know, I don't love the classic Disney franchises as well.

189
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But this shows that, you know, between Tangled and now Big Hero 6, it seems like Disney might be going for a much more modern approach with some of the games or some of the lands that they're putting in the game.

190
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And maybe this means we will see things like Wreck-It Ralph, although, I don't know, getting the other video game properties.

191
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I think if they do Wreck-It Ralph, it's going to be limited to the Sugar Rush or whatever, the go-kart land.

192
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Because those were all original creations. It wasn't really based on anything. So you'd probably see that.

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But I think we're definitely going to see things like Frozen and things that are kind of like the newer Disney properties.

194
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You'll probably see a lot of hopefully some Pixar as well.

195
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But I was just curious, what do you guys think of this whole Big Hero 6 coming to Disney?

196
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Ooh, and the fact that that's a Marvel. Big Hero 6 is based on a Marvel thing.

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You know, it's not Iron Man or anything big like that, but it's still a Marvel property. So we're seeing that being dipped into.

198
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm curious what you guys think in chat about that. What do you guys think about this?

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Dark Sakura, you excited for Big Hero 6 in Kingdom Hearts 3?

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Maybe.

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Maybe? A little bit?

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'd be excited when I have the game in my hands.

203
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So it's one of those things where it's like, I'm not going to get excited about anything because I'm going to be hyped for five years while I wait for this game to come out.

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Logie?

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't know. I haven't seen Big Hero 6 yet. I'm aware of it. It's cool, I guess.

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, it still gives you a sense of the direction Disney's going with it, right?

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
No, not really. It doesn't. Because it's just a hodgepodge of stuff that they throw at the guys sometimes.

208
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's fair, that's fair. Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

209
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
ActDeaf says, I'm excited for Kingdom Hearts 3 in general.

210
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Tigerclaw says, for Wreck-It Ralph, I don't think Disney could get the permission to use the other video game characters that show up in the movie.

211
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I am disappointed with their announcement of the Hannah Montana world, though.

212
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There is no Hannah Montana world, be quiet.

213
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Dungeon Buster, she twerks now. They wouldn't be able to get Hannah Montana. She kind of went...

214
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
She could be summoned.

215
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
She could summon and she could come in like a wrecking ball and take out all the enemies.

216
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Dungeon Buster says, Disney World Hollywood's getting a big Toy Story area.

217
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Now Buzz Lightyear doesn't have to fight alone in Tomorrowland.

218
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Toy Story, I would say you could definitely... I mean, if they are going to dip into the Pixar stuff, I think Toy Story would be at the top of the list of what they're probably going to bring into the game.

219
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Let's see, also William Murderface says, they need to be careful with how much they try to throw in.

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Those are all some good comments from our chat room over at live.vog network.com.

221
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yeah, we don't want them to go overboard.

222
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
They are going to have to limit it to X number of areas and then just kind of, you know, go with it.

223
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And there's going to be things left out that we're going to be pissed off about.

224
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I know, it's going to be disappointing that they will be available for DLC in part of the season pass.

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm sure. I'm sure. DLC for sure. It will be the stuff you want most.

226
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Tiger Claw says, I'm surprised they didn't use some of their other Pixar movies such as A Bug's Life in these games.

227
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's because A Bug's Life really is, like, if you take the list of Pixar movies from best to worst, Bug's Life is going to be near the bottom.

228
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry to say.

229
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And at Disneyland, like, California Adventure, the Bug's Life area, I mean, it's for kids, so you can't hold it to the same standards.

230
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But it's starting to feel a little dated just because that movie is getting dated.

231
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I think the only reason there is a Cars 3 movie even coming out at all is because Cars Land at Disney is pretty fucking amazing with the special effects just in the way it looks and visual and all that.

232
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I mean, it's just stunning. It's very modern, especially if you see it at night.

233
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Bug's Land? Eh, it could probably use some redoing, but it would cost a lot of money to do so.

234
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But, I don't know. That's just me. And I hate the movie thing they have for Bug's Life at California Adventure.

235
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't know if you guys have seen that or been to that. That movie thing is really awful.

236
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So, and I think I heard they were getting rid of it. They didn't get rid of it, but they've just moved other stuff in there.

237
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But they did, they've done the same thing to Captain EO, which is sad. I mean, I know Captain EO had to go some day, but...

238
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's a land that needs to be...

239
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What? Captain Eoland?

240
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Captain EO in...

241
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Or just Neverland Ranch?

242
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Kingdom Hearts 3.

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh, Captain EO as a... I think that should be a summon.

244
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Of course, then you'd have to get the estate of Michael Jackson to sign off on that. It's probably not going to happen.

245
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Probably not going to happen.

246
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Just saying. I think Lucas has to get... No, because Lucas is part of Disney now, so that would be a little easier there.

247
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't know. Anyhow.

248
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That would be amazing, though.

249
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Alright. Let's move on. We're going to talk more about some of the news out of D23 as we move on with the show.

250
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
There's, of course, been some other related Disney announcements.

251
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And, of course, we'll get to your thoughts on Disney or anything else that's been going on in the gaming world.

252
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
When we get to the Skype line later in the show, add us on Skype. Be our friend.

253
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

254
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You can also do it the old school way, 1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the US and Canada.

255
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We'll get to that a little later on, though. It's going to be when we get towards the end of the show.

256
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,000
For now, though, let's get into what we get into towards the top of every show and talk about how is your gaming week?

257
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What are the types of video games that you played this week? Dark Soccer.

258
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Dragon Age Inquisition.

259
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Ah, yes, because the new DLC came out, right?

260
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Exactly, and I had to fight to get it working because for some reason it read the beta version that I had and wouldn't install properly on my regular one.

261
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So I had to do a whole bunch of futzing with it and then I'd have to, like, unload my mods and reload my mods to actually get the thing to load.

262
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And then I played through, like, all of it until, like, midnight last night.

263
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And yeah, it's pretty good. And there's more I haven't done yet.

264
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Because after you've beaten the DLC, you get a ton more exploration shit to do.

265
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And it's just, like, if you like the lore and dwarves, it's perfect.

266
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Now, that was something you were mentioning to me before the show is that, you know, you go so far with the lore as to, you know, you're doing some of the fanfic and some of the, you know, just really, like, deeper discussion about the story of what's going on with Dragon Age.

267
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
So did this DLC just give you, like, a whole new, like, it's like, oh my gosh, this is a whole new encyclopedia to work with.

268
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Not so much for my story for, actually, yeah, it did because with where I'm going with my story, it helps give me a little bit more of a sandbox to play in.

269
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But I'm not going to touch that too often because I started too much because I already started writing before the DLC was out.

270
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But nothing, at least that I've written, has counteracted the DLC, so that's good.

271
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah, I was going to say, did you get into that awkward position of the DLC, like, totally did something opposite that was your vision that you had to fill in the gaps?

272
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Not really.

273
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
How do fanfic writers deal with that? Is that a curiosity?

274
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Some just stop writing, and others just say, well, I know this is different, but I've already started writing, so screw it.

275
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So it's kind of like one of those things where it's like we don't acknowledge the alternate universe or whatever?

276
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Well, no, no, no.

277
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The J.J. Abrams timeline isn't real?

278
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Every piece of fanfiction is technically not canon.

279
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:51,000
They're your interpretation of canon or an alternate universe or expansion on what's in your head, but it's not canon, even if it says it follows the story canonically.

280
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, it's following canon, but every single independent thought that you write for the character is not necessarily canon.

281
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And simply because you can't expect that the people, I don't want to say the real writers, but you know what I mean, the ones that get paid to actually do the script for the game.

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The creators of said canon.

283
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yes, they're not out there reading all that, there's too much fan, they might read some of it, but they don't read all of it.

284
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
And some of it they probably, quite frankly, stay away from.

285
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Actually, quite a few of them on Twitter think that there's really interesting theories out there from fanfiction and discussions and have entertained a few things.

286
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And even a couple of them even said, yeah, you guys are awfully close to it, we can't say who's close to it, but there's some people out there who are really close to where we're going.

287
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But in the end, canon is in the hand of the creators.

288
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And what we're talking about really close to where the story's going, we're talking about all the cross-species sex. That's exactly where we're going.

289
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I think that's the type of fanfic the creators tend to not look at, just kind of leave to the back alleys of the internet.

290
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Anyway, so that's it, Dragon Age DLC and exploring all that, probably took a lot of time.

291
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It had shiny moments, I'll leave it at that.

292
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Fair enough. Loki, how was your gaming week?

293
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't really remember what I played this week. I know I did play more of the Windows 10 beta edition of Minecraft.

294
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:25,000
That client's actually really good. It runs way better than the Java version by, like, miles.

295
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It is still beta though, so it's missing a lot of things.

296
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Like, for example, there's no steel doors, there's no pistons, a lot of the crafting stuff.

297
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
For example, you can craft a bow and arrow, but there's no arrows.

298
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So you just have unlimited arrows, which is kind of weird.

299
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But it runs super smooth. You can set the draw distance to forever and it just runs like crazy.

300
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
So I'm really digging that.

301
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So once they get that patched up to where the PC version is now on the Java version, I think that's going to be pretty awesome.

302
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Definitely check that out. Especially if you own a copy of Minecraft, it's free.

303
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So go download the beta client, because it's awesome.

304
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
With that, I also played...

305
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Oh god, what else did I play this week? I don't know.

306
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Like, I just kind of played a bunch of different random things.

307
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I bought more games. I bought that Namco bundle.

308
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Installed Ridge Racer, but I haven't played that yet.

309
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I did, unfortunately and embarrassingly, play a little bit of Sakura Clicker.

310
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's another clicker game, but it's with big-breasted anime chicks.

311
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:46,000
So, you know, you're attacking monsters, but it's just really more big-breasted anime chicks.

312
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But I played it for 45 fucking minutes!

313
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm sucked into these stupid clicker games.

314
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm just like, okay, this is going to be stupid, it's free, whatever, I'll just check it out.

315
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And you tap the titty over and over?

316
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yeah, and they're like, ah, ah, ah, ooh, eh.

317
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And of course the cat girl's like, meow, meow.

318
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, there's a cat?

319
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Oh yeah, they're all different. They have bears, they have cats, there's like slimes, all sorts of weird stuff.

320
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
So you start by tapping. Usually in these games you click the same thing over and over again.

321
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Like in Cookie Clicker you're always clicking a cookie, right?

322
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
So you're clicking a titty in this game, but what, the titty changes?

323
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And then suddenly it's a cat?

324
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah, it's another creature. They have all sorts of just scantily clad women in it.

325
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And I don't know, there's really no point to the game.

326
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But for some stupid reason, I was brain dead this afternoon, and so I played about 45 minutes of it.

327
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm like, oh god, why am I playing this so long?

328
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Fifth Dream in Chat says, Sakura Clicker is great, I've played it for a lot of hours.

329
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's a whole girl, not just a titty.

330
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah, it's not just titties, it's just, you know, it's an anime.

331
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But like, you know, their DLC or whatever you can buy for it, it's like costumes for like the hero girl.

332
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Which is like, whatever, you don't even need to do that.

333
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But yeah, so I played that for like 45 minutes today.

334
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
What else did I play? I played...

335
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I can't believe...

336
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I played Grand Theft Auto! I played Grand Theft Auto 5 for like 5 minutes.

337
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Because my son likes watching my old YouTube videos, and so I have one that I did that was Breaking Rad.

338
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Which was, you know, with Trevor Phillips.

339
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It was set to like, you know, the theme music from the 80s movie that was so amazing, Rad.

340
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And so it's just BMX stuff.

341
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So I was like, oh cool, I can play the game and do that again, you know.

342
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And so I was playing that and riding around on a bike and shooting people with explosive bullets.

343
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
So that was fun. I played that for a bit. Need to go back and play that some more.

344
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Good times.

345
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yep. And then I worked on...

346
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I didn't really work on my game this week, I worked on my website and logos and stuff.

347
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Game related, but just not quite games.

348
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Let me guess, StubbornLoki, after all the talk last week about Jamie or Cody or somebody else out there helping you on your logo, you're just doing it yourself.

349
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Because that's how you roll.

350
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Cody, I never heard back from him.

351
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Someone never messaged me.

352
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I know, I didn't message you. And it's because I wanted to do it myself.

353
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And then I finally found a logo that I thought looked nice.

354
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I didn't want to stop and ask for directions. I'll figure it out.

355
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Exactly. So, I...

356
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Typical.

357
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I found... Well, the thing is, you know, I didn't have any direction to go with it.

358
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I didn't know what I wanted. I just wanted... I'd know it when I see it. You know, type of thing.

359
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And so I...

360
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
When I see the McDonald's that we go left at, I'll know.

361
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So yeah, I've been learning how to do a lot of web stuff because, you know, it's a lot...

362
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Web development has gotten so much, you know, more involved since GeoCities, so, you know.

363
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I know. I remember when I could write a web page by hand in HTML markup.

364
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You can still do that. It's just a pain in the ass.

365
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You'll look like a GeoCities page.

366
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Just saying, I can code CSS by hand.

367
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Can you? Great. Fixhornslaungeradio.com.

368
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That's PHP, Rob.

369
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh.

370
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Shows you how much I know.

371
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Alright. Is that it for your gaming week?

372
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Yeah, that's gonna be it. And then, of course, this week I'm gonna be playing Goat Simulator because I just bought that.

373
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I played that a little bit on Xbox One. And well, I am PC.

374
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
You know what would be, though, a fun game? Not fun, but fun in a really disgusting way?

375
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
What?

376
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Goat Stimulator.

377
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Where you work at a goat farm.

378
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Okay. I was gonna tease him for the whole titty clicker thing, but now you're talking about Goat Milker or whatever you're talking about.

379
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You guys, Goat Simulator.

380
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I've got screenshots. Let's pull up some screenshots, shall we? Or we'll just hit play.

381
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Of course. Of course. He pulls up Steam and it's defaulted to Sakura Clicker.

382
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Because I was just playing that before I came here. I told you. 45 minutes this afternoon.

383
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
48 minutes. I stand corrected.

384
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You know, Steam does have it.

385
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Are you getting trading cards?

386
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
No! There's no achievements. So, really, there is absolutely no reason for me to play this.

387
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Okay.

388
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
But, yeah, see, here's what the game looks like.

389
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Oh, God.

390
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And so you just...

391
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's it. And I'm fighting the witch.

392
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Because I know it's radio.

393
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
And, see, look. That's a panda bear.

394
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Oh, my God.

395
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm fighting a panda bear.

396
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:23,000
These various... Okay, when he says he's fighting a panda bear, it's a girl dressed up with a little tiny panda bear coming out of her panties that she's wearing.

397
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
And her bra and panties happen to be a black and white pattern.

398
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
What? A dragon?

399
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
That's not a dragon. That's a girl in a very revealing dragon costume.

400
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Showing a lot of side boob.

401
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
There's a bear.

402
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Okay, these are not...

403
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
See, I'm thinking in my mind of actual animals.

404
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,000
No, it's just... It's pretty anime ladies in unrealistic proportions dressed up as creatures.

405
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
All right, Loki, you're crazy. I love it.

406
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
All right, Mike, give me a week.

407
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So, believe it or not, not a lot of Final Fantasy XIV this week.

408
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I know that's usually my go-to game, but I think I've kind of worn that game out for right now.

409
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm trying to still do enough content where I'm getting my tomes every week so I can get my gear.

410
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
But I'm kind of burned out on that.

411
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I actually went back to a game that I've been playing a lot of in the past, Diablo III, because I read that Season 3 is ending.

412
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
And so now I'm like, oh, shit, I didn't unlock everything.

413
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I still need to get 400 achievement points so I can get my portrait.

414
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:26,000
So I've been working on Diablo III, hoping I can just barely make the buzzer on that before they end Season 3,

415
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
which I think I have about another week.

416
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And then Season 4 will be starting on, I think it was the 28th, don't quote me on that, but it's coming up before too long.

417
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So, yeah, I wanted to get that done.

418
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So it's been nice to kind of go back and play a little more Diablo.

419
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Otherwise, new games this week.

420
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
On PlayStation 4, I played two new games that came out this week.

421
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The first one I played a little less of because I'd already played this game on PC,

422
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
but I checked out Gauntlet on the PlayStation 4, or as I think they're calling it, Gauntlet Slayer Edition,

423
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
which is very similar to the Gauntlet on the PC, except of course it's built natively for the controller.

424
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And I think some of the level design and the structures are a little different than the PC version, at least from what I remember in my experience.

425
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
But otherwise, I'll say mostly the same stuff I said the first time about Gauntlet.

426
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
It's a pretty cool little reimagining of the game.

427
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It is different in Diablo in that you're not really on the hunt for gear, you're on the hunt for gold,

428
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
and you turn around and you use the gold to buy gear.

429
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
So you're not going to do these endless grinds that you do in Diablo,

430
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:37,000
but you can do a dungeon randomizer and you'll try to go as far into a randomly generated dungeon as you can,

431
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
which has a lot of the feel of the old game, which yes, I know the old game was not random dungeons,

432
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
but sometimes they felt that way as you started to forget what the levels looked like one after the other.

433
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
So there's that.

434
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Plus the other thing I kind of like about what they do with Gauntlet is that all the different characters have a very different feel in how they play.

435
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
You know, the warrior plays how you would expect a melee class to play.

436
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's not like the old school Gauntlet where the warrior is throwing axes across the room all the time.

437
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
It's not really like that.

438
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But if you go from the warrior and then you go play as the elf, the elf plays like a twin-stick shooter.

439
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Like if you use the R-stick, he's just constantly shooting arrows at the enemies over and over again.

440
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I actually like playing as the elf the best.

441
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,000
And you can use like, if you buy a certain power-up, you can use R1 to like dash and get out of tricky situations.

442
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,000
And then the wizard plays like that game Magica, where like you have a fire button, an ice button, and a lightning button,

443
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
and you can hit like fire, fire, and it'll do a fireball.

444
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Where you hit fire, lightning, and it does like, it does a kind of like a thing that mixes both those elements.

445
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So I think that's kind of neat, because I like that whole little mechanic in Magica as well.

446
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I thought that was pretty cool.

447
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
So it's neat that they've given those characters completely different play styles inside Gauntlet.

448
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And spoiler alert, although it's not that hard to figure out if you check out the leaderboards,

449
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
there's a fifth class that wasn't even in the original game, Necromancer.

450
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
And that's going to be different as well.

451
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I haven't unlocked the Necromancer yet, but...

452
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Oh, I was hoping it was Pojo.

453
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
No, it's not Pojo.

454
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
But the chicken class was the best class, let's be honest.

455
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,000
From what I understand, the Necromancer is like, I don't know, she controls like undead creatures,

456
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
like a summoner or something like that, I don't know, I think is the way it works.

457
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You don't say a Necromancer controls undead.

458
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I know, right? Right?

459
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That's...

460
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Not just a clever name.

461
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
That's just silly.

462
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That's how it plays in the game.

463
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
So there's Gauntlet.

464
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Then the other game I played this week, and I actually played this game from start to finish,

465
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and Dark Sakura watched me play probably the last quarter of it or so today,

466
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
is a brand new game that was on the PlayStation 4 this week called Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

467
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And yes, that's the name of the game, and it's kind of a silly title for a game,

468
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:50,000
but when you start to play the game, you understand that it definitely appears that the rapture has occurred.

469
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You are exploring this world.

470
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
You wake up in a place, and you learn that all the citizens in this town have disappeared.

471
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And you're trying to figure out the why in it.

472
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm going to caution you, because the reviews for this game are going all over the map.

473
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:16,000
And it's because it's a gorgeous game with a really deep story that's very well acted,

474
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
and the music in the game is incredible as well.

475
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's got a great orchestral score to it.

476
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
They do some really neat things where they have choirs singing songs.

477
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
It almost feels like Bioshock Infinite a little bit in some parts.

478
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
They do some really great things with the soundtrack.

479
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
But, here's the thing.

480
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
If you didn't like Gone Home, and you thought that game was pretentious or whatever,

481
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
you're going to hate this game. Don't bother.

482
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Because it's very similar in the aspect that there's not a lot of, and I'm using my quote-y fingers, game.

483
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You're not fighting zombies, although it seems like one's going to jump out behind the door at some point.

484
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You don't really die. There's no risk factor in the game.

485
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:08,000
At the best, the game is that you're chasing a ball of light, and the ball of light kind of helps you know maybe where to go next.

486
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
But one thing I learned after my first playthrough of the game is that if you just follow the ball around,

487
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and don't bother to do any of your own exploring, you're not going to get the entire story.

488
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:25,000
The ball of light will show you those cutscenes you have to see, but it's not going to show you everything.

489
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Anyway, I don't want to give away too much of the game or what have you, but I just want to caution you.

490
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:39,000
If you are not into the idea of an interactive story, as opposed to maybe a game, then you're probably going to want to pass on this game.

491
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:47,000
However, I will say, for those that are going with the whole video games or art thing, this game is a work of art.

492
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And it's one of those games, not just, is it gorgeous?

493
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I mean, Dark Soccer, you were watching the game on PlayStation 4. It's a gorgeous game, right?

494
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I just told Dan that we need to buy this.

495
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
The graphics, I mean, it goes, and you were noticing, wow, the times of day change.

496
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,000
The one thing that bothered me was the trees and grass. You had wind effects, but none of the environment moved.

497
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,000
So it made, but it actually added to the atmosphere to me, and that it made it seem like you were stuck at a time.

498
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Like you were an outside observer, like you were dropped and time had been frozen for the moment that you were there.

499
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
It was very metaphysical.

500
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
SSJ100Matt says, let me guess, is it preachy? No, and I think that might be where they're going to regret the title,

501
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:37,000
because people are going to make the assumption that their game has a lot of religious tones in it, and actually it doesn't.

502
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But, well, I will say this. There is a preacher character in the game, and so there are some religious tie-ins,

503
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:53,000
but the game itself, and there's, I gotta be careful, I don't want to spoil things, but there's also not a lot to spoil,

504
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
because a lot is left up to interpretation, I believe. I don't think the game is really about the rapture.

505
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:09,000
God, I have a comparison to make, but I have a feeling it would be a little spoilery if I made it.

506
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
We better not. We'll wait a few weeks, then maybe talk about it later.

507
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Ask me in chat and I'll tell you what I think it is.

508
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But I will say this. You know, the minute I beat the game, I kind of just wanted to talk to somebody else about it.

509
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You know, and even Dark Sakura and Shane was actually here too, and I was just talking to Shane.

510
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I was like, so does that mean, so that means, you know, and we're just trying to talk it out and figure out what the hell it all meant,

511
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
because there is a lot of it that's opened up to interpretation. That could also frustrate the shit out of some people.

512
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So, in a nutshell, everybody's gone to the rapture. Gorgeous graphics.

513
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I actually think Dark Sakura, what she said about the environment is super, super nitpicky. I don't even think you'll notice it all.

514
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Gorgeous graphics. Well, I mean that in a, you know.

515
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Well, yeah, but I noticed stuff like that.

516
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
It's a fair criticism, but it's so minor in the context of things.

517
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
The graphics is great. The sound in the orchestra, orchestral music is great.

518
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
The voice acting is fantastic and all that.

519
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But as far as where's the game, some of you may be left wanting a little more, because it's more of an interactive work of fiction in that regard.

520
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:26,000
And maybe the one thing that really frustrated me the most is for the first half of the game or so,

521
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I had no real sense of, am I progressing? Am I doing this right?

522
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
What am I, because the game gives you so little to work with, what the hell am I supposed to be doing?

523
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Am I, if there are 10 cut scenes to see in this part of town, did I see them all?

524
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
How do I know? Because I'll tell you this much as well, which is crazy to me.

525
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I beat the game start to finish, right? There's probably like 20 trophies in this game.

526
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I got two of them playing the game from start to finish.

527
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So that tells me there's a lot of game I didn't see.

528
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So it's, I don't know. It's interesting that I couldn't figure that out.

529
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But yet I do have that sense of, maybe I should go back and play it again, because I think there is a lot that I missed.

530
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Now, like if I knew when I started what I knew when I finished, maybe now there's more that I'll be able to uncover.

531
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And I think in that regard, if not only the game can be a work of fiction and get you to play it like that,

532
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
but then make you want to go play it again immediately, I think that's a hell of an accomplishment.

533
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So just kind of something to throw out there.

534
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Alright, I'm looking in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

535
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
DungeonBuster wants to know, how long is the game?

536
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
That could bother some people as well. I would say it was about four hours for me, start to finish.

537
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I bet some people out there could beat it a lot faster, and I bet some will take their time a little more.

538
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
But remember what I just said. I beat the game, and then I wanted to go back and play it again,

539
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
because I realized I think there's a lot of shit I missed that now I know stuff that I didn't know at the beginning I could go back and find.

540
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:05,000
So I'll leave that to you, how much you think you could really get out of a game like that.

541
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Let's see, also going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

542
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Fifth Dream says, at the beginning I was scared a lot. It made me think of PT, and that made me freak out.

543
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
But there was nothing to be scared of. Oh yeah.

544
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And I was actually showing Shane the game for the first time on SharePlay, and I was telling him as I was playing,

545
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm like, every time I open a door, I think Chica's going to jump out and go, and like, bite my head off.

546
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Like, I keep thinking that the game definitely has a very scary ambience to it, but there's nothing, like there are no jump scares in the game.

547
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
And I was telling Bobby Black Wolf before the show, the game is in Bobby Black Wolf mode. You cannot die.

548
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You will not, there's no consequence in the game really, except time wasted running around in circles.

549
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
One last thing I'll say about the game. Tip, if you get the game, hold the R2 button.

550
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,000
In most scenarios, the R2 button will move you faster. They do not say that in the beginning of the game, and I think that's a mistake.

551
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's in the manual, if you bring up the manual and go look at the online manual, and that's the only way I found it.

552
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:19,000
But yeah, I think it was a mistake not to call that out in the game, because if you don't know about the R2 button, some of the, it's going to move really slow.

553
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
For not reading the manual.

554
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Really slow.

555
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
For some people.

556
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
RTFM.

557
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So there you go. That's my thoughts on Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.

558
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,000
A very, I think this is an art piece that I think a lot of, I think you're going to see these Game of the Year awards.

559
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I think this thing's going to get nominated for a ton of them.

560
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
And I think some people are going to say, what a pretentious piece of shit, it shouldn't win all these awards.

561
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
It's going to be the same thing with Gone Home.

562
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I think this is just kind of this year's Gone Home, and it's going to be a lot of the same stuff that you saw happen with that game.

563
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Alright, anyhow, and by the way, for the record, I loved Gone Home.

564
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I actually liked Gone Home a little more than this game, but I thought the graphics and the music and the presentation and some of the things that kind of the game leaves open are a little better in this game.

565
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So I guess they kind of both have their pros and cons, don't they?

566
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Alright, quickly, some housekeeping, and then we'll get into this week's gaming news.

567
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r. We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

568
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
We're also on Google Plus, at google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

569
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
We will not be here over Labor Day weekend.

570
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:41,000
That is because, as I mentioned earlier in the show, I will be at DragonCon with some of my other buddies from the Voice of Geeks Network, including Travis from Under Sedation Live, Bobby from the Bobby Black Wolf Show,

571
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:48,000
some of the guys from Critical Myth are going to be there, and I believe Brian from British Invaders also making the trip out from Canada to be there.

572
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:58,000
So there's going to be quite a bit of VOG representation around the show, and I'll give you more information about what panels to look out for and what to tune into online.

573
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,000
If you can't make the show, I'll get you that a little closer to the actual date of DragonCon, which is Labor Day weekend.

574
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,000
But we will not be here live because of it, but I'm sure so many of you are going to be going to cons of your own or on trips.

575
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I know PAX is the same weekend. There will probably be some gaming news out of that. It's going to be a busy weekend, but we will not be here that weekend.

576
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news for the week. And speaking of expos, right, Loki?

577
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yes, this is pretty exciting. I don't know if I can go, but it's going to be much closer this year.

578
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
But the PlayStation Experience 2015 is going to be held in San Francisco as opposed to Las Vegas last year.

579
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
It's going to take place December 5th and 6th, and will be at Moscone West.

580
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I don't know when tickets are going to be available, but you can check out the official PlayStation Experience website, which is really long.

581
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Just look for PlayStation Experience on PlayStation.com.

582
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I'm happy, well, the selfish part of me, completely 100% selfish part of me is happy that they moved into San Francisco because now I could go without having to take time off work.

583
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:14,000
So the chance that I could actually attend the event this year is way higher than it was in previous years, or previous year, really.

584
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:26,000
So, yeah, that's exciting. Although, it is the week before GamerX, which VOG Network is actually a sponsor of, so doing both back to back is going to be a little tiring.

585
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,000
But, you know, it's not like, you know, San Francisco is only a two hour drive, so it's doable. It's doable.

586
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Interesting, because Jason, who does the voiceovers for our show, like in the beginning, he was actually texting me, he's like,

587
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Wow, weren't you guys just talking about PlayStation Experience last week on the show? And I was like, what are you talking about? They just announced it this week.

588
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:52,000
He's like, no, no, no, but you were, you were talking about something that kind of led to you talking about where's PlayStation Expo and aren't they going to announce things?

589
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And yeah, I think last week we were talking about Gamescom and that it was kind of Microsoft heavy. We didn't hear a lot, a lot out of Sony.

590
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
We heard some, but not a lot. It kind of begs the question, was Sony going to do their own thing? And here we are.

591
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:14,000
And some interesting things that I was reading around the internet as to why they do this, and I thought this was a very smart theory, why this PlayStation Expo is working very well for them.

592
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Because by doing this expo around the holidays, when there's not usually a lot of gaming news otherwise, everybody's talking about what?

593
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
During the holidays, PlayStation.

594
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Hanukkah.

595
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
And that's, well, and what they want under their menorah for Hanukkah is a PlayStation because there's all this-

596
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
The Hanukkah bush, get it right.

597
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I think, I think it's very well timed how they do. I thought that was a really interesting theory that PlayStation does this purposely during the holidays to get the conversation around PlayStation right when people are looking to buy that type of stuff for the holidays.

598
00:43:48,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I thought it was pretty clever insight, especially when you consider this year, you know, we've, and we talked about this in the, on previous editions of the show, Sony PlayStation doesn't exactly have a lot of first party games to be putting out there.

599
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So they have to kind of steer the conversation into a different direction and they're really putting a lot of their focus on Street Fighter 5, a lot of focus on Street Fighter 5, No Man's Sky, and some of these other games that are coming out that aren't necessarily-

600
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I mean Morpheus stuff at that point, cause you know, it's almost 2016 at that point.

601
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Well, maybe that's, that's a big chunk of what we're going to say. I mean, if, if the Morpheus is indeed spring 2016, maybe the conversation at this PlayStation experience is really going to focus on Morpheus and it's going to get people to go, Oh, I want that.

602
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Make sure you put a PlayStation 4 under my Hanukkah bush or my Christmas tree or whatever it is, your Festivus pole for that's what I want.

603
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:51,000
So, uh, very, very interesting. So, um, I hope to go, did they say tickets are on sale yet or they didn't really say, cause they'll probably sell out in 15 minutes.

604
00:44:51,000 --> 00:45:04,000
So I'll, uh, I'll have to just hope I can get one. So, cause I, I feel like I'm only going to be able to go on Saturday just because of the working situation and everything, but I'd love to go just at least for a day. I think it'd be a lot of fun.

605
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Well, maybe one game that will show up at the PlayStation experience, you know, again, one of those games that Sony has been pushing a lot, even though this game is supposed to be on Xbox one as well.

606
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:25,000
But I think that when a lot of people think of Sony, they think of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy 15. It's been announced this week that Final Fantasy 15 will get a worldwide simultaneous launch.

607
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:34,000
This was in an interview with GameSpot. Final Fantasy 15's director Hajime Tabata actually said that Final Fantasy 15 will get a release worldwide.

608
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:45,000
This is noteworthy because typically a lot of Square Enix games come out in Japan, you know, a good six months even before they're out here. Like Final Fantasy 13. I remember, Loki, you imported Final Fantasy 13.

609
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
No, I didn't import Final Fantasy 13. I imported Final Fantasy 13, the demo.

610
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:58,000
The demo of 13 you imported. So it's not uncommon that things come out in Japan much earlier than they are actually released here.

611
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:15,000
But Final Fantasy 14 broke that trend quite a bit. Granted, 14's in a different situation because 14 is an online game. There's a different set of rules that go with that, but I guess it showed that Square can certainly do these simultaneous releases.

612
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:26,000
So a quote from the interview. This may be something that we are a little bit embarrassed to talk about, but really this is the first time that we've done a packaged standalone Final Fantasy game with a simultaneous global launch.

613
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And I'm only letting that comment slide because he said packaged standalone and I'm like, again, 14 launched globally, but anyway.

614
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So we didn't have the setup to deal with that really. The first thing we had to do was rearrange our internal structure to be able to create something that could do that.

615
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:56,000
That was the first important work on the project. And maybe I would think that if you're working on this game and you're in Square right now, a big part of the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One is about that social connectivity.

616
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And you can go onto Twitch TV, the built-in PlayStation 4 viewer right there on your crossbar, and watch people play Japanese games that are only out in Japan right now.

617
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And likewise, people in Japan can watch people play games that are out in the US that are not out in Japan, and Europe can do all the same things as well.

618
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So I think they fully realize, if we release Final Fantasy 15 in Japan first, what's going to happen?

619
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Everybody's just going to watch Twitch streams and get the story that way. It's built right there into the PlayStation 4.

620
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,000
And they'll just get their fill of the story that way. You know somebody's going to run that channel that's like, I'm going to play Final Fantasy 15 and I'll translate as I go.

621
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
And somebody who's very well-versed in Japanese and English can play through the game and translate everything as they go.

622
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:49,000
So I think they kind of see that we, and I've been saying this for years as I think a lot of us have, we now live in a world economy of sorts.

623
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You know, with the internet having us all connected, no more can you release a game over here and not expect any news about it to never make its way over here.

624
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:07,000
When Nintendo re-skinned Doki Doki Panic and made it Super Mario Bros. 2, they could kind of keep that a secret because there was no internet.

625
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
There was magazines. They could kind of control that information.

626
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Most people in America didn't know for years and years and years that Super Mario Bros. 2 was a completely different game in Japan.

627
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Nobody really knew that until the Mario lost levels and all that stuff.

628
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
How did no one notice that? It looks completely different. It plays completely different. It doesn't make any sense.

629
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Color palette was different.

630
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Well, because we didn't have their Super Mario Bros. 2.

631
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yeah, but seriously though, it's like, what?

632
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
But now that the internet is out there, could Nintendo ever do something like that? No.

633
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So, you know, because it would be out there on the internet in a minute that, you know, this is what they've done and they changed the game and it has a different name and all this other stuff.

634
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
It would just be out there the instant.

635
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
They took Tomb Raider and they re-skinned it to Mario and now it's Mario.

636
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's Mar-Rader.

637
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Anyway, Final Fantasy XV is going to be launching globally and I think that's good news for Final Fantasy fans here in the state and in Europe.

638
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Is that we will not have to wait for the game to be translated and all that localized because they're doing it simultaneously just like they're doing it for Final Fantasy XIV, so it makes sense.

639
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Let's move on. Dark Sakura.

640
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
This is happy news. Happy. Everyone, happy.

641
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Resident Evil 2 is getting a remake. Booyah.

642
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Because how many different ones have we had for the first one? Like, a million? Or at least three or four?

643
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Well, it looks like there will technically, it's been hinted a lot that there's going to be a possible Resident Evil 2 remake and now it's actually been officially approved.

644
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:53,000
So, we are going to be getting one. There's no details about it, but hopefully it has my favorite line in it.

645
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
It's time to take down Umbrella.

646
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Because it's not raining anymore.

647
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I guess I get why not. You know, a lot of people really love the earlier Resident Evil games, so why not? Especially 2. Why not go back and remake it?

648
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Cap come out of ideas. I mean, is that what I'm hearing here? Because I understand Street Fighter V, which, let's be honest, it's not that different from Street Fighter IV.

649
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I mean, you're tweaking things.

650
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Fighting game fans may take issue.

651
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:30,000
I understand that. Whatever. That's fine. I'm talking about just a purely development. I mean, we're not talking like it's completely different. I mean, the systems may be a little bit different.

652
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Okay, fine. Whatever. I'll give you Street Fighter V.

653
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:42,000
But like, they're remaking Mega Man, or they're doing like a collection for Mega Man. They're remaking Resident Evil. They just remade Resident Evil.

654
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It's like, I guess you ran out of ideas. Let's just make all the old games again. I mean, I don't know.

655
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:59,000
Well, this is the one who's actually in charge of the project is Yoshiaki, and I hope they did not just miswrite his name.

656
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Hirabayashi, who is the one who is also behind the last one. And he seems really excited and passionate about it.

657
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
So that first Resident Evil remake must have sold really well for them to be thinking about this.

658
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
I have it. Have I played it? No.

659
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Capcom's gonna go where the money is. And I think, Loki, if you're asking, why are they doing all this? Because that's what people are buying.

660
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Everybody loves nostalgia.

661
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
You know what they love more than nostalgia? The new Mega Man game.

662
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Well, Anna, if you believe Capcom, it's Pochislot.

663
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Well, I bet if that Mega Man collection sells absurdly well, maybe they will do a Mega Man 11.

664
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Or they're gonna bundle a 7, 8, 9, and 10 type of thing. I don't know. We'll see. Anyhow.

665
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Let's move on, Loki.

666
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
So, Phantasy Star Online 2 is coming out for the Playstation 4.

667
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,000
That's pretty great news. And there's a guy wielding a fish. So that's something.

668
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Of course that's in Japan, of course. Not announced over here yet.

669
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
But region free, right?

670
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I mean, I'm sure it's a little bit more complicated when you get into an MMO.

671
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:17,000
But, I don't know. Is it gonna operate the same as Phantasy Star Online did, where you can play offline?

672
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
I don't know.

673
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Yeah, there was a whole single player campaign, and Universe had a great one. Well, I thought.

674
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I liked Universe more than most people did.

675
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I've been wanting to play Phantasy Star Online 2 for forever.

676
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And I realize, yes, there's the whole...

677
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Just recently, we were talking about this too, maybe not even a month ago.

678
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
There's the server now that they took the region restriction off of, so you can get a patched client and do that.

679
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
But it's like, is it too much to ask, with all that being said, for Sega to just kind of officially acknowledge it?

680
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
And just, maybe it's easier said than done. Patch it into English and put it out already.

681
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Maybe it might be a good idea to make something other than Sonic for a change.

682
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Because Sonic ain't working for you right now. So, maybe put up Phantasy Star.

683
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Dungeon Buster in chat says, you can solo a lot in PSO2.

684
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Rama says, Sky, what patch? The region lock is back on.

685
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I don't remember the details. I'm sorry, maybe some of you people that are more tuned into the Phantasy Star Online current goings ons.

686
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I don't think you're playing the same game that the Japanese audience is.

687
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I think it's a different territory. And it's like a year behind in updates from what Japan has.

688
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
But it does have the region restriction gone on it.

689
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
So, it was something I was seeing on Twitter a while back.

690
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It was one of those things where I wanted to play it because I loved Phantasy Star Online.

691
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I love Phantasy Star Universe. But when I see Sega kind of giving us the finger here in the States,

692
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
I kind of just want to give them the finger right back.

693
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
We do. That's why their sales are in the tank for Sonic Boom.

694
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Dungeon Buster says, the server restrictions are back. Oh, that sucks.

695
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
But there's a proxy you can use to get around it. I've been playing for a few weeks now.

696
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,000
There are several versions. The C version is the one everyone avoids.

697
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,000
The Japanese fan translated version is the one people suggest to play if you want to jump through the hoops to do it.

698
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I'm just kind of like, Sega, just acknowledge that I exist. Is it too- Sega, give me a hug.

699
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
That's all I want. Just give me a hug. Please. Please, Sega.

700
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
I defended Phantasy Star Universe on this show. It's not that bad.

701
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:22,000
It's gone now. I think they pulled the plug on the servers years ago. But it wasn't that bad.

702
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Wheeling the two swords in two hands is really awesome, anyway.

703
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Moving on. Well, since we won't have Phantasy Star Online 2 to play in the States,

704
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I guess I can look forward to this game and that makes me very excited.

705
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:42,000
It's Super Mario Maker. Super Mario Maker, some more details were revealed in advance of the September 11th release date,

706
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
which I love that they're releasing this, on Loki's birthday. How appropriate.

707
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I keep watching videos for it. It looks cool.

708
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Yeah, it does look cool.

709
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I'm digging it, but once again, I was at Walmart the other day, because I needed the router fast,

710
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
and I looked at the system like, how much do we use now? $2.99? No, fuck that.

711
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:04,000
That's pretty much what it is. That price is not going to sell me. I'm sorry.

712
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Well, a lot of people are excited about some of the things they saw in the video,

713
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
including a lot of the different features that will be in there and things that you can do to the different levels.

714
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:18,000
But some people are very upset about the whole fact that it will take nine days to unlock all the content.

715
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,000
That's right, they're going to slowly release content. It's not like DLC thing, like what they're doing with Splatoon,

716
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
but it's because you're going to, you go in and you edit a level, and as long as you spend five minutes in the level editor

717
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,000
with the tools that you have, you'll get new tools the very next day.

718
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And I guess the concept behind this is they don't want to overwhelm you by throwing all the tools at you at once,

719
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:51,000
which I kind of get it. I actually kind of get that. And to be fair, LittleBigPlanet gated its stuff as well.

720
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It wasn't a day release, it wasn't a 24 hour time lock, but you did have to play through the single player campaign

721
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,000
to get all the bubbles that would unlock all the mechanics that you would end up using in the level editors,

722
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
especially when it came to cosmetic things.

723
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Okay, so it's a little bit apples to oranges, but I kind of understand the whole, you got to teach somebody to do a simple level

724
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
before they can just do a complicated level. I'm not, I don't know. I saw a lot of outrage on Twitter and stuff at this,

725
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
and I actually like, you know, I'll call Nintendo out when I have a problem with what they're doing,

726
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
but this doesn't seem like the greatest of crimes they've ever committed. It's just nine days.

727
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And I'm sure as a lot of people are figuring out, you could just change the clock on your Wii U.

728
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
We were just talking about time shifting.

729
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
If you need it that bad, just do what you did in Animal Crossing and set the clock ahead, and there you go.

730
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Problem solved. You can unlock everything. But you still will have to spend five minutes with the current set of tools.

731
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I mean, I kind of think it'll be a bigger pain in the ass to set the clock forward all the time than to just fucking wait.

732
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It's not, I mean, I feel like you can do a lot with the tools that'll be there already.

733
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's gonna start a lot of people on creating a very basic level and then improving that level over and over.

734
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I don't know. I just, it's nine days, not thirty. I just think this isn't the biggest deal in the whole wide world.

735
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Loki, you usually, if you've got a problem with Nintendo, you're one to say it. Do you think this is an issue or nah?

736
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
No, because you can just easily take like ten minutes, well probably more than ten minutes,

737
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
but you can take less than an hour to time shift it nine times and just unlock it that way.

738
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:35,000
It's an inconvenience and it's kind of stupid, yes, but whatever. I understand their point, but I don't agree with it.

739
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Alright, well one other thing to point out about Super Mario Maker is that it's going to be compatible with over fifty amiibo.

740
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You don't say. Amiibo support in Super Mario Maker.

741
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
But what it's gonna do is it will allow you to, I guess, place the character in a question mark block,

742
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
so when you play the level, you can transform Mario into that character.

743
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:05,000
There's some exceptions. I think the actual 8-bit Mario amiibo will put mustaches on all the enemies. Silly little things like that.

744
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
But I was, you know, and in the video they show Link...

745
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:12,000
No, that one made Mario super big.

746
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Oh, wait, which one's the one that puts mustaches on the monsters? There's two of them, right?

747
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I don't remember, but like the 8-bit Mario that allowed you to put like a big mushroom into one of the blocks and you can make Mario extra huge.

748
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Got it, that's right, and I remember seeing that as well. So there's maybe one does one and one does the other.

749
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
But anyway, oh, Dartusuya says the giant Mario does both those things, so we're both right.

750
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Okay, but the other thing, and in the video they show Mario turning into Link, and I think they show Wii Fit Trainer in the video as well.

751
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
But if you go look at the list of compatible amiibo, there's some pretty funny ones in there,

752
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
because some of the Animal Crossing characters that are gonna be amiibo are gonna be playable in this game.

753
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Sonic?

754
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Sonic is one of the amiibo! So that means that you can play as Sonic in Mario Bros.

755
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Now, hold on people, I don't mean that you're gonna...

756
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
The universe will implode.

757
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Yeah, you're not gonna be able to spin dash through blocks or anything like that.

758
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:17,000
It's gonna look like one of those crappy 8-bit ROM hacks back in the day, like when people would do like super nude Luigi ball sack or whatever.

759
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:22,000
You know, people did Super Penis Bros., where just everything was a dick that you would play in the game, right?

760
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Remember these ROM hacks? When things like...

761
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Oh God, what was that Nintendo emulator everybody used back in the day?

762
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Nesticle?

763
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Nesticle! Because it had a dirty name. Nesticle. And Genesis, remember?

764
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Everybody had these stupid ROM hacks and patches.

765
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,000
That's what it's gonna look like. You're gonna have Sonic, but it'll play like Mario, which it happens to be Sonic.

766
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And Pac-Man and Mega Man, also on the list.

767
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And Kirby.

768
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And Kirby! So I just think that's hilarious that after all these years, finally, Sonic playable in a Mario game. Like that.

769
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh man, Bloodlust Software. Those guys really knew their stuff back in the day. Wasn't it just one dude?

770
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I don't think it was like a whole team. I thought it was just one dude who was just kind of a...

771
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
I'm curious to see what they look like, because I know they have the 8-bit versions and the Super Mario version.

772
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
But what about other, because you can switch it between Mario 3 and all those.

773
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
They look like the 16-bit versions in Mario World.

774
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
They probably share a lot of the similar looks that they have in Smash Brothers.

775
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I would imagine maybe they recycled some of the shapes and things from that. We'll see.

776
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Well that's pretty cool, because I have a nice growing collection of Amiibo.

777
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Growing way more than it should have, but I kind of like a lot the Amiibo that I have.

778
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
And last week, thanks to AkumaJP, I now have a Pac-Man and a Greninja from Japan.

779
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So hey, I'm happy. I wanted a Pac-Man, because I actually play Pac-Man in Smash Brothers.

780
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
It's like one of my three characters I use all the time.

781
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
So now I have all my actual characters in Smash Brothers.

782
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I have a Ness, I have a Wii Fit Trainer, and I have a Pac-Man.

783
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I had to go to Japan to get, well I didn't actually go to Japan, but I had to turn to the Japanese market to get all of them.

784
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
But I have them.

785
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Almost to release dates, but first, Dark Sakura.

786
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Yes.

787
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Did you play, did you play Nesticle back in the day?

788
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Hell yeah, I had it on Linux.

789
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
On my little teensy netbook, it's what I'd play in class.

790
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I feel like Nesticle ran on my 486.

791
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:38,000
Actually, I didn't play Genesis. I played Gens, which was the only one I had that could play Panorama Cotton.

792
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Oh, right.

793
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Panorama Cotton was notoriously...

794
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
There's always that one game. That one game that you have to play in the emulator.

795
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:51,000
It was just notoriously difficult to run because of all of the scrolling and everything it did.

796
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
So, but back to some Nintendo news.

797
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
They actually pulled a game out of the 3DS eShop because it had been hacked.

798
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Well, not really.

799
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It was one you could use to enable homebrew games and software.

800
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,000
It was a game called Ironfall Invasion.

801
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Basically, they created this thing called the Iron Hacks Exploit, which would let you go get, you know, your own homebrew on there.

802
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
And everyone really, really wanted it.

803
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,000
It was actually announced by a coder named Smeelum, I guess how he goes.

804
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Jordan Smeelum Rabbit.

805
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Who basically posted on Twitter, everyone interested in 3DS homebrew should get Ironfall from the eShop for free.

806
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Tell your friends about it. Please retweet.

807
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
So it was supposed...

808
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
The method was supposed to launch this week.

809
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
And basically, Nintendo yanked it.

810
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,000
And the guy behind it apologized to the developer for causing the removal of the game.

811
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:06,000
But the game was downloaded several hundred thousand times before the exploit was announced.

812
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Of course. Well, the exploit was announced somewhere.

813
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:17,000
They announced which game the expo was going to work with before the exploit was released.

814
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
But look at Cubic Ninja and how expensive that is now.

815
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
It's because there was an exploit in that to run the homebrew channel on there.

816
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
There you go.

817
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Yeah, and this isn't something exclusive to Nintendo.

818
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Like, I think about this happened on iOS.

819
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Is that there was a game that was on the App Store for free.

820
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
And it ran one of the public domain MAME games.

821
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
You know, it's public domain so you can do whatever you want with it.

822
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I think it was like Mr. Robot or something like that. You download it.

823
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And it was actually the full MAME emulator on your device.

824
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,000
So you use something like iFunBox or something to go into your iPad or your iOS.

825
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
You just dump the other zip files in there and congrats.

826
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
You got a MAME emulator on your iPad or your iPhone.

827
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Now, it took Apple a week to pull that thing from the store.

828
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
But so many people went and downloaded this app.

829
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And once you got it, you got it on your device.

830
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Unless they do a PT.

831
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I don't know if they did.

832
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Only if you have saved the downloaded version on your computer would you be able to bring something like that back?

833
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:27,000
If you delete the file, then it's not downloadable again.

834
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Which is why I keep a backup in my iTunes, always.

835
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Not everyone does.

836
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Not everyone does, no.

837
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
So there it is. Oh, Dark Tetsuya says it was Robbie Roto.

838
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
As I recall, the original creator released it to the public domain since years ago.

839
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
That's right. That sounds right.

840
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:49,000
So again, these types of like openly hackable things are not exclusive to Nintendo.

841
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out release dates.

842
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Let's see what bugged games are coming out next.

843
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:04,000
So we've got this week Dungeon Travelers 2, the Royal Library, and the Monster Seal for the Vita.

844
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
A Vita game?

845
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Yeah, a Vita. I know. Shocking.

846
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Hell Divers Super Earth Ultimate Edition.

847
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,000
They're getting a boxed version of that that's coming out on PlayStation 4.

848
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And then LBX Little Battlers Experience for Nintendo 3DS.

849
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:30,000
That's one of those first party titles that no one knows is coming out and then it comes out.

850
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Surprise! Surprise release.

851
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Surprise! There was no Nintendo Direct about that title.

852
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Alright, is that it?

853
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
That would be it.

854
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
Alright, traveling to Japan. It's a very quiet week this week in Japan.

855
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
But on the PlayStation Vita, we have Romeo vs Juliet, the all-chapter pack.

856
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
I think I mentioned this one last week because it was a very slow week last week as well.

857
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And then on the Nintendo 3DS even, there's Super Robot Taisen BX, but that's really it.

858
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:04,000
We start to get some more stuff next week, such as the Dragon Quest VIII remake is out next week.

859
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
And I think a lot of you are going to be into that.

860
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
But for this week, things remain pretty quiet in Japan.

861
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
How about Europe? Dark Sakura?

862
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:19,000
There are a few things. What we have on the 18th is Final Fantasy Type 0 HD for PC, Fingered.

863
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Volume for Vita and PlayStation 4 PC. Also, Zombie for PC and PS4 and Xbox One.

864
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Oh, that's right. That's this week. The Zombie thing. The Wii U one that's now on other systems. That's right.

865
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Yes. On the 19th, we have Smite for Xbox One. And the 20th, we have Trine 3, the Artifacts of Power for PC.

866
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Nice.

867
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
That's it.

868
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week. Loki.

869
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Alright. So, Disney Magic Kingdoms was a title that they kind of announced during D23.

870
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:05,000
And what is Disney Magic Kingdoms? Well, it's kind of an iOS or a mobile game where you basically design your own Disneyland or Disney World or whatever.

871
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
And they have lots of crap that you can pull in there. I guess sort of like a rollercoaster tycoon game.

872
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:18,000
But I remember they showed you can even add Flynn's Arcade in there. So that was pretty cool. Still no Tron game.

873
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Wait, so I can have a Disney park with a proper Tron arcade? Thank God.

874
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
You can, yes.

875
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
The world is going to be correct somewhere.

876
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Yes, and it's being put out by Gameloft. No word on when that's going to be out. I'm guessing this is probably going to be free to play when it comes out.

877
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
It sounds like a free to play game. So we'll have to wait and see. I think that was announced today.

878
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
I'll check it out. Yeah, it's probably part of D23. It was probably this weekend at some point.

879
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I'll check it out. It sounds like fun.

880
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Anyhow, last but not least before we get to the classic game of the week, we'll talk about Nintendo and why they don't do annual franchises.

881
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I mean, let's be real. Nintendo does have a tendency to always put out that Mario game or that Zelda game or a Mario Kart game.

882
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,000
But they don't do it every year. We're not talking like Madden, FIFA, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed. Nintendo's really not at that level.

883
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And why is that? Talking to the examiner, the executive VP of sales at Nintendo of America, Scott Moffett said,

884
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,000
We tend not to annualize our franchises. There's not a new Mario Kart every year.

885
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:29,000
What we've tried to do with the Wii U is first create a fully featured, really enjoyable game that is something for everybody,

886
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
has surprises that you'll discover as you play through levels, and it gives you a good amount of quality entertainment.

887
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:42,000
For fans who love Mario Kart, we've released extra content over time so that it keeps the game fresh and allows them to experience more than they could when they originally bought the game.

888
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:50,000
That's the approach we take. Rather than annualizing the franchise, we're periodically releasing new courses, levels, and features that keep people playing.

889
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
We see a huge surge in gameplay hours on Mario Kart when we release new content.

890
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,000
We take different approaches with different franchises. If you look at the Pokémon franchise, we've released multiple core games for 3DS.

891
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:09,000
We like to give Pokémon fans something every year, but something like Mario Kart or Smash Brothers, there may be only one version of that franchise in the whole console cycle.

892
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,000
It all depends on the franchise, the developer, and what new ideas they can bring to the franchise to move the gameplay forward and keep the franchise fresh.

893
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:24,000
I think we always need to innovate and we need to always bring new ideas and new thoughts, but they have to be sufficient enough to justify the next release.

894
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Small incremental changes may not be worth a whole new release.

895
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I like that perspective. I still feel like this is a lot of new ground for Nintendo because that whole enhancing the game that's already out there through DLC is something really unique to this generation with the 3DS and the Wii U.

896
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:55,000
That's not something Nintendo's really been able to do before, but certainly I do like the way that Mario Kart 8 lasted for 18 months through the game coming out.

897
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Then you've got the Zelda DLC, then the Animal Crossing DLC, the 250cc. They've been giving little bumps to that game to keep it current without you having to buy Mario Kart 9 to get these courses.

898
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
That I can appreciate.

899
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:18,000
But they do that with every single game that comes out now. They act like, look, we take this really original approach about keeping our games fresh. Fuck you.

900
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:26,000
You know what? Seriously, you have done what every fucking publisher of a game has done for the last several years.

901
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:34,000
You release a game, you do updates for it, you release DLC, and you know what? Those publishers still do an annual series or whatever.

902
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Let's put some more DLC out before it then.

903
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I was gonna say, wait a minute, I don't get the anger because Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty, they do all of that. And they're yearly.

904
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Exactly. That's exactly my point. Is that they're acting like this is some unique thing that they're taking a completely different approach when they're doing the exact fucking thing that everybody else is doing.

905
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Would you rather, just to be clear, would you rather that there is a Mario Kart 9 and then a Mario Kart 10 next year and a Mario Kart 11 the year?

906
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
You wanna see Nintendo go annual so that there's more of it?

907
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:14,000
No, I'm saying if they're trying to, if they're gonna tout themselves as taking an original approach, make it fucking original.

908
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Put more DLC out there. Make it so that there's a lot more tracks. Because people want more tracks.

909
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I have to be honest though, and I truly believe this, I think Nintendo is putting some of the best DLC out there. Like their DLC is very well-rounded.

910
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:38,000
You know, those Mario, or the Mario Kart tracks are not just like some BS little additional thing to the game. Like it's a really impressive start.

911
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,000
No, I understand. They're not BS little additions to the game. Those would be the amiibos that are the meaningless BS things that they add to the game.

912
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:53,000
No, so they do spend the time putting out quality stuff for those games. And let's be honest, they put out quality games.

913
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:00,000
But, they're not doing anything unique. They're just doing what everybody else is doing. So stop fucking touting it.

914
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Like, just say, listen, we're just doing what everybody else is doing and it's working for us. Cool. That's it.

915
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:11,000
You don't have to be like, listen, we're doing something completely different. We don't want to do it this way because, you know what, fuck it.

916
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
You would do it if you had the manpower to fucking turn out those games.

917
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
We use capabilities are limited and nobody's gonna say that. Nobody's gonna fucking do that.

918
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:24,000
It's because, listen, we put out another fucking game but we got a new system coming and we'll put out the game on that. So that's what it really comes down to.

919
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Alright, let's travel back to a time when things were simpler. You know what, there was no patching. You put out the game and if it was fucked up, oh well.

920
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:45,000
That's why we tested things. It's the classic game of the week. Dark Soccer's gonna step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful little brats.

921
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Play this game and then get off my lawn. Get off my lawn while you're playing this game.

922
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Just go play the game on someone else's lawn.

923
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Go play, exactly. Go play the game on Loki's lawn. Alright, it's the classic game of the week and a very, very appropriate timed one this week, right, Dark Soccer?

924
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Indeed. That's why I picked it.

925
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:16,000
In light of D23 and the announcement of Star Wars Land, or whatever it will be called, at the Disney parks, I've decided to go with the 1983 Star Wars game from Atari.

926
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Atari is awesome.

927
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:31,000
So it was basically a first person space simulator and it had the, basically it was just the Attack on the Death Star over and over.

928
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It was made with 3D color vector graphics and it is probably one of the best games of its age, especially since everything else around that time was all vector-y too.

929
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
And the music in it was really good, I mean, just for the built-in time.

930
01:13:50,000 --> 01:14:02,000
The age has treated this game very well. Not a lot of games from this era have aged well, but I believe Star Wars is still a shitload of fun to play.

931
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,000
It is. And I love being able to find a game that's still in really nice, vivid condition.

932
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:16,000
So basically you go through the three attack phases. You are Luke Skywalker, or Red Five, as he pilots the X-Wing.

933
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,000
And you don't have to kill every enemy to advance, you just have to survive through the level.

934
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:28,000
So, you know, and every time that you get hit takes away one shield of the six that you start with.

935
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,000
So in the first game, you're in outer space and you have to do the dogfight with Darth Vader and TIE Fighters.

936
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:44,000
And the second one, you basically need to shoot down turrets. And the last one is the trench run at the Death Star.

937
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
The trench run stages are the best. Best, best, best.

938
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:58,000
And if you manage to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything except the exhaust port, you get the using of the force bonus.

939
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Achievement. Achievements, guys.

940
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:15,000
So, it used voice samples from the movie. You had Mark Hamill, Alec Guinness, James Earl Jones, Harrison Ford, and R2-D2 and the growling growls of Chewbacca.

941
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Thank you.

942
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,000
The world record actually has been set and reset several times.

943
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:31,000
In 1984, it was 300 million points in 49 hours, which is the world record for an individual.

944
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:40,000
2005, it went to 54 hours on the single credit with a score of 283 million. That's the longest endurance record, sorry.

945
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:54,000
And then a group played for 5 days, 2 hours and 26 minutes on the single credit to get the world record score of 1 billion and 12 points.

946
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I love that it's 1 billion and 12.

947
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Yeah.

948
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:06,000
So, as far as home versions, they were designed, well, the original was designed by Mike Hallie for Atari.

949
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,000
Parker Brothers converted it in 83 and 84 to 8-bit consoles and computers.

950
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:18,000
So, you have Atari 2600, 5200, the Atari 8-bit systems, ColecoVision, the Commodore 64.

951
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:23,000
The ColecoVision version was designed by Wendell Brown.

952
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
And I'm actually looking at what else Wendell Brown did.

953
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Can I just say while you're looking that up how damn impressive this game was on 2600, all things considered?

954
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I don't, I think I was missing one of the levels, I don't remember, but, like, for a 2600 game? Seriously, this game was great.

955
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,000
By the way, Wendell Brown did a bunch of Intellivision games.

956
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Other conversions that were out in 87 and 88, we had Amiga, Atari ST, the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron, BBC Micro, and Enterprise 64.

957
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Again, converted for the Atari 8-bits and Commodore 64.

958
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:08,000
There were Apple II, Macintosh, Commodore 64, and DOS versions in 1988.

959
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:12,000
The closest being the Amiga and Atari ST versions.

960
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:22,000
So, on the Nintendo GameCube Star Wars Rogue Squadron 3 Rebel Strike, you could also unlock this, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.

961
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So, there you go.

962
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Hey, I don't know if this is, like, on your resource or in your brain, but what was up with the hidden messages on the Death Star?

963
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Like, if you looked really carefully, like, as you would zoom into the Death Star, there's usually, like, messages written on it.

964
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Bye Atari, bye Atari, bye Atari, bye Atari.

965
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Yeah, or like you would say, like, use the force, or like, there's all these, like...

966
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
They're not very hidden, but yeah.

967
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Well, you know what I mean. Like, it's subliminal. Subliminal messages.

968
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Yeah, worship Satan, smoke crack.

969
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Drink your Oval Team.

970
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
What?

971
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Drink your Oval Team.

972
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Wholesome fun, wholesome fun. Bye Atari. Bye our games, dammit.

973
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, the vector version of Star Wars by Atari.

974
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:08,000
The old school Star Wars Atari arcade game, which is seriously one of my all-time favorite games.

975
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Seriously, Disney needs to bring back, you know, these old vector games, like Tron.

976
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Right? Well, they had the Xbox 360 version of Tron, to be fair.

977
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
But anyway, Brad from Pod Culture, very excited about this pick, saying,

978
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Best game ever, I will kick a puppy to have an arcade version of this.

979
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Don't kick a puppy.

980
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Dungeon Buster says, yay, vector Star Wars.

981
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Fun fact, the control stick was also used in Atari's only laser-diss game, Firefox.

982
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
SG100Matt says, my summer camp as a kid had an arcade with a few games in it,

983
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
and one of the games they had there was this.

984
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
It was the sit-down cab, which is apparently hard to find.

985
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Did you know, DarkSahara, they used to have, at the Sunrise Mall tilt,

986
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
this is how old that was, it was a long time ago, right?

987
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
They used to have a sit-down Star Wars cab.

988
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I remember playing it when I was a kid.

989
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Did you know, Rob, that they had a sit-down Star Wars cab at Crestview Lanes before they closed the arcade?

990
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
No, I did not.

991
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I wonder if it's the one that used to be at Sunrise Mall.

992
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Well, keep in mind, that's the same place they used to go play Air Guys.

993
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,000
That's awesome.

994
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,000
And Blazing Star.

995
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I miss Crestview Lanes, that place was so amazingly ghetto.

996
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Love that place.

997
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,000
I miss real arcades.

998
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
It's officially been torn down.

999
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Yeah, I know.

1000
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
It's gone.

1001
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
What are they building, a Walmart?

1002
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Fuck, if I know.

1003
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Panera Bread.

1004
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Crestview Walmart.

1005
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Anyhow, alright, that's going to do it for this first half of the show,

1006
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,000
but we have plenty more show to come,

1007
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
including the FUGO Question of the Week, rapid fire news,

1008
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
your emails, if there are any, because there weren't when I checked earlier.

1009
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, the FUs of the Week, and...

1010
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I'm really not that mad at long emails, y'all.

1011
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And Maple Bacon Chips.

1012
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And Maple Bacon Chips.

1013
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Maple Bacon Chips, eat them.

1014
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I will, during break.

1015
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

1016
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,

1017
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
live on this Sunday evening, August the 16th, 2015,

1018
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
with episode number 610 of our show already in progress.

1019
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
We're going to get to some rapid fire news and your calls a little later.

1020
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1021
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
First, I thought I'd give you all a little bit of a personal life update in some ways,

1022
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
because sometimes we talk about our personal lives on this show once in a while,

1023
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
and this might actually give a little insight to some of the things I've been saying in the past couple weeks on the show,

1024
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,000
because there was something going on that I kind of had to keep a secret,

1025
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
but I don't have to keep it a secret anymore.

1026
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:36,000
So I can actually say that this week, I'm going to talk about my day job.

1027
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I don't do that a lot on this show because I don't like to mix my day job with what we do here,

1028
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
but certainly it's a big part of my life.

1029
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
It pays the bills. It pays for this show.

1030
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:58,000
But I actually resigned from my job of the past 14 years this week, and it's a job I've had longer than I've been doing OLR.

1031
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
For the longest time, I could say my job is the thing I've had longest in my life,

1032
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
longer than any relationship, longer than OLR.

1033
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Now, OLR is the longest thing I've had in my life as of this Friday because I get my two-week notice on Monday.

1034
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:16,000
I do have another job lined up. It's not like I did not quit out of malice or anything.

1035
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I'm pissed off or anything. No, it's nothing like that.

1036
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:24,000
It's just that I got an amazing opportunity with another company in the same field that I do now.

1037
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I don't get too much into the details of my work because, again, I just don't need people trying to find me at work.

1038
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,000
That's very awkward. But I'm a corporate trainer by day.

1039
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:42,000
So, yes, I get paid to talk to people all day long and teach them about the wide, wonderful world of our industry and all that.

1040
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:48,000
So, I'm going to be doing corporate training for a similar type of company here in the area,

1041
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
but it's more of a ground-level growth type of thing.

1042
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,000
So, I'm very, very excited about it, even though that's a huge change.

1043
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
So, I'm a little bit freaked out about it.

1044
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:05,000
So, if next Sunday's show is cut just a little bit short so I can get to bed at a decent hour, you'll understand why,

1045
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
because I got that going on.

1046
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
So, yes, it's going to be some big changes ahead for me, but I'm very excited about it.

1047
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
DragonCon is still on, despite all that.

1048
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I got a message from Travis Donovan over at Understation Live when I made the announcement that I was leaving the job and starting anew.

1049
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
He's like, are you going to be able to go to DragonCon still?

1050
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
I'm like, yes, yes. I worked that all out.

1051
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
I told him up front, I already have plane tickets to Atlanta.

1052
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Can we work around that?

1053
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
And they were very, very accommodating with that.

1054
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
DungeonBuster in chat says,

1055
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Grats on class change. Distribute those new points well.

1056
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
That's a great way of putting it.

1057
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Thank you very much, DungeonBuster. I appreciate that.

1058
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
And that's Jonah to Matt says, good for you, Rob.

1059
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
You deserve a better opportunity and we're all here to support you.

1060
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Thank you so much. I really appreciate that.

1061
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
And I can say this, I don't work in the games industry.

1062
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
We're going to get into a story a little later on that will probably tell you why I don't.

1063
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
But in the meantime, let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki.

1064
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
I wouldn't know anything about that there.

1065
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
About working in the games industry and the radio show.

1066
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Yeah, I think we might have all shot ourselves in the foot on that, but we'll see.

1067
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase PROFIT.

1068
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
So this is kind of cool.

1069
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:23,000
CGProticRed has released mod support for Witcher 3, the Wild Hunt.

1070
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:31,000
And they have a nice picture of a unicorn with, looks like, star makeup on its eyes.

1071
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I don't know. That's pretty cool.

1072
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:40,000
But yes, apparently you can use Nexus mods and you're able to incorporate all sorts of mods into the game now.

1073
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So look for those nudity mods right around the corner.

1074
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
Not already there, I'm sure. First thing out the gate.

1075
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
So, awesome.

1076
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
This is kind of cool.

1077
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,000
There's a Final Fantasy VII remake coming.

1078
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
And no, I'm not talking about the one that Sony's doing.

1079
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
This is actually a fan-made 2D action game remake.

1080
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
And this is done by PD Design Studio.

1081
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
They're a small indie developer.

1082
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,000
And what they did is they put together a proof of concept playable demo that you can check out and play.

1083
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So, let's see.

1084
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:22,000
The actual website that you can download that would be ffvii-reimagine.com.

1085
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
And it looks pretty cool.

1086
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I watched the video, I haven't played the demo yet.

1087
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
But I'd play that.

1088
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
If they're going to be giving it away, sure, why not.

1089
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Yeah, play it now while it's still up on the internet.

1090
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Well, Loki, once it's on the internet, it'll always be on the internet.

1091
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,000
It might just be a little harder to find than it used to be.

1092
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,000
Darktedsuya in our chat saying,

1093
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000
That reminds me, I never did finish playing that fixed translated version of that Chinese bootleg Famicom edition.

1094
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Oh yeah, that didn't look very fun though.

1095
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Try saying that five times fast.

1096
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,000
That didn't look very fun.

1097
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:00,000
If you're a PlayStation Plus member, you're going to get some additional rock band songs with your pre-order.

1098
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:13,000
So, you'll get ten exclusive tracks. Those include All That Remains, Divide, Blitz Kids, Run For Cover, Bring Me The Horizon, Throne, Dead Sarah, Mona Lisa, Duran Duran, The Reflex.

1099
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
That's awesome.

1100
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Hell yes.

1101
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Janis Joplin, Move Over.

1102
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Hell yes.

1103
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Of Mice and Men, Would You Still Be There?

1104
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Oh Honey, Sugar You, Pantera, Cowboys From Hell, Live From the Monsters in Moscow Festival, and Seastick Steve, Summertime Boy.

1105
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
And yes.

1106
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:43,000
So basically, if you do a digital pre-order, you'll get a rock band 4 theme, and you'll be able to get those free songs.

1107
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Maybe an attempt to sway people who are like, I'm going to buy it on Xbox One because all of my songs are on 360. Because I'm in that camp right now.

1108
01:25:52,000 --> 01:26:02,000
So, my question is though, are the old instruments working with the new game? Because how the fuck are you going to play those songs if you don't buy the game?

1109
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I think I heard they're trying, and that's where things were at right at the last turn.

1110
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:13,000
You might want to just avoid buying those songs right away and maybe, I don't know, think about it.

1111
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Because that does seem kind of a sticking point there. How does one buy that game digitally if there are no instruments for it?

1112
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Did they purchase those separately?

1113
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Maybe. We'll see.

1114
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Anyhow, moving on, talking about some of the news around the world of gaming.

1115
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:37,000
This is a book that Loki's talked a lot about on the show, and I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with. Ready Player One.

1116
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
And I think a lot of you are aware that they are turning this into a movie.

1117
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
2017!

1118
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Steven Spielberg. You're very excited, aren't you?

1119
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Steven Spielberg is the one that's going to be directing this.

1120
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Well, in the book, which I must admit I haven't read, although I feel like I have because Loki's told me all about it.

1121
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
You need to read it. I can load it to you.

1122
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
I might actually take you up on that.

1123
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:07,000
There's a character in the book named James Halliday who's kind of like, and correct me if I'm wrong, he's kind of like a Willy Wonka-esque kind of figure where he's the one that's putting him on.

1124
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Well, here's the crazy part.

1125
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:17,000
Steven Spielberg, the rumor is out there, and granted this is coming from Ain't It Cool News, so here's an entire salt shaker to go with this rumor.

1126
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:32,000
But the rumor is that Steven Spielberg is trying to court Gene Wilder to actually play this character who was Willy Wonka in the 70s version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

1127
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Didn't he quit acting after?

1128
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:38,000
He did. So if he were to do this, this would be him coming out of retirement.

1129
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I believe he did do at least one movie after Gilda passed away.

1130
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I think he did something in the early 2000s, but after his wife, you guys may or may not know, he was married to Gilda Radner, one of the original Saturday Night Live players.

1131
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Hysterical woman. One of my inspirations, quite frankly. She's so fucking funny if you go back and watch just her old stand-ups and all that, but she tragically passed away.

1132
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Just listen to Let's Talk Dirty to the Animals.

1133
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Or just watch any Roseanne Roseannadanna sketch.

1134
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
That's it. That's going to be the fortune cookie.

1135
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:19,000
So anyway, go check that out. But anyway, ever since she tragically passed away, I think he really took over a lot of the charity work.

1136
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Gilda's Club and the things that she had left behind. So he hasn't been acting as much.

1137
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:28,000
So for him to show up in this would be huge.

1138
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:33,000
And the fact that it's like a video game 80s throwback thing is really cool if Gene Wilder would show up.

1139
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
You seriously need to read the book. It's amazing.

1140
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I do.

1141
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I haven't read too much of it or listened to too much of Armada yet.

1142
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I'm not enjoying Armada as much as Ready Player One, but Ready Player One was exciting enough to where I just blazed through that.

1143
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,000
What do you think of that casting? They're saying in chat, isn't Gene Wilder 82 years old? Yeah, he's 82.

1144
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I don't know if I'd see him as that character, but yeah, I still think it's cool.

1145
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:06,000
They could cast it as somebody else and it would be fine, but it would be neat to see him.

1146
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
As G-100 Matt wondering, I don't know how well he will fit. I have a feeling if they did it, it would be...

1147
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:18,000
I don't want to say stunt casting, but it would definitely be for the fact that Gene Wilder is in the movie than maybe anything else.

1148
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I don't know. We'll see. Anyway, time will tell. They've got to start filming that real soon if it's coming out in 2017.

1149
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
It's December 2017, so...

1150
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
We have a little time.

1151
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Anyhow, did you know that Square Enix has a streaming game service because Loki didn't?

1152
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,000
No, I did not know. I was like, what?

1153
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Even though we talked about it, it was a long time ago. We talk about it a lot on OLR. I forget all the things we talk about too.

1154
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Sometimes I have to go to Dark Tetsuya and be like, did we ever talk about this? He's the one that knows.

1155
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Yeah, it was episode number 487. What are you talking about?

1156
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,000
So anyway, Square Enix is actually going to be shutting down Dive In.

1157
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It was a game streaming service that they actually had last year.

1158
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
You probably haven't heard of it because it was only in Japan.

1159
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
It's not something that they actually had here in the US. That's probably why many of you haven't heard of it.

1160
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Maybe AkumaJP has heard of it. I don't know. Or whoever else is in Japan listening.

1161
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:15,000
This is a way that you could rent titles like Final Fantasy XIII or Season of Mystery on your iOS or Android device.

1162
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:21,000
And so how much you pay for the games, that just depended on how long you wanted to play them.

1163
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:25,000
But you would get free demos for 30 minutes at no cost.

1164
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Now, I can only sit here going Final Fantasy XIII with touch-only controls does not...

1165
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
Well, then again, I guess to play Final Fantasy XIII, you really only need one button.

1166
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
But for some of the other more complex games, you might, you know, I just...

1167
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:51,000
A controller on the... I don't know. That's always been my bitch about gaming on the tablets, no matter if it's Apple or whatever.

1168
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
It doesn't lend itself well to the tangible controls.

1169
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:02,000
And so, you know, when a game is designed with touch controls in mind, it works really well usually.

1170
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
But these games don't usually translate over very well.

1171
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,000
But this is also Japan and not America.

1172
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And I know the culture, especially when it comes to mobile gaming and so forth, is very, very different over there.

1173
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:21,000
But I just think the Final Fantasy Record Keeper lends itself much better to a mobile experience than maybe Final Fantasy XIII would.

1174
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,000
But that's my opinion.

1175
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Hey, somehow I got a story about Mass Effect. I must have stole this one from Dark Sakura.

1176
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
But it's a story about Mass Effect Andromeda, and I'm sure she already knows.

1177
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
But how many of you guys heard about this?

1178
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Well, there was actually a little bit of a Q&A going on on Twitter this week, not officially.

1179
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:45,000
But Chris Nguyen, who is part of the development team, actually was talking a little bit on Twitter about some of the information with the game.

1180
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Including, are there going to be any familiar faces in Andromeda?

1181
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:53,000
And Chris replied and said, story-wise, it wouldn't make much sense.

1182
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:00,000
So don't expect that you're going to get to see Garrus and Caden and Rex and all them all over again.

1183
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
We kind of already knew that. It was going to be a completely different part of the galaxy.

1184
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:07,000
You still can't help but wonder if maybe there will be a cameo or something.

1185
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
No, but anyway.

1186
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Also, apparently, some of the combat in the game is going to feel very similar to Mass Effect 3.

1187
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Which I enjoy hearing that because I think, you know, I did not care for Mass Effect 1 as much as I did 2 and 3.

1188
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Very similar between the 2 and 3, especially.

1189
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I thought the combat was great in 3 and multiplayer. I love that an awful lot.

1190
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
So, very cool.

1191
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
So, Mass Effect Andromeda, just a few details there on Twitter this week.

1192
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
AkumaJP responding to my comment about, I'm not sure how the mobile thing goes in Japan.

1193
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:49,000
He says, in Japan, less is good. We play most game and train where we can only use one hand while standing.

1194
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
And that could lend itself as to why.

1195
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
You know, you get the image of the crowded train.

1196
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,000
One hand is probably holding onto a pole or a little leather strap thing so you don't go flying through the train.

1197
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:06,000
That probably makes a game like Final Fantasy 13 very hard to play in that rare case you are hitting more than one button.

1198
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Or, yeah, I was going to say, not in Final Fantasy 13's case.

1199
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,000
You do have to move lightning around the screen at one point on the map.

1200
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Even if you are going down a tunnel, sometimes you have to turn left and right.

1201
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
You get to Chapter 10 eventually when you're on the world.

1202
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Alright, anyhow. Dark Sakura.

1203
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Well, this is, hold on.

1204
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Sorry, apparently my boobs can no longer hold up the microphone.

1205
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Well, have we talked about on the show your makeover today?

1206
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
We haven't brought that up on the show yet.

1207
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Dark Sakura, sorry to distract from the topic at hand, but you all want to hear about Dark Sakura's hair, don't you?

1208
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Dark Sakura got her hair did today and it looks great.

1209
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I put pictures on my Tumblr.

1210
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:54,000
She has this fade, this red to black fade going on and it's very, like, Dark Sakura has been touching herself all night.

1211
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
And don't take that dirty, you dirty birdies.

1212
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Meaning she's been petting her hair, going, my hair feels great, I can't stop touching my hair.

1213
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And it is, your hair is like, fantastic.

1214
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I've been telling everyone to touch my hair.

1215
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
You have? Anyway.

1216
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Where were we? Gaming, news, yes.

1217
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
I was trying to find my Tumblr for people.

1218
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Oh, for people that don't know your Tumblr.

1219
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Anyway, there is a suggestion that there will be a third Taiko no Tatsujin or Taiko Drum Master for Wii U.

1220
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:34,000
There is WiiU3.Taiko-CH.net that will, I guess they're thinking about doing another one.

1221
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
That's still speculation.

1222
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:46,000
But it was found from, but the second one came out with WiiU2.Taiko-CH.net.

1223
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
So, who knows.

1224
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Also, there's going to be a new Pachi Slot game, yay, Bayonetta, yay.

1225
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Sega just wants the Pachi Slot money.

1226
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Whatever.

1227
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
And-

1228
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Your favorite's becoming Pachinko Machines.

1229
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
It's not just Konami.

1230
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Not even just Pachi, they're the slots of Pachi.

1231
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
They're Pachi sluts.

1232
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
But not just Konami.

1233
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Hey, you watch it, she's a strong female.

1234
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
She don't take no shit from no man.

1235
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,000
That's right, she's not going to take your dirty mouth over there calling her names.

1236
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Anyway, Epic Games has a warning out to the community that there are going to be phishing attacks.

1237
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Or that there are phishing attacks.

1238
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
Saying they're officially coming from Epic Games, but it's a lie.

1239
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Lies.

1240
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Don't click it.

1241
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:46,000
You remember how we used to, way back in the early days of OLR, we used to not make fun of, but we used to, I don't know, riff on the Don't Copy That Floppy anti-piracy song.

1242
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I think that Dark Soccer needs a version that's like, don't click that link.

1243
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,000
You want to know what happens next? Don't click that link.

1244
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Don't tink that link.

1245
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:07,000
Alright, but one link we do need to click on this show is on over to our Facebook and our Google Plus pages.

1246
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Because every week on this show we like to do the Fugal Question of the Week.

1247
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:24,000
We're going to head on over to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and ask a question that's on our mind this week.

1248
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
And we want to know your answers. And this week it has to do with Kingdom Hearts.

1249
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
You know, we're riding on the high of the Big Hero 6 being announced today.

1250
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:35,000
So we want to know, what do you want to see? What land do you want to see in the Kingdom Hearts game next?

1251
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I was really worried that I asked this question before, but I didn't find it in a search.

1252
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
And many of you answered and nobody said, hey dummy, you already asked this last month.

1253
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
So if I asked it, it's been a long time.

1254
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Anyhow, William Murderface says, I may be the dissenting voice here, but I don't want any other worlds added.

1255
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:57,000
At this point the story is wrapping up and the original Kingdom Hearts lore needs to take center stage otherwise, in my eyes at least.

1256
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Square Wriste turning one of the best original series into another tired cash cow that they shoved references into for money and fan wank.

1257
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:12,000
What's wrong with fan wank though? It's some of the best parts of Final Fantasy XIV or fan wank, just saying.

1258
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:21,000
No, but I respect that perspective. Chad B. replied and said, if I could get Treasure Planet or Atlantis, that'd be perfect.

1259
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Going deep into the Disney library. Those were some movies about 10 years ago that unfortunately didn't do so well.

1260
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,000
It was a dark period for Disney, but I know those movies have their fans.

1261
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Silent Tom replied and said, I would love to see the Guardians of the Galaxy in Kingdom Hearts.

1262
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I would love to see Groot hanging with Donald and Goofy.

1263
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:43,000
That would be pretty amazing. Would you be down for that dark soccer, the Guardians of the Galaxy in Kingdom Hearts?

1264
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Maybe.

1265
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Maybe? I think so. I like that. Let's see.

1266
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Nemesis 47 replied and said, I say Toy Story should finally get a world or even just Pixar in general along with Star Wars.

1267
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Lightsaber Keyblade anyone?

1268
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
That's California Adventure.

1269
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I'm excited for Kingdom Hearts 3 having a big Hero 6 world. I love that movie a lot and Sora with Baymax sounds awesome to me.

1270
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,000
One thing Kingdom Hearts 3 must get back to having is Kingdom Hearts 1's difficulty.

1271
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:13,000
I felt Kingdom Hearts 2 was too easy. So much I rarely died, but most of those were when I was fighting Sephiroth.

1272
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Tiger Claw says, I'd love to see some Marvel characters show up in the game. Big Hero 6 was originally a Marvel comic.

1273
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Rage Nator says, I'll be frank. I don't give two shits about Disney. I was never a fan.

1274
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:30,000
That being said, I never bought a game that has Disney properties in it, including Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.

1275
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:36,000
That being said, whatever they announced next to be in Kingdom Hearts 3 doesn't apply to me.

1276
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Well, thank you very much for that very useful and insightful information, Rage Nator.

1277
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Andy R says, Star Wars or anything related to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

1278
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Really anything that hasn't already been excessively covered in the previous games.

1279
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:02,000
AKA, can we please not go to Aladdin, Hercules, 100 Acre Woods, etc. that have been featured multiple times already.

1280
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I agree with that.

1281
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Look, I love Hercules, but we don't need to go back to the Colosseum.

1282
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Degenerate Johnny says, You know, everyone is talking about Disney's recently acquired fantasies.

1283
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:18,000
However, Disney has so many worlds that exist in its library, especially those of its original titles.

1284
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:26,000
One world in particular that I wouldn't mind seeing in Kingdom Hearts 3 is, and I'm probably dating myself here, Babes in Toyland.

1285
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:35,000
You are dating yourself, but I totally remember the 80s miniseries that they had of Babes in Toyland.

1286
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
Because wasn't Keanu Reeves in that? I'm almost positive he was.

1287
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,000
You know what I would really love, but we will never have it, because they butchered the movie anyway.

1288
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,000
The Black Cauldron.

1289
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Oh, that'd be awesome.

1290
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Why isn't Dylan Wee a princess at the park? I mean, really.

1291
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Was the Labyrinth Disney? Or was that some other story?

1292
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Labyrinth was Jim Henson created that, but I think, I want to say Warner Brothers ultimately owns the rights.

1293
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:09,000
Even though, you know, Disney bought Jim Henson. I want to say, I could be wrong, maybe somebody in chat wants to correct me, but I feel like Warner owns the rights to that.

1294
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Anyhow, more answers on Facebook.

1295
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Jodastar says, I think it'd be awesome to see some Star Wars in a new Kingdom Hearts.

1296
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Maybe build a Millennium Falcon gummy ship. How about that?

1297
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Let's see, and S.H.O. and Hunter Matt says, I'd love to see a Black Cauldron world. It's very dark and creepy, I wouldn't mind seeing that.

1298
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Probably very toned down now as a world.

1299
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:34,000
We have this one other person here on Facebook, replying, totally not Loki.

1300
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I want a new Tron game, because of Tron and the lack of it in any new movies. Where's the rumored game I've been promised?

1301
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I totally agree with that guy, he's got great points.

1302
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Totally not Loki, responding to us there on Facebook.

1303
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:53,000
It's Loki, just so you know. That was Loki responding on Facebook.

1304
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:55,000
I think they got that.

1305
01:40:55,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Let's go over to Google Plus at Google.com slash plus orange lounge radio, because we did get a few answers over here as well.

1306
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:16,000
And Act F says, Ducktalesland or Duckburg, please. That would be worlds colliding. Maybe that doesn't happen because of the Ducktales game? I don't know, but that would be very interesting.

1307
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Let's just start digging into the Miramax properties, the clumps.

1308
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Oh my god, Reddertainment says, Disney owned Miramax. Miramax world, because awesome. Didn't Miramax put out Pulp Fiction?

1309
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,000
They did. Pulp Fiction world. That would get dark.

1310
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Mmm, that is a tasty burger.

1311
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,000
I just want Samuel L. Jackson to shoot, I just want him to shoot Donald.

1312
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:46,000
When Donald doesn't heal you, bam. You just shot Donald in the fucking face.

1313
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Oh, you guys. There it is, the Fugu question of the week.

1314
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Kill Bill world.

1315
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Yeah, Miramax has put out all of Quentin Tarantino's movies.

1316
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Clerks animated world, yes. 100% yes.

1317
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Oh god, that was on ABC.

1318
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Oh my god. Fuck, you know what, let's just get a new Clerks animated series.

1319
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
How about just a fucking Clerks video game? That'd be amazing.

1320
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I just want a new series.

1321
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I wasn't even supposed to play this game today.

1322
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,000
There's a new movie coming out.

1323
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Oh, that's right, there is a Clerks 3 happening, huh? You never know, anything is possible.

1324
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Isn't that supposed to be Kevin Smith's last movie, or at least he says?

1325
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Oh, it's always his last movie, whatever, I don't know.

1326
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
He makes Oodles and Noodles podcasting now.

1327
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Anyway.

1328
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Alright, that's it for the Fugu question of the week. Let's get back into some news.

1329
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Add us on Facebook, add us on Google if you're still using Google.

1330
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Loki.

1331
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Alright, so I'm kind of disappointed to see that they're still continuing on with this lawsuit,

1332
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:48,000
but the whole ZeniMax versus Oculus over, you know, I guess they say misappropriation of trade secrets,

1333
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
that's going to be allowed to continue.

1334
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:56,000
So this, of course, was back, got it, it was all the way back from 2014, back in May.

1335
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Basically, they have denied Oculus's attempt to have it dismissed.

1336
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
So now the case will proceed.

1337
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:11,000
In case you weren't aware, it was basically they're alleging that John Carmack, who worked at it,

1338
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:18,000
had basically helped Oculus with the information that he received while working at ZeniMax.

1339
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:21,000
On, I guess, similar technology or something.

1340
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Mmm.

1341
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
They're trying to get in on that money.

1342
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
It's going to be a hard thing to prove, though.

1343
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Probably because of that whole, uh, how this rolls online game sounds.

1344
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Alright, well, I wonder if it's going to turn into this.

1345
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Usually these things are settled outside of court.

1346
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
They want that two billion dollars.

1347
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
They're like, we smell some money.

1348
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
If it goes to court, that means all that's going to be public.

1349
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:51,000
That's going to be fascinating to see what happens with that, if that does go to court.

1350
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:56,000
They even have John Carmack in a white Bronco, and I mean, it's just going to be a media frenzy.

1351
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
And then he'll actually be putting an Oculus on his head.

1352
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.

1353
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
If the headset doesn't fit, you must acquit.

1354
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:07,000
Alright, anyway, moving on.

1355
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Did you know that the PlayStation Plus service is actually rising in price in some parts of the world?

1356
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Not everywhere, but it is happening in some places.

1357
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Apparently, though, of course, if you already are locked into a twelve month subscription,

1358
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:26,000
you don't have to worry as much, but it is something you should be concerned about still.

1359
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Could Sony be raising the price in other parts of the world?

1360
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Because right now this change is only happening in Europe and the UK,

1361
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:37,000
but could a price change for everyone else be far behind?

1362
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
It is going up by fifty pence a month,

1363
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:47,000
or the three month sub is going from $11.99 to $14.99 in the local currency there.

1364
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,000
So could this be something that's going to end up happening in the States,

1365
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
where the price of the service could rise?

1366
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
I would say certainly it's not out of the question.

1367
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
It's not out of the question, but people are going to still question,

1368
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
you know, what is it that you're giving to me?

1369
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Because I understand they could say inflation, but what more are you giving me for my money?

1370
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:11,000
Well, kind of judging the way Sony's delivered similar news like this in the past,

1371
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:17,000
I think they'll be very good about really softening the blow and burying it under other news.

1372
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Like, for example, that historic E3 where they basically came out and slapped Microsoft in the face at their press conference,

1373
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:29,000
they also said, you're going to have to have PlayStation Plus in order to play online.

1374
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,000
You didn't need that before, but because everybody was riding the high about,

1375
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
oh, the system's going to be $100 cheaper and all this other stuff, nobody cared.

1376
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Nobody cared also because you got all these free games along with it.

1377
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
And I still don't care because I get all these free games along with it.

1378
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:48,000
I feel like if Sony's going to announce the price is going up, they're going to soften that blow by being like,

1379
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:54,000
did you know as a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you now have access to your PlayStation 2 and PlayStation library?

1380
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I'm pulling something out of thin air.

1381
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
2 and 3 library? Okay, that's fine. Five bucks more a month?

1382
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Exactly.

1383
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Or a year or whatever?

1384
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:07,000
As a part of our all new PlayStation Plus plan rolling out this year, PlayStation Plus Gold for 14, you know, or whatever they do,

1385
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,000
they'll, they'll do something to just bury that news a little bit.

1386
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Just wait. Just wait.

1387
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Anyhow, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

1388
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Well, you know what? I accidentally closed the story because I'm stupid.

1389
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
That's all right. You want to reopen it real quick?

1390
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Yeah.

1391
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
I could just let Loki ran a little longer if you need it.

1392
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Talk about the story.

1393
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Okay. Well, I think that Loki would have a very good rant about this.

1394
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Basically, we've been hearing about it all day. Bobby talked about it on his show.

1395
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:59,000
A Nintendo localizing editor, Chris Pranger, is it Pranger or Pranger? Anyway, was on a podcast and he got fired for it.

1396
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:10,000
He was on the Part Time Gamers podcast on August 3rd and just kind of, I guess, talked really openly about being at Nintendo.

1397
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:14,000
Didn't really say anything terrible and they still fired him for it.

1398
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:19,000
And he was pretty gracious about the whole thing.

1399
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I mean, but still, I guess, got to ask for permission.

1400
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:33,000
That's why I don't tell a dang soul where I work unless I know you or have a very significant reason to tell you why.

1401
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
And I still don't tell people what I do.

1402
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:45,000
And a good reason why I, you know, and earlier I mentioned this, I was talking about my job changes that I don't really like to talk about my day job just because I'm not like, you know, if it weren't for my day job, I wouldn't have this.

1403
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
So I'm not going to mix those worlds together. I'm just not.

1404
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:58,000
And I don't work in the gaming industry and I'm totally OK with that because it allows me to say whatever I want about it, you know, and so I don't have to worry about those types of recourse.

1405
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,000
That being said, I used to do it all the time.

1406
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Yeah, I know. But you were in a different scenario.

1407
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
You weren't actually making the games. It was a little different.

1408
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
And on top of that, I am damn proud of my job.

1409
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
And it took a lot of work for me to get there and to get where I am now.

1410
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
And I'm not going to jeopardize it for anything.

1411
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Right.

1412
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Not even the cool factor.

1413
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Right.

1414
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Because I work somewhere pretty cool.

1415
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Well, and you have to wonder, like, why?

1416
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:35,000
I mean, I don't want to I don't want a dog on this guy because I really believe he was probably helping a friend out, you know, who maybe had this show and was, again, probably just defending a company he really loved.

1417
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:41,000
And, you know, saying the things that I think a lot of us are sitting here going, we kind of wish Nintendo would say it.

1418
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
I think there's a lot of us that have been sitting here going.

1419
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It's kind of a nice change of pace to see somebody from Nintendo defending themselves a little more openly like this.

1420
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I don't think anybody, you know, dislike this guy or what he said or anything like that.

1421
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:59,000
But unfortunately, Nintendo took a huge issue to it because that's not the public face that they choose to put forward.

1422
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:06,000
And although a lot of us get frustrated that Nintendo is such a fucking clam sometimes with this stuff, that's their choice to do that.

1423
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:12,000
And if they're going to fire an associate for opening their mouth when they didn't have the permission from corporate, then that's their prerogative.

1424
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:18,000
But you can tell this guy is crushed and he's like, I made a dumb mistake and I could have ruined.

1425
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,000
He said he made a stupid mistake is what he said.

1426
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Now, I'm hoping there'll be another company out there that can maybe, you know, find a good fit for this guy because, you know, he's obviously very passionate about what he does.

1427
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,000
Maybe Sega, because I want to say the Sonic the Hedgehog account actually tweeted something of this guy.

1428
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Maybe he'll be able to land in the gaming industry after all and he can kind of learn from this.

1429
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:43,000
Maybe he can go to a company where he can talk more openly.

1430
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Maybe he can go to Microsoft.

1431
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Microsoft does have public figures out there.

1432
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:52,000
They used to have a lot more until they cut a lot of them back, but at least they have Major Nelson out there who talks pretty openly.

1433
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:59,000
Maybe he can find a role like that somewhere else and I hope for this guy's sake he does because I just, it's just kind of a bummer.

1434
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,000
But that's also why, and I just want to mention this, you know, we've been fortunate enough where, you know, I do have friends in the game industry.

1435
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:10,000
You live in Northern California, you're going to know somebody that have come on this show.

1436
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,000
And if they're indie developers, that's why we like interviewing indie developers.

1437
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Because especially when it's just one guy or a small team, you know, they'll talk about whatever you want to know.

1438
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Open book, you can ask whatever. We get a lot accomplished with those.

1439
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:30,000
But even my friends who work for the larger developers, you know, okay, I respect that they have talking points they have to stick to.

1440
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:39,000
And so I try in those interviews not to necessarily ask about, you know, what are the big secrets in the game you can't tell us.

1441
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Because I don't want to get my friends fired. That's just being an adult.

1442
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Like I'm not going to, you know, I'm not Barbara Walters or Diane Sawyer who can get a no holds barred interview.

1443
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:55,000
So when I get friends in the industry, I usually just kind of like to talk about, you know, don't, you don't have to tell me specifics about your game.

1444
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Give it a plug. Let us all know that you worked on it and you're proud of it.

1445
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:03,000
But then let's talk about like you and the industry and what goes into that.

1446
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:10,000
That's the conversation I like to have here is, you know, let's, let's just talk about things in a more general term and so forth.

1447
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Because, you know, I don't necessarily need to have those sorts of secrets.

1448
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:19,000
So I, and I have not heard the interview, just a big disclaimer.

1449
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:28,000
But I really hope if this guy was friends with the hosts of this show, I really hope the hosts didn't bait this guy.

1450
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I hope the hosts took it up. And again, I haven't heard it. So I'm, I'm just saying, I hope when I do hear it, I will see that this is clear.

1451
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:44,000
I hope the host talked to this guy in advance about the, what can we and can we not talk about and didn't do it for the ratings.

1452
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Because if he did it for the ratings, that's a tacky way to treat a friendship.

1453
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:56,000
But again, I haven't heard it. Maybe I'm just, I just wanted to throw that out there, though, for anybody with a podcast out there who might have a potential guest like in the future type of thing.

1454
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Like, talk about the borders. Because I know there's plenty of people out there that are like, well, when you have an interview, you should be able to ask whatever you fucking want.

1455
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
No, no, no, that's not how the world works, people. Because this is what happens.

1456
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:13,000
Professionals are professional. End of story.

1457
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:20,000
We talked about this a little bit on the Bobby Blackwell show. This is not unique to video games. Tom Cruise is out there promoting Mission Impossible.

1458
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:26,000
What the hell is the latest one called? The Rogue Legacy? Isn't that a video game?

1459
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Rogue I think is just what it is.

1460
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,000
So anyway.

1461
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I don't care. It has Simon Pegg in it. The movie.

1462
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Anyway, if you're going to interview Tom Cruise about Mission Impossible, you're signing a waiver that you will not ask about Scientology.

1463
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Well, no, seriously, they take all this stuff seriously, and especially if they answer the shareholders and stuff. I remember when I was excited about, what was it?

1464
01:52:49,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Advanced Warfare, back when they called it. What the fuck was it called? I don't remember what it was. It was, I don't remember the code name for it, but I was talking about what my boss was singing at the PlayStation event or whatever they go to.

1465
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:20,000
And yeah, that got some big trouble there. Lawyers contacting our work and stuff like that had the signed stuff basically saying I wouldn't talk any more about it.

1466
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:31,000
And they were very cautious about it. I mean, they just have to take all that stuff seriously, so I can understand, even if you didn't say anything bad, they could be taking that very seriously.

1467
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
So you just got to be careful.

1468
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Thankfully they don't work anymore, so I can do whatever I want now.

1469
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Some comments from our chat room over at live.vagadetwork.com. Sg100matt saying, we've laid off people at my job for tweeting or sharing things online that may be trivial, but make the company look bad regardless.

1470
01:53:46,000 --> 01:54:01,000
As much fun as it seems to maybe be an insider, you can't trust the internet. DungeonBuster says, there's a reason there's PR department and handlers. With today's social media, it's not unusual anymore for prospective employers to start looking at your online history as a matter of course.

1471
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:13,000
So it's all very true from our comments over there. So in some ways it's a good thing that I keep my day job very separate from this because it allows me to do whatever I want here on this program. I don't have to worry about it.

1472
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Something something Microsoft employees something something always online something that doesn't matter. I think that's what it comes down to. Remember that whole debacle?

1473
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Oh yeah when Microsoft was on script that whole E3 and then literally a week later they reversed course because they were able to get an award.

1474
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:37,000
No no no I was talking about the guy that like I forget who it was that you know is basically you know getting into arguments with people over Twitter.

1475
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1476
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:42,000
You know being this isn't being always online and I don't know.

1477
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I remember that.

1478
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:49,000
All right let's move on. Some more stories for you guys before we get to your phone calls. Some people in chat want to call in about this.

1479
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:54,000
1877 game OLR username on Skype orange lounge radio. But first a few more stories. Loki.

1480
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:00,000
So they're putting out a Star Wars PlayStation 4 bundle. I should say maybe a couple bundles.

1481
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:09,000
So there's going to be one I know with Disney infinity with it and then they're also going to be doing one with Battlefront the deluxe edition.

1482
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:18,000
And then they also have a Star Wars classic collection which includes four downloadable Star Wars games that are kind of being redone in HD.

1483
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I'm trying to see which ones they are. It's hard to see it based on.

1484
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:30,000
I think it's a Super Star Wars something.

1485
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Star Wars bounty hunter star fighter and something revenge. I can't.

1486
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Oh it's right here. Super Star Wars bounty hunter and Jedi star fighter racer revenge.

1487
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:54,000
That'd be cool pod racing game on the PlayStation 4. Pretty cool I bet.

1488
01:55:54,000 --> 01:56:01,000
So yeah you can get that and it's got a cool controller that has like a red d-pad and some of the buttons are red.

1489
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:05,000
And Darth Vader is on the actual console.

1490
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:12,000
I don't know about this whole the old retro games being available on PS4. That's kind of a neat little twist.

1491
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I'm sure they're going to be selling them separately because their vouchers that download them so that only makes sense.

1492
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:20,000
I guess that's true. It's only a matter of time.

1493
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I would love to get a Darth Vader PlayStation 4 if I didn't you know already have a PlayStation 4.

1494
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:28,000
So anyhow.

1495
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Just buy the game.

1496
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Sadly not coming to PlayStation 4 anytime soon. We already knew Guillermo del Toro and that whole PT project he was doing with Kojima.

1497
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,000
We already knew that was that was pretty much done and that's not going to happen.

1498
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
But Guillermo del Toro this week saying you know what.

1499
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Peace out. I'm done with video games. 100 percent done.

1500
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:53,000
And this is in an interview with Shaq News he said I have proven to be the albatross of video games.

1501
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,000
I joined THQ and THQ goes broke.

1502
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
I joined Kojima and Kojima leaves Konami.

1503
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,000
I have decided in order not to destroy anyone else's life.

1504
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I have decided I will never again get involved in video games.

1505
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Never say never.

1506
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Otherwise I'll join someone and his house will explode or something.

1507
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Hey Guillermo del Toro you ever been interested in making a Skylanders game.

1508
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Just out of curiosity.

1509
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Kidding. Kidding.

1510
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Well I mean who can blame the guy. He's been fucked over how many times now.

1511
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Twice.

1512
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Can you blame him.

1513
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Twice.

1514
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Two times.

1515
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
Except like.

1516
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
Twice.

1517
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I'll say fool me once shame on you fool me once.

1518
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Isn't the story of the albatross that as long as you keep the albatross alive it was good luck.

1519
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
And when they killed the albatross then all the bad luck happened.

1520
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Perhaps.

1521
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
So don't kill the albatross keep trying.

1522
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
I just don't.

1523
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Whatever.

1524
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
You know what he just says that now because it's something to say.

1525
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:48,000
I mean I think if you know Kojima is like hey let's make a Silent Hill game.

1526
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
I need your help.

1527
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
He's like OK.

1528
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I also.

1529
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Yeah I feel like he's 180 on this question.

1530
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I think he's just like just something to say because he's angry or he's he's frustrated right now.

1531
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
And that's kind of his response.

1532
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I don't think there's really anything to it.

1533
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Well Gamut of Toro I know you don't listen to this show but if anyone who knows him happens to listen to this show.

1534
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Just.

1535
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
You know.

1536
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:10,000
We would.

1537
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Go to Kickstarter.

1538
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Seriously I know I don't usually embrace the whole Kickstarter thing but I think we all know it's an inevitable conclusion.

1539
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:21,000
That if you and Kojima went to Kickstarter and said we want to make a PT inspired game.

1540
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Millions of dollars would be thrown at you.

1541
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Just make a Pan's Labyrinth game or something like that.

1542
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Seriously.

1543
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Or make a game that has giant mechs fighting the monsters from Pan's Labyrinth.

1544
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
You know that would be cool too.

1545
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:36,000
I can say the players definitely want to play a Gamut of Toro game.

1546
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
The corporate culture.

1547
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Yeah.

1548
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:39,000
They're being dumbasses.

1549
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
But if for what it's worth Gamut of Toro.

1550
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
We all hate Konami right now.

1551
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
So just.

1552
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:46,000
Hey but you know what.

1553
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
You're not alone.

1554
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,000
They might want to license one of your properties into a patinko machine or a slot machine or something.

1555
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Sit down and be quiet.

1556
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I'm sitting down.

1557
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,000
Do the other app.

1558
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Dungeon Buster says.

1559
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Seriously.

1560
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Kojima and Del Toro on Kickstarter would probably melt their servers.

1561
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
You guys thought Shenmue 3.

1562
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
Maybe that's what Sony has planned for the Playstation experience.

1563
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Get Kojima and Del Toro up on the stage.

1564
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Watch the internet just fucking explode.

1565
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Offline.

1566
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Done.

1567
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:16,000
We're done.

1568
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Everybody went to the rapture.

1569
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
No for real.

1570
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
It's done.

1571
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Everybody's gone.

1572
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Alright.

1573
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
So Del Toro we hope you'll take another try at the video game industry.

1574
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Because I think a lot of us would like to check out these things that you had to create.

1575
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
In the meantime you guys create.

1576
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
Sometimes.

1577
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Emails to send our show.

1578
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:43,000
You can email our mailbag.

1579
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com if you want to participate with the show.

1580
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Again that email address is participate at Orangeloungeradio.com.

1581
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and finds the emails worth reading.

1582
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Of which I think there is one.

1583
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:58,000
There's one.

1584
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Uno.

1585
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:00,000
This one comes from Raginator.

1586
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Hi OLR it's your friendly neighborhood Raginator.

1587
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Some of you in the VoG community may already know I've just started playing Final Fantasy

1588
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
XIV on Wednesday the 12th.

1589
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
About damn time right?

1590
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Anyways naturally I'm not too far into the game only having leveled my Lalafell Thaumaturge

1591
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
to level 3 and did some quests.

1592
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Granted there's a bit of a learning curve.

1593
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Especially since my last major MMO was Final Fantasy XI.

1594
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
But nonetheless I'm loving Final Fantasy XIV so far.

1595
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Next time we're all on game perhaps we can do some game content together.

1596
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:33,000
My character's name is Good Something Rage.

1597
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Named after the Final Fantasy XI character.

1598
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,000
You'll want to type that in chat it's very difficult to pronounce.

1599
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Yeah.

1600
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
And he's on our server.

1601
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
This email is brought to you by Loki's Rants and Sky's Epic Diva Fits.

1602
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
What am I known for?

1603
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
Like you had your diva fit.

1604
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Loki rants.

1605
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Correcting people's spell.

1606
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Yelling at emailers who do not use correct punctuation and grammar.

1607
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
See?

1608
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Sorry you're gonna be the grammar Nazi.

1609
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:06,000
No no no no no no no no.

1610
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Because I'm not gonna like mass murder people for it.

1611
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Even though you contemplated it maybe one time.

1612
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
No comment.

1613
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
I'm under NDA Rob.

1614
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
I am your English teacher.

1615
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,000
There you go.

1616
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
You're the professor.

1617
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Professor Sakura here on the show.

1618
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
My son said something the other day.

1619
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
I don't remember what it was about but it's just so appropriate.

1620
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,000
It was like he was complaining about something.

1621
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:39,000
He's like yeah it's not good when people do that.

1622
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
We should kill them.

1623
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I'm like that's a bit extreme.

1624
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:49,000
It was something like they were walking behind our car or something like that when we were trying to back out or something.

1625
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Takes after daddy.

1626
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Something ridiculous like oh they're not driving fast enough on the freeways.

1627
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
We should kill them.

1628
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I'm like no that's not a good idea.

1629
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
That is a bit much.

1630
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Figure of speech.

1631
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I know what you're meant for Dark Sakura.

1632
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
We talked about it earlier in the show.

1633
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I'm gonna miss yelling out something completely non-sensically related to the topic at hand.

1634
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,000
What?

1635
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Exactly.

1636
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,000
You know what we should have is goat titulater.

1637
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Rob.

1638
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,000
What?

1639
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Rob.

1640
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:30,000
What?

1641
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Rob.

1642
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
What?

1643
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Exactly.

1644
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Alright there it is.

1645
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
You're just jealous because my hair is pretty.

1646
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Your hair is pretty and like I said on your Facebook.

1647
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,000
It's soft.

1648
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,000
It feels like my cat.

1649
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
It's on Facebook.

1650
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I wish I had hair for Moneta Style.

1651
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
We'll get you a wig for Moneta Style.

1652
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
It feels like my cat.

1653
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
It does.

1654
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:54,000
So you're over there feeling your pussy?

1655
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I'm just touching myself.

1656
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
I thought it was a pussy cat.

1657
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Like the old cartoons I thought I saw a pussy cat.

1658
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Shut up I'm just touching myself.

1659
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I'm stroking my hair in a comforting fashion.

1660
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:09,000
We need to get on Periscope so we can Periscope you petting yourself.

1661
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:10,000
You know what?

1662
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Fuck the internet.

1663
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:15,000
She's doing a lot of heavy petting over there.

1664
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Can't help it.

1665
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
I love it.

1666
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Can somebody put that on one of those inspirational posters in quotes?

1667
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Fuck the internet.

1668
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Dark Sakura.

1669
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Like maybe like a little picture of a sunset or a kitten.

1670
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Like a big thing of kitten.

1671
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
And she used the kitten the one like the I want you to pet me but I sort of want to bite

1672
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
you.

1673
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
That kitten.

1674
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:38,000
We'll just get that picture of Midna that looks like she's rolling her eyes.

1675
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Do we have an image contest on Twitter this week?

1676
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Can you do a Dark Sakura motivational poster?

1677
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:48,000
I want you to take a quote from Dark Sakura and do a motivational poster and tweet it

1678
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,000
at OLR.

1679
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,000
With eagles.

1680
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
For sharks.

1681
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
We'll send you a Destiny Red Bull quote.

1682
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
Sharks and eagles.

1683
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
I had a lot of them and I threw them all away.

1684
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
I'll give mine up.

1685
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
We'll send you a Destiny Red Bull quote.

1686
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
I'm sure I will have more.

1687
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:03,000
I know I have more because I have at least one more in the car.

1688
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:04,000
There it is.

1689
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Tweet it.

1690
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
We don't do enough on Twitter.

1691
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Tweet them at OLR and be sure to use the period in front so everybody can see your motivational

1692
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
poster.

1693
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:21,000
And they have to be at least make sure there are no artifacting in them.

1694
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,000
And you have to use the official motivational poster font.

1695
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Do it in MS Paint for all I fucking care.

1696
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Don't fucking use Comic Sans or I will murder you in your sleep.

1697
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:34,000
There's a quote right there for you to use on a poster.

1698
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Don't use Comic Sans or I will murder you in your sleep.

1699
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
I won't really murder you in your sleep.

1700
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:39,000
But I'll think about it.

1701
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:43,000
You know with some of those computers that they have that run Android and stuff like

1702
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:48,000
that that are about the size of a USB thumb stick that you can basically attach to your

1703
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
TV.

1704
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
One could insert that into an orifice and literally fuck the internet.

1705
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,000
So I mean it is technically possible to fuck the internet.

1706
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:00,000
You know they have these vibrators that are called the iPod.

1707
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
And they hook up to an iPod.

1708
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
And iPods are internet capable.

1709
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:11,000
So imagine if you ran Spotify you would be fucking internet music.

1710
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,000
Although if you're sticking out sorts of foreign objects up there you may be doing a little

1711
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
bit of Spotify anyways.

1712
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Akuma JP in chat says this is how I'll introduce OLR from today.

1713
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,000
You know you should listen to OLR except this episode.

1714
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
Dartitsia can we get a note on the wiki where it says episode 610.

1715
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Don't just skip this one.

1716
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:34,000
You know what you're better off skipping this episode.

1717
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:37,000
There's 609 other great episodes for you to listen to.

1718
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
My coworkers are starting to realize that.

1719
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Well I did post about we have an official like listen to these podcasts forum in our

1720
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
little social network crap.

1721
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
And I did post our show.

1722
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
So like you know they know I do it.

1723
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
Why did you do something so stupid like that?

1724
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Why?

1725
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
My industry has nothing to do with this show.

1726
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,000
That's true.

1727
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,000
That's true.

1728
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Me too.

1729
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,000
So that's the good news.

1730
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Alright if that's it for the mailbag tonight I don't know how Raginators look.

1731
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:04,000
I'm playing Final Fantasy 14.

1732
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Email went to use Comic Sans and I'll murder you in your sleep.

1733
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,000
But that's what happens here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1734
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Who came up with Comic Sans?

1735
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
It was from Microsoft Bob wasn't it?

1736
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
It was a fun whimsical font.

1737
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:22,000
In part also done because the kerning for it fit their certain text pattern.

1738
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,000
It was something like that.

1739
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
It actually was to be kerned a certain way.

1740
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Do you know what kerning is internet?

1741
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
It's the space between your letters.

1742
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,000
You called me a nerd earlier in the show.

1743
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,000
You know what I watched today?

1744
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Or I introduced my son into?

1745
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Reading Rainbow.

1746
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
And you know what the second or third episode they had?

1747
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,000
They had people like actually inking and...

1748
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Calligraphy?

1749
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,000
No they were inking comic books and doing the lettering and stuff.

1750
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,000
And I'm like wow this is so relaxing just to watch them do this.

1751
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Okay if you just want to like sit and chill just like put on enigma and watch people do calligraphy.

1752
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
You just won't move for a few hours.

1753
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:58,000
I thought that's what the food network is for in general.

1754
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,000
No cause then Paula Deen's face will show up and then you'll want to die.

1755
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:03,000
It doesn't show her anymore.

1756
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:04,000
And Guy Fairey's hair.

1757
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
It's that other chick.

1758
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
What the hell's her name?

1759
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Oh god.

1760
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Rachel Ray.

1761
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,000
At home with...

1762
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,000
What's her name?

1763
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:11,000
What?

1764
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,000
That's it?

1765
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,000
Was it Giada De La Cruz?

1766
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:14,000
Yes.

1767
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Or is it the other one?

1768
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
You know what I just thought of?

1769
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:21,000
I saw the great meme on tumblr that was like and if you can't summon the fires of hell

1770
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
just go get one at the store.

1771
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
No no no no that's not Giada.

1772
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:31,000
That's you're thinking of god damn it's been a while now because she actually has cocktails

1773
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:35,000
now too because she does this little thing cocktail time at the end of her show and she

1774
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
actually has cocktails now they're called cocktail time.

1775
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Barefoot Contessa.

1776
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
Thank you.

1777
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:40,000
That's it.

1778
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Thank you Orange Wright.

1779
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
No it's not the Barefoot Contessa either.

1780
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
That's who I'm thinking of though is Barefoot Contessa.

1781
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:50,000
But you know could you just imagine the ultimate evil would be Paula Deen's face and Guy Fairey's

1782
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
hair.

1783
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:54,000
There's another motivational poster for you.

1784
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:58,000
That is the thing I will see in my nightmares.

1785
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:03,000
She should just have a shirt that says butter y'all.

1786
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:09,000
But I swear to god Food Network when an unwrapped marathon happens I could just I could just

1787
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
watch that all night with a big bullet.

1788
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Seriously if you can't get Gene Wilder to play you know the guy in the Ready Player

1789
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
One movie Mark Summers.

1790
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Let's get Mark Summers.

1791
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Oh hell yeah.

1792
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I'll take the physical challenge.

1793
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
All right let's get to the F.U.'s of the week.

1794
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Big F.U. to having to get up at 6 a.m. done.

1795
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
Loki?

1796
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:50,000
I guess F.U. to my new hours because I have to work like 10 to 7 and then I work Saturdays

1797
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,000
now which is kind of lame and I get Thursday off instead.

1798
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:58,000
So F.U. to that and then also kind of just talking about Mark Summers there and just

1799
02:08:58,000 --> 02:08:59,000
thinking about Food Network.

1800
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:04,000
It would be so amazing for them to redo double there like that would make it all grandos

1801
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:10,000
like you know Iron Chef like have him just standing up there like take the physical challenge

1802
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
and just like.

1803
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:12,000
I volunteer to host.

1804
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
That would be my dream.

1805
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
My dream job is game show host.

1806
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Anyway my F.U. of the week goes to the fact F.U. to the fact that I am not a game show

1807
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:25,000
host but at least I have this show we play games on this show so it's close and F.U.

1808
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:32,000
to food because I eat a lot of it and it's really delicious and then I have to do walks

1809
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:37,000
and laps and run and stuff to burn said food off and it's really irritating.

1810
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:42,000
Anyway by the way Dark Soccer I don't know if you noticed in chat you see that the first

1811
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
motivational poster is in from Dungeon Buster.

1812
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
There it is from our chat room.

1813
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Little angry cat and it says Internet.

1814
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Fuck the Internet.

1815
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:50,000
There it is.

1816
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
The first Dark Soccer motivational poster is in.

1817
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Good job Dungeon Buster.

1818
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:55,000
Love it.

1819
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
There it is.

1820
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:58,000
You like that one.

1821
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I'm proud.

1822
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
All right.

1823
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Oh cute little.

1824
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:02,000
I want to poke its nose.

1825
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:03,000
All right.

1826
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,000
I'll put that on her Twitter right now while Loki gets into another news story here.

1827
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
Very well done.

1828
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,000
All right.

1829
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
So this is kind of cool.

1830
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
You know.

1831
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,000
And funny enough I actually watched the movie again this weekend.

1832
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:18,000
But Kung Fury Street Rage is out on PlayStation 4.

1833
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:23,000
If you're unaware it was a game that was released around the same time as the Kung Fury movie

1834
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:26,000
on YouTube and it was a game that was on Steam.

1835
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,000
You can check it out now.

1836
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,000
It's very similar to.

1837
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:33,000
God I'm trying to remember the name of the game now.

1838
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
It's another fighting game.

1839
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
It's very similar to it.

1840
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,000
It's kind of like a rhythm fighting game.

1841
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
And it's only $1.99.

1842
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:45,000
So go ahead and check it out.

1843
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
It's pretty fun.

1844
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,000
How many times have you watched Kung Fury now?

1845
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
At least a dozen times.

1846
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Probably more than that.

1847
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I would totally watch more of it.

1848
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
But I've seen it so many times now.

1849
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I can quote it all.

1850
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
For the most part.

1851
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I'm waiting for them to screen that on a big screen.

1852
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
All Rocky Horror Pictures in style.

1853
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
I backed it on Kickstarter.

1854
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,000
So I have a Blu-Ray coming at some point.

1855
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I don't know what the point is.

1856
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
I've already watched it millions of times with them.

1857
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
Alright. One more story for you guys.

1858
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:23,000
We're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1859
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Or our username on Skype.

1860
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

1861
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
But getting to this story first.

1862
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:31,000
And this has to do with Fallout 4.

1863
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:35,000
And some footage that showed up on the internet.

1864
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:36,000
But you know how it goes.

1865
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:41,000
You put footage up on the internet and the copyright holders are going to take it down real fast.

1866
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:45,000
So some Gamescom gameplay footage made it onto the internet on YouTube.

1867
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:49,000
But Bethesda, they pulled that stuff down real quick.

1868
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:53,000
But did you know that folks who want to put this footage on the internet

1869
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:56,000
they will sometimes go to other places where Bethesda is not as quick.

1870
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:59,000
And I'm not talking about the mail or anything like that.

1871
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,000
I'm talking about Pornhub.

1872
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:07,000
That's right. The Fallout 4 footage was hosted on Pornhub for a little while.

1873
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
It is now finally down.

1874
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:13,000
But there were at least 73,000 people that got to view this before they pulled the plug on this.

1875
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:17,000
And the greatest thing about it were some of the tags that were on this thing.

1876
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Yes.

1877
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Now posted on the Pirate Bay.

1878
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Point of view. Roleplay. Shooter. Shitty camera. Thanks, Mr. Skeltyl.

1879
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:31,000
I love that. That people are turning to places like Pornhub and just like all these random ass places to put the footage.

1880
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I guess instead of watching that video you're going to have to watch Lesbian Ass Slick.

1881
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Which is apparently to the left of where the video would be.

1882
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Fallout 4. Lesbian Ass Slick. What's it going to be today? I don't know.

1883
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:48,000
But hey, the thing is though, since it is on the internet, there may be another, they may put it somewhere else.

1884
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Yes, they may put it somewhere else. That's right. The video, that is.

1885
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,000
Oh, Jesus. Alright. I thought you were still talking about the lesbians.

1886
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Anyhow, that is definitely going to do it for the news section of our show.

1887
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:13,000
It's time. Skypline time. 1877 Game OLR. Or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

1888
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:17,000
I don't know if you want to call in to tonight's show, but if you want, there it goes.

1889
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:21,000
I must sadly depart, because my ass has to be up super early tomorrow.

1890
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Dark Sakura's on her way out for the night. A final thought from you tonight, Dark Sakura.

1891
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Um, my hair feels good.

1892
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Keep petting your hair. Keep stroking that hair.

1893
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I feel pretty.

1894
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
And witty. And hey, we're getting another phone call.

1895
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:37,000
On the line right now by Dark Sakura. Have a great night.

1896
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:41,000
Let's get to the phones. We've got a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1897
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Hey, what's going on? It's Rama.

1898
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Hey Rama, how you doing?

1899
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Tired. You're tired? You sound tired.

1900
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:53,000
You sound tired. You look tired. We can see the video on our in-studio Skype here. You look tired.

1901
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
You've had it. Yeah.

1902
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:58,000
It's also kind of late there on the East Coast. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

1903
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Um, I'm going to make this quick, because I don't know if y'all have heard about this, but did you hear about the $200 PlayStation 4?

1904
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Oh, oh god. Is this the whole scheme where people were taking the...

1905
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:19,000
It was like Best Buy had the Xbox One and HDTV bundle.

1906
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:22,000
But some people were like, well, fuck that. I don't want an Xbox One.

1907
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:27,000
So they would return the Xbox One to Play... Oh, no? I thought that was that.

1908
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
All right, well, tell me your version.

1909
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Kmart marked down the PlayStation 4 to $200.

1910
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Oh, well, Kmart's got to get business somehow. That's not news.

1911
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:47,000
And people went to Target, Best Buy, and Walmart, and pretty much got them to price match it, including the bundles.

1912
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Ooh. Ooh. Oh, boy.

1913
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Can they mark down, like, the weird of 50 bucks, please?

1914
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I'm waiting till it drops to 25.

1915
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Wait, so was it an accident, or was Kmart serious about that?

1916
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Kmart's dead serious. They actually marked the price down to $200.

1917
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Damn.

1918
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:10,000
If you go to Kmart's website now and look up PlayStation 4, it'll say $200, but they're sold out.

1919
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Well, gee, I wonder why. That's a hell of a deal.

1920
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:21,000
I bet people are buying them just to take them back to a different store and get, like, a cash card for Walmart or something.

1921
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Yeah, but there is one problem with that.

1922
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Uh-oh. What's that?

1923
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:36,000
When you buy a console, they also scan the serial code, so if you return it somewhere else and that serial doesn't pop up in the system, they never sold it.

1924
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Ah. Well, that's a good thing, because people that do that are a little shady, and I don't think people should take advantage like that, because it ruins it for the rest of us.

1925
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Definitely.

1926
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:47,000
They have better intentions.

1927
02:15:48,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Well, to finish what I was saying, there was a bit about people would buy this Xbox One and TV bundle from Best Buy, and then they sold the Xbox One back to Target and then turned around and bought a PlayStation 4 with it.

1928
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,000
It was crazy.

1929
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Wow.

1930
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:09,000
But, yeah, surprisingly enough, the thing you're talking about, I guess, didn't work. I guess they weren't scanning the codes or, I don't know, maybe they got away with it somehow.

1931
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Well, I do know that the people I've spoken to, friends of mine on my Facebook, they have actually gone out and gotten the $200 console, but as always, everybody's price-matching policy is slightly different.

1932
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Where it's gotta be the exact model, or like Target, I believe, Walmart, they're a little bit lenient, so they're like, okay, here, it's the same price, here you go.

1933
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Wow. Yeah, Fry's has a price-matching policy as well. I know I've price-matched Amazon a ton of times with them, so I wonder if they were doing it too. Jeez.

1934
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Well, I've got a friend that works over at Target. I'm gonna find her in the morning. I'm gonna have to make the schlep out to Staten Island to pick one up.

1935
02:16:51,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Wow, interesting. Well, I don't know what to think about that. That's crazy. I would say go to Kmart and get one. I don't know what they think in pricing that so low.

1936
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
My god, they must really be desperate for business.

1937
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,000
I didn't see it listed on there anymore when you tried to pull up the system.

1938
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Yeah, maybe they pulled it.

1939
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Well, if you're on my personal Facebook, if you go back a little bit, I shared it late last night, early this morning.

1940
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Gotcha.

1941
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,000
I was digging up and posted it in the chat.

1942
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Tigerclaw in chat says the Kmart I go to doesn't have any video games or consoles. They got rid of that stuff. Yeah, I heard some of them did.

1943
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I'm not surprised by that because don't you remember about a good three, four years ago Kmart had like that blowout sale.

1944
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Yeah.

1945
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:40,000
And they had like the Guitar Hero bundles, all that. Yeah, at that time, a lot of the Kmarts were pretty much closing out their gaming departments.

1946
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,000
Same thing with Sears.

1947
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Yeah, because Kmart and Sears are the same company. So, Sears did that same move.

1948
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:55,000
And I remember Sears was the place I got my Nintendo years and years ago, when people went to Sears more often.

1949
02:17:55,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Let's see, bonds006 in chat says this is a perfect example of where the internet does not exactly help.

1950
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Since when does the internet was able to successfully help?

1951
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
It's very rare.

1952
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
I'm saying.

1953
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Very rare.

1954
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:12,000
All right, Rahm, any other thoughts for us before we let you go?

1955
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:17,000
I need more cough drops. Training today killed my voice.

1956
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Yikes. Well, feel better, okay? I know how that goes. If I'm out of practice, it kills my voice.

1957
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I will because I got one of these.

1958
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Oh, look at you show off. He's showing off his brand new, can I say what it is?

1959
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Yeah, it's a Surface tablet.

1960
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
A brand new Microsoft Surface right there.

1961
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Yeah.

1962
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Beautiful. All right. Well, have fun with that. I'm going to let you go so we get more calls.

1963
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Cool. Awesome. Thanks a lot, guys.

1964
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Take care, my friends. Bye-bye.

1965
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Bye.

1966
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:45,000
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. I hope Rahm makes it to MAGFest.

1967
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
I would like to be reunited with Rahm once again.

1968
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Early next year in February or whenever MAGFest is. I forget.

1969
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:57,000
1877 Game OLR, username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. Let's do some last minute stories. Loki.

1970
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:04,000
So Fallout Shelter came out on Android and it's been hacked already.

1971
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:10,000
Don't bother to try to get a high score in the game because there's a guy, some douchebag named Jake Polley that...

1972
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I love that you just name him.

1973
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Yeah, he's in the picture. He hacked the game and he is at the top of the leaderboards with one billion points.

1974
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,000
One billion happiness.

1975
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,000
One billion points.

1976
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:25,000
And two billion score.

1977
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:31,000
How rude. Again, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

1978
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:37,000
You know, Brad from Pod Culture sent me this story here in chat, but it's since been updated.

1979
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
So I guess I'll just give this clarification out there.

1980
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Supposedly the headline says Microsoft can remotely disable pirated games if you run them on Windows 10.

1981
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And as you can imagine, this made a lot of people go, what? Windows can do that to your software?

1982
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:57,000
But an update was just put out that says Microsoft can block your access to services like Bing or Xbox Live,

1983
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:02,000
but it cannot remotely disable a copy of a third party software installed on your hard drive.

1984
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:05,000
They can block my access to Bing?

1985
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Oh, no.

1986
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:13,000
You can't go to Bing. Oh, no. How will I not use Bing anymore? Oh, wait.

1987
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:21,000
So there you go. It sounds like some clarifications there on the Microsoft use policy.

1988
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:32,000
I will put one more call out there for calls, and then we'll wrap it up. 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

1989
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Loki, any last minute stories that you have?

1990
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:39,000
Uh, no.

1991
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:45,000
No. All right. ActDeft apparently has just come up with his own motivational poster he wants to share here in chat.

1992
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:50,000
And there is a little angry bird, an actual angry bird that says Internet. Fuck it.

1993
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:57,000
There it is. More dark soccer motivational posters, courtesy of chat. A plus work, you guys. A plus.

1994
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:03,000
All right. Last call for realsies. 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.

1995
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Some week we, like last week, didn't we get like 18 calls back to back? We couldn't even take them all this week?

1996
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Yeah.

1997
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:12,000
No, just Rama. Rama wants to say hey. Everybody else being shy.

1998
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Next week on the show, trying to finalize this, but I'm hoping we're actually going to,

1999
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:21,000
and unfortunately I can't tell you exactly who yet until I know for sure we've got them confirmed.

2000
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:25,000
But you know our pal Marissa does a lot in the voice acting world right now.

2001
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:29,000
She's trying to get some of her friends who've worked on games to come on the show.

2002
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:33,000
So we may have some voice actors on the show next week. So I'm looking forward to that.

2003
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Stay tuned to our Facebook and our Twitter feed for more updates as soon as we know who we've got confirmed for next week's show.

2004
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:43,000
We are looking at that. That should be exciting if you want to learn anything about voice acting in video games.

2005
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:49,000
So there you go. Alright, well sadly the Skype line is not opening up, so I guess I'm going to shut it down.

2006
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:54,000
I guess that's that. I think Dark Sakura leaving just ended the show. How dare she, Loki? She ruined it.

2007
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:58,000
I can't believe it. I guess we're just left here to our maple bacon chips.

2008
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:02,000
Yeah, I like them, but they don't taste like maple bacon. They just taste like barbecue.

2009
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:08,000
They do. They taste like barbecue. They don't taste like maple bacon at all. Maybe just like a little hint, but it's like hardly anything at all.

2010
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Alright, well as I always say at the end of the show, thank you so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2011
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:18,000
And if you like the show, please tell a friend or two about the show, because all we have is word of mouth.

2012
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:23,000
I'm not Kevin Smith. I didn't direct really funny popular movies that are out there.

2013
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:26,000
And also unpopular movies like Geely.

2014
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:29,000
That's right. I never had Jennifer Lopez in anything I did.

2015
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:34,000
So please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word.

2016
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:37,000
Five star reviews go a long way. We haven't had any in a while.

2017
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:41,000
So please consider, you know, on iTunes, just say five stars.

2018
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:46,000
And I get so much inspiration from Dark Sakura every week on OLR. It'd be great.

2019
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Also on Stitcher Radio or wherever it is you heard about this show will go a long way.

2020
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:54,000
And we really appreciate all of that.

2021
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,000
But that's going to do it for this week at Orange Lounge Radio.

2022
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2023
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:02,000
We already had Dark Sakura's, so I guess me, I'll go next.

2024
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:07,000
And my final thought for the night is I kind of miss Final Fantasy XI.

2025
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:10,000
I know I'm all about Final Fantasy XIV, but looking at this XI poster on the wall

2026
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,000
and hearing Rage Nator talk about it earlier, maybe a bit nostalgic.

2027
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
And they're practically giving it away at this point.

2028
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,000
I keep getting emails from their...

2029
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Yeah, but they're not giving it away yet.

2030
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Please come back and play. It was free for like two weeks.

2031
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
I don't know if you saw that, Loki. Maybe you don't get those emails.

2032
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
No, I don't get those emails apparently.

2033
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Yeah, it was like if you ever had an account you can play for free for like two weeks.

2034
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Damn it!

2035
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Damn it. It might still be going on. You have to look into that.

2036
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Yeah, I don't want to play it.

2037
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Anyway, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2038
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
I don't know. I got nothing.

2039
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
I got nothing. Alright, that's it.

2040
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Thank you guys so much for listening to the show. We really appreciate it.

2041
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:46,000
We will be back next week to do it all again with the latest in gaming news.

2042
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:51,000
Thanks for participating. We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

2043
