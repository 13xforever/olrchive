00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

00:14.000 --> 00:26.000
Tonight we recap the week in gaming news and we are joined by voice actors Andrew Jones, Drake Berger, and David Solov to talk about voice acting in gaming. Ask your questions live right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:43.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Episode number 611 for this, August the 23rd of 2015.

00:44.000 --> 00:53.000
We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with myself here in studio, Rob Roberts, but you might know me on Twitter as Skie, at S-K-I-E.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
And joining me is Miss, at DarkSakura. DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Hi.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Hi, how are you?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Caffeinated now.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Caffeinated, and it's hot. The temperature in the studio keeps going from extreme hot to extreme cold. It's weird.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
And it's only 88 degrees outside. Only.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
I know. In beautiful, headquartered Sacramento, California where we're at. It's been pretty creepy.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
AKA Satan's asshole.

01:19.000 --> 01:29.000
Actually, Satan's asshole has been kind of good to us this year. We've had only maybe like 5, 6 hundred degree plus days over the whole summer. I've seen some summers that are way worse.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
It's been relatively mild.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Some summers are straight up phoenix.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
For being in the middle of a drought.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
True, true. Not joining us tonight, sadly, Techmaster Loki. Techmaster Loki has the night off to take care of some other issues.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
But filling in tonight in our third chair, very happy to have him joining us, and I'm not just saying that because I know him very, very, very well.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Say hello, everybody, to Alan, joining us here in studio tonight.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Hi.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Hi, Alan. Welcome back to the show.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Thank you for having me.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
You're welcome. It's, you know, your house too, so I guess, you know, when this show's going on in the spare room, you know, you can pop on when you want.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
But no, I appreciate you being here. Usually you work on the Sunday nights, so I'm glad you're here.

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, my work has had a bit of a drought the last two weeks, but considering that it's not an election year without getting too much into what I do.

02:17.000 --> 02:25.000
The way it's been the last two weeks is more representative of what it should be like. The fact that it's been so busy up until this point was the anomaly.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
And I guess that streak finally, the well ran dry, but hopefully I can get some hours soon.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
But I'm here, so I'm going to help co-host the show.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
I appreciate it.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I have stories and everything.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Hooray. It's always nice to see you here on the program. And always nice to have you guys join us live.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
And remember, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
vog.network.com. And if you are listening to us live, head on over to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
And you can participate live with our show and have some of your comments read.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
For example, Brad from Pod Culture is in our chat room right now saying, nice, it's been a while since Alan has been on the show.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
It has been a while.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Sj100matt saying, you all will need to pick up the slack in the rant side of things tonight.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Alan, you know Loki is infamous for his rants here in the studio.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
I can probably be pissy bitchy about something, just not Nintendo. I don't really have the hate in my heart.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
I can't really drum up that level of angst for them in particular.

03:32.000 --> 03:43.000
And you know, we say this all the time, even though Loki gets very angry sometimes when the subject of Nintendo comes up, it comes from a place of, I'm a fan and I hate seeing you make these decisions I don't like.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
That's where Loki's quote-unquote anger comes from. But you're not really in the same boat. You think Nintendo's cute, right? I don't know.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
They're fine.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
They're expensive. But you're more a PC gamer anyway. I have like every single console here in this house. I don't think I ever see you pick one up.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
I don't know, just something about sitting in the living room and doing that is strange.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
That's weird because that's what I love doing. I almost think sometimes being in the, I mean, I don't know, the MMOs are one thing.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
And maybe that's because of the more chat room style experience where I really need the keyboard.

04:12.000 --> 04:20.000
But sometimes when I'm playing games, I need to be able to plop on the couch, have that controller in my hand, you know, and just relax.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Just Cheeto dust from chin to ankles.

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
Yes! Precisely! Don't you be telling the listeners my secrets here.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I wish Alan would get over his fear of planes and come to Dragon Con sometime.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
And also I wish Alan's boss would let him take Labor Day weekend off. Well, I think that's just a matter of, it's also a matter of money.

04:44.000 --> 04:55.000
It's a money thing mostly this year because even, I mean, we try to call people when they're at home and Labor Day is like the biggest vacation weekend of the year, right?

04:56.000 --> 05:01.000
Maybe Memorial Day? So I probably wouldn't have a shift that weekend anyway.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
So you could come probably if tickets weren't so expensive and the fact that, you know.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
I think there's another, we're doing Gamer X in December and then I think there's something in February or March.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
MagFest is the thing we're planning on.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
MagCon, it's all about Marge Simpson. We're both going to do our cosplay. Patty and Selma.

05:21.000 --> 05:32.000
So tell us a little more about PC gaming. Since you haven't been on the show in a while, what kind of games do you, I mean obviously we're going to do our gaming weeks in a little bit, what kind of games do you generally enjoy on PC?

05:32.000 --> 05:47.000
Action RPGs. Your Mass Effect, your Dragon Ages, your stuff that is on, you know, the big titles on Steam, Borderlands, I like FPSs if it has a strong narrative aspect, Bioshock.

05:48.000 --> 05:59.000
One thing I noticed you like to do, and I see other gamers do this too, but for some reason I don't usually get into this, is you really like to replay classics.

05:59.000 --> 06:11.000
Like it seems like every year, and I mean I shouldn't say it that way because it's not like I don't go back and play Super Mario Brothers or Super Mario 3, but you will go back to the 100 hour plus games and really invest like on a yearly basis.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
Like I see you go back and go to Half-Life or Half-Life 2. I see you go to Dragon Age.

06:17.000 --> 06:33.000
The games that I'm more likely to replay like that, Half-Life 2 is a special case because it's a first, obviously it's an FPS so it's going to be the same experience from start to finish. I can just maybe tweak with the difficulties if I want and make it like really punishing.

06:34.000 --> 06:50.000
But a game like Skyrim or Dragon Age or Mass Effect where you can do things out of order, you can make your character an asshole, make your character a goody-goody, play a different race, there's going to be variety in something that I do in a replay.

06:50.000 --> 07:13.000
I mean overall the campaign is the same, but it's not like I'm going to fire up Final Fantasy 7 or 8 games that I love and I have played through those more than once, but that's like a once a decade thing because I mean the characters are static, the campaign is static, the grinding is static. I'm not as compelled to invest another 60 hours in that.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Jamie, you want to jump in here?

07:15.000 --> 07:38.000
That's actually how I feel, why I've gone back and I'm playing through, I think I'm on my fifth playthrough of Inquisition right now and I'm on my third or fourth playthrough for the original Dragon Age because I did play it through twice with the same type of character because I really like the Dalish origin, but now I'm playing the human noble and Alistair.

07:38.000 --> 07:48.000
Anyway, because he's pretty. He's a precious cinnamon roll, too perfect for this world. And you know Mass Effect, because modding makes him even better.

07:49.000 --> 08:04.000
You got some fans, fellow fans of PC gaming in chat, Dungeon Buster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying, yeah PC gaming! And SSG100Matt giving us an update on MAGFest. MAGFest is aiming to have tickets and hotel registration open within the next week or two, re their Twitter.

08:04.000 --> 08:14.000
That's going to be my first MAGFest, but I was a fan of the Rockage thing they did out here, which was related, and everybody tells me, you got to do MAGFest, you got to do MAGFest. Alright, fine, I'll go.

08:14.000 --> 08:22.000
I also, since we're talking about PC gaming, I want to give a special free plug because it's not like we have an affiliate thing with them.

08:22.000 --> 08:34.000
For anyone who remembers the early 90s games, the Forgotten Realms, the Baldur's Gate, BioWare's first foray into RPGs, the Icewind Dale, some of the more obscure.

08:34.000 --> 08:47.000
Because a lot of those old TSR D&D RPG games were pretty, like Ravenloft I think was one of them with the mummy on the cover. All that stuff is on good old games, GOG.com for like $1.98 per game.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
GOG does some great deals.

08:49.000 --> 08:59.000
And that is for this weekend, so this is a live audience exclusive. So if you're downloading this on the podcast feed, unless Rob gets it up by midnight and you listen to it before you go to bed tonight, which, wow, okay.

09:00.000 --> 09:10.000
That's just a tip for those listening live. You can get a whole bundle, I think for like $15 for like 20 games, literally hundreds of hours of gameplay.

09:10.000 --> 09:21.000
Planescape Torment, which a lot of people think is the best 90s RPG ever for PC, is also like $1.98. It's insane, so everyone go check that out.

09:21.000 --> 09:34.000
Awesome. Yeah, hey, I know we don't get paid by these companies to give shout-outs, but I am a fan of good deals tonight. Anyhow, I want to get into our kickoff topic tonight because we actually have a really big show tonight.

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
I mean, you know, we always try to do a big show here at Orange Lawn Straight Open. Tonight's like a really big show. We actually have some guests joining us tonight.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
At about 6.30, we are actually going to be joined by some voice actors, and I'm really excited about this. We're pretty much going to have like a live panel.

09:49.000 --> 10:01.000
We've been talking about conventions, right? We're going to have like a live panel here on the show tonight all about voice acting. We're going to be joined by Andrew Jones, who's like a casting director, and we're going to talk to Greg Berger.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
Greg Berger, you video gamers probably know him, I mean he's done a few things, but you guys probably know him best as Jecht from Final Fantasy X.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
Although if you watch cartoons, Dark Sakura practically peed her pants when she heard.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
He's Grimlock.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
He's Grimlock.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
And Skyfire.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Yes.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
Grimlock.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
And he's Odie. So, I mean, he's going to be here live, taking your questions in just a little bit.

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
If you have to ask who Grimlock is, then you need to leave.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Go to Wikipedia quick and figure it out.

10:31.000 --> 10:39.000
Alright, also joining us, so that's two, we have three, David Sobolov going to be joining us as well.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
Very excited. He is Asmodan. You guys, gamers, if you play Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm, you guys know Asmodan.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
He is that voice, and he also has an impressive resume from other cartoons and games.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
He is the one that actually had a minor role in Mass Effect 3 as well, so he's tied to our beloved BioWare.

10:56.000 --> 11:01.000
So we're going to talk to all of them in just a little bit, in about 15 minutes here on Orange Laundry Radio.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
So if you want to be able to ask questions, get to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Meanwhile, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, and you know, tonight's kickoff topic,

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
not the sort of thing I like to lead off the show with. In fact, a topic like this isn't really about gaming,

11:17.000 --> 11:27.000
but it's more of a side effect of what happens as gaming is getting bigger and bigger and more and more mainstream and so forth.

11:27.000 --> 11:34.000
Those of you that have probably been paying attention to the news today might have heard about the Pokemon World Championships that are going on right now.

11:34.000 --> 11:43.000
The Pokemon World Championships are happening out in Boston, and unfortunately today, there was a bomb threat at the Pokemon Championships.

11:43.000 --> 11:51.000
And they have actually arrested two individuals in conjunction with this bomb threat that's happened there.

11:51.000 --> 12:02.000
This is crazy. Obviously, sick people doing sick things with this whole thing.

12:02.000 --> 12:10.000
And you know, now we're seeing this type of stuff where these large gaming events are getting targeted.

12:10.000 --> 12:20.000
You know, if you heard that somebody made a bomb threat against the Super Bowl or the Olympics or some other big sporting event,

12:20.000 --> 12:29.000
you'd probably go, that's messed up, people are stupid, but you'd probably also go, it seems like there's always some crazy targeting these large events.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
And now we're seeing it happen with these gaming events even. It's something else.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
What do you guys think when you hear this, that there were people targeting the Pokemon World Championships?

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
And shout out to the police for catching it and shutting it down before anybody got hurt, thank God.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
What do you guys think about this when you hear this? Anybody?

12:50.000 --> 12:58.000
So the two individual suspects, was there actually a device found?

12:58.000 --> 13:04.000
You know what's funny is the story I had closed on me, so I'm trying to find it.

13:04.000 --> 13:14.000
Not that it matters, but I mean, the people that, whatever their intentions were, are going to pay the consequences.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
But aside from the arrest, was there an actual device? I'm just curious.

13:18.000 --> 13:25.000
I got it, I got it. Okay, here we go. So a 27-year-old and an 18-year-old, and I'm not going to read their names and give them any attention,

13:25.000 --> 13:36.000
27-year-old idiot and 18-year-old moron, we'll call them idiot and moron, were, I guess they were actually invited to play in the Masters Division of the tournament.

13:36.000 --> 13:45.000
And they had made threats on Facebook, and there was a post where there were guns that these guys had posted that they were going to take,

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
saying that idiot and I are ready for the world's Boston here we come. And this was brought to the attention of the police.

13:52.000 --> 14:01.000
And so they were stopped from entering the venue on Thursday, firearms were found in the car that idiot and moron had when they drove from Iowa.

14:01.000 --> 14:10.000
Neither one of them had a license to carry, the car was seized, the vehicle had a shotgun, assault rifle, hunting rifle, 250 rounds of ammo.

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
They were arrested on Friday night. So there was no bomb, I guess the bomb threat was on Facebook.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
Okay, but it very easily could have been like a mass shooting situation, and I totally want to throw up now.

14:22.000 --> 14:35.000
People are garbage, and it's gross, and I guess, I include myself in the fact that I do identify with this group, but like the gaming, gamers are gross.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
Some gamers are gross.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
It's an awful industry.

14:39.000 --> 14:48.000
Well, here's the thing that strikes me as like, just like really scary about this. I mean, obviously the whole thing is weird to begin with.

14:48.000 --> 14:54.000
But, you know, usually when we think about video games make people violent, what are the things they target?

14:54.000 --> 15:02.000
They target the first person shooters, the Duke Nukem's, the overly, Grand Theft Auto's, the overly violent games.

15:02.000 --> 15:13.000
This was fucking Pokemon. This was a family event. This is something kids play. That's, well, really disturbing.

15:15.000 --> 15:27.000
I understand what you're saying, but it's a different discussion between the content of gaming and what these two idiots would want to be infamous or getting into notoriety.

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
And for that reason, it's a very, I mean, it's, they're all E-rated games. Parents play them with their kids. Kids love it.

15:34.000 --> 15:41.000
It's got a larger audience than say if it was like, I don't know, BlizzCon or something, which I think is going to skew older.

15:41.000 --> 15:49.000
So it's really frightening that they picked a, you know, something that has that much crossover mainstream appeal.

15:49.000 --> 15:58.000
Anyway, SS21 Hunter Matt says, Boston doesn't mess around with security. Act Deaf to reminding me in chat, the Olympics have had that happen.

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
I apologize if that comparison was in poor taste, but I was just naming some big sporting events that came to mind first.

16:03.000 --> 16:12.000
But I mean, unfortunately, yes, in, in 96 in Atlanta, where I'm going in a couple of weeks, there was a bomb event that occurred and it was all over the media and stuff.

16:12.000 --> 16:25.000
And it was, it was sick then and it's sick now. So, yeah, let's see, also looking in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, SS21 Hunter Matt confirming that one of the guys was a known member of the Pokemon community.

16:25.000 --> 16:35.000
And Dungeon Muster says they boasted about doing this on social media, which the police picked up on, which, you know, was some really weird, sick cry for attention.

16:35.000 --> 16:52.000
So anyway, again, not that I think this has anything to do with gaming directly, but the reason why I bring it up is it's just one of those like really like sad after effects of seeing gaming get bigger and bigger and more into the mainstream.

16:52.000 --> 17:02.000
You know, gaming is becoming more mainstream. These on demand, you know, Shane was over here the other day, we were watching like a Heroes of the Storm tournament on the TV, like it was ESPN practically.

17:02.000 --> 17:12.000
Granted, we were using Twitch to do it, but, you know, as TV gets more and more virtual, you know, more and more of this stuff gets mainstream, you know, these big gaming events are big sporting events.

17:12.000 --> 17:27.000
So I guess also the moral of the story, so to speak, you know, these guys were talking about it on Facebook, you know, I would hope that none of you hang out with people that would ever do things like this.

17:27.000 --> 17:38.000
But if you ever see something like this on Facebook or something, like, you need to alert the authorities. And don't fucking joke about this stuff either, because it's no joke.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
Not that I think any of you guys would, but I'm just saying, you know, you have to take this kind of crap seriously, because unfortunately, those guys had guns in their car, they were serious.

17:48.000 --> 17:58.000
Anyway, let's try to change the topic. Back to the games that are fun, we like, we enjoy, and not where there's-

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Not that violent Pokemon stuff.

18:00.000 --> 18:08.000
Yeah, right? Let's talk about our gaming weeks here real quick. I'll probably have to interrupt us in the middle of this here, because we're gonna have our guests on shortly.

18:08.000 --> 18:14.000
But we always like to start off the show with, how was your gaming week? So I want to talk to Dark Soccer real quick. How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?

18:14.000 --> 18:28.000
Old. I played some Dragon Age Inquisition, of course, because I always do. I played Final Fantasy XIV, I'm actually getting back into the story, I'm around the 2.2 patch stuff right now.

18:29.000 --> 18:44.000
But I'm playing, I'm playing. And Dan and I busted out the Super Nintendo last night, we busted out the sealed box of games, the ones that we've got in the special plastic, and we are playing through Chrono Trigger.

18:44.000 --> 19:06.000
I, all of my save files were intact, so we new gamed plus that shit, and we are piling through the story. So, since playing since last night, we just got the epic last, uh, today. So, we are on our way.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Nice!

19:08.000 --> 19:18.000
We're at the point where you go back to 12,000 BC and get, uh, Magus. Man, he had such a cool name in Japan, though.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
What was that? I forget.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Maul.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Oh, that's right.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Demon King.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Sounds scary.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.000
Yeah.

19:24.000 --> 19:40.000
When I saw that box of games, of in their case, or in their box with the instructions and all that, the first thing that I thought was, I used to have nearly all of those, but then that leads me to my second thought, that's easily like $1,500 on eBay.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
Yes, it is.

19:42.000 --> 20:05.000
The reason why I no longer have those things is because I think I parted with my near mint Chrono Trigger for like $120, $150, and then I was able to sell the official strategy guide, which had a ton of really gorgeous artwork in it from Akira Toriyama, for like another $50 or $60. So, money, money, money. Especially that Ninja Gaiden trilogy you have.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
Yeah, we, um, the last one of those that went in the condition ours is in.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Went for about $450.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Wow.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Um, one without the manual or box went for about $200.

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
Yeah. Not that you guys would ever, but as soon as I see all that stuff.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
We tried to sell it once.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
I'm just like.

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
We tried to sell Ninja Gaiden first. Um, we put a $350 buy it now on it.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
Yeah, but if they don't make your limit, then you're not gonna sell it.

20:32.000 --> 20:44.000
We didn't go at the time, but we, we were sort of talking about downsizing the collection a little bit just because, um, it's not that we have less space, but the room is oddly shaped with the windows and closet and everything.

20:44.000 --> 20:54.000
So, um, we were talking about that last night, but we're, we're thinking about how we can bring back the vault properly and what we're going to do with it. More news, news later, news later.

20:54.000 --> 21:03.000
Good. I, I need to come over and we're going to stream some games cause you got so many games that I think there's so many people out there that haven't seen a lot of these classic games.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
Like, you know, I'm sure everybody knows Chrono Trigger. If you don't, you probably want to look into that.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
Uh, but there's, there's a lot of stuff you guys have in the vault.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
I'll try to post some stuff up on my Tumblr in a few.

21:13.000 --> 21:20.000
Awesome. Awesome. All right. Uh, well, um, Alan quickly before we get to our interview here, how was your gaming week?

21:20.000 --> 21:28.000
Good. Um, really quickly, I have a Final Fantasy 14 story on, uh, the show roll for me, so I won't talk about that as much.

21:28.000 --> 21:42.000
Um, I've been doing a lot of PvP in 14 simply because for the end game, uh, story content and rating and stuff, I'm, I've run out of stuff to do, um, without doing the savage heroic hardcore mode, which I have no interest in doing.

21:42.000 --> 21:52.000
Um, I bought Pinball Arcade, uh, two weeks ago on Steam. They had the pro edition for 19 bucks and almost every single table that I would want is in the season one pack.

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
Um, the Addams Family, which I know you had the guy on, was interviewed on OLR about getting the Addams Family.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
That is correct.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
That's season four. Um, there isn't a lot that interests me in the other seasons.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
I almost feel like season one has too many good games in it that they needed to spread out amongst the other ones because I don't really have any incentive to buy it.

22:12.000 --> 22:19.000
So I've played a lot of that, a lot of, um, Twilight Zone. It's amazing how much crap is crammed into that board.

22:19.000 --> 22:27.000
Um, lots of Elvira Scared Stiff, which I played a ton of when I was, uh, 1920 at the Nickel Arcade in Walnut Creek.

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
Uh, I'm playing Mass Effect trilogy all the way through again, or I plan on it.

22:32.000 --> 22:42.000
The reason why I'm playing it again is because I want to be gay with Kayden in Mass Effect 1 that you can do, but you have to do it one of two ways.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
If you, if you want to do Sheploo, which is the generic Shepard, you can do that from jump.

22:47.000 --> 22:57.000
If you want to use a custom Shepard with a custom face and background and name, which I do, you play it all the way through, you set yourself to female, then you beat it.

22:57.000 --> 23:06.000
And then when you do a new game plus, you set yourself back to male and then that screws up the flag enough to where you can be a custom Shepard and romance Kayden as if you were a woman.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
But not have Jennifer Hale's voice coming out of a male Shepard's body, which is one of the bugs that can happen if you do it the other way.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
All right. So kind of, kind of some general mods on the game.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Yeah.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
Why is it that you, you go back and visit Mass Effect? I mean, why, why this game? Why now?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
It's...

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
Is this prepping for Andromeda or...

23:25.000 --> 23:35.000
But kind of, I know I have a lot of problems with a lot of the stuff that they did at Inquisition story-wise and how it kind of shed on a lot of the, the first two Dragon Age games.

23:35.000 --> 23:40.000
Bioware's kind of gone downhill in their writing quality, maybe lost up their own butt a little bit.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Ooh.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
But they're still great or whatever. Like, don't send an email.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
They've gone from a 10 to a 9.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Yeah.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
In your eyes. Okay.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
Mass Effect 1 and 2 is just really fucking good storytelling.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
Like, Vermaier, even though you know it's going to happen, is really intense.

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
And Ilos and the whole spree from Ilos through going back into the Citadel and, spoiler, spoiler, is all really intense.

24:03.000 --> 24:12.000
So it's all really great storytelling that's so good that so long as I shelve it for like maybe a year, I can revisit it again and it's still just as exciting.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.000
It's like watching a classic movie.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Yeah.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Except you're the star.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
Yes, exactly.

24:17.000 --> 24:21.000
All right. Anything else for your gaming week before we move on?

24:21.000 --> 24:26.000
Pinball. We played that new You Don't Know Jack game.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Oh, the Quiplash.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Quiplash, which we only had three people and I think it needs at least five to be really good.

24:31.000 --> 24:36.000
It wasn't bad. It was just you only have one person really voting on your stuff when there's only three people.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Yeah.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
I noticed they really set that game up for streaming though.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
They must have seen how many people were streaming the Jackbox Party Pack and so they really set up Quiplash.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.000
You can extend the time for answers. It really lends itself well to game streaming.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
I liked how the studio saw that that was happening.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Remember, we had them on the show right before Jackbox Party Pack came out.

24:55.000 --> 25:00.000
We had them on the show and they were kind of talking about watching and participating even with some of those streams.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Pretty cool.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah, so that's it really.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
All right.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
DungeonBuster in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
I really like the first Mass Effect for the same reasons.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.000
When I finally made it to Ilos, that was a great moment.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.000
There you go.

25:15.000 --> 25:22.000
I am going to slightly disagree with some of the shitting on the lore stuff for Dragon Age Inquisition.

25:22.000 --> 25:27.000
If you go back and look at some of the things, I think these were all planned from the beginning.

25:28.000 --> 25:39.000
There was a very big, long explanation about how no one writing the actual codex entries within the scope of the universe actually knows what they're talking about.

25:39.000 --> 25:51.000
It's all having to do with things getting lost to time, things being a perception, having half of your history wiped out and coming from an oral history.

25:52.000 --> 26:00.000
So I think that what we're getting is actual source material as opposed to an interpretation.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Opinions here at OLR.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
We have them and you have them.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
And you know what else we have tonight?

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
We have some guests that are going to be joining us here live.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
And since this is live radio, I'm going to actually call these guys right now.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
We are going to welcome onto our program.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
We actually have a trio of voice actors joining us tonight.

26:18.000 --> 26:23.000
We have Andrew Jones, Greg Berger, and David Sobolov are going to be joining us here.

26:23.000 --> 26:28.000
We're getting them on the line right now to join us on the program here at Orange Lounge Radio.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
If you guys are listening live, you can head on over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

26:34.000 --> 26:41.000
And if you have any questions for our trio tonight, we'd be happy to get out as many of these questions as we can.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
But I think we have everybody connected on the line.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
So welcome, guys, to Orange Lounge Radio.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
Hello.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
Thank you.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Hello.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Yo, yo, yo.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
It's like we're doing a live panel tonight.

26:53.000 --> 27:00.000
I know you guys have to do the convention circuit all the time with all the many voices that you guys have provided over the years.

27:00.000 --> 27:03.000
So it's kind of like we're going to do that live here on OLR.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
I love that.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
All right. Are you cosplaying?

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
Am I cosplaying?

27:08.000 --> 27:16.000
Actually, I am wearing my outfit that I wore for like half my Joker costume, like my casual Joker.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Joker for Mass Effect 3, not Joker for Batman.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Oh, cool.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
Yeah, every time I say Joker, everybody assumes that one.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Seth Green's Joker.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
And I'm signing a photo for you right now.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.000
Awesome.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Yes, autographs.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Can we get a picture, a selfie?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Sure, sure.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
All right, awesome.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
Let me go down the line and introduce everybody we have here on our panel tonight.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
First off, Andrew Jones joining us tonight.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.000
What's up, Andrew?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Nothing much. How are you?

27:40.000 --> 27:43.000
I am great. Tell us a little bit about yourself.

27:43.000 --> 27:50.000
So I work in casting, directing, and actually it's funny because David and Greg are both my mentors.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
I've studied voice acting and acting with both of them.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
And I've tried to work a little bit in voice acting.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
I worked on a show for Fusion, formerly TV Reguide, called Like, Share, Die.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
And I'm doing some stuff for some video games, so it's going to be pretty awesome.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
Awesome, awesome.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
Also joining us on our panel tonight, David Sobolov is here tonight, everybody.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
Welcome, David.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
David, can you hear me okay?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
I just got you.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
On the Skype call, sometimes if you get a phone call, it cuts it off and that's what just happened.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Oh, no, you're a popular guy.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
The people are trying to call you right now.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
I'm here, I'm back. David Sobolov, happy.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Well, welcome to the program, David.

28:30.000 --> 28:37.000
I know a lot of gamers probably know you best as, I know, like, Asmodan from Diablo III, Heroes of the Storm.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Huge character.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.000
What are some other voices some gamers out there might know?

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
Let's see, over the years, I'm literally going to scroll down here.

28:48.000 --> 28:54.000
Oh, Army of Two Devils Cartel, if people saw that, I did a performance capture role on that.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.000
It was Tyson Rios.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.000
Oh, wow.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
That was fun.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
I worked on Star Trek in Darkness, that was the movie.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
There's a Star Trek video game that I was on as well.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I play a whole bunch of parts.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Dota 2, I was Terrorblade.

29:06.000 --> 29:10.000
Oh, that's a huge game, especially in Russia.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I think Dota 2 is gigantic.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
It's very, very big in Asia, I've heard.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Yes.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
It's an e-sport.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
It is. It was one of those huge e-sports.

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
We were watching Heroes of the Storm.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
I think somebody was playing Asmodan even.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
Oh, cool.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Yeah, very cool.

29:24.000 --> 29:28.000
There's a lot more dialogue in that game than he did in Diablo 3.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Really?

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
I would have thought he had a ton more in Diablo 3. Interesting.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
There's more in Heroes of the Storm, and it's much more comedic, too.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.000
Did you enjoy that, getting to put a more comedic edge on a character?

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
Oh, I always do, because I don't get to do that very often with my voice.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
Yeah?

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
I always play the deep voice, like serious guys.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.000
Do you find that you get typecast a little bit sometimes, maybe?

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
Oh, yeah, that's okay.

29:53.000 --> 30:01.000
I used to play 12-year-old girls, but it wasn't really paying the bills, so I went into the deeper voice stuff.

30:01.000 --> 30:06.000
I don't know. I think you'd make an amazing Powerpuff Girl, but I guess they already filled that.

30:06.000 --> 30:10.000
I hope they're listening. I'd love that chance for that role.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.000
Awesome.

30:11.000 --> 30:17.000
Also joining us tonight on our panel, say hello, everybody, to Greg Berger joining us tonight.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
How are you doing, Greg?

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Howdy, howdy. Doing well. Thanks for having me.

30:20.000 --> 30:24.000
Thanks for having me. I only go where I'm invited, so thanks for putting out the welcome mat.

30:24.000 --> 30:32.000
You are most welcome. Hey, I know. I love Diablo 3 and Heroes myself, so obviously that was the first thing that came to mind with David.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
And for you, I am a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series.

30:35.000 --> 30:39.000
So when they told me that Jecht was going to be on the show, I was like, what? That's awesome.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Will somebody have to teach that kid to play Blitzball?

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
Oh, my gosh, that's amazing. I love it.

30:46.000 --> 30:55.000
And then, okay, so then I told my co-host here at Dark Soccer, Jamie, I said, you gotta get familiar with Greg, take a look at the IMDB, take a look at the resume.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.000
I might have squealed.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
And she literally squealed. What was the one that you saw that got you to squeal, Jamie?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Grimlock.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
Grimlock.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.000
Me munch metal.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
I love it.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
You're not playing with your voice.

31:09.000 --> 31:15.000
You don't know how many copies of Transformers the movie I have, including the Japanese laserdisc.

31:17.000 --> 31:31.000
I've had the great good fortune at convention of being involved in some big screen screenings of the film with popcorn fights in the audience and people screaming and basically knowing the script, you know, by heart.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
The Rocky Horror Transformers show.

31:35.000 --> 31:52.000
I just have enjoyed every time I've seen it. One of them was with Flint Dilly, who was the story editor and one of the producers, and he actually had a stop motion option, which allowed him to tell some behind the scenes story as we watched. Phenomenal.

31:52.000 --> 32:00.000
I mean, I remain extremely proud of it. I think it's a great story with lots of twists and turns and a really good movie about robots.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.000
That's awesome.

32:01.000 --> 32:13.000
I mean, Transformers was pretty much like the first real addiction to any animated series I had. I mean, as a kid, I was a kid in the 80s, and that was like every day for me.

32:13.000 --> 32:25.000
I was introduced at a convention by a guy who said when this show was on in the morning, it's the reason I was late for school every day. When they moved to afternoons, it's the reason I always left before the end of my last period class.

32:26.000 --> 32:32.000
I'm going to ask Dark Soccer to do some breathing techniques and calm down the fandom just a little bit. It's professional here.

32:32.000 --> 32:47.000
But I do have to ask this because it is a video game podcast, and we always stay up on the gaming news. Greg, I don't know if you've probably haven't heard of this, but in Splatoon, the Nintendo title, they oftentimes do what they call Splatfest, where it's Team X versus Y.

32:47.000 --> 32:54.000
For example, a few weeks ago, they had Team Cat versus Dog. They had, what was it, Team Roller Coaster versus Team Waterslide?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
And there was Marshmallow and Hot Dog.

32:56.000 --> 33:02.000
Yeah, something like that. Well, the upcoming one is actually the first tie-in with another property, and it's Transformers.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Cool.

33:03.000 --> 33:19.000
So it's Team Autobots versus Team Decepticons. Now, I would think the answer to this is probably obvious, but you never know. So I'm going to ask, Greg, which team do you think you would be splatting in Splatoon for? Team Autobots or Team Decepticons?

33:19.000 --> 33:35.000
Well, Long Haul is a Constructicon, so there's that. And he didn't join his outfit to be no dump truck, but he's a worthy adversary. But meet King! So I kind of got a pull for my team.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
All right.

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
Now, if it's Autobots versus Marshmallows, I think that remains, that's pretty easy.

33:41.000 --> 33:48.000
Well, there it is. It's settled, guys. I think I just ruined Splatfest and had the whole thing tilted in one direction there. All right. There we go.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
Oh, I wouldn't have the slightest idea. I'm just speculating.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
I think you should have, like, Greg Burger and David Funanabi. David, you were shockwave on Transformers Prime.

33:57.000 --> 34:03.000
Yes, I was. I was also depth charge on Beast Wars, so I was on both sides.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Oh, jeez.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
Oh, my God.

34:05.000 --> 34:12.000
But he was, you know, depth charge was barely good. Just on the good side, just like 5%.

34:12.000 --> 34:21.000
Love it. Well, again, thank you guys so much for joining us tonight. And if you guys have questions for our trio in the chat room, head on over to live.vognetwork.com.

34:21.000 --> 34:28.000
We have some comments here in chat. Bonds006 says, I'm looking at the IMDB stats. The fandom is high tonight.

34:28.000 --> 34:38.000
Let's see, another comment in chat here. Everyone in the OLR chat room just wetted themselves there at the Grimlock. Awesome.

34:38.000 --> 34:44.000
Well, hey, let me ask this. So you guys are all voice actors, and I'm sure this, you know, kind of brings this first question to mind.

34:44.000 --> 34:51.000
What made you decide this is the life for me? I want to get into voice acting. This is my calling. This is what I want to do.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Andrew, I'll start with you.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
My thing is I've been trying to get more into voice acting. I've done a few things non-union.

34:59.000 --> 35:05.000
It's funny, the more I do that, the more I get pulled into doing, like, casting and voice directing, more so casting than that.

35:05.000 --> 35:15.000
But the reason I particularly liked voice acting or I like it and it's something I want to pursue is I studied theater in Florida and I studied theater out here.

35:15.000 --> 35:21.000
And I just found it more freeing to be able to just get behind a microphone and embody a character.

35:21.000 --> 35:32.000
I feel like it's a little bit, for me, less anxiety or some sort of stress, but it capitalizes on creativity because they don't really care that I'm 5'6".

35:32.000 --> 35:38.000
It's like, oh, you're Frodo Baggins. You are not going to play an action hero. And it's like, yeah, yeah, I understand that.

35:38.000 --> 35:51.000
You know, so I like the idea that if I can sound like a character, if what I'm saying is believable and what I bring to the table is what they, you know, want, then that's all they care about.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
It doesn't matter what I look like. I could show up in, like, feedie pajamas and wear a T-Rex hat and they wouldn't care.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
Casual Friday is every day in voice acting, right?

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
Love it. Greg, what about you? What made you decide that voice acting is for me?

36:06.000 --> 36:19.000
Well, I can abbreviate the story and tell you the emphasis is more on the acting than the voice because when the character is three-dimensional and true, the voice goes wherever the rest of it carries.

36:19.000 --> 36:38.000
I came to Los Angeles as an actor with a show. I actually have always pursued this as supplemental, but I was seen in a show that started in New York and I was in the L.A. company by someone notable who asked to say hello after the show.

36:38.000 --> 36:48.000
He said if I was as versatile as what they had seen on stage, they should know about me for animation and without missing a beat, I said you've had my demo for several months now.

36:48.000 --> 36:54.000
If you can move it from the bottom of the pile to the top of the pile, it's exactly what I'd love to be doing.

36:54.000 --> 37:03.000
I've been smitten by it since my, you know, chin was on my fist on Saturday morning watching shows on the floor of the living room.

37:04.000 --> 37:32.000
So I have a great loyalty to all of the greats and when I was seated next to Mel Blanc and in the room with Don Messick and June Ferre still, I'm working with my heroes and they may or may not be well-known names to other people, but to have been allowed in the course of my career to work with most if not all of my heroes is just jaw-dropping for me.

37:32.000 --> 37:43.000
And you know what's so funny is like right as you're telling this story, SSG100Matt just posted a question in our chat, who is your idols or inspiration in voice acting and so it's so funny that you said that and then Dark Soccer, you know, June Ferre.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.000
You named one of mine.

37:44.000 --> 37:51.000
Yeah, I mean she's flawless, she's amazing and Mel Blanc's certainly like one of the just originals, so.

37:51.000 --> 38:03.000
We actually, I don't know how many know, but in addition to Grimlock, I'm also Odie, Haridee, Alley Cat, Herman the Mailman and Squeak the Mouse on the Garfield show.

38:03.000 --> 38:16.000
And June Ferre has over the past few seasons been an irregular regular, so she's dropped in with some frequency and you know, just to be able to call her a friend is fantastic for me.

38:16.000 --> 38:22.000
I think we're all excited that we get to call Grimlock a friend now, having been on OLR.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
Me no kisser!

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Okay, fair enough, fair enough.

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
David, how about you? What made you decide voice acting, this is what I want to do?

38:31.000 --> 38:41.000
Well I had studied acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and I was thinking I would be doing theater, I was thinking I would be doing on camera and I did a lot of theater, I did about 30 plays.

38:42.000 --> 38:52.000
And while I was doing the plays, people were saying, I've got this great voice for villains, you should do these villains. And I kind of have a great face for radio, like a thug look to me.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
I get the same thing, I get the same thing all the time, I hear you.

38:55.000 --> 39:07.000
Yeah, so the parts I was being offered on camera were just not really that interesting. And it got way more interesting when I got into voice acting, so I stuck with it, they kept encouraging me with a paycheck.

39:07.000 --> 39:16.000
And I also had a lot of fun along the way and it just became something I was trying out and became my life. That was about 20 years ago I started it.

39:16.000 --> 39:24.000
I think you guys are all very fortunate to just be born with that type of voice, you know what I mean?

39:24.000 --> 39:30.000
Because when you guys are talking, I'm like, I would just listen to a podcast with these guys, just talking.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
I think we are listening to a podcast with these guys.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
I think we are right now listening to a podcast with us talking.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
Rob's going meta tonight.

39:37.000 --> 39:46.000
Sadly, I only get you for 30 minutes, but I'm talking on the regular. Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom over at live.vogue.com says, just erase the rest of the show role and keep them on.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.000
I'll keep them here as long as I can. I will.

39:50.000 --> 40:02.000
Well, here's the deal. A distinctive voice can only help to serve you. However, if your acting chops are honed, and both David and I are teaching for Grey Knight Productions right now,

40:02.000 --> 40:14.000
but if your acting chops are honed, you'll come up with something original, unique, and memorable if that's what you're suited for.

40:14.000 --> 40:23.000
If I hadn't studied acting, I'd probably have about 5 credits on my IMDB instead of 100, because you have to be able to just go in 50 different directions.

40:23.000 --> 40:29.000
I don't really have the type of voice, the type of comedic training that I think Greg has.

40:29.000 --> 40:41.000
I think a lot of what I'm doing is variations on a theme, but it's really based on telling the story, living truthfully under these crazy given imaginary circumstances we have in animation and video games.

40:41.000 --> 40:51.000
Often they'll throw the character in front of me and I'll make it up on the spot. I'm sure Greg's had to do that at times, too. I don't really have a lot of voices that I pull out of a hat.

40:51.000 --> 40:57.000
If I may chime in, by the way, I completely agree with my mentors and the people I've studied with, and I completely agree.

40:57.000 --> 41:07.000
A lot of the stuff that they talk about actually came into casting for me, because I found that the projects that I've worked on, I've had someone with a voice that I'm like,

41:08.000 --> 41:15.000
I literally push my chair back. That's great, but then I don't believe a darn thing that they're saying.

41:15.000 --> 41:23.000
I've had people that have the everyday approachable average voice, but their performance is so captivating that you feel for them.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.000
That's what I think it's about, reaching out and finding a way to make your audience care about what you're saying.

41:29.000 --> 41:40.000
So let's talk a little bit more, Andrew, about this Grey Knight productions that you have, because I know you are, since we're talking about having the voice but then learning how to refine the voice,

41:40.000 --> 41:49.000
I know this is a big passion that you guys have, is that you're actually helping people learn how to more refine the voice and how to act and so forth.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.000
So tell us a little bit about this school that you've set up, Andrew.

41:52.000 --> 42:00.000
So I started Grey Knight as a means, because I've taken acting classes all throughout Los Angeles, and there's some predators out there who will take your money and go,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Ha ha ha, you're so good at acting.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
Predators? In Hollywood? Get out!

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
No, they're all so honest and caring.

42:06.000 --> 42:17.000
But no, I started my production company because I'm like, okay, well, I know some of the best people on the planet who do what they do, and I figured those are the best teachers.

42:17.000 --> 42:24.000
Now, granted, just because someone's famous or does this and is in this project doesn't mean that they're qualified to teach.

42:24.000 --> 42:33.000
A lot of people that I bring in, I've either studied with or they've gotten ridiculous references, or their background really supports their argument.

42:33.000 --> 42:43.000
But yeah, so the goal is, you know, I work in casting, and I've discovered that a lot of people, especially with my generation, some of them don't have the substance.

42:43.000 --> 42:53.000
They go, oh, that looks easy, and, you know, Greg and David can tell you the same thing, where it's like, they go, wow, you know, I do a great Donald Duck impression, or I do this really well.

42:53.000 --> 42:58.000
And it's like, oh, that's nice. Can you act? And they're like, uh, uh, uh.

42:58.000 --> 43:07.000
So the whole point of Grey Knight was just, it's to basically offer the highest quality classes, you know, in a premier environment.

43:07.000 --> 43:16.000
I mean, like, we're using Formosa Interactive, and they did, like, God of War, and they worked on, like, Last of Us, and they worked on Carlson Riddick, and some of the stuff for Frozen.

43:16.000 --> 43:24.000
So, you know, it's creating the best possible environment with the best teachers, and, you know, trying to make it competitive and fair so it doesn't kill a student's pocket.

43:24.000 --> 43:32.000
I think that's a really good point, too, about the whole I can do an impression versus can you stay in that impression, because I know I can do a mean Miss Piggy.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
It's all about you.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
I can do a Miss Piggy.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
You can't do a happy Miss Piggy?

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Only a mean one.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
You might need to do a happy one sometimes.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
I can do a Miss Piggy, but I can't, like, you asked me to act, I would never be able to do it.

43:46.000 --> 43:52.000
So, you know, I think I might need a class or seven to teach me how to get that better.

43:52.000 --> 44:00.000
But this is, unfortunately, I know we're a global show, but you're mostly focused in the Los Angeles area, right?

44:00.000 --> 44:09.000
For now, actually one of the things I'm trying to figure out or work out, I'm figuring out if I can do a phone patch or if I can do, ISDN is way too expensive.

44:09.000 --> 44:24.000
But I'm trying to find a way to actually make it so that people can study if they're in, you know, like freaking New Zealand or Australia or London or whatever, and they can kind of tap in, you know, finding a way to make it so that people around the globe can actually take these classes.

44:24.000 --> 44:38.000
And, you know, I'm currently trying to find a way to kind of just, you know, I guess the best way to put it is put up the resources and the materials so that people who really want to do this, this is a passion for them.

44:38.000 --> 44:47.000
They can't live without it, you know, they're doing it because they enjoy it, not for the money, you know, that they have the ability to pursue it.

44:47.000 --> 44:55.000
I don't think anyone's location should really necessarily limit them for their ability to educate themselves for what they want to do in their lives.

44:55.000 --> 45:01.000
Well, excellent. I hope through, you know, web conferencing technologies or things like that, you guys are able to do that.

45:01.000 --> 45:12.000
You know, I know we have the podcasting, but, you know, sometimes, you know, it's kind of difficult to set that up in like a school type format, but I think that would be great because actually Greg and David are two of the teachers, correct?

45:12.000 --> 45:20.000
Yeah, no, they're amazing teachers and yeah, they're the ones who actually kind of justified me doing it.

45:20.000 --> 45:35.000
Greg and David have been the staples for my education in the entertainment industry and really just nailed and drove home the whole acting element and I had brought this idea forward and I'm like,

45:35.000 --> 45:51.000
Hey, Greg, David, I'm going to try to do this thing. Do you want to try to do it? Oh, yeah. Oh, no questions asked. I would love to teach. I would love to be able to do this. This is great. I love, you know, and I'm pretty sure that you guys have been approached by other people before, right?

45:51.000 --> 45:58.000
I mean, it's just it's one of those things that's found on ethics. I like to think they like they're doing it because they like what I'm trying to do.

45:58.000 --> 46:09.000
It definitely seems like the voice acting circle is a very tight knit, like little family I noticed because, you know, I see again, it seems like you guys are going to a lot of the same conventions and so forth.

46:09.000 --> 46:22.000
And, you know, I know our pal Marissa here in Los Angeles was actually the one that got us all introduced. And, you know, she's she's talking about all these wonderful people she's meeting and networking with which shout out to Marissa hearts.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
Yeah, Marissa Meisel.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Love that woman.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
She's great.

46:29.000 --> 46:34.000
So let me let me ask a couple more questions about video game voice acting and so forth.

46:34.000 --> 46:44.000
Let me let me ask Greg and David, because you guys have such diverse resumes. You guys have done cartoons, movies, you know, screen capture and so forth.

46:44.000 --> 46:56.000
What is what are the challenges that go into video game voice acting specifically as opposed to I'm going to be doing a cartoon or something like that? How are video games different?

46:56.000 --> 47:03.000
Well, in a cartoon, quite often you have the entire cast. So it's like doing a radio play and you can work off of each other.

47:03.000 --> 47:12.000
But I think I have about fifty five or sixty video games on my resume and I'm DB and only twice have we ever had more than one cast member in the room.

47:12.000 --> 47:19.000
It's usually me by myself and any other dialogue that's happening. I either have to just have it in my head or the director might say it.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
So it is a lot harder without other actors there.

47:22.000 --> 47:28.000
I would think, too, the whole fact that the dialogue can branch in a video game, whereas, you know, with a cartoon, it's static.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
But, you know, you kind of have to suddenly be like, OK, this is the good answer. This is the bad answer.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
You know, I could I could see where that like just is is so easy.

47:36.000 --> 47:40.000
It would it would not make it possible to have everybody in the same room, I would think, in some cases.

47:40.000 --> 47:45.000
Well, I'm sorry. I'm just echoing everything David said up to this point.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
And he and I did a game called Halo Wars to get Halo Wars together.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.000
Oh, I think a few people have heard of that one. Halo Wars.

47:53.000 --> 47:57.000
Yes, Halo Wars is it's pretty popular. That was one of the notable exceptions.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
That's one of the two. We did it ensemble style.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
I'm sure it was inconvenient from a production standpoint.

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
And part of the reason for that is actually understandable.

48:08.000 --> 48:18.000
And that's because there are so many nearly infinite possibilities that the only way to really cover an actor is isolated in the booth.

48:18.000 --> 48:27.000
It's much more difficult to cover that ground ensemble, although it's way more fun for actors to play with actors.

48:27.000 --> 48:39.000
But the relationship in in games, which David was was pointing at, is is really more between the director and the actor, because you're kind of acting in a vacuum.

48:39.000 --> 48:50.000
The director on the other side of the glass has to paint you in and out of scenes and help you find levels that are consistent with other people who may have recorded before you.

48:50.000 --> 48:54.000
But you don't have the luxury of working directly opposite them.

48:54.000 --> 49:01.000
Quite often they have a writer there as well, because on Guild Wars 2, for instance, I get called in to work on that fairly often.

49:01.000 --> 49:08.000
And they will sometimes have three different studios going with milk crates full of scripts.

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
And we all have our own little section that they've they're very organized.

49:12.000 --> 49:18.000
But I've seen in the one studio and imagine this is times three studios, you have three milk crates.

49:18.000 --> 49:30.000
Each milk crate has maybe, I don't know, 4000 pages in it and a quart of milk and a little bit of cream cheese because it's delicious.

49:30.000 --> 49:36.000
A little voice acting schmear. But no, they they'll take out the binder and take out your section and off you go.

49:36.000 --> 49:42.000
And if there's one hundred and eighty thousand lines in a game, there's no way the director is going to have read all that.

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
So they often will have a producer and they'll have the writer there to help them.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
Wow. I can I can only imagine like, well, and that's got to be like so much.

49:52.000 --> 50:03.000
And this this leads into a great question from our chat room over at live.vognetware.com from SSJ100Matt saying that the various voice acting con panels he's gone to, he's heard it put stress on your voice after long sessions.

50:03.000 --> 50:11.000
How long normally does it take for your voice to recover after a recording session or an entire voice acting project?

50:11.000 --> 50:20.000
Let me ask Greg something here. Does your agent generally limit you to two hours of screaming or do you sometimes get the four hours of screaming from video games?

50:20.000 --> 50:27.000
The effort is always to confine the I mean, if it's a war game or if it's a extreme stress.

50:27.000 --> 50:39.000
First, I believe they have to include that language so that there's an option of whether or not you're strong enough, vocally strong enough to withstand that kind of stress.

50:39.000 --> 50:45.000
Because when you say yes to an engagement, you better bring one hundred and fifty percent of your abilities with you.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
That's no time to find out that you've overreached your grasp.

50:50.000 --> 51:06.000
But yes, efforts are made on on behalf of clients to confine those high, high intensity and stress sections of a game to a two hour period rather than a full four hour session.

51:07.000 --> 51:13.000
Although if you're doing, it's not a video game, but if you're doing a feature film, the language is a bit different in that contract.

51:13.000 --> 51:22.000
I've been in situations where I was in a group situation with say about ten voices and we'd be there seven, eight hours.

51:22.000 --> 51:28.000
And it sounds like, oh, well, hey, I work forty hours a week. What's the big deal?

51:28.000 --> 51:37.000
You know, everyone out there saying that. But when you're screaming at the top of your lungs for four hours, that's pretty much all they're going to get.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
You're not going to be able to do it. You asked about recovery. Oftentimes I'll take a day off.

51:41.000 --> 51:49.000
I will schedule, if I can, the video games on the times of the week when I know I have an extra day afterwards before I have to do anything else.

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
And there is no single answer to recovery time because it differs by different talents.

51:55.000 --> 52:03.000
But it also there's no way of knowing how consistently torturous a session is going to be.

52:03.000 --> 52:10.000
But as a rule, most of them, especially if they're combat oriented, are going to be stressful.

52:10.000 --> 52:17.000
Now, we don't get the scripts in advance for video games. For the most part, we're just walking in cold and we might have six hundred lines.

52:17.000 --> 52:23.000
That's a long session. But say we have four hundred lines to do in four hours and we will have never seen that before.

52:23.000 --> 52:29.000
So there's, I think, an additional vocal stress in just having to come up with characterizations in the moment.

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
Sometimes you've done them before, but oftentimes you haven't.

52:32.000 --> 52:37.000
You can do up to three voices in a session and sometimes they have you do more and pay you a bit more.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.000
You know, I bet these are things that most gamers never even think about when they're playing the game.

52:41.000 --> 52:47.000
Is that, you know, there's all that energy that goes into all those screams and everything else that you're doing in the game.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
And the fact that because there is such an air of secrecy around video games,

52:52.000 --> 52:57.000
like I'm sure you guys have plenty more projects in the works you can't talk about because there's all that secrecy that goes into it.

52:57.000 --> 53:04.000
And so you have to go into it cold because, heaven forbid, the script for something like Mass Effect Andromeda or Halo 5 or something leaks.

53:04.000 --> 53:07.000
You know, it's going to be huge. Jamie, you want to jump in here with something?

53:07.000 --> 53:15.000
I was just thinking that it would probably require the same sort of control like with modulation that goes into singing,

53:15.000 --> 53:22.000
especially diaphragm control, controlling your breath, keeping your voice at a particular level.

53:22.000 --> 53:30.000
And I've had a friend of mine who halfway through her master's program as an opera singer had to have vocal surgery for overtaxing yourself.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.000
Not pretty.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
Yeah. And so you guys...

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
That's like a football player getting a leg injury.

53:36.000 --> 53:42.000
Or if you want to look at more pop culture, Chris Cornell, when he had three surgeries on his mostly singer of Soundgarden.

53:42.000 --> 53:48.000
And his voice has never been the same ever since. So, I mean, you guys totally get props from me.

53:48.000 --> 53:57.000
Well, like any other artist, you want to acquire whatever mastery you can over whatever instrument it is you're playing, even if it's your own voice.

53:57.000 --> 54:07.000
But speaking for myself, I believe that in these sessions, by bringing your A-game every time, by not holding back,

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
you don't go out of your way to damage yourself, obviously.

54:10.000 --> 54:19.000
But holding back can make every session take twice as long because it's not translating as true.

54:19.000 --> 54:22.000
If you hold back, it sounds held back.

54:22.000 --> 54:32.000
So there's just a sweet spot, just like a tennis racket, that you look for that strength for yourself.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
It's something you learn just through repetition and skill building.

54:36.000 --> 54:45.000
And if you're skilled enough and they trust you and you're screaming like crazy, they will sometimes allow you to just do one take and they'll take it.

54:45.000 --> 54:52.000
And you're able to come up with a good enough performance that you don't ruin your voice by having to do three or four takes of every line.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
That's pretty awesome.

54:54.000 --> 54:58.000
Wow. This has been so informative. And I'm sad that our time is running out tonight.

54:58.000 --> 55:10.000
But if our listeners want to keep in touch with you guys, I want to make sure you guys have a chance to amply plug your Twitter and your websites and what have you so that folks can follow you.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
So let me just go down the line here.

55:12.000 --> 55:17.000
David, do you have a place that people can follow you and find out more information and hear more from you later?

55:17.000 --> 55:25.000
I'm at Twitter, at Volo Boss. It's my last name backwards. V-O-L-O-B-O-S. And that's kind of my only social media right now.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
There's a lot of them. Sometimes you have to focus on one or two.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.000
Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
There's too many. I understand. Greg, how about you?

55:31.000 --> 55:48.000
Best is Facebook slash my name G-R-E-G-G-B-E-R-G-E-R at Greg Burger on Twitter and coming soon to a, I don't know, Pinkberry near you. I don't know.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Ooh, that's our favorite.

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
Pinkberry.

55:51.000 --> 55:55.000
I think we're on the first name basis of the Pinkberry Twitter.

55:55.000 --> 56:08.000
No, but hopefully coming soon to a convention near you. And I really love the convention vibe. I love the opportunity to say thank you to the people who are kind enough to come and say thank you to us.

56:08.000 --> 56:14.000
Albeit WasabiCon in Florida, October 31st and November 1st.

56:14.000 --> 56:18.000
Greg, any upcoming appearances for you convention-wise?

56:19.000 --> 56:36.000
TFCon, Charlotte, October 16th through 18th. There's some other things in the pipeline, but boy that NDA, those are the three letters we live with daily. And it's all, things are not disclosed until it's time to disclose them.

56:36.000 --> 56:44.000
Well, when they are disclosed after E3 or Game Awards or whatever, they're going to announce it out. We'll have to have you guys back to talk about it.

56:44.000 --> 56:50.000
Andrew, I want to make sure you can plug your website as well. And please, one more time, the acting classes.

56:51.000 --> 57:00.000
Oh yeah, so my website is greenightproductions.com and you can follow me on Twitter and talk to me. I'm pretty responsive to people.

57:00.000 --> 57:10.000
At AJjones828. But yeah, the classes, I'm trying to actually schedule a four-week class with David and Greg in the next couple of months.

57:10.000 --> 57:22.000
So, I mean, I always put stuff up. So yeah, just let me know. Message me if you have a question. And that's another thing too. I feel a lot of people are very, that would be my phone freaking out.

57:22.000 --> 57:26.000
Sorry you guys are fast at following on Twitter.

57:26.000 --> 57:33.000
Oh my god, that was me following you on Twitter that said off your phone? Wow. That's amazing.

57:33.000 --> 57:43.000
My phone is amazing. No, it's, you know, I feel a lot of people get a little bit wow or a little bit shy about stuff because they think, oh, it's, you know, it's Greg Burger and David Sobolov.

57:43.000 --> 57:50.000
And it's like, no, I mean, they're amazing teachers and, you know, I'm open to questions and so are they.

57:50.000 --> 57:58.000
Oh, I am announced at a G.I. Joe, original G.I. Joe panel at Long Beach Comic Con September 12th, I believe.

57:58.000 --> 58:09.000
Another favorite. I know we could just, we could just spend hours and hours talking to these guys about all these various roles and impacts they've had on our favorite games and cartoons from way back.

58:09.000 --> 58:16.000
But I got it. They got it. They got a busy night ahead. I got to let them go. Thank you so much for taking the time out to be on our show tonight. I really appreciate it, you guys.

58:16.000 --> 58:22.000
And best of luck with not only the classes, but all your future projects that you can't talk about yet.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
Thank you. Thank you for having us.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
You are most welcome, guys. Take care.

58:28.000 --> 58:29.000
Take care.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.000
All right.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.000
Cheers. Bye.

58:31.000 --> 58:39.000
Good one. That was Andrew Jones, Greg Burger, David Sobolov. Some fantastic voice acting talent there on the program.

58:39.000 --> 58:46.000
Dark Soccer, you were covering OK from fangirling over there? No, that was awesome. That was awesome.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
I have happiness.

58:49.000 --> 58:57.000
I wish, you know, sadly, I was not born with the deep voice that those guys like David has.

58:57.000 --> 59:04.000
But, you know, it is what it is. And I think those guys are extremely talented at what they do.

59:04.000 --> 59:10.000
And that was great to hear even those little little excerpts of some of their characters here. Alan, what do you think of all that?

59:10.000 --> 59:11.000
It was great.

59:11.000 --> 59:15.000
Yeah, we get some great guests here on Orange Lounge Radio. We're so happy. So happy.

59:15.000 --> 59:21.000
Hey, if you want to, if you think you have an idea for a guest here for Orange Lounge Radio.

59:21.000 --> 59:24.000
Because like I said, Marissa got us and hooked us up and got us in touch.

59:24.000 --> 59:28.000
Please feel free to reach out to me anytime. robatvognetwork.com

59:28.000 --> 59:33.000
If you want to get in touch and get somebody booked here on the show.

59:33.000 --> 59:38.000
ActDeftInChat saying, it's always great to hear voice actors. I agree.

59:38.000 --> 59:43.000
SG100Matt says, everyone follow him, break his phone. Good plan. Good plan.

59:43.000 --> 59:51.000
And Bobby Black Wolf saying VOG has the best interviews. You know, we're pretty, I try to be humble, but we're pretty darn good.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.000
You should have asked me for some interview questions because I had some stuff I could ask them.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Oh no, I didn't know you were, you should have thrown something at me.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
No, I wasn't waving at you. You had it all planned out.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Actually, I improved most of that. With the help of the chatters.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Rob reached into his underwear and pulled out. No.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
But I only had 30 minutes, so I had to make the best of the time I had.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
What would you have asked out of curiosity?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000
If anything jumped out at them where a video game script, especially for the Final Fantasy ones,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
where the word salad was so bad that they had no problem saying it,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000
but they had to turn to the producer and be like, life ether, what the fuck am I saying?

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Because I know that's come up.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
If any of them are still listening, tweet me the answer at OLR, let me know.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
What do you do about that word salad? That's right.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Some video games that have some weird-

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000
LeCie, Falsie, Seif, like 13 is awful with that stuff.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.000
I just totally want to like find a way to contact Gideon Emery and ask him,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.000
okay, do you just crack up every time you say anything as Urianger in 13?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Oh yeah.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And I love him because he's like all of my favorite BioWare people, practically.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:10.000
But I have to fast forward every time because I can't get over the really bad language.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Well, that's just how-

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
That's how the character's written.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:23.000
It's how it's written, but he has to read those pretentious, overly, anon, forthwith, thou, hence-

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And on top of that, it's grammatically incorrect.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Yeah, it's butchered.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:35.000
It's very, oh my god. So anyway, but as like I was saying though, I was a music major for a short while,

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.000
which is how I met my poor friend who ended up getting vocal surgery halfway through her masters.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:48.000
And I have nothing but mad respect for people who use their voice as their instrument.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I mean, your body using that as an instrument for what you do.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I've pulled my diaphragm before playing the bass when I played Contralto Clarinet.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Any abuse that you put your body through and still get up the next day and do it, mad respect.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
I think there's always a part of me that thinks, Rob, you really should have done a cartoon character.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You really should have gotten into some of that stuff.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And I think there's still a part of me to this day that says that, but I really like doing this radio stuff too.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
It's an awful lot of fun doing the podcasting.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:27.000
I was surprised that one of them had said that for the cartoons, they get to do the ensemble recordings

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:34.000
because when Ayesha Tyler had Adam Reed on talking about Archer on her podcast,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000
that show is exclusively separate, each person.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
That is all spliced together using software and basically the direction that they get.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000
It might just depend on who.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Because Ayesha Tyler and H. John Benjamin have a million gigs going on at once.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
That might be part of it too.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So I think that show in particular is probably maybe a bad example.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
But yeah, I believe that show is almost entirely done piecemeal.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Yeah, and Marissa is saving the day.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
You're asking all these voice acting questions.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Marissa is saving the day in our chat room over at live.vogue.com.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Marissa is saying studios collect clips of when actors lose it.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
That's because that cast has so many working actors.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Yeah, that is probably a really bad example.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
All right, well, again, we want to thank Andrew, David, and Greg for joining us tonight.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
That was a great interview.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And the cool thing is, thanks to kind of getting in with those guys and so forth,

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I'm getting connected with more and more voice actors.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
So look forward to bringing some more on Orange Launch Radio in the coming months.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
I'm hoping to meet up with one at Dragon Con.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
You know, I have like, as far as anything that goes into the production of video games,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
and I'm just going to actually single it back to video games.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
My heart, I think, and I appreciate the things that everyone does,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:58.000
but my heart goes to concept art, manual production, and voice actors,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
and manual production is dying.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
All right, well, let's move on.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
We're still at 7.09.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
We're now we're into the show, and we still haven't even touched a news story yet,

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
but you know what, well worth it for that interview, well worth it.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000
I just want to quickly get into my gaming week because I had to take a quick detour.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
So I've played a lot of the similar stuff that I've talked about in previous weeks.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Still trying to make progress on Gauntlet on the PlayStation 4,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
which I've surpassed what I did on the PC and gotten a little further.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
So that was pretty cool.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I also was playing a little more of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture,

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
which I talked about in more detail last week, so I'll kind of leave my review there.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
But I was chasing some trophies in the game last week.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Just a couple quick new games I want to mention.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
On the PlayStation 4, well, this is an old game in new clothing,

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
but they actually have this growing library of what they call arcade archives

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
available on the PlayStation 4.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I believe the price to be a little pricey.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
They won $8 a game, and they have things in the collection like Gradius,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
but the one I decided to finally pick up this week was Bomb Jack,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
which had just come out just in this past week, I believe.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And Bomb Jack was a game that I remember from the Commodore 64,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
and I believe there was a version of it on the NES as well.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
I think Mighty Bomb Jack was on the NES.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
So I have fond memories of the game, so I decided,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
what the hell, I'm going to pick up the game.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And, you know, it's an 80s arcade game being emulated on the PlayStation 4.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Pretty hard to mess that up.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
But one of the things I like is that they have a lot of options,

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
so you can do all these different ratios in the game.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
You can flip the screen 90 degrees.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
So, you know, for emulation of an 80s arcade game,

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
you know, because not every, you know,

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
when you go to like Virtual Console on NES,

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
you don't always see all these options available.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
What did I say on the NES?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
When you're doing NES Virtual Console on the Wii U,

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
you don't always see all these options.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
So it was pretty neat to have all that.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.000
But one thing that cracked me up about Bomb Jack was that the trophies are a joke.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I got every trophy, I think there's like five bronze and two gold,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
in ten minutes in that game without even trying.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Because the trophies are things like...

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
You started a game, you scored a point.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:10.000
You access the options menu, submit your high score online.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Like seriously, you read the manual.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Like, the trophies are a joke.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
But I'm pretty sure that's because the easiest way for them to do the trophies

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
was to program them all into the shell, the emulator shell.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And so therefore, none of the trophies have anything to do with the game itself.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Like the score you get in the game.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
But yet, the shell knows enough to extract your high score from the game

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
and put it on an online leaderboard.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
So you would think there would be some trophies that are like,

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
get a hundred thousand points, get five hundred thousand points.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
You know, things like that.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
So I was a little surprised at that.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
So that would be my only little complaint.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I mean, the trophies are a real gimme.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
And that's kind of a minor.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Because, you know, who really cares?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
There's not a lot of people that super care about trophies.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Some do, don't get me wrong.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
If you're a trophy whore, these are the easiest trophies you'll ever get

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
in these arcade collections.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000
But if you're not, you're probably going to laugh at how easy most of them unlock.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Just go into every menu option you have and you'll get, like, all these trophies.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
It's pretty funny.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
So that is Bomb Jack.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000
And then otherwise, I want to talk about one other quick game.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:22.000
This is actually a game that is on the phone.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And I don't talk about a lot of phone-based games.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
But it's a brand new one that came out this week.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000
It's called Pac-Man 256.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Pac-Man 256 is, of course, a Pac-Man game.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
I think we've talked about it previously on the show.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
It was one that was in development.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
They've taken the concept of an endless runner,

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
like Temple Run, Jetpack Joyride, those sorts of games,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
and applied it to Pac-Man.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
And they call it Pac-Man 256 because,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000
you remember how on the 256 board on Pac-Man,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
half of it glitches out and it renders the game unplayable, right?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
It's the kill screen version.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Yes, exactly.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
So what they do, instead of it being a left and right thing,

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
they have a glitch at the bottom when you play Pac-Man 256,

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.000
and the glitching slowly moves up the screen.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.000
And the maze is an endless maze vertically.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So you're basically forever chomping away vertically

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:18.000
to try and escape the glitching that's happening at the bottom of the screen.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
And they put a bunch of other twists on it too.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
For example, you have these little power-ups,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
like lasers and bombs and things like that,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
that'll help you in taking out the ghosts.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
But that's where the free-to-play mechanic comes in as well,

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
is that you use coins to get these power-ups,

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
and you can collect them slowly, or...

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Pay $3.99.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Exactly.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Or watch a movie, watch a 30-second ad to get some.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
But you know what, all things considered for a free-to-play game,

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
it's pretty well constructed.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
So I've got to say, I've played some pretty shitty free-to-play games.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I'm always going to say that Act of Time battle, or whatever the square one was.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
The Soul Calibur one.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Oh god, the Soul Calibur game.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
I'm like, oh, I blocked that from my memory.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Why are you doing that to me?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
So as far as free-to-play games go...

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I could bring up something worse.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
I like Pac-Man 256. What?

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Yaris.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Repressed memory. Why did you do that?

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
So anyway, Pac-Man 256, you know, it's free.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
And I think it's a cool little game on the phone.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
I would check that out if you haven't seen that yet.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
So there you go.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Alright, that is it for our gaming weeks.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I'm reading our chat room.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Bonds006 in chat says,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I love when I get lazy trophies.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
You found ammo, food, new player.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Yeah, it's even easier than that.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
And we do have a link, by the way, to greynightproductions.com in our chat room.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Oh, I noticed that it looks like Andrew actually joined us there in chat.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Hello!

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Welcome to the chat room.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
If you guys want to keep asking some questions,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
maybe he'll be good enough to answer there in the chat room.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Before we get into gaming news, some real quick housekeeping.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Of course, follow us on Twitter at OLR.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000
We're also on Facebook.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
As far as upcoming shows go, we will not be here in two weeks.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
There will be no show in two weeks,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
because I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It's also Labor Day weekend,

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000
so many of you guys here in the States are off on travel and so forth.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Those around the world who don't have Labor Day, sorry,

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
but it's a week when a lot of people are going to be away

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
if your favorite show tapes on the weekend.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Bobby Blackwell and I participating in a couple of panels.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Actually, the Dragon Con app is out and now updated,

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
so if you are attending Dragon Con,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000
you should check out the Dragon Con app,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.000
and you're going to want to mark the podcasting past, present,

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
and future panel is the one that I will be attending,

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000
and that is on, I believe, Sunday at 1 p.m.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
That's going to be fun to chat on, because we've been doing OLR for,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I lost count, 13 years, right?

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
We've been doing Orange Lounge Radio for 13 years,

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:03.000
so I think I'm there to talk about the past before it was in iTunes and so forth.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Bobby is going to be doing a panel, I believe it's about community.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Podcasting community, you can check that out Monday at 10 a.m.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I was trying to pull up my own schedule, but it's updating right now on my phone.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
And I must say, I actually am not going to be on the show next Sunday.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
You're not?

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Because you know who I'm going to get to meet.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.000
How dare you?

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Oh, is that next week?

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000
That's next week.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Who are you meeting next week?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Weird Al.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000
You should get a bumper.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
I wish.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
We've got backstage passes and meet and greet tickets to see Weird Al.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
This is the day before my 10-year wedding anniversary.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Ah.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
So, screw you guys, I'm going to see Weird Al.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.000
That's fair, I understand.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
You know, we sponsored a convention in Atlanta,

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:52.000
and Bobby actually left said convention that we paid money to be at

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
to go see a Weird Al concert.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.000
So, this is not the first time that Weird Al has completely interrupted something.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Bobby is a wise, wise man.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
And I just interrupted you in something related to Weird Al.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
And now you're going to drink from the fire hose.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
That wasn't Weird Al that said that, though.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
What's his face that was...

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Seinfeld.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Yeah, that show I don't watch.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
The guy that then went, kind of bonkers.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Wheel of Fish.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
All right, let's get into it.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
We could talk about Weird Al all night, but we're not.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.000
It's not a Weird Al podcast.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000
It's a gaming podcast.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
So, let's get into some gamer news.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Alan, start us off, please.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Nintendo is dropping the price of the 2DS starting August 30th.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
It's going from, I believe, $129.99 down to $99.99.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:47.000
So, $100 will get you a 2DS.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.000
And they are now...

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.000
The core 2DS package will come with a download code for Mario Kart 7.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000
So, that is just standard now.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Some caveats about the 2DS.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
The screen size is not as big as a standard XL 3DS.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.000
The slider and ability to view the 3DS with the two screens that overlay is removed entirely.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Because it's technically meant for little kids.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
And that's obviously why it's called the 2DS.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
So, the 3D ability has been removed.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I know adults that use it, too.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Yeah, a lot of people that originally liked the 3DS play with it off.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Just because I think for some games, like I think Pokémon X and Y,

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:34.000
the battles have a slightly higher frame rate if you just turn it off entirely.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
And I think a lot of other games are like that.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
A lot of Pokémon don't even do the 3D.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
I get motion sick from the 3D.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:44.000
And honestly, like in Final Fantasy Theatrhythm, the 3D is distracting.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I have to turn it off.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Yeah, so if you're like, eh, it was nice, but I don't need it, then that's for you.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Also, again, if a game requires the new 3DS, because certain games require

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.000
whatever new chipset is in the new 3DS, you cannot play that on a 2DS.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Because it's a 2DS and not a new 3DS.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000
So, yeah, that's yay for affordable consoles.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000
3DS is still, you know, the DS platform is still dominating the portable market.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I'm going to be a little bit tinfoil-hatish here, and I apologize,

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
but do you think they could be dropping the price because they're trying to offload these

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
because there could be a successor on the way relatively soon?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Well, whenever I do the gaming predictions for the new year,

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000
I always say Nintendo is going to come out with yet another SKU for the DS.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:45.000
So there's going to be the 2DS plus Omega they have to clear shelf space for.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I don't know.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Alright. Well, also in Nintendo's camp this week, a lot of people talking about

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:55.000
a patent application that has been, you know, we get a lot of gaming secrets

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
out of patent applications, but sometimes it doesn't mean anything.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Sometimes companies file these patents that maybe they're thinking about doing something

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
and they don't end up doing it, or they just want to have those legal protections

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
or what have you. So this week, a lot of people with raised eyebrows at the fact

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:16.000
that Nintendo has filed a patent for a stationary game console without an optical disk drive.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Here's an excerpt from this patent.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.000
An example system includes an internal hard disk drive storing a program and or data,

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
a communication unit transmitting or receiving a program and or data via a network,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000
and a processor executing a program stored in the hard disk drive to perform game processing.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000
The example system is not provided with an optical disk drive for reading out a program

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
and or data from an optical disk.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:50.000
So this has a lot of people jumping to conclusions that possibly Nintendo's next console

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
may not have a disk drive.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Now you may remember, Microsoft got in a lot of poopy water when they announced that

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Xbox One was going to have all these locks on it and it was essentially going to be digital only.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
You remember the whole thing about DRM and so forth.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Well, if you're not going to have a disk drive on a console, one would assume this means

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
that they're going to a digital only type of system.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Well now granted, it would be the only digital only system to have ever existed.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.000
I believe that Ouya was a digital only system.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Correct? Maybe you could put a USB thing in there and read it that way,

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:33.000
but there was no disks in the traditional sense.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000
The Ouya was also only $99 and has recently been sold, as we talked about a couple weeks ago.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:46.000
I'm not sure how gamers would react to a Nintendo console with no disk drive.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I think again, there is a certain type of equity that comes in with having a large gaming library

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000
because you can sell those games back and so forth.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000
But if Nintendo is about to unveil their new console and say,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
well, there's not going to be any disks, so you're not going to be able to buy, sell, trade and all that stuff,

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
but all our games are now only going to be 20 bucks.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Well, that might be, that might, I don't know, I doubt they'd go that low,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
but even if they were to say 30 bucks, I don't know, that might make some people think twice.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Again, we're hugely jumping to conclusions with this.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:28.000
We can't assume anything is going to happen until we hear it from Nintendo themselves,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
but a lot of people speculating what could be happening with this whole NX thing.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
SSG100Matt in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying,

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
I would be worried about this. This is a huge step in the technical direction,

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:46.000
and if Nintendo doesn't pull it off right, then it won't go well for them.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000
Bonds006 says, I think Nintendo can go diskless and get away with it.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I kind of think they can too, because Nintendo also has a very rabid fan base,

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:03.000
where Microsoft, they have a fan base too, but they have just as many detractors as they do fans.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I'm not sure Nintendo has that same ratio, honestly.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I mean, there's always going to be Nintendo detractors.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
There's always going to be haters. You're always going to have a hater somewhere,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
but I just think the ratio is, is different.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
DarkSaga?

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
I'm just going back to the no disk thought.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Nintendo has always been one for wanting to control, though, their format.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.000
You know, hence, they had the, they stuck cartridge for so long,

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.000
and then moved on to their own proprietary disk format,

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:43.000
and I think, honestly, going digital is the best way to control their, I mean,

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.000
then again, I think the other part was it too, is that people would have to pay them for the,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.000
the media as well, because it was their proprietary,

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.000
but still, it just reeks back to having that controllable aspect of it, you know.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Well, you know, not everybody sees this as such a bad thing.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Grayknight is in our chat room and says, I'd love to have no more disks.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
GameStop needs to go away.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Brad from PodCulture responds directly to that comment saying,

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000
only problem, disk space and bandwidth. Games are so huge these days.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Well, you know, I think the bandwidth problem, by the time Nintendo puts out their next console,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
which, you know, even a year from now, I think a lot of that is going to resolve itself out.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
I'm not as worried about that, but then I also think about, well,

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.000
DarkStalker just started opening the show talking about the vault and her collection,

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:32.000
and to hear that those tangible things might be going away is kind of, it's sad in a way.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I don't have the same attachment I do to media today as I do for the older media.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:45.000
I mean, yeah, it's one thing to bust out the Super Nintendo and plug in Chrono Trigger,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:52.000
and go, Chrono Trigger, and then look at my copy of Chrono Trigger on disk and go,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
do I want to play this one? No, I'd rather play the cartridge.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
You know, it's the same thing. I don't mind digital content.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:07.000
I mean, every last game I've bought now in the last, actually, I take that back.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
We've bought two games that were on disk, and they were when we got our PS4.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000
We got Batman, which came with it, and we got Puyo Puyo Tetris.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
Dungeon Buster in our chat, one more comment here, says,

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Arguably, though, we've slowly been moving in that direction with more and more games being available for direct download.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
So if Nintendo's leaping to conclusions with their new console, that's a big bet.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Well, you know, and to be fair to the prior comment from Grey Knight, too,

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:37.000
is that, you know, if you look at, like, phones, iPhones or Android,

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:40.000
you don't put in cartridges in those things right now. It's all digital.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
That's the digital world we live in.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000
But it's also, you pay 99 cents, or free, or, you know, you know what I mean?

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Like, it's a lot less, there's very, very few games that can get away with charging $15

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
as an iPhone or Android download, and the only ones that can are usually what?

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Square Enix games. That's about it. They actually get away with doing that. Anyway.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Well, there's something else, actually, that occurred to me.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:15.000
In our big, you know, relocation of the vault back to the house, we found our boxes of laser discs.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And Dan and I were having a conversation about, I wonder how many of our discs have succumbed to disc ride.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
Ooh.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:32.000
And I haven't, I know that video CDs can also have that layer separation.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Mm-hmm.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:42.000
And be subjected to the same thing. But I'm wondering, though, for CD, DVD, Blu-ray media,

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:48.000
if they have the same susceptibility to layer separation, disc rot.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I mean, disc rot is really just another term for the layer separation on the discs.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:59.000
But they don't have the sustainability, I think, that our old cartridge-based media does.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.000
So, and this is actually more in a response to Bobby saying,

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
in 30 years, people our age will wax politically about their old Halo discs.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Their old Halo discs may not even be functional, if you consider that aspect of it.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
And I will scream fury if our Tron box set is no longer playable.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I will cry bitter, bitter, bitter, slightly manly tears.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Tears, tears don't have a gender.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:38.000
They will be angry. They will be, my tears, if my tears had a voice, it would be Lewis Black.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.000
I'll put it that way.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:43.000
All right, fair enough. We could talk about this subject for a very long time.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
It's just, it's one of those great games.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Halo will never be classic game of the week.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
It's one of the, and you'll have to wait for a week, she's not here.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:55.000
It'll be one of those great debates that goes on for a very long time.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:01.000
But, you know, to humor Bobby's comment there, in 30 years, when we're still doing OLR,

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000
we might be looking back on, wow, has the industry changed?

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Remember when he had a big box of video discs and laser discs and so forth?

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Anyway, to be continued, if Nintendo decides to go in that direction, we will see.

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
In the meantime, we've got more gaming news to cover,

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
so let's go to Dark Soccer for our next story.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Well, in other news, and let me get off of the list of every voice actor I'm in love with right now,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:32.000
there actually was a hearing on the 21st, which was two days ago,

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:35.000
so I haven't seen anything about the outcome of this,

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:41.000
but the California Assembly Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports Tourism, and Internet Media,

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I wonder if that actually has a decent acronym,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:55.000
had a hearing, an info hearing, called California's Video Game Industry Staying on Top of the Changing Game,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000
to where they're basically looking at seeing what the industry looks like now,

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:07.000
and how California can stay a leader in the video game industry.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:16.000
So, they were supposed to go over all kinds of different contributions of computer and video gaming,

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:23.000
of the role in colleges and universities for training, the development talent,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.000
different opportunities for strengthening California's position in the industry,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:33.000
as in money, money, money, and the future of video games,

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.000
as how it applies to education, research, and workforce development.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.000
It's organized by the 57th District Assembly member, Ian Calderon,

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
and supposed to have just all kinds of people there.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:56.000
There's a few folks from EA, there's folks from the Entertainment Software Association,

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
and a bunch of other folks.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
I don't know what the result is, if they're going to publish anything,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
but hopefully we'll see something published before too long.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.000
So, I'm glad that they had some people in the industry there,

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:22.000
but I think if you want a real grasp on, I guess this really was more about the business aspect of it,

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:31.000
but I would have liked to have a little bit more about the social aspects of it,

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.000
about how this is affecting social media.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Well, this is me coming from the sociology background.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:50.000
I would love to see a little bit more about how it encourages education amongst the players,

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:57.000
increases the more social aspects, and I want to see more in-person social events,

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:04.000
and not just contributing to the deterioration of in-person social interaction.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000
Things like that.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000
But I can see California, we need money, and this is money.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000
All right. Well, thank you.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Again, you're bringing up things that will be different.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
It's so interesting to hear about these things that we research now,

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
but it's all going to change in ten years anyway.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
All right. Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
and some video games that are coming soon to a store near you.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000
With Loki not here this week, I'm going to go ahead and just jump in here with the US release dates.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:42.000
So, all the releases this week seem to, well, most of the physical ones anyway, all on the 25th.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:47.000
So, on the 25th, you have to look forward to Amnesia Memories on the PlayStation Vita.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:51.000
There's Honored Definitive Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Gears of War Ultimate Edition arrives on the Xbox One.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I Am Bread on the PlayStation 4, and it's Madden week.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Madden 16 is out on PlayStation 3 and 4, and Xbox 360 and the One.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
The Mega Man Legacy Collection is out this week.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I know a lot of you are looking forward to that.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.000
You can get that on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Nova 1-11 on PlayStation 3, 4, Vita, and PC.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000
One Piece, Pirate Warriors 3 on PlayStation 4, 3, and Vita and Windows.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Shadowrun Hong Kong, PC, Mac, and Linux.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Steins Gate on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And lastly, Until Dawn on the PlayStation 4 on the 25th.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.000
That's the one that they showed at E3, I think, last year with the, what's her name?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Hayden Pantoneer, the... I can never say her name.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
The cheerleader?

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
The cheerleader from Heroes.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Right, she's the one that's like motion capture.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
It was like the scary game where you're running away from the killer,

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000
and I'm sure a lot of you horror fans will be into that.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Also noteworthy, it's coming on a day that we don't usually get video games.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.000
We usually get games on Tuesday, but we're getting some off-cycle game on Sunday,

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
and it's a big one.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And when you're this company, you can release a game any damn time you want.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Disney Infinity 3.0 is one week from today.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000
On everything. Literally everything.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.000
On all the things.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000
It will probably run on an Atari 2600 if they can sell you figures, honestly.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.000
All the things.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Now I'm just picturing this.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
We're not picking you up, Alan, for some reason. Is that microphone off?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
Sorry, it was off because I'm snacking.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Try again.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
You had whispered about,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I don't know, I think I'm really going to get Disney Infinity 3.

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
With all the amiibos you already have.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Rob, don't do it.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Thinking about it, but luckily I have Mega Man Legacy Collection to distract me this week,

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
and I want to check out I Am Bread as well.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
So as long as you can keep me focused on those games,

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I probably will be able to put it off for a little while.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I always talked about that with Disney Infinity 2.0 as well.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I'm going to get it, I'm going to get it, and then I never got around to it

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
because there's all these other games to occupy my time.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Rob.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
What?

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Dragon Age Inquisition.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Play it and do multiplayer with me.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000
That's a thing?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Actually, I've played more multiplayer in that game than I probably have single player.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I haven't played multiplayer yet and I want to play with my friends.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
I'm not good though.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
So?

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Alright, fair enough.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000
I still can't make it past whatever the, what, bronze and mass effects or whatever.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Alright.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
Going to Japan quickly.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:29.000
On the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week on the 27th, Dishonored HD.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Dragon's Dogma Online Limited Edition.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Madden 6.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Sorry, that's not Japan.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
That's your update sneaking in there.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Until Dawn.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Sangeki no Senso is also out in Japan.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
So that's interesting that that game is also coming out in Japan.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
At the same time, we're getting it here in the US.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:54.000
On the Xbox One, Dishonored is also being released on the Xbox One for ye few Xbox owners.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000
Devil's...

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Why are all these Europe dates suddenly showing up on my list?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Sorry, guys.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Super Mario Maker is the next Wii U title to look forward to in early September.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Nothing this week otherwise.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000
On the PlayStation Vita.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
You know the Vita's kicking in Japan.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000
Yet again, another week where everything's on the Vita.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Ayakashi Gohan Omori.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
Himawari, Pebble in the Sky.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
One Piece, Pirate Warriors 3.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Rere Falaise Red of Another.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:27.000
And Raine des Fleurs in limited edition and limited edition DX packs.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
All coming out this week on the Vita.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Lastly, looking at that other handheld, the 3DS.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Oh, this is kind of a big deal.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Dragon Quest VIII gets a Japanese release on the 3DS this week.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Aren't they also getting a Famicom faceplate?

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
For the new 3DS?

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
The new 3DS.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
There is like a red 3DS coming out.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Oh, the Game & Watch faceplate.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Maybe.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I'm not seeing it on my list here.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
It may have already come out.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
It may have then.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I remember hearing about it, which I'd be like, I want one.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:02.000
But, Famicom Remix is also out on 3DS this week in Japan.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
That would obviously be like Nintendo NES Remix over here.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000
So that's kind of neat.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.000
That's nice.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
Cool.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
I wonder if it'll have the extra sound channel like the Famicom actually has.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Ugh.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000
You know, there was something that we picked up a while back.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
It was the power base converter with the FM sound chip playability in it.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And, I mean, it was really cool playing R-Type and whatnot on it.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:35.000
But I would like, it would just be some, you know, a cool thing if there was like a cheap re-release of like a disc system add-on or something.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Yeah.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.000
You know, I would love to go back and play like Zelda with a different sound set.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Or, Castlevania 3 was one that actually, not only did it have a different sound set, but it had different character animations for some of the other characters.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
And it's kind of a little bit harder too.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
Didn't they censor a lot of that too, those Castlevania games?

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.000
There were some, actually quite a bit of censorship in the Castlevania series.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:06.000
But like, my favorite thing about the, actually no, I don't think it was a disc one.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I think it was that it was on the cartridge, but the cartridge had the extra animations.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Like Grant could throw his swords, not his swords, but his daggers and whatnot.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000
She could use them as a projectile player.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Didn't mean to get on that note, but it also though had different sound processor, different, I think it had, now my brain is failing me, but it did have a different sound set.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000
No, you're right. That extra channel was used to enhance the music.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000
That was it.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000
Anyhow, let's move on. You got Europe released.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:46.000
All of three things. On the 25th of August we have Frozen Freefall Snowball Fight on Xbone.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:52.000
On the 28th we have Doubles Third for Wii U and Until Dawn for PS4.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Alright. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
But first, Alan.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Hello.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.000
You got a story about a game you play a lot.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I do. So back in February, I believe, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XIV, which got a revamp after its horrific original launch in 2010, had 4 million active accounts.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:27.000
Well, now this week they have announced that Final Fantasy XIV, which just had its first expansion, Heavensward, come out two months ago.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Yeah.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
They're now at 5 million active accounts.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:53.000
What that means is that 5 million people worldwide, this does not include free trials, 5 million licenses have been purchased and entered into their account to give them full access to the game plus the free 30 days that you get as a part of buying the game.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000
So they've sold 5 million copies of the game but those people may or may not be still playing.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000
Exactly.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.000
World of Warcraft, which I know announced they're really trying to sweep the Warlords of Draenor cycle.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.000
I'm not sweeping under the rug but they've already announced their new expansion and they didn't even wait for Blizzcon to do it.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Even though allegedly their subscriber base has been free falling, their last announcement was 5.6 million active subscribers.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Which I take it to mean people who are beyond their first 30 days, people who have been rebuilt at least once, and people whose accounts have been active.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Which of course is a huge number and when will you fave for all the crap that people talk about World of Warcraft, it's still the juggernaut.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:46.000
It's far more much more money to have 5.6 million recurring subscribers.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:57.000
But it's just proof that I think that a lot of people said WoW was the last MMO that could sustain a subscription based format.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And in 2010 or 2013 when Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn relaunched, people were like there's no reason to pay $14.99 a month for a game when you could play three free to play MMOs back to back and give money to none of them.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Or just pick the one that you're really into to occasionally give $10 a month to and play the other two on your board.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:25.000
There's no way that it's just not possible in the industry and I guess Square's kind of proven them wrong.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:31.000
There was a time when people would say there is no MMO that can compete against World of Warcraft. There isn't a single one.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:39.000
And not that, again, it's little apples to oranges. I don't always like the Final Fantasy XIV to WoW comparisons because they're two different games.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.000
They're two completely different games, they just happen to be in the same genre.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And also every big blue chip license like the Bioware's, the Old Republic MMO, Elder Scrolls had a lot of momentum in the first six months.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.000
And they've not necessarily gone free to play, but they had a big hump and then a big drop down.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:13.000
XIV is still growing. It's the first MMO that people would say, oh it's going to be the WoW killer, which whatever, no it's not.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.000
It's the first one that survived its year and not fallen off a cliff. I think that's safe to say.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Because if you think of all the other big titles, like, what are the two that came out? The one that still was really into?

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Was it Wildstar? Elder Scrolls Online.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:39.000
And then there was another one that I'm blanking on. It came out around the same time as Guild Wars 2.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:51.000
Everyone was like, oh, hype, hype, hype. And it might have sold great the first couple months, but it always has that drop off and then always that announcement, we're going free to play.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:58.000
And I think XIV is the first MMO to really, it's kept its inertia.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:11.000
This might also be the game's Japanese roots or something. I'm talking like business stereotypes. You get the Japanese business stereotype is often very stubborn. We've said that about Nintendo a lot.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Final Fantasy XI, you still have to pay to play that. How long is that game?

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
And they're officially ending that.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Hell no. They're ending it on PlayStation and 360.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
But as far as coming out with new content?

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
Yeah, done. But they're still going to charge for it.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.000
But then they're going to shift it to mobile. I don't know what the hell is going to happen with that.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.000
So anyway, I've said this once on the show before. I'm going to say it again.

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:42.000
I think gaming history will be very kind to Naoki Yoshida for what he's accomplished with Final Fantasy XIV.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.000
He took the worst MMO of all time and made it one of the very best.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Basically, he loves MMOs and he's played a lot, including World of Warcraft. So he's a huge fan of the genre.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:04.000
He's not a suit that barely knows what he's talking about. So his heart is in XIV so much.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:13.000
I think the only bummer about it is that I honestly truly believe the renaissance of Final Fantasy XIV in 2.0 and everybody being really into it.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.000
I don't want to say saved Square Enix, but it's put their company on a different trajectory.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:26.000
The only downside is that they're going to pull him and some of his team to work on something else that is another big thing for Square.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
That's the only thing that I worry about.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Yeah, well between XIV and Record Keeper and their mobile games, the ones that are actually good, are making disgusting amounts of money.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Obviously we can see how they're spending money in XIV because they have a good content patch come out every three months.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:51.000
They have tons of content and they technically don't have to do that. They can follow the WoW model and be like, new patch in nine months, bye!

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:59.000
Well, but to be fair, and I sound like I'm up XIV's ass, which I guess in some ways I'm a little bit of a fanboy, but I will say this.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:05.000
I am a little burned out right now. Heavensward, brilliant expansion, phenomenal story, worthy of the Final Fantasy name.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Best campaign story probably since X.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Oh my god, I would say since VI, but people will argue with me there and that's fine.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:23.000
But I will say, now that I'm kind of all done with it and I'm in the endgame, I'm in the lull.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000
I'm a little bit, okay, I log on, I grind my tomes, I'm a little bit over it right now.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
That's why I've been kind of, I need to finish Diablo III.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:35.000
3.31 is on the horizon for next month, I think.

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Oh, did they say as soon as next month? I know 3.07 is like this week.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I'm glad I've taken it so slow, even though it was due to a lot of personal crap that I took a big part of my break with everything going on.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000
But I'm kind of glad that I took it as slow as I did.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:57.000
Oh yeah, and there's a lot of people for various different reasons in your boat too.

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.000
It means I'm going to have content out the ass for a long time.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:07.000
And I'm really enjoying how much that I've just been able to sit back and do story stuff.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:19.000
I actually, I'm even enjoying doing some of the different battles too, like I just did Moogle Mog.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Oh, I love that file.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:28.000
It was kind of a pain in the butt when I died right at the end, but it was still hilarious because of Disco Moogles.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:40.000
But like, I'm ready to do the Ultima fight now and all the, I think the big thing is that there is something for fans of the older series in the past, as well as the newer ones.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
And that's giving it a bit more longevity apart from just the revamped play.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Right.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000
So anyway, that's my 12 cents.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Alright, well moving along here, since we are running, we're almost to two hours in this segment.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:56.000
But when you have, this always happens when we have an amazing interview on the show, is that we just run long. That's alright.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Let's talk about Konami again. Oh boy, what did they do this time?

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Well actually, some people are looking a little more favorably on that.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Konami apparently released a heritage game survey.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
They're asking players about some of the IPs and how you feel about them.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:17.000
It's also asking, what do you want to see brought back?

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000
I'll tell you what's on the list here in a minute.

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
There's well known and obscure on here, but not on the list.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
Silent Hill and Metal Gear.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Does this mean that they're already, I mean, obviously we have a new Metal Gear game coming out in a week.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000
You know, is Silent Hill still continuing?

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
Survey be damned, who knows?

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.000
Or could this just be the Konami's trying to get in people's good favor again?

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.000
By throwing out these names of reminding us why we love them.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:52.000
And teasing us, giving us just a taste that we could be seeing it again in the future.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Here's a list, here's what they put out.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Jamie, you're going to be surprised at some of the things on this list.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
Rocket Knight. What?

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Bishi Bashi. Ooh, Bishi Bashi.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
Parodius. What?

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Sunset Riders. Parodius.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
Contra. Parodius.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Suikoden. Parodius.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Gradius. Parodius.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Okay, but can we talk about Gradius? Sure.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
Track and Field.

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Bomberman, because remember they have Hudson now.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Castlevania.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Mystical Ninja, or Goemon.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Zone of the Enders.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Vandal Hearts.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Yu-Gi-Oh.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
And I love that there's an option, none of these.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Parodius.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:35.000
Yeah.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Parodius.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Well, you know.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I do know. And I think a lot of the listeners by this point know.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:44.000
But just in case we have new listeners, Dark Soccer.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Sunset Riders is a freaking good game, by the way.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
But Parodius. These are all good games.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Oh my god. I could totally,

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
totally stand to have

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
a

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
a

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Parodius.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Dark to see you.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
I just lost my brain. Dark to see you in chat says

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
I did vote for a new Sunset Riders.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Fifth Dream says Zone of the Enders.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Act F. Zone of the Enders. Bonds. 006.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Zone of the Enders. Hmm.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
We got a lot of Zoe fans in our chat there tonight.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Anyway. We'll see. I don't know.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
It's a poll. It's a survey.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
I'm kind of looking at it going

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
whatever until I see some evidence

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
that it's actually going to happen. We'll see.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Anyhow. Let's

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Actually, I would like to say

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
if they did anything in the Castlevania series

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
as much as I like the new

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
series. You know, the ones that have been on the handhelds

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
in the last few days. I would

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
daze my butt. I would

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
like to have a continuation

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
of the Dracula X storyline.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
You know, we had Dracula X.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
We had Rondo

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
of Blood. We had Symphony of the Night or

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Nocturne in the Moonlight

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
as it was in Japan. I would love

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
to have a direct

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
trilogy. You know.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
That would be pretty rad.

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Alright. Well, let's go back to a

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
classic time. Let's go back to a time when Konami

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
was actually making all these series.

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Even when Konami

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
was making games people liked.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
I get it. To be fair,

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I'll give her a solid five. I'm sure tons of people are going to like.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
But anyway, it's just one game.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
Dark Soccer is going to step into

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
the vault. Newly refurbished and remodeled

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
vault. And find a game, which actually

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
tonight isn't Konami. It isn't exactly

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
remodeled as much as shits everywhere.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
She's going to go into the archive

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
and find a game that she thinks, hey, brats

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
check out this game. This is a classic.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Or, I think,

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
and she sometimes does this, because a game

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
to qualify as a classic game of the week has to be at least

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
ten years old. So sometimes Dark Soccer

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
comes in here and goes, ha ha

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
remember this game? It's because you're old.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
And I think that's what she's

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
I think that's what she's doing to us tonight.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
This is called

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Watch Out My Foot's

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
Heading Toward Your Age Balls.

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
game of the week tonight?

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
Zuma. Yes.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Zuma is over ten years old.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
How does it make

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
you feel? You are a rude

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
rude individual.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Oh yeah.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Zuma, like when old people go to the

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
YMCA and do calisthenics? No.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
No, that's

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
Zumba. That's Zumba.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
And it's not Zima, which is

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And it's not what cleans your house. That's a Roomba.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
See, here I was going for

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
even more old and going for the Zimas

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
which was what the

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
drink of

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
of the preppy frat plays

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
everywhere.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Anyway,

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Zuma is a tile

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
matching puzzle game. It was put up by

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
PopCap and

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
you can still play it for free a bunch of places

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
because no one

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
cares about putting any more money into it

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
because Zuma's revenge is out.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
And that will make you feel

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
old because that will be a ten year game in 2019.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
That came out in 2009.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
Good lord, people. Stop

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
blowing up my chat here.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
For those of you that know Extover from

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Horde House,

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
this is like, I have

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
my god, he played so much Zuma, you guys.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
This is probably like his classic game of all time.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
He played a lot of this game.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Until he discovered Devil's Crush.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Yes.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
On the Wii U

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
or the Wii release.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Anyway,

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
it received

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
the 2004 Game of the

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Year award from Real Arcade.

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
So,

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
anyway,

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
with this particular game, I always called

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
it kind of like, bust a move

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
on a track.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
I can see that. Yeah, because, I mean, you basically

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
have the different multicolored balls

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
and you move a little thing around in a

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
He said balls.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
I didn't say deez nuts.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
Deez nuts for president.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
Anyway.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Anyway.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Ah, don't get me started.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
So,

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
as I was saying, before Rob

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
rudely interrupted me. I'm just waiting for you to

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
actually pick the game, Balls,

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
as the classic game of the week.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Just for, I think I've done, um

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Balls has a better chance than Halo, you guys.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Oh, I should do

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Balls. I did, um, Vector

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Man before and he's made of balls.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
Wait for election day. You can do Balls.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
In honor of deez nuts.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Anyway, go ahead, I'm sorry to keep interrupting.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
I'm sorry to keep interrupting. Go ahead. No, I'll probably

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
because when

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Bernie wins, I have to do something relatively

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Jewish. Back to the

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
game.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
So, anyway, um,

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
the balls are gonna go, are on like

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
a track and you have a little

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
360 degree

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
ball shooter thing

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
that looks like a big Aztec

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
monument head face thing.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
So, um, basically

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
the balls, you have to stop the balls before

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
they reach, um, a skull or

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
else, you know, game over.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
So, um, you eliminate

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
the balls by shooting a colored

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
ball of the similar color

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
until you, um,

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
uh, match up a particular

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
color. So when you have three or more of the same color

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
in contact, they'll explode

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
and they can even trigger

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
explosions and chain reactions. And the

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
level's completed when you fill up

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
your bar for as many of them

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
as you do. You get bonuses

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
for collecting coins that show through the

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
different gaps and making

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
things explode.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
And then you have, um,

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
different power ups you can get. There's the

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
backward ball that pushes

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
the furthest out chain

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
backwards for a little bit.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
And there's a slow down, uh, ball that

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
slows down time. Or,

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
you also get, um,

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
an accuracy ball that

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
lines up your shots.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
Um, and then you have

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
an explosion ball that just makes

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
things go boom. I like that.

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Um, you've got

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
adventure mode, you've got gauntlet mode,

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
um, you've got

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
all kinds of different stuff in it.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
But there was a controversy about this.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
There was, um, a

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Japanese developer called, uh, the Mitchell

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Corporation that said Zuma infringed

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
on a 1998

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
game called Puzloop that

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
was released as ballistic outside

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
of Japan.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
The game was, uh,

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
uh, re-released, um, for

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
the Nintendo DS.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Um, well, I'll

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
backtrack on that one. They re-released

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
the design as a game called Magnetica.

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
And PopCap,

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
um, basically went

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
back and forth and saying that it wasn't an exact

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
clone. And

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
that they were actually

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
happy that the games were getting copied.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
It was a whole bunch of odd stuff.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
So, but anyway, yeah,

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
um, congratulations. Everyone feels

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
old now because Zuma is

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
officially a classic.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
Not a real

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
classic, but it's old enough to be

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
considered classic.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Classic enough.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I suppose.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
And this is just really one of my

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
little spiteful ones. Like, hey, guess what?

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Heh heh.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Alright. There it is.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
This person's not playing very well.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Zuma!

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Not to be confused with Zumba, or Zima.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
To

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
register participation for this week's

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
episode of Orange Lounge Radio at

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
vognetwork.com, use the passphrase

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Rake. As pointed

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
out in our chat room,

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Bobby Blackwolf says Zuma is backwards

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
compatible on the Xbox One right now.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
So it's a classic that's playable on a very modern console.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
That's a very good point. You can check that out.

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
That's gonna do it for this

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
first half of our show, but we've got plenty

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
more. It's more like first two thirds.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
But we still have more show to come

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
when we come back. We're gonna get into rapid fire news.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
The fugal question of the week

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
about voice acting tonight, in honor of the

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
guests we had on earlier. And we're gonna get to our

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
mailbag, the FUs of the week, and your

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
or on Skype, at Orange

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Lounge Radio, all one word. We're gonna get to

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
all that when we come back after this

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Lounge Radio. Live tonight

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
August the 23rd of

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
2015 with the 611th

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
episode of our show

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
already in progress. And

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
yeah, we've had a great

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
interview with a trio of very

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
talented voice actors there

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
at the top of the show. So if you're just joining us

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
live, again, you need to go check out the podcast feed once

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
it's posted. Available on iTunes

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
or Stitcher Radio or pretty much

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
vognetwork.com. If you wanna have it over there, you can always listen

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
on demand there. Show is always posted

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
about an hour after we wrap up live.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Anyhow, we're

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
gonna get right back into it. We're running a little long tonight

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
so we're gonna get right back into the gaming news

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
and remember if you want to participate along

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
with our show, we like to read comments and things like that

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
live.vognetwork.com

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Alan's joining us tonight in place of Loki.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Hello. Hi.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
What do you got for us for rapid fire news tonight?

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I'm gonna actually

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
make these very quickly, quick

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
because I don't have much personal

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
commentary to make about any of them.

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
So people are all a

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
flutter about a job posting

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
that Bungie put on their website

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
specifically asking for a

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
PC compatibility tester.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
This is exciting because

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
I don't believe Bungie has put a game out

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
on the PC platform since Halo

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
or Halo 2 and those were, I think,

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
probably just ports. They weren't developed

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
natively for the PC.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
So the scuttlebutt

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
or the popular opinion

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
is that they're

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
thinking about bringing

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Destiny to PC

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
though Bungie has not

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
announced anything

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
like that. But the

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
job description says

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
evaluate PC hardware specific features

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
and ensure various systems work together

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
across multiple PC configurations

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
to provide a great experience.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
So basically it's a

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
quality assurance

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
beta tester for PC.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
So people think that that is

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
interesting to note.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
There

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
was a lawsuit between

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
3D Realms, Gearbox Software, and I believe

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
another software company called

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Interceptor about a spinoff Duke Nukem

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
game that 3D Realms

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
licensed to Interceptor.

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Except Gearbox is like, no, we

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
own that intellectual property now.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
It was a part of us doing Duke Nukem forever.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
That case

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
has finally

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I don't think

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Yeah, they all

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
voluntarily ended their litigation

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
so I believe it was settled out of court.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Gearbox is now the sole

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
owner of the Duke Nukem license

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
and Interceptor and 3D Realms is

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
working on their own new game.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
So hooray

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Gearbox, even though

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
that wasn't really their fault but Duke Nukem forever

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
wasn't the best and I don't really know if there's

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
even any hype for that franchise to live on.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Yeah, it's kind of, hooray, it's

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
been settled, a franchise that I think

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
most people are done with.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
I don't know, I think

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Duke Nukem could be reinvented still.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
He's a classic character.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
The statements from 3D Realms and

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Interceptor were very gracious in

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
saying, you know, we did this on Good Faith

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
didn't know there was a legal

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
issue, congrats to Gearbox, we look

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
forward to future blah blah blah.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
If Sonic can survive Sonic

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
2006, then

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
If Britney Spears can survive 2007

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
then you can make it through this day.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
I say

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
that to myself every morning.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Finally, there's a game

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
on Steam which I believe is on HellasHale

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
this weekend called Zombie Army Trilogy.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Valve and Steam

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
put out this weekend a

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
free update that puts all

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
six, or sorry

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
six or eight, all eight, excuse me

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Left 4 Dead protagonists in

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Zombie Army Trilogy so you

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
can play as the cute redneck

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
or the sleazy

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
guy in the white blazer

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
or the biker dude that kind of looks

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
like the guy from Grand Theft Auto 4.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
They are playable characters now in

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Zombie Army Trilogy for you

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Left 4 Dead fanatics out there and that's all I have

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
done.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
because that's

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
what you learn when you do something like that

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
is you get off the internet.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
S2100Matt says about the Duke Nukem

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
What I'm hoping for with this is that Duke Nukem could make a guest

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
appearance in Borderlands.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Imagine him as the villain in the next Borderlands game

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
as a rival Vault Hunter.

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Just saying, that would be epic.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
That would be pretty rad.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
S2100Matt, you need to write a letter.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
Or something.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Let's go and talk about

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Pokken Tournament.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
It's going to be happening on the Wii U.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
It's coming next spring.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
They announced the release of

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Pokken Tournament for the Nintendo Wii U.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
It's an arcade game in Japan

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
but it will be released worldwide

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
in Spring 2016.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Being developed in collaboration with Bandai Namco

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
who of course made Tekken

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
so they know a thing or two about fighting games.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Will you play Tekken with Pokemon

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Dark Saga?

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
No. I'll play Tekken with Gon.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
I will. I will.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Look, if Tekken can have a panda bear

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
and whatever

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
that tree thing was

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
the wooden- Mokujin.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
Mokujin, that's it. By the way, to go back to

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
the last segment, I just told

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
Konami that Silent Hill, all of Silent Hill

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
is Silent Hill ever forever.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Did you actually fill out that interview?

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Yes I did. And I put Silent Hill.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Sorry, did I say interview? I meant survey.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Survey, yes.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
My wires are crossing tonight. I'm in a short circuit here any moment.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Alright, well Dark Sakura

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
pay attention because I know you want to know about this

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
because it has to do with Gunstar Heroes.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
No, I'm not announcing a new Gunstar Heroes

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
game, I apologize. But

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
a remake, sort of,

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
of the Gunstar Heroes

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
game is available on the 3DS

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
eShop as of August 20th.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
This is,

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
I don't know if this is a

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
oh yeah, it is a 3D version of Gunstar Heroes.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
It's the Gunstar 3D Heroes

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
for the Sega Ages thing

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
that already came out.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
But this has already been

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
a thing. On the 20th.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
Right? Yeah, I think actually I

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
have this, I think.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
I don't know, I've got so many copies of

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Gunstar Heroes that it's ridiculous.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
I'll ask Dan, he knows. Well it's Gunstar.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I don't know, I'm reading here, it just came out this week.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Maybe it was in a collection, now it's not.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
So, whatever, it's Gunstar Heroes.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
I want to say it was one of the Sega Ages things.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Also, you know, last week on the show

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
we talked about how Resident Evil 2 is being

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
remade. Well,

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
there was a fan project, if you didn't know,

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
that was already in the works, Resident Evil 2

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Reborn. And it was going to be made

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
in Unreal 4. So what happened this week?

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
It got shut down

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
is what tends to happen with these fan

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
projects all the time. But,

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
good guy Capcom,

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
doing this the right way, because usually like

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
if Square Enix or Nintendo does this to you,

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
like when Nintendo pulled that Mario 64

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
thing, you disappear.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
But, in a good

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
guy Capcom, which I don't use that phrase

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
very often anymore on this program,

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
but Capcom actually reached out to

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
the Reborn team and has invited

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
them to share their ideas

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
for it. So,

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Capcom saying, hey look, legal

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
reasons, got to shut you down,

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
but you know what, let's talk,

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
let's have a meeting. So, that's

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
a reasonable end

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
to this situation.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
Alan? I was going to say,

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
the fact that they would give them

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
the time of day and be like, okay

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
we'll see what

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
ideas you had. Because, I mean,

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
this type of thing happens

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
all the time where, you know,

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
with the Streets of Rage

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
compilation, Sega see indeed that,

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
it happened so often that they could have

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
just, okay, seasoned assisted because

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
intellectual property rights, blah, blah, blah,

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
and then been done with it and I don't think anyone

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
would have faulted Capcom

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
worse than they fault anyone else when this happens.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
So the fact that they're meeting with them is

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
pretty cool. Exactly.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Alright, let's move on, Dark Sakura. Stuff.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Um,

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
there is a big reason why

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Dan and I have been on our Chrono Trigger

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
kick lately.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
And the big reason for the

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Chrono Trigger kick is because Chrono Trigger

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
has had its 20th birthday.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
My tummy hurts, I don't feel good.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I know, right?

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
God, you thought the Zuma thing made you feel old.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
That would make you feel.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
We were in high school. Next year

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
is our 20 year high school

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
reunion. Fuck off. Mine already passed.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Anyhow,

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
sorry Dark Sakura.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
We had to whine.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Get off our lawn.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
So, and I mean,

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
this was, it just had such a great

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
creative team. It had

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Sakaguchi, who's the guy who created

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
Final Fantasy. It had

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Hori, who was

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
the creative

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Dragon Quest. And of course,

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
one of everyone's favorite

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
mangaka, Akira

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Toriyama

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
was in it.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
I

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
did the right away

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
ending just so I could see

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
his little sprite in the game.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
So, it was

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
such a good game. Such a good game.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
In fact, Dan and I were actually just

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
whenever character music would play, we'd just like

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
stop the dialogue and do the Robo

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
dance. The Robo's theme

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
is incredible to this day. Yeah.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
Actually, I'm going to be ring toning

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
that before too long

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
because it's so great.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
But yeah,

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
you actually,

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
I mean,

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
the battle system in it was

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
I'd say fairly

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
revolutionary too. I mean, you had

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
your different techniques and the combination

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
techniques and

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
the fact you could actually

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
bypass certain fights.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
It was a little unheard of.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
It wasn't just the woosh woosh

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
random encounter. Oh my god.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
But you could get away with some.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
In fact, Dan today, he

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
runs right through the middle of the enemies, leaves

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
the room and is like, hey, weren't enemies supposed

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
to spawn here? Went back and they spawned.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Because he went back to check.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Good job.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
The humor and everything was great.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Okay, so I would

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
add enough gushing on that one for me.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Super Mario Maker.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Some news about that.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
It's going to have different skin tones

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
and fur

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
colors.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
So basically,

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
it's supposed to be

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
a dog's paw.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Why are they focusing on the dogs?

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
Where's the cat love?

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
But you're going to have different

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
skin tones that will go with what you

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
associate with if you want to.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Oh, I remember. Or you have the gloved hand

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
like Mario. There was a controversy

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
on this a while ago when people were like

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
why is the hand only this

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
one white hand that you can play in the game?

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
And so they

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
said they would have more.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
So it sounds like now they've shown like, oh, you can be

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
a dog's hand if you want. Or you can be a

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
cat paw. A Mario hand. Why all the cat hate

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Nintendo? I know. Took them forever

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
to add Nintendo cats. Maybe that's in there too.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Super Mario Cats is already a game.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
It's called Super Mario 3D World.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Fair

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
enough. Fair enough. And

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
then this

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
I laughed so hard when

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
I read this. And I even

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
like how you put it in the show Roll Rob.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
PS4 in my

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
pants.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
A shoplifter

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
tried to fit a PS4

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
in his pants.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
On top of that is Florida Man.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
You know Florida Man

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
is my favorite criminal.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Florida Man, Florida Man. You know about the

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Florida Man theme.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
You say Florida Man.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Florida Man has a sexual relationship

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
with all of their relatives.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
And they smoke tons of crack and bath salts in there

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
in every story ever. Wasn't Jack Voldemore

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
a lawyer in Florida? Yes.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
But no, Florida Man has kind of

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
made a bit of a meme.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Where, you know, they'll say like on Twitter

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
Florida Man accused of this.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
And then just over and over. So Florida

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
Man has become this

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
like super villain. And so

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
now Florida Man tries to stuff

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
a PS4 in his pants. Sorry.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
You just say Florida Man, I think of Jack Voldemore.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
And it's funnier.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
I'm done. I quit.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
How did they find the PS4

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
in his pants?

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Let's see.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
He managed to stuff the PS4

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
and the accessories in his pants

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
while going to a Walmart.

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Only at Walmart.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
And he walked out of the store

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
without paying and was stopped and

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
arrested on a felony

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
grand theft charge. Oh, I get it.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
I feel so uncool. He was already on probation.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
I feel so uncool for not having

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
heard of this before. Tigerclaw linked me to a Wikipedia

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
article, which by the way, I'm surprised this is on

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
Wikipedia and not like Encyclopedia Dramatica

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
or one of those other websites.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
What's the meme? Urban Dictionary.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
So anyway, link me to Wikipedia

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
and it actually says the reason why it's

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Florida Man is because that's the way all the headlines

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
always read. Florida Man steals PlayStation

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
4 in his pants. Florida Man got it.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I get it. Now it's funny.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
And I don't want to mention Florida Man's

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
actual name here. But Florida Woman's

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
just as crazy. But he's 36 years old.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Which makes me think that he still

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
had a pair of jinkos in his closet.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
From like 1994.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
It's either sweatpants, a big old pair

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
of sweatpants, or he's still got the jinko, the raver jeans.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
I'm going to vote for the jinkos.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Because if you like

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
cinch off the ends of them, you could probably fit

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
like a small family in those things.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
Alright, well

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
let's see.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
I think it's time

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
for us to get into the foogle question

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
of the week.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Every week we ask you guys a question on our

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
You put Facebook and Google together,

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
you get foogle!

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
Tonight,

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
I thought we would ask about

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
voice acting. Because you know,

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
we had some voice actors on our show tonight

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
so why not?

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
I mentioned that we were going to have our interview tonight and said

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
what or who is your

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
favorite voice acting performance

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
in a video game and why did you pick that

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
performance? So

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
what was a voice acting performance

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
that really resonated with you?

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Redertainment answered over on Google Plus and said

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
due to the fact that we don't regularly see

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
actor in roles in video games

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
like how we see the actors in movies, TV

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
shows and plays and so forth.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
Individual actors don't stand out to me as much as the

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
characters do. Unless the actor has

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
a really distinctive voice that I know from

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
some other platforms, I don't remember

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
what actor plays what roles. So that's

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
why my answer is Stephen Merchant from Portal 2.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
You know,

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
if a voice actor is doing an amazing

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
job though, that would mean that you

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
shouldn't necessarily be able to tell. I mean

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
sometimes you do, it just depends on the type of character

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
but I think when you look at

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
especially the resumes of some of the gentlemen that were on the show tonight

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
say whoa, that was the same person?

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
That's cool. You know and I think a lot

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
of you guys probably have done that when you go to

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
one of those websites that list everything that the

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
voice actors do that I know

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Marissa linked one of those sites earlier in our chat room.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
I had no idea that Jennifer Hale was

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
as prolific as she was. Yes.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Like I knew obviously that she was a big

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
name but it's like no, she was

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
voicing stuff. She's in Baldur's Gate

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
and all this stuff from way back

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
when. I also love

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
Marc Meer not because

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
he was Commander Shepard because a lot of

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
people, not maybe the best

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
acting in some of the lines he delivered

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
but as a personality if you see

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
his YouTube videos and his cosplay he's

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
really funny. Well

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
do you guys remember Hitoshi

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Doi? He had the

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Seiyu database. Yes.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Which was basically

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
a visual novel,

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
video game, anime

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
and drama.

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Drama programs.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
Yeah. For Japan.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
And then I think there was supposed to be a

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
branch out of it

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
when anime started getting bigger in the

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
US. And I don't know what

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
happened to that. I don't even know if his Seiyu

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
database is still around.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
Alright.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
Well let me move on here

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
with some of the answers on Facebook.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Chad B says

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
Gideon Emery is Balthier

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Without a doubt Balthier and Fran

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
made Final Fantasy XII for me and

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
it was quite a nice surprise to hear Emery pop up

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
through the Dragon Age franchise as well.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
And I just found out he played one of the Russian brothers

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
in the Daredevil Netflix series which makes it that much

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
better. That's one of my all time favorites too.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Like that's an amazing

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
performance. Balthier and Fran for that matter.

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Both are fantastic in that game.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Elliot B says

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
I'll get the obvious out of the way. Portal would not be

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Portal without Ella McClain as GLaDOS.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
And Stephen Merchant was great in Portal too

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
especially in comparison to other voice over work by

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
big name actors.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
DeGenere Johnny says

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Sarah Kestelman's performance as

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
Kreia in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
The Sith Lords. Her portrayal matched

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
every aspect of the character and how she was written

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
which was the highest quality I've ever

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
seen in a game. It takes a great deal of

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
talent to sell a villain that the player will sympathize

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
with and she nailed it perfectly.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
To this day I still get teary eyed when

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
remembering her performance.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Dark Tetsuya says

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
David Hayter as the original Solid Snake.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
The Phantom Pain just won't sound the same

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
with Keith or Sutherland taking over.

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Honorable mention for Cameron Clark as

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Liquid or Master Miller.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
I do have to insert there.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
Playing the Dragon Age Inquisition DLC

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
because he voiced Ren.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
And I was just having

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
major Metal Gear flashbacks

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
the whole time.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Let's see. Moving on to

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
SSJ100Matt says

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.000
He also has a long resume working on many games.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
Wing Commander, Darksiders, Kingdom Hearts

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
and of course Batman Arkham games.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
His Joker role is iconic and

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
certainly can have the case made of

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
being the definitive Joker even

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
amongst the movie Jokers.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
And I don't think there's really a lot of

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
people that would argue with you on that to be honest.

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
So, let's see.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Asking around in the room here.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
Dark Sakura, what is your favorite

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
voice actor or actress performance in a game

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
and why is it Jennifer Hale?

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
Laughter

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
Laughter

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Laughter

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Am I right or am I right?

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
I love Jennifer Hale so much.

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Well, I mean it's not just the whole

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
You're gonna cry at GamerX3

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
I just know it.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
It's not the whole fem-shep thing.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
She plays so many

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
good, strong female characters

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
that I can't help but go

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
doki-doki in my heart.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
But

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
I'm actually gonna go

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
This is

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
his favorite voice actor

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
in games in general.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
Or his particular performance.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Like Balthier for me

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
would have probably been my answer too.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
I've got voices that I can

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
pick out anywhere.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
I can pick her out.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Everyone who has

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
ears can pick out Gideon Emery in anything

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
he ever does because

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
that gravel. Oh god.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
Shivers, shivers, shivers.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
You alright? You need a moment?

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
Laughter

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
But the hard thing for me is that

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
I can't, once I recognize

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
a name with a voice

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
I can't unrecognize it.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Do you know what I mean?

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
So I keep, there's characters

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
who I would probably think were kinda crap characters

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
but I love them for the voice actor.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
I mean

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
there's voice actors that I

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
would love to hear in

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
modern games. I mean

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
God, my youth.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Oh, is that it?

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
No, I just actually had

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
a moment of nostalgia because

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Chris Latta

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I would have loved if

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
he was still around.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
Alan

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
you pretty much already said yours

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
any other shout outs you want to give there?

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
Shout out to the voice actor

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
for Hoagie in Day of the Tentacle

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
he was the big kind of chunky

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
rock and roll dude with Bernard

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
and the way that

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
that voice was delivered was very

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
I guess against type where he sounded

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
sort of like the rich snotty

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
dude on Gilligan's Island. That's in the early

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000
days of voice acting too because voice

02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.000
acting showed up on computers way before

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
there was the CD talky version that was

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
ten dollars more when these people just got it on

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
three and a half diskette.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
So that, the way that character was done

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
I really like. And then

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
for his weird, bullshitty

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
sort of fairy tale Xanadu

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
the green ending in

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Mass Effect 3 is with the whole Shangri-La

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
and everyone. Oh my God.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
The monologue that Edie gives

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
is incredible. Oh my God.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
Trisha Helfer

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Six from Battlestar Galactica

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Yes.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Like, you will be moved

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
to tears. Like, it's so good. She's so

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
good. Oh my God.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And I was going to say, Balthier

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
probably would have been mine, but for newer

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
performances go, like, you know, again

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
here I go, fanboy, but seriously

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
one of my favorite performances

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Sivan Hewlett, who does

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Yasael in Final Fantasy 14

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
He was going to say Yasael in Heaven's

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
World is great. Oh my God. She is

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
so good. And some of the

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
scenes in Heaven's World with her

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
wow. That's all I'm

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
going to say. I don't want to spoil, but wow.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
I am going to, though, bring up

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
actually a pair of performances because they're in

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
the same game.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
OK. I had really high

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
standards for the Berserk games

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
as in Berserk as in

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
from the manga and anime

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
you know, with Gatsu and everything

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
because one of my favorite Japanese voice

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
actors was Gatsu

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Great. Now I can't

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
say his name, but he was also

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Toski in Fushigi Yugi

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
and who else did

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
Basara in

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Macross 7 and

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
why can't

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
Nobutoshi

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
first name. Anyway, so

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
I was like, OK, I'm not going to like the

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
US version of Berserk. I'm not going to like it. I'm not going to like

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
I'm not going to like it. And then I heard Michael

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Bell. I was like

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
and then I heard BJ Ward and I'm like

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
I was like

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
it's like Voltron in a

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
different universe. My brains, I can't shut

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
them off. So, yeah.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
And I actually have to think

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
S.J. 100 Matt for bringing up Tim Curry

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
doing voice actors. Yeah, I was just going to say

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
S.J. 100 Matt, let's not forget the various

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
roles Tim Curry did. Honestly,

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
you just won right there. And Nolan

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
North. That's it. Nolan North. There's nothing

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
else to say after Tim Curry. Our Deadpool.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
Nothing else to say. Tim Curry

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
the end. Rob.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
What?

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Ah, Tim Curry.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
Alright, let's get back into some more. He was the first

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
man that ever scared me in a movie.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Oh, what? As Darkness or It?

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Legend. It was all legend.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Or Rooster in Annie.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
No, it was

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Legend.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Alright. We're going to get back

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
to some gaming news and then of course your phone calls

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
coming up in a little while. 1877 Game OLR

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
all one word. But some more gaming news

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
to get out there. Alan. As we like to say

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
on OLR, hackers going to hack.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Not necessarily

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
the standard usage for that phrase

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
with this story. But a third party

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
has come out with

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
a little device which I imagine

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
is going to be sued

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
into the atmosphere and stripped off

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
the face of the earth. They have a little

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
neat device called the Amico.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Or Ami-quo. It's A-M-I-I-Q-O.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
The price

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
given is

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
49.75 pounds. So I

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
believe it is a European creation.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
I think that's what? 60 or 70 bucks

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
American. What this thing

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
does, and why it's going

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
to be probably blasted off the face of the earth

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
is a lot of people

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
when the Ami-Bos, the little Wii U

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
figures were announced, a lot of people were upset

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
that they can only store data for one game at a time.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
So if you have your Princess Peach

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Amiibo, you can have your Smash

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
your custom Peach Smash character on

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
the figure. Or

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
you can have your custom Peach Mario Kart

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
on the figure. What this thing does

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
is it lets you, you also have to

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
have an NFC compatible

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Android device

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
like any Samsung phone from the past three years

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
to interact with this

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
thing. What it does is it lets you

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
back up those

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
NFC

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
or ARFID, whatever, the

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
little data that is on the

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
Amiibo. You can back it up so you can

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
not have to buy the Fireball Mario

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
versus the regular doing the

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Mario pose Amiibo because they have three different

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Mario ones now. You can

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
just swap out the data using this device

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
and not

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
have to go completely bankrupt on Amiibos.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Also, and this is the

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
big, the real big one,

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
it lets you download

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Amiibo

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
character profiles like the

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
unique identifier for NES, the unique identifier

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
for Pac-Man. And it lets

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
you emulate that so

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
that when you put it on the Wii U

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
pad, it'll think that you have

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
whatever character that is and it'll unlock

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
whatever goodies.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
It honestly doesn't surprise me

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
that

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
something like this happened.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
I'm surprised it took

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
this long, honestly. I'm surprised

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
it's not on the phone because of all the near-field

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
stuff on the phone.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
So this is just

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
an interesting thing.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Yeah.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
So each

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Amiibo device comes preloaded with

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
data for 10 figurines

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
and 200 figurines can be stored

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
in it in total.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
The downside, of course, is you don't get the figurines

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
themselves, but

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
I would think that if you sought out this device

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
and purchased one, you knew exactly what you were

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
doing and what you were going to use it for.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
That means your figurines can stay

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
on your shelf and look pretty forever.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
When was the last time there was a sort of

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
bootleg device like this?

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
What if we needed

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
one like that? Because

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
usually peripherals, they don't

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
really need to be... I keep thinking back

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
to the Ninja Pass and the

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
loaders.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
3DS loaders, yeah.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
3DS loader, exactly.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Alright. Well, moving

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
on to a story. I just have to bring this up in chat

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
because this is so hilarious what's happening right now.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Oh, act deaf.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
SS2-100 Matt, because we brought up

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Tim Curry a minute ago, right? And what a

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
legend he is just in everything

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
but that he also did voice acting against.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Oh, come on. I can watch the worst witch on repeat

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
because of him. SS2-100 Matt brought up in chat.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Oh, my God. I just realized Greg Berger

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
worked with Tim Curry on

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Real Monsters. We had someone on the show

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
who worked with Tim Curry and that just made me

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
realize I has failed you as an interviewer

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
in every possible way. You didn't fail.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
No, I completely failed. But here

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
it is. Gray Knight

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
potentially saving the day in our

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
chat room over hearing all this saying, did you want me to

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
ask Greg another question for you?

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
And I was like,

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
yes.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
Yes, please.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
I just need to find the old

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
Rocky pictures of you in the corset.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Or not. Maybe

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
some things our listeners don't need to see.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
It's a radio show. Let's leave

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
it that way.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Why did you say that

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
on air? I hate you.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
People don't know that you've been Frank

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
before, Rob.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Gray Knight says,

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
what do you want me to ask him?

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Okay, because we just know

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
that we had a connection with someone on the show

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
who worked with Tim Curry.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
I think the question would be what?

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
Did you get to meet

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
him?

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
How was

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
working with Tim Curry, I guess.

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
But then I worry that it was the whole thing where they were

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
isolated in the booths and he's going to come back and say

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
I never got to meet the guy because we all did

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
our stuff at the same time.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
That's not a game.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
It doesn't matter. Oh yes, right.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Cartoons are sometimes a group reading.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
We're going to gamble. Did you get to meet him?

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
And if so, just

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
literally tell us anything about Tim Curry because we all

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
worship him here at OLR.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
And in life.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Is there anybody out there who doesn't worship

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Tim Curry? If so, I need you to

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
stop listening.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Just to comment on what Dungeon Buster said about

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Tim Curry as Gabriel Knight in the

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Sierra Adventure Game Classic.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
Which wasn't Roberta Williams.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
It was another woman

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
who wrote that.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
I've played that game.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Tim Curry is incredible as Gabriel Knight.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
However, the fact that

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Gabriel Knight is supposed to be

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
a creole womanizing

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
20-something with a thick New Orleans accent.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Tim Curry was a very

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
strange choice

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
because his attempt at a New Orleans accent

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
isn't the best.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
He's still great as Gabriel Knight, but that was just weird

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
casting.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Alright.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
Let's move on to talking about this story here.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
About Windows 10.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
You know, a lot of you guys have been upgrading your

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
devices to Windows 10.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
You know, because they're giving it away now

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
that they are competing with Apple on that front

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
who also gives them away.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Windows 10, apparently

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
not playing nice with

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
some DRM. The infamous

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Secure ROM having issues

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
in Windows 10, as is SafeDisk.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Now, Microsoft

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
is saying everything that ran in Windows 7

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
I'm sorry, this isn't the company,

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
but Microsoft's Boris Schneider

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
John, who is

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
being interviewed at Gamescom,

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
saying, everything that

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
ran in Windows 7 should also run in

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Windows 10. There are just two silly exceptions.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Antivirus software and stuff that's

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
deeply embedded into the system.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
And there are old games on CD-ROM that have

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
DRM. This DRM stuff is also

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
deeply embedded in your system.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
And that's where Windows 10 says, sorry,

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
we can't allow that because that would be a

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
possible loophole for computer viruses.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
That's why there's a couple games from

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
2003 to 2008 with Secure ROM that

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
don't run without no CD patches and such.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
We can just not

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
support that if it's a possible danger for

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
our users. There are a couple patches from

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
developers already and there's stuff like good old games

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
where you'll find versions of those games

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
that work. So, this

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
is also in response to, I think, a lot of those

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
sensational headlines

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
that were out last week that Windows 10 is gonna

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
sneak into your house in the middle of the night and

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
install all your pirated software and things like

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
that. And in reality, there's

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
nothing in the user license agreement

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
that wasn't already there before.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
But

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
we all know that Secure ROM and all that

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
DRM stuff was way too restrictive and terrible

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
so it's no surprise that it's

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
already broken as

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Microsoft regulates heavier

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
which you can and can't do.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us next?

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Stuff and things. In this case,

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
some UK news because we like to

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
give some attention to our friends

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
overseas. The UK

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Committee of Advertising Practice

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
which is pretty much a watchdog agency

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
for advertising rules

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
and making sure they're enforced

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
has put out official

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
guidance for video game

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
content makers that take

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
payments to promote

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
products in their game. Basically,

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
it's controlling product placement.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
So, you know, when you're driving along in your

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
racing game and you see a Valvoline

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
ad for it, they're

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
going to be the watchers for this in the

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
UK. So in the new rules,

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
basically, you can't

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
endorse or

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
promote a product that

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
has been paid without offering a

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
full and highly visible

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
disclosure. So basically,

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
if you take the money for the product

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
and

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
the ad is there, it has to

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
be marked as such.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
So this is

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
really going in after an

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
advertising standards authority investigation

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
basically found that content

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
creators were failing to properly

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
disclose that they had been paid to

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
promote the products.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
So,

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
yeah, it's got to be fully

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
in place on there now.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
However,

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
it has said that

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
YouTubers basically

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
who are doing streaming content, they don't

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
have to say anything about

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
that because

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
they didn't pay for the content.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
However, YouTubers that are

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
being paid to promote the games,

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
they need to be

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
upfront and say, we were paid

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
to play this and review it.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Interesting.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
You know, and the YouTube gaming is just going to

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
get bigger and bigger. You know, I thought their dedicated

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
gaming thing was supposed to launch by now. Maybe

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
I thought it was late August. Maybe it was September.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
But I think that's just, there's

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
heavy, heavy rumors too. You know,

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
rumor, can of salt, that

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
the next PlayStation 4 firmware

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
that's coming out towards the end of the year will

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
stream to YouTube gaming

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
when that is all worked out. So maybe they're

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
waiting on that. I don't know. Anyway, sorry.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
Interesting timing with

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
what you're saying. Well, there have been,

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
there was kind of a stink going

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
on around that about Twitch players

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
and folks on YouTube and whatnot who

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
were live reviewing

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
or doing reviews of games, you know,

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
without saying, well, hey,

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
we were given a promo

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
copy of this or so and so.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
I

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
personally would like to know up front, by the

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
way, if someone is reviewing a promotional

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
copy and

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
that they say up front, I am,

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
this is an unbiased review

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
of whatever the

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
hell game this is. And

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
just so y'all know, over at vognetwork.com

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
where we do have reviews,

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Eric RPG's been posting a lot of

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
cool video game reviews. In fact, he just

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
did the Oni Chimbara sequel just

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
today that went up. And we always do say, we

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
say it at the end, we don't say it at the beginning, but it's there

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
in the same size font and everything else. And it

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
actually says how we got the game. Did we

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
get a code? Did we, you know,

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
and if for whatever reason we were

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
actually paid to play a game, that never happened,

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
but if it happened, it would be there.

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
It would be there. Yes. Now,

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
I've been paid to break

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
software. Now,

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
before we get to the next story, this is

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
very important. Uh oh.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Tonight has come back with an answer

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
from Greg.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Frequently, I worked with

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Tim Curry on Ah, Real

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Monsters and Duckman.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
So you guys,

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
it's official.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
We here at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
as of tonight, are two

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
degrees of separation from Tim Curry.

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
I

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
need a minute. Rob's a little

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
verklempt. You thought you fan-boyed

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
over the... Talk amongst yourselves. You thought you fan-boyed

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
over the Grimlock thing.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
I'll give you a topic. My love

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
for Tim Curry is

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
very, very deep.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Really? Tell us how you really feel.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Don't take it to a dirty place.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
I didn't! I've loved him

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
since I was in grade school, so don't make it

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
dirty. Wadsworth and Clue,

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
there it is.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Oh my gosh. Yes, the answer

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
is yes.

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Great. Would you like to

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
interview Tim Curry? If his health is up to it.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
Yes, if his health is up to it. That's the most

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
important thing in the world, is his health.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
Because he is a national treasure and must be protected.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
But if he's up to it...

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
I have to say it was

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
actually a little heartbreaking to see

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
the pictures that came out after

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
his recovery. My dad

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
had a stroke.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
I just was...

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
It's sort of when you know someone

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
who's been through that and then you see someone

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
who's been an icon of

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
most of your life suffering

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
through the same thing, it's sort of

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
the empathy level is there.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
I will say

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
this as well though is that

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
people can also make great

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
recoveries. Like Nichelle Nichols

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
going to be at Dragon Con. She had that.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
And

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
Tracy Morgan from 30 Rock

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
was in that horrific car accident in New Jersey.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Was in rehab,

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
physical rehabilitation, not the other type of rehab

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
that a lot of people used to go to. And he's actually going to be

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
doing Saturday Night Live in October and that's fantastic to see.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
So...

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
SSJ 100 Matt says, I'm happy I derailed

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
the show for this. Oh and that's really

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
good. Gray Knight says

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
Charlie Adler is very good

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
friends with him. Tim is doing fairly well

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
to my knowledge. Yeah.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
I think that could be like

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
a lifetime goal up there.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
I actually have done a bit of

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
design work for a few

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
stroke survivor and

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
therapy non-profits.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
My...

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
I'll just go ahead and say this right now. I lost

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
my maternal grandmother

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
after complications from several

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
strokes and my dad is in a nursing

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
home right now. I think you've

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
mentioned some of this in prior episodes.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
This is what you've been dealing with this year.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
Anyone who has

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
been through that and recovers from it

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
it takes a lot

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
of determination so

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
it's kind of a big thing for me.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
Sure. I understand. Anyhow,

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
I'm going to try my best not to just lose it

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
and fanboy out right now.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
My people will have to talk to your people. Good sir.

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
In the interest of

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
the utmost professionalism, I must move

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
on with more gaming news.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Alan, you've got more for us.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
This story is near and dear to my heart.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
A

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
creator named Thomas Cole has released

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
a fan game

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
called Halfline. It is a

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
mashup of Half Life 2 and Hotline

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Miami. It has the graphical

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
8 slash 16 bit style

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
of Hotline Miami, the top

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
down isometric view and the incredibly

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
fast paced

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
sort of

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
tank control run and gun action as

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Hotline Miami except the

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
sprites and the overall

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
levels are

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
basically follow the story of Half Life 2.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
The first one is the train station

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
and then I imagine you go to the

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
prison. You can

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
download it on

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
I think it's

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
itch.io

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
itch.io

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
just

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
google

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Halfline

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
fan game

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
and check it out. I'm definitely going to

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
get it before it disappears.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Before it gets cease and desisted. Yeah.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
Like all the good ones do, right?

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Alright, well the Game Awards

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
was an experimental thing that happened

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
last year and it was

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
it was okay. I mean it was

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
it had some flaws but for a

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
first year thing it really, it could have been a lot

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
worse. Let's put it that way.

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Excuse me.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
It is happening

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
again this year and

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
apparently this, I don't know

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
why it's making the rounds on game blogs this week

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
because I think it was announced in June

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
but now all the news sites are

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
picking up on it because it was tweeted

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
that the Game Awards 2015

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
are coming this December and

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
stay tuned for more news soon

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
and that was on the official Twitter.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
I think the problem was the news came

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
out during E3 so most people

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
missed it there so we'll see

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
if they make some of the improvements this year. I got to say

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
it was really awkward the whole like

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
I'm going to interview you and then oh hey you won

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
this award. I'm just going to pull this out of my jacket. You got

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
an award too. I understand they got to keep

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
it moving quickly but then

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
there were some things they did right

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
like the tribute to

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Roberta Williams and that

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
whole, that was fantastic.

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
So there's

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
there's room for improvement

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
but it could have been a lot worse.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Anyhow it's time to get to the mailbag

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
every week Dark Soccer jumps into the mailbag

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
but was there

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
anything to be found this week?

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
Not a damn thing.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
I'm actually sad.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
At this point I would

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
take Ross till UT sending an email.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
Oh stop. You like reading his

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
emails. I do like reading his emails.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Um.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
Well that's it. Kill the music.

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
No. No emails.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
No.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Now it's gotten to the point. See usually Dark Soccer

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
is like I don't want to work but now

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
it's been so many weeks.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
Dear Rob. Dear me.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
Jamie is the best

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
email reader in the universe

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
and bite my butt.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Love Jamie.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
P.S.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
Alright

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
well this seems like an appropriate

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
transition to get into a reoccurring

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
segment we do every week here on Orange

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Lounge Radio. Why?

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
I don't know because we got feelings and stuff.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
It's the FUs of the week time.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Dark Soccer?

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
FU to the person who

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
was doing

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
how fast were they going?

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
30 in a 45 zone

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
because drivers

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
and

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
FU

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
to situations.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Um.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Not going into a lot of detail.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Pretty personal.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
But

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
situations.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Uh. Alan you want to go next with your FU of the week?

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
Sure.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
FU to work not having

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
very many hours.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
Um. Not really.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
FU to not paying attention to your diet

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
and what you eat and how active you've been and then

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
gaining weight because that's what happens when you

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
do those things. And FU to

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
being kind of starving because you forgot

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
to eat lunch and I make star dinner after

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
my last story. Alright that's fair.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
It's going to be spaghetti. That's fair.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
Mmm spaghetti. Uh.

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
My FU of the week. Actually you know I talked about

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
my big personal change last week on the

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
show and I have nothing bad

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
to say about that. Everything

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
my send off at my prior job

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
everybody was fantastic and

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
it was really more than I could ask for.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
And I'm really excited about

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
the prospect of new jobs so how can I possibly

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
be mad at any of that right now? I'm

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
actually have nothing to say negative at all.

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
So I guess I'm going to give like a completely

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
like not serious

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
like tongue in cheek FU and I'm just going to

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
say FU to

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
the blue team at Ingress who have been

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
stepping up the pressure lately and Megan Allen

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
and I actually work harder. Do I need to download

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
that game again? Yes play with us.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
Play with us. But I

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
deleted it because I needed the brain.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
Enlighten the planet Dark Saga. Being real

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Jamie I wouldn't worry about it.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Yeah.

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
Because like it was funny that Konami thing is like

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
how often do you play games

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
on this device? Well on

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
your mobile phone I'm like I play Bejeweled.

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
No I don't. You got to do your Bejeweled

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
daily. As much

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
shit as you all give me for it which is fine it's

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
deserved. I do get hardcore about it but I get hardcore

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
a lot about a lot of MMOs.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
I do more exercise because of that game

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
period. It has impacted me

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
positively in that regard. If Ingress

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
actually did have the functionality to use my

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
Apple Watch I would probably play it a lot more.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
See because they're a Google company it works

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
with the other watch but I don't think the

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
Apple Watch works yet.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
It's probably coming though. Actually with

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
the Google alphabet thing

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
and the antique who made Ingress is now

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
separate from Google. So that may

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
happen in the future.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
That and WatchOS

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
2.0 is out eventually.

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
It's in testing right now.

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
I mean the open beta is for it.

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
Gotcha. And for those

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
listening. I didn't really mean that.

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
I mean just

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
in case you happen to be a blue player that's

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
listening it's whatever.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
It's just a game for fuck's sake.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
But I can still get huffy and puffy.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
Evidence that Rob

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
is really into this game.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Blow your portal over. Two weeks ago or

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
last weekend he asked us

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
so Alan would you judge me if

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
I agreed to do an op.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
And an op in Ingress is when a bunch of people

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
go out because it's a GPS game.

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
So you have to go out to the location to do whatever

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
stuff you want to do. Would you be mad

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
if I went and did an Ingress op at 3 AM

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
on Saturday?

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
And I was like I'll judge you a little bit

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
but you do you girl.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
You do what you want. The late night

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
stuff is fun. And they do it at

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
3 AM because obviously

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
anyone with sense is asleep.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
So whatever

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
you choose. When I was

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
kind of playing

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
I did go over to Dad's

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
kitchen in Folsom and saw

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
the bottle cap bench

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
that is like one of their landmark

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
whatever the hell it is.

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
And I rubbed my butt on it.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Because it was the other team.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
I

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
I

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
because I wasn't high enough to attack

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
or do anything.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
And then I was like and

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Dan's like what are you doing as like

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
I'm just rubbing my butt on this portal.

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
I was like I did it at

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
a spike.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
And I think that was when

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
I finally stopped playing. I know exactly

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
what portal that is.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
And exactly yeah

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
that portal is usually blue for reasons

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
but it's oh my god I'm dying.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
I'm dying. I thought that you would

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
appreciate that story. And I said it

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
live on air. Thank you.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
So that you would stop fangirling over

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Tim Curry. All right. Thank you.

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
I appreciate you taking my mind off Tim Curry

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
with your assing of portals.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
All right.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
1877 Game OLR. Our username

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
on Skype Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
Alan? Is it me? Yeah.

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
OK. So. Is it me? It's you?

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
I try

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
not to be a petty person but

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
sometimes it's a lot of fun.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
Shut up.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
So someone noticed

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
that at JB Hi-Fi

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
which is a retailer in Australia

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
someone who worked at that

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
store did their own

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
little banner

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
for their shelf that has

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
pre-order copies of Metal Gear

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
Solid 5 The Phantom Pain.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Someone put on it

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
it's a Hideo Kojima

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
game because

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
Konami or as I like to refer to them

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
as toilet clowns

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
they

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
they are trying to do some weird

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Jason Bourne Men in Black

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
number six I'm not a number I am a free man

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
sort of thing

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Hideo Kojima who's that?

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
We don't like him. He's gone.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Just strip the name off. So this

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
this petty video game employee

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
put up their own

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Who's one of your heroes?

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
For this? Yeah.

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
So just put up hey this is a Hideo Kojima game

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
and Kojima caught wind of it on

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Twitter and retweeted it

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
and was like oh yes it is nice

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
for me to get some

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
credit and notoriety that I did in fact

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
make this game. Ooh shade.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
That's pretty good.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
So petty, petty, petty

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
but people can be as petty as they

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
want to Konami. So.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
SSG100Matt in chat says what a

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
rant by Alan and Act F says

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
and you were worried Alan wouldn't fill the rant quota.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
There

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
it is. Congratulations there Alan.

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
Yes. Speaking of um

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
shade throwing we gotta talk about our fries

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
trivia today. I'm gonna go ahead and uh

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
oh wait shit I got one more story. Hold this thought

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
we're gonna talk about shade throwing

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
right after I talk about this

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
which is just gonna make you

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
well actually this might make you happy.

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
It's gonna make you angry because

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
we're gonna talk about Silent Hills yet again

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
and how it's not happening but

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
do you remember that somebody

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
remade PT and called it

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Allison Road? They actually

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
kind of remade that PT demo and it was

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
inspired by that. Well now

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
That was named something different

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.000
cause I still have the freaking installer for it

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
on my Mac. Well

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
It was a punity.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:48.000
Oh there was that too.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.000
This is something else. This is something different.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
But uh Allison Road has actually gone

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000
to what else? Kickstarter

02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Hey y'all figure

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
PT would end up on Kickstarter. Kojima

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
and Yomototaro will end up on Kickstarter at some point

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
so the folks behind

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
Allison Road have actually gone to Kickstarter

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
and they are looking to fully

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
realize their game

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000
that started as a PT

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:12.000
clone essentially. You need to get more

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
information AllisonRoadgame.com

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
I'm gonna have to see if we can get them on the show. I think it'll be fun

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
to talk about. This will take

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
my Kickstarter virginity. Really?

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Hell yeah.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
Alright. I'm gonna go ahead and open up the

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Skype line 1877 game OLR

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
or a username on Skype orange lounge radio

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
all one word. Can we talk about fries? Yes

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:32.000
Can we talk about the fries trip and the hilarious

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
thing we saw there? Go ahead. You're a better story

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
teller than me. Go ahead. So obviously

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
this was just a coincidence

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
of them being in between

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
uh moving inventory

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000
around. No it was on purpose. Okay it was

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
on purpose. So in the video

02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:48.000
game section one aisle over

02:39:48.000 --> 02:39:50.000
the header where on every

02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:52.000
shelf there's a little thing that tells you what should be on

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:54.000
that shelf. At the top there was the

02:39:54.000 --> 02:39:56.000
Xbox 360 logo and it said

02:39:56.000 --> 02:39:58.000
360 or Xbox 360

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:00.000
accessories except what was

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:02.000
actually on the shelf were those little

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
like in a corporate environment when

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
you have your office desk the little trash

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
can. It was trash cans.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
So they were saying Xbox 360

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
accessories aka trash bins

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
put your 360 in the garbage. I think

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
was the subtext

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
there. Yes. And we

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
saw it and had a good laugh and you

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
put a picture on Twitter. I did at my personal

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Twitter. Twitter.com slash SKIE

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
I actually was sky SKIE I actually put

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
a picture of the Xbox

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
360 accessories trash but then also

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
like Shane pointed out Shane was with us

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
like just next to that it was something like

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
um Xbox like regular

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
accessories and it was a bunch of frozen

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
lunch pails or something

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
so I was like frozen

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
everything. Frozen has gone too far

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
too far this time

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
anyway again the skype line is

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
open 1877 game

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
olr or username on skype orange

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
lounge radio

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Brad from pod culture saying

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
that toilet clowns is the name of my

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
band and rock band well it will be

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
anyway so there you go

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
look at that Alan inspiring

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
people's future rock band

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
the real reginator wasn't Allison

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
wrote a gin blossom song it might have been

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
actually yes it was

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
alright well

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
looks like folks are being a little bit shy on

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
our skype line tonight you know sometimes we get 20 people

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
fighting over the phones tonight it looks

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
a little empty I guess I guess people don't want to follow

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
the Alan rant or the great interview we had

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
tonight but I will put out

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
I'll put out one more call for

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
calls 1877 game

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
olr or our username on skype

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
orange first y'all don't email

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
second y'all don't call

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
my southern so

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
solicit random questions

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
I think sometimes we like to take some random

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
questions from our chat room

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000

ask us go ahead and put them in the chat room

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
just make sure it's nothing

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
no perverts and no

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
no weird stuff keep it

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
keep it clean

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
I mean we might give dirty

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000
answers but keep it clean keep it classy

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000
you know who else would be cool to interview

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:14.000
random questions for no reason at all

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000
other than awesome Betty

02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:18.000
White

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:20.000
I could die

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:22.000
what video game did she do?

02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
she did everything awesome at least

02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Tim Curry did have some gaming

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
experience even though I don't know I was just randomly

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
thinking about Betty White because I was thinking

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:32.000
about cheesecake

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:34.000
she did some voice over work for the golden girls

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
RTS

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
there is no golden girls RTS

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
there should be

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
absolutely

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
actdeft in our chat room is asking the

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
quintessential ASL

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
37

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
as often as I can

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
SSJ100Matt asks

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
what three people would you want in your foxhole

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Foxhole's

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
taking it back to World War 1

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
I think that sounds dirty

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
a foxhole sounds like

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
forget the Collins we need to

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
do an ask Orange Lounge

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
that's what I was kind of getting at

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
we need to do an official ask Orange Lounge

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
an official ask Orange Lounge

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
but we're barely

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
getting any questions

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
as it is

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
fine I have a question

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
what

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
can we get cheesecake

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
not this late I start a new job tomorrow

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
girl

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
it's never too late for cheesecake

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
SSJ100Matt is confirming that is

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
the World War 1 saying

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
so what three people would you want in your foxhole

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
it just sounds dirty

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
who do you want in your

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
foxhole

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
all I'm thinking are like

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
of like

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
I'm just thinking of names of like really good looking actors

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
I know because that's where my mind

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
goes I go Chris Pine

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
Zachary Quinto

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
you know what just the cast of Star Trek

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
just put the entire cast of Star Trek

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
I would want

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
Neil deGrasse Tyson

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
Bill Nye

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
and

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
Laverne Cox

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
Act Deft is asking a question

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
okay so if you could have a video game item

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
any video game item

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
which one would you want

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
so are we talking like a video game item

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
in real life

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
like a hook shot I'm assuming that's what it means

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
if you could have a video game item in real life

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
what would you want

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
gravity gun

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
a portal gun

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
yeah but you'll break your legs if you also

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
don't have the long fall boots

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000
fine I want a portal gun and long fall boots

02:44:52.000 --> 02:44:54.000
I would snap my neck

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
just doing stuff around the house with a portal gun

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
alright let's go to the

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
phones and take a call

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
who's this

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:04.000
hey Rob how's it going

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.000
oh is this Marissa

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
hey how are you doing

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
I'm glad tonight it went so well

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000
it was so much fun

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000
thank you so much for getting us in touch with

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
them and putting me two degrees from Tim Curry

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000
I'm so appreciative

02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:20.000
that was incredible

02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:22.000
yeah I just called to say hi

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:24.000
so no one was calling

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:26.000
and I felt bad and it's been a while

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:28.000
and I miss you and we still need to have Rob and Marissa

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:30.000
at giggle time

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
I know that's a future podcast we need to have for sure

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:34.000
is the Rob and Marissa giggle time I miss your face

02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:36.000
you know what's weird I haven't been to LA

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:38.000
in like months and months I haven't been to Disneyland in a year

02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:40.000
I think just with everything going on

02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:42.000
at my former job that was so busy

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
I just didn't get really down to LA

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
I'm really over due for a trip

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
but now I'm going to be in this new job and I have to focus on that

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
for a while so

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
Rob there may be plans early next year by the way

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000
early next year I might be able to swing that

02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:56.000
I might be able to work with that

02:45:56.000 --> 02:45:58.000
well Marissa you heard all the chat

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:00.000
you heard all the chat on voice acting earlier

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
was there anything out of that interview

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
that kind of made you go wow

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
that was a really good point that somebody made

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:08.000
oh you know

02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:10.000
I love you anytime I have the opportunity

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:12.000
to hear both of them speak

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:14.000
it's just always a thrill

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
and there are wonderful interviews out there

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
on the internet and I've had the pleasure

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:20.000
I'm not taking classes with Dave yet

02:46:20.000 --> 02:46:22.000
I hope to soon but with Greg

02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:24.000
and he's an amazing

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:26.000
teacher and just a great

02:46:26.000 --> 02:46:28.000
guy as you can see he's a lot of fun

02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:30.000
I bet

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:32.000
it is true though this gentleman

02:46:32.000 --> 02:46:34.000
oh no I was just going to say

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:36.000
when he was doing the interview I liked how he would

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000
slip into some of his voices there

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:40.000
as he was doing the interview does he do that when he's teaching too

02:46:42.000 --> 02:46:44.000
if somebody asks

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
you know he's really wonderful about that

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
he doesn't mind

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000
he's just a sweetheart about that

02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:52.000
and it's been a great thing

02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:54.000
putting all these classes together because

02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:56.000
if you're not in town you might not know about it

02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:58.000
but you know it's like an old

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000
LA thing about all sorts of classes

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:02.000
you know there's so many things

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:04.000
to choose from and it's really nice

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:06.000
for these wonderful teachers

02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:08.000
so although Jamie was actually asking

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:10.000
about the strain on your voice

02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:12.000
and I hear that a lot

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:14.000
what they alluded to

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:16.000
specifically with video games

02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:18.000
well you know even

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:20.000
I didn't want to make it about me

02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:22.000
but now I can make it about me because

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
we're old friends and we're at the back

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.000
of the show but you know I used

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:28.000
to MC Rocky Horror Picture Show and other cult

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:30.000
movies like Repo and some of

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
that stuff here in Sacramento and

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000
even just yelling at Rocky Horror

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:36.000
for two hours on end the next day I've come

02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:38.000
into OLR and you guys go back a couple

02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.000
years in the show I've done OLR sounding

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
like this and it's because of the strain I put on

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
my voice the night before when I was doing

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
Rocky Horror and that's just

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
a couple hours of being loud and obnoxious

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
in front of a cloud of 500 and then

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
you know I'm a teacher by day as

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
well the corporate type

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
and so you know that can put a strain on my voice

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
as well so like I

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
hear you in it but it's one of those things

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
like until David or Gray

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
you know says it like

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
oh yeah my god when they go into those

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
booths there must be like

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
that time when they have to do the war

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
calls and the my character's getting

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
shot and stabbed stuff you know

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
and it's like oh my gosh that's got to be crazy on the

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
voice. Allen?

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Oh yeah especially with a lot of those fantasy

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
games or war games

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
there's an incredible amount I've heard all sorts

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
of interviews and actors talking about

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
you know just streaming for hours

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
I mean you know it depends on the context

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
for example like you know if it's a union

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
job you know they make efforts

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
to try to protect the actors or

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
you know things happen anyway at the job

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
or they try to give them notice but even

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
I had a session you know where I went in and

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
I did no shit about it

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
I was screaming for two hours at the top of my lungs

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
so I mean people try to employ

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
you know various vocal

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
techniques too or you know there are certain

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
ways to scream you know that don't

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
damage your voice as much but you know if it's really

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
emotional you have to try to do it and

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
I guess the best you can try to do is

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
you know like the first

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
time as much as you can I guess

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Alan wanted to jump in here and say something too

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
I've heard from other

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
podcast interviews that a lot of

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
beginning

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
voice actors sort of a rookie mistake they make

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
when they're just starting to get regular work

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
is they will come up with a voice

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
for a character for like a Cartoon

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
Network show and they really love

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
the voice that they came up with and they can't wait

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
to show the producer and then when they get

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
in the recording booth it's like oh this voice

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
involves me screaming this voice is totally

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
not sustainable for like a regular character

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
you're absolutely right

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
yeah we hear that a lot

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
or somebody they'll be like at the highest

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
part of their range

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
but you know

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
your voice levels change with emotion

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
so if you're at the highest

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
part of your range you can't go anywhere

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
you know where to go

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
so yeah that's a great point I forget yeah

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
they talk about that a lot too like you have to make

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
sure that you can do it and

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
you're not going to be strained and I see that all

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
the time honestly you know sometimes

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
people got to do these big growly things

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
and they swear that they can do it all day and you can hear

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
you're like no I know you want to take the job

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
but you know you're going to

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
hurt yourself

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
oh my gosh

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
wow I get to answer this question

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
in our chat room again making it about me

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
sorry Marissa but ST100Matt is asking

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
didn't you meet at least

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
didn't you meet at least one

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
cast member from Rocky Horror in

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
your shadow cast years Rob?

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
believe it or not no

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
when I went to the 25th in Vegas

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
years ago this would have been the year 2000

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
I went to the 25th

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
they taped some VH1

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
shows and so I was in the audience

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
they used to have a show called Celebrity Karaoke

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
which is so funny that now there's that

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
lip syncing show on Skype

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
on Spike TV because it's like

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
okay they used to have like karaoke on

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
TV and now it's lip syncing whatever

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
but they did a karaoke thing and

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
Richard O'Brien, Little Nell

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
and Patricia Quinn were all there and in it

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
so we got to see them and that was cool but I didn't get to meet them

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
but here in Sacramento

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
actually we are having a big con coming

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
up called Sinister Creature Con

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
and it's the same company that

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
put on Rocky Horror here in Sacramento

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
that I used to be with they actually got

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
Little Nell

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Patricia Quinn and Barry Boswick

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
are all going to be here in Sacramento

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
I think it's the 17th of October

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
I think is when it is

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
don't quote me on that date look up Sinister Creature

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
Con on Facebook and

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
yeah that's awesome so

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
I definitely have to go to that and I'll finally get to meet

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
them and cause

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
yeah those are all some great great talent

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
so anyway

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
sorry Marissa I didn't mean to make it

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
about me but oops I guess I did

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
so well

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
well hopefully you'll be meeting up with another friend at Dragon Con

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
too they'll make an appearance later

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
yes I love getting interviews at

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
Dragon Con and so we're going to try to make that happen

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
so I am totally okay

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
and me and that actor are working together on a

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
on an audio

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
an audio play you know kind of like a radio

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
drama well that's exactly what it is just in

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
podcast format and that's going

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
that's run by Ben Padme if you

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
remember him he does

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
he wrote even the Jump Leads

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
webcomics in addition to Port

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Center

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
and he's called in a few times

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
those would be a lot of fun to

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
work on I bet you know those

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
types of podcasts I have some friends that do them

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
and yeah I bet that's so much

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
fun those audio dramas good stuff

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
well I'm going to let you go

bye always good to hear from

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
our pal Marissa here who by the way

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
and you might be wondering

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
well she didn't talk about video games

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
that whole call what's she playing what's she doing

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
she mentioned earlier it doesn't matter because Marissa

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
yeah it doesn't matter because Marissa

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
so F you and B

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
she loves

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
some thief and she actually named earlier

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
in chat I didn't read it on air but she actually said

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
that in

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
the original thief not the new one that's some of

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
her favorite voice acting she's had in a

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
game there so there it is

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
anyhow I think

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000

off again and then try to speak into it so

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
when you get the technical hurdles figured out

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
all right uh let's see my

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000

thought last but not least dark

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
your final thought for tonight

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
I

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
don't know I think about

I can't have it

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
all right maybe it'll be a

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
cheat day in your future

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
I had a cheat weekend what are you talking about

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
that's the way to do it

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
the whole thing is that I have to be super good this week

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
because like I said next Sunday

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
well technically it's the

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
Tuesday next

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
Tuesday I will have been

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
married to Dan for ten years

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
and haven't set him on fire yet

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
I did scald him once that was an accident

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
all right

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
I want to thank again

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
by the way Andrew Jones

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
Greg Berger and

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
David Sobolove

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
for being on our show tonight thank you so

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
much they were great they were so

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
fantastic oh my gosh I'm just like

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:30.000
and it seems like now we've like

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
we've broken the seal and now like

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
there's going to be more voice actors on OLR in the future

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
which I'm super excited about

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
that's awesome because that's like a movie

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
podcast getting actors and actresses

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
so why wouldn't we want voice actors

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
and actresses on our show I can't wait

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
they totally get mad respect

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
for me in fact I have to

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
say that

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
Greg was one of the first ones that I actually

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
got an appreciation for versatility

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
of voice acting when I was a kid

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
for that one episode in Transformers

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
where Grimlock gets really smart

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
and I was like

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
is that the same person

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
and as a kid so I think

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
that's sort of what started my fascination with

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
just learning more about it so

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
very cool awesome and yes Dan is definitely

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
the man for me respect

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
respect for

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
voice actors and actresses respect

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
for other gamers keep on

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
respecting we'll see you in seven days on the next

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
Orange Lounge Radio Loki should be back with us

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
Dark Soccer sadly will not we're not going to see you

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
for a few weeks because with the DragonCon episode

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
you think I'm going to be sad

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
I'm going to be seeing Weird Al

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
