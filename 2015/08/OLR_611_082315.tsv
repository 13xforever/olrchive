14000	26000	Tonight we recap the week in gaming news and we are joined by voice actors Andrew Jones, Drake Berger, and David Solov to talk about voice acting in gaming. Ask your questions live right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	43000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Episode number 611 for this, August the 23rd of 2015.
44000	53000	We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with myself here in studio, Rob Roberts, but you might know me on Twitter as Skie, at S-K-I-E.
54000	58000	And joining me is Miss, at DarkSakura. DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
59000	60000	Hi.
61000	62000	Hi, how are you?
63000	64000	Caffeinated now.
65000	68000	Caffeinated, and it's hot. The temperature in the studio keeps going from extreme hot to extreme cold. It's weird.
69000	71000	And it's only 88 degrees outside. Only.
71000	76000	I know. In beautiful, headquartered Sacramento, California where we're at. It's been pretty creepy.
77000	78000	AKA Satan's asshole.
79000	89000	Actually, Satan's asshole has been kind of good to us this year. We've had only maybe like 5, 6 hundred degree plus days over the whole summer. I've seen some summers that are way worse.
90000	92000	It's been relatively mild.
93000	94000	Some summers are straight up phoenix.
95000	96000	For being in the middle of a drought.
96000	103000	True, true. Not joining us tonight, sadly, Techmaster Loki. Techmaster Loki has the night off to take care of some other issues.
104000	111000	But filling in tonight in our third chair, very happy to have him joining us, and I'm not just saying that because I know him very, very, very well.
112000	114000	Say hello, everybody, to Alan, joining us here in studio tonight.
115000	116000	Hi.
117000	118000	Hi, Alan. Welcome back to the show.
119000	120000	Thank you for having me.
121000	124000	You're welcome. It's, you know, your house too, so I guess, you know, when this show's going on in the spare room, you know, you can pop on when you want.
124000	128000	But no, I appreciate you being here. Usually you work on the Sunday nights, so I'm glad you're here.
129000	136000	Yeah, my work has had a bit of a drought the last two weeks, but considering that it's not an election year without getting too much into what I do.
137000	145000	The way it's been the last two weeks is more representative of what it should be like. The fact that it's been so busy up until this point was the anomaly.
146000	152000	And I guess that streak finally, the well ran dry, but hopefully I can get some hours soon.
152000	155000	But I'm here, so I'm going to help co-host the show.
156000	157000	I appreciate it.
158000	159000	I have stories and everything.
160000	163000	Hooray. It's always nice to see you here on the program. And always nice to have you guys join us live.
164000	171000	And remember, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network.
171000	179000	vog.network.com. And if you are listening to us live, head on over to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
180000	183000	And you can participate live with our show and have some of your comments read.
184000	189000	For example, Brad from Pod Culture is in our chat room right now saying, nice, it's been a while since Alan has been on the show.
190000	191000	It has been a while.
192000	195000	Sj100matt saying, you all will need to pick up the slack in the rant side of things tonight.
196000	200000	Alan, you know Loki is infamous for his rants here in the studio.
201000	206000	I can probably be pissy bitchy about something, just not Nintendo. I don't really have the hate in my heart.
207000	211000	I can't really drum up that level of angst for them in particular.
212000	223000	And you know, we say this all the time, even though Loki gets very angry sometimes when the subject of Nintendo comes up, it comes from a place of, I'm a fan and I hate seeing you make these decisions I don't like.
224000	228000	That's where Loki's quote-unquote anger comes from. But you're not really in the same boat. You think Nintendo's cute, right? I don't know.
229000	230000	They're fine.
231000	237000	They're expensive. But you're more a PC gamer anyway. I have like every single console here in this house. I don't think I ever see you pick one up.
238000	241000	I don't know, just something about sitting in the living room and doing that is strange.
242000	247000	That's weird because that's what I love doing. I almost think sometimes being in the, I mean, I don't know, the MMOs are one thing.
248000	251000	And maybe that's because of the more chat room style experience where I really need the keyboard.
252000	260000	But sometimes when I'm playing games, I need to be able to plop on the couch, have that controller in my hand, you know, and just relax.
261000	263000	Just Cheeto dust from chin to ankles.
264000	269000	Yes! Precisely! Don't you be telling the listeners my secrets here.
272000	277000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I wish Alan would get over his fear of planes and come to Dragon Con sometime.
278000	284000	And also I wish Alan's boss would let him take Labor Day weekend off. Well, I think that's just a matter of, it's also a matter of money.
284000	295000	It's a money thing mostly this year because even, I mean, we try to call people when they're at home and Labor Day is like the biggest vacation weekend of the year, right?
296000	301000	Maybe Memorial Day? So I probably wouldn't have a shift that weekend anyway.
302000	305000	So you could come probably if tickets weren't so expensive and the fact that, you know.
306000	309000	I think there's another, we're doing Gamer X in December and then I think there's something in February or March.
309000	311000	MagFest is the thing we're planning on.
312000	320000	MagCon, it's all about Marge Simpson. We're both going to do our cosplay. Patty and Selma.
321000	332000	So tell us a little more about PC gaming. Since you haven't been on the show in a while, what kind of games do you, I mean obviously we're going to do our gaming weeks in a little bit, what kind of games do you generally enjoy on PC?
332000	347000	Action RPGs. Your Mass Effect, your Dragon Ages, your stuff that is on, you know, the big titles on Steam, Borderlands, I like FPSs if it has a strong narrative aspect, Bioshock.
348000	359000	One thing I noticed you like to do, and I see other gamers do this too, but for some reason I don't usually get into this, is you really like to replay classics.
359000	371000	Like it seems like every year, and I mean I shouldn't say it that way because it's not like I don't go back and play Super Mario Brothers or Super Mario 3, but you will go back to the 100 hour plus games and really invest like on a yearly basis.
372000	377000	Like I see you go back and go to Half-Life or Half-Life 2. I see you go to Dragon Age.
377000	393000	The games that I'm more likely to replay like that, Half-Life 2 is a special case because it's a first, obviously it's an FPS so it's going to be the same experience from start to finish. I can just maybe tweak with the difficulties if I want and make it like really punishing.
394000	410000	But a game like Skyrim or Dragon Age or Mass Effect where you can do things out of order, you can make your character an asshole, make your character a goody-goody, play a different race, there's going to be variety in something that I do in a replay.
410000	433000	I mean overall the campaign is the same, but it's not like I'm going to fire up Final Fantasy 7 or 8 games that I love and I have played through those more than once, but that's like a once a decade thing because I mean the characters are static, the campaign is static, the grinding is static. I'm not as compelled to invest another 60 hours in that.
434000	435000	Jamie, you want to jump in here?
435000	458000	That's actually how I feel, why I've gone back and I'm playing through, I think I'm on my fifth playthrough of Inquisition right now and I'm on my third or fourth playthrough for the original Dragon Age because I did play it through twice with the same type of character because I really like the Dalish origin, but now I'm playing the human noble and Alistair.
458000	468000	Anyway, because he's pretty. He's a precious cinnamon roll, too perfect for this world. And you know Mass Effect, because modding makes him even better.
469000	484000	You got some fans, fellow fans of PC gaming in chat, Dungeon Buster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying, yeah PC gaming! And SSG100Matt giving us an update on MAGFest. MAGFest is aiming to have tickets and hotel registration open within the next week or two, re their Twitter.
484000	494000	That's going to be my first MAGFest, but I was a fan of the Rockage thing they did out here, which was related, and everybody tells me, you got to do MAGFest, you got to do MAGFest. Alright, fine, I'll go.
494000	502000	I also, since we're talking about PC gaming, I want to give a special free plug because it's not like we have an affiliate thing with them.
502000	514000	For anyone who remembers the early 90s games, the Forgotten Realms, the Baldur's Gate, BioWare's first foray into RPGs, the Icewind Dale, some of the more obscure.
514000	527000	Because a lot of those old TSR D&D RPG games were pretty, like Ravenloft I think was one of them with the mummy on the cover. All that stuff is on good old games, GOG.com for like $1.98 per game.
527000	529000	GOG does some great deals.
529000	539000	And that is for this weekend, so this is a live audience exclusive. So if you're downloading this on the podcast feed, unless Rob gets it up by midnight and you listen to it before you go to bed tonight, which, wow, okay.
540000	550000	That's just a tip for those listening live. You can get a whole bundle, I think for like $15 for like 20 games, literally hundreds of hours of gameplay.
550000	561000	Planescape Torment, which a lot of people think is the best 90s RPG ever for PC, is also like $1.98. It's insane, so everyone go check that out.
561000	574000	Awesome. Yeah, hey, I know we don't get paid by these companies to give shout-outs, but I am a fan of good deals tonight. Anyhow, I want to get into our kickoff topic tonight because we actually have a really big show tonight.
574000	581000	I mean, you know, we always try to do a big show here at Orange Lawn Straight Open. Tonight's like a really big show. We actually have some guests joining us tonight.
581000	589000	At about 6.30, we are actually going to be joined by some voice actors, and I'm really excited about this. We're pretty much going to have like a live panel.
589000	601000	We've been talking about conventions, right? We're going to have like a live panel here on the show tonight all about voice acting. We're going to be joined by Andrew Jones, who's like a casting director, and we're going to talk to Greg Berger.
601000	608000	Greg Berger, you video gamers probably know him, I mean he's done a few things, but you guys probably know him best as Jecht from Final Fantasy X.
608000	614000	Although if you watch cartoons, Dark Sakura practically peed her pants when she heard.
614000	615000	He's Grimlock.
615000	616000	He's Grimlock.
616000	617000	And Skyfire.
617000	618000	Yes.
618000	619000	Grimlock.
619000	623000	And he's Odie. So, I mean, he's going to be here live, taking your questions in just a little bit.
623000	627000	If you have to ask who Grimlock is, then you need to leave.
627000	631000	Go to Wikipedia quick and figure it out.
631000	639000	Alright, also joining us, so that's two, we have three, David Sobolov going to be joining us as well.
639000	645000	Very excited. He is Asmodan. You guys, gamers, if you play Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm, you guys know Asmodan.
645000	650000	He is that voice, and he also has an impressive resume from other cartoons and games.
650000	656000	He is the one that actually had a minor role in Mass Effect 3 as well, so he's tied to our beloved BioWare.
656000	661000	So we're going to talk to all of them in just a little bit, in about 15 minutes here on Orange Laundry Radio.
661000	666000	So if you want to be able to ask questions, get to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
666000	670000	Meanwhile, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, and you know, tonight's kickoff topic,
670000	677000	not the sort of thing I like to lead off the show with. In fact, a topic like this isn't really about gaming,
677000	687000	but it's more of a side effect of what happens as gaming is getting bigger and bigger and more and more mainstream and so forth.
687000	694000	Those of you that have probably been paying attention to the news today might have heard about the Pokemon World Championships that are going on right now.
694000	703000	The Pokemon World Championships are happening out in Boston, and unfortunately today, there was a bomb threat at the Pokemon Championships.
703000	711000	And they have actually arrested two individuals in conjunction with this bomb threat that's happened there.
711000	722000	This is crazy. Obviously, sick people doing sick things with this whole thing.
722000	730000	And you know, now we're seeing this type of stuff where these large gaming events are getting targeted.
730000	740000	You know, if you heard that somebody made a bomb threat against the Super Bowl or the Olympics or some other big sporting event,
740000	749000	you'd probably go, that's messed up, people are stupid, but you'd probably also go, it seems like there's always some crazy targeting these large events.
749000	753000	And now we're seeing it happen with these gaming events even. It's something else.
753000	758000	What do you guys think when you hear this, that there were people targeting the Pokemon World Championships?
758000	764000	And shout out to the police for catching it and shutting it down before anybody got hurt, thank God.
764000	769000	What do you guys think about this when you hear this? Anybody?
770000	778000	So the two individual suspects, was there actually a device found?
778000	784000	You know what's funny is the story I had closed on me, so I'm trying to find it.
784000	794000	Not that it matters, but I mean, the people that, whatever their intentions were, are going to pay the consequences.
794000	798000	But aside from the arrest, was there an actual device? I'm just curious.
798000	805000	I got it, I got it. Okay, here we go. So a 27-year-old and an 18-year-old, and I'm not going to read their names and give them any attention,
805000	816000	27-year-old idiot and 18-year-old moron, we'll call them idiot and moron, were, I guess they were actually invited to play in the Masters Division of the tournament.
816000	825000	And they had made threats on Facebook, and there was a post where there were guns that these guys had posted that they were going to take,
825000	832000	saying that idiot and I are ready for the world's Boston here we come. And this was brought to the attention of the police.
832000	841000	And so they were stopped from entering the venue on Thursday, firearms were found in the car that idiot and moron had when they drove from Iowa.
841000	850000	Neither one of them had a license to carry, the car was seized, the vehicle had a shotgun, assault rifle, hunting rifle, 250 rounds of ammo.
851000	857000	They were arrested on Friday night. So there was no bomb, I guess the bomb threat was on Facebook.
857000	862000	Okay, but it very easily could have been like a mass shooting situation, and I totally want to throw up now.
862000	875000	People are garbage, and it's gross, and I guess, I include myself in the fact that I do identify with this group, but like the gaming, gamers are gross.
875000	877000	Some gamers are gross.
877000	879000	It's an awful industry.
879000	888000	Well, here's the thing that strikes me as like, just like really scary about this. I mean, obviously the whole thing is weird to begin with.
888000	894000	But, you know, usually when we think about video games make people violent, what are the things they target?
894000	902000	They target the first person shooters, the Duke Nukem's, the overly, Grand Theft Auto's, the overly violent games.
902000	913000	This was fucking Pokemon. This was a family event. This is something kids play. That's, well, really disturbing.
915000	927000	I understand what you're saying, but it's a different discussion between the content of gaming and what these two idiots would want to be infamous or getting into notoriety.
927000	934000	And for that reason, it's a very, I mean, it's, they're all E-rated games. Parents play them with their kids. Kids love it.
934000	941000	It's got a larger audience than say if it was like, I don't know, BlizzCon or something, which I think is going to skew older.
941000	949000	So it's really frightening that they picked a, you know, something that has that much crossover mainstream appeal.
949000	958000	Anyway, SS21 Hunter Matt says, Boston doesn't mess around with security. Act Deaf to reminding me in chat, the Olympics have had that happen.
958000	963000	I apologize if that comparison was in poor taste, but I was just naming some big sporting events that came to mind first.
963000	972000	But I mean, unfortunately, yes, in, in 96 in Atlanta, where I'm going in a couple of weeks, there was a bomb event that occurred and it was all over the media and stuff.
972000	985000	And it was, it was sick then and it's sick now. So, yeah, let's see, also looking in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, SS21 Hunter Matt confirming that one of the guys was a known member of the Pokemon community.
985000	995000	And Dungeon Muster says they boasted about doing this on social media, which the police picked up on, which, you know, was some really weird, sick cry for attention.
995000	1012000	So anyway, again, not that I think this has anything to do with gaming directly, but the reason why I bring it up is it's just one of those like really like sad after effects of seeing gaming get bigger and bigger and more into the mainstream.
1012000	1022000	You know, gaming is becoming more mainstream. These on demand, you know, Shane was over here the other day, we were watching like a Heroes of the Storm tournament on the TV, like it was ESPN practically.
1022000	1032000	Granted, we were using Twitch to do it, but, you know, as TV gets more and more virtual, you know, more and more of this stuff gets mainstream, you know, these big gaming events are big sporting events.
1032000	1047000	So I guess also the moral of the story, so to speak, you know, these guys were talking about it on Facebook, you know, I would hope that none of you hang out with people that would ever do things like this.
1047000	1058000	But if you ever see something like this on Facebook or something, like, you need to alert the authorities. And don't fucking joke about this stuff either, because it's no joke.
1058000	1067000	Not that I think any of you guys would, but I'm just saying, you know, you have to take this kind of crap seriously, because unfortunately, those guys had guns in their car, they were serious.
1068000	1078000	Anyway, let's try to change the topic. Back to the games that are fun, we like, we enjoy, and not where there's-
1078000	1080000	Not that violent Pokemon stuff.
1080000	1088000	Yeah, right? Let's talk about our gaming weeks here real quick. I'll probably have to interrupt us in the middle of this here, because we're gonna have our guests on shortly.
1088000	1094000	But we always like to start off the show with, how was your gaming week? So I want to talk to Dark Soccer real quick. How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?
1094000	1108000	Old. I played some Dragon Age Inquisition, of course, because I always do. I played Final Fantasy XIV, I'm actually getting back into the story, I'm around the 2.2 patch stuff right now.
1109000	1124000	But I'm playing, I'm playing. And Dan and I busted out the Super Nintendo last night, we busted out the sealed box of games, the ones that we've got in the special plastic, and we are playing through Chrono Trigger.
1124000	1146000	I, all of my save files were intact, so we new gamed plus that shit, and we are piling through the story. So, since playing since last night, we just got the epic last, uh, today. So, we are on our way.
1146000	1148000	Nice!
1148000	1158000	We're at the point where you go back to 12,000 BC and get, uh, Magus. Man, he had such a cool name in Japan, though.
1158000	1159000	What was that? I forget.
1159000	1160000	Maul.
1160000	1161000	Oh, that's right.
1161000	1162000	Demon King.
1162000	1163000	Sounds scary.
1163000	1164000	Yeah.
1164000	1180000	When I saw that box of games, of in their case, or in their box with the instructions and all that, the first thing that I thought was, I used to have nearly all of those, but then that leads me to my second thought, that's easily like $1,500 on eBay.
1180000	1181000	Yes, it is.
1182000	1205000	The reason why I no longer have those things is because I think I parted with my near mint Chrono Trigger for like $120, $150, and then I was able to sell the official strategy guide, which had a ton of really gorgeous artwork in it from Akira Toriyama, for like another $50 or $60. So, money, money, money. Especially that Ninja Gaiden trilogy you have.
1205000	1211000	Yeah, we, um, the last one of those that went in the condition ours is in.
1211000	1212000	Yeah.
1212000	1213000	Went for about $450.
1213000	1214000	Wow.
1214000	1218000	Um, one without the manual or box went for about $200.
1218000	1222000	Yeah. Not that you guys would ever, but as soon as I see all that stuff.
1222000	1223000	We tried to sell it once.
1223000	1224000	I'm just like.
1224000	1229000	We tried to sell Ninja Gaiden first. Um, we put a $350 buy it now on it.
1229000	1232000	Yeah, but if they don't make your limit, then you're not gonna sell it.
1232000	1244000	We didn't go at the time, but we, we were sort of talking about downsizing the collection a little bit just because, um, it's not that we have less space, but the room is oddly shaped with the windows and closet and everything.
1244000	1254000	So, um, we were talking about that last night, but we're, we're thinking about how we can bring back the vault properly and what we're going to do with it. More news, news later, news later.
1254000	1263000	Good. I, I need to come over and we're going to stream some games cause you got so many games that I think there's so many people out there that haven't seen a lot of these classic games.
1263000	1268000	Like, you know, I'm sure everybody knows Chrono Trigger. If you don't, you probably want to look into that.
1268000	1271000	Uh, but there's, there's a lot of stuff you guys have in the vault.
1271000	1273000	I'll try to post some stuff up on my Tumblr in a few.
1273000	1280000	Awesome. Awesome. All right. Uh, well, um, Alan quickly before we get to our interview here, how was your gaming week?
1280000	1288000	Good. Um, really quickly, I have a Final Fantasy 14 story on, uh, the show roll for me, so I won't talk about that as much.
1288000	1302000	Um, I've been doing a lot of PvP in 14 simply because for the end game, uh, story content and rating and stuff, I'm, I've run out of stuff to do, um, without doing the savage heroic hardcore mode, which I have no interest in doing.
1302000	1312000	Um, I bought Pinball Arcade, uh, two weeks ago on Steam. They had the pro edition for 19 bucks and almost every single table that I would want is in the season one pack.
1312000	1319000	Um, the Addams Family, which I know you had the guy on, was interviewed on OLR about getting the Addams Family.
1319000	1320000	That is correct.
1320000	1325000	That's season four. Um, there isn't a lot that interests me in the other seasons.
1325000	1332000	I almost feel like season one has too many good games in it that they needed to spread out amongst the other ones because I don't really have any incentive to buy it.
1332000	1339000	So I've played a lot of that, a lot of, um, Twilight Zone. It's amazing how much crap is crammed into that board.
1339000	1347000	Um, lots of Elvira Scared Stiff, which I played a ton of when I was, uh, 1920 at the Nickel Arcade in Walnut Creek.
1347000	1352000	Uh, I'm playing Mass Effect trilogy all the way through again, or I plan on it.
1352000	1362000	The reason why I'm playing it again is because I want to be gay with Kayden in Mass Effect 1 that you can do, but you have to do it one of two ways.
1362000	1367000	If you, if you want to do Sheploo, which is the generic Shepard, you can do that from jump.
1367000	1377000	If you want to use a custom Shepard with a custom face and background and name, which I do, you play it all the way through, you set yourself to female, then you beat it.
1377000	1386000	And then when you do a new game plus, you set yourself back to male and then that screws up the flag enough to where you can be a custom Shepard and romance Kayden as if you were a woman.
1386000	1392000	But not have Jennifer Hale's voice coming out of a male Shepard's body, which is one of the bugs that can happen if you do it the other way.
1392000	1396000	All right. So kind of, kind of some general mods on the game.
1396000	1397000	Yeah.
1397000	1402000	Why is it that you, you go back and visit Mass Effect? I mean, why, why this game? Why now?
1402000	1403000	It's...
1403000	1405000	Is this prepping for Andromeda or...
1405000	1415000	But kind of, I know I have a lot of problems with a lot of the stuff that they did at Inquisition story-wise and how it kind of shed on a lot of the, the first two Dragon Age games.
1415000	1420000	Bioware's kind of gone downhill in their writing quality, maybe lost up their own butt a little bit.
1420000	1421000	Ooh.
1421000	1425000	But they're still great or whatever. Like, don't send an email.
1425000	1426000	They've gone from a 10 to a 9.
1426000	1427000	Yeah.
1427000	1428000	In your eyes. Okay.
1428000	1431000	Mass Effect 1 and 2 is just really fucking good storytelling.
1431000	1436000	Like, Vermaier, even though you know it's going to happen, is really intense.
1436000	1443000	And Ilos and the whole spree from Ilos through going back into the Citadel and, spoiler, spoiler, is all really intense.
1443000	1452000	So it's all really great storytelling that's so good that so long as I shelve it for like maybe a year, I can revisit it again and it's still just as exciting.
1452000	1453000	It's like watching a classic movie.
1453000	1454000	Yeah.
1454000	1456000	Except you're the star.
1456000	1457000	Yes, exactly.
1457000	1461000	All right. Anything else for your gaming week before we move on?
1461000	1466000	Pinball. We played that new You Don't Know Jack game.
1466000	1467000	Oh, the Quiplash.
1467000	1471000	Quiplash, which we only had three people and I think it needs at least five to be really good.
1471000	1476000	It wasn't bad. It was just you only have one person really voting on your stuff when there's only three people.
1476000	1477000	Yeah.
1477000	1479000	I noticed they really set that game up for streaming though.
1479000	1484000	They must have seen how many people were streaming the Jackbox Party Pack and so they really set up Quiplash.
1484000	1488000	You can extend the time for answers. It really lends itself well to game streaming.
1488000	1492000	I liked how the studio saw that that was happening.
1492000	1495000	Remember, we had them on the show right before Jackbox Party Pack came out.
1495000	1500000	We had them on the show and they were kind of talking about watching and participating even with some of those streams.
1500000	1501000	Pretty cool.
1501000	1503000	Yeah, so that's it really.
1503000	1504000	All right.
1504000	1507000	DungeonBuster in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,
1507000	1510000	I really like the first Mass Effect for the same reasons.
1510000	1514000	When I finally made it to Ilos, that was a great moment.
1514000	1515000	There you go.
1515000	1522000	I am going to slightly disagree with some of the shitting on the lore stuff for Dragon Age Inquisition.
1522000	1527000	If you go back and look at some of the things, I think these were all planned from the beginning.
1528000	1539000	There was a very big, long explanation about how no one writing the actual codex entries within the scope of the universe actually knows what they're talking about.
1539000	1551000	It's all having to do with things getting lost to time, things being a perception, having half of your history wiped out and coming from an oral history.
1552000	1560000	So I think that what we're getting is actual source material as opposed to an interpretation.
1560000	1562000	Opinions here at OLR.
1562000	1564000	We have them and you have them.
1564000	1566000	And you know what else we have tonight?
1566000	1569000	We have some guests that are going to be joining us here live.
1569000	1573000	And since this is live radio, I'm going to actually call these guys right now.
1573000	1575000	We are going to welcome onto our program.
1575000	1578000	We actually have a trio of voice actors joining us tonight.
1578000	1583000	We have Andrew Jones, Greg Berger, and David Sobolov are going to be joining us here.
1583000	1588000	We're getting them on the line right now to join us on the program here at Orange Lounge Radio.
1588000	1594000	If you guys are listening live, you can head on over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1594000	1601000	And if you have any questions for our trio tonight, we'd be happy to get out as many of these questions as we can.
1601000	1603000	But I think we have everybody connected on the line.
1603000	1606000	So welcome, guys, to Orange Lounge Radio.
1606000	1607000	Hello.
1607000	1608000	Thank you.
1608000	1609000	Hello.
1609000	1611000	Yo, yo, yo.
1611000	1613000	It's like we're doing a live panel tonight.
1613000	1620000	I know you guys have to do the convention circuit all the time with all the many voices that you guys have provided over the years.
1620000	1623000	So it's kind of like we're going to do that live here on OLR.
1623000	1624000	I love that.
1624000	1626000	All right. Are you cosplaying?
1626000	1628000	Am I cosplaying?
1628000	1636000	Actually, I am wearing my outfit that I wore for like half my Joker costume, like my casual Joker.
1636000	1638000	Joker for Mass Effect 3, not Joker for Batman.
1638000	1639000	Oh, cool.
1639000	1642000	Yeah, every time I say Joker, everybody assumes that one.
1642000	1643000	Seth Green's Joker.
1643000	1645000	And I'm signing a photo for you right now.
1645000	1646000	Awesome.
1646000	1647000	Yes, autographs.
1647000	1648000	Can we get a picture, a selfie?
1648000	1649000	Sure, sure.
1649000	1650000	All right, awesome.
1650000	1654000	Let me go down the line and introduce everybody we have here on our panel tonight.
1654000	1657000	First off, Andrew Jones joining us tonight.
1657000	1658000	What's up, Andrew?
1658000	1660000	Nothing much. How are you?
1660000	1663000	I am great. Tell us a little bit about yourself.
1663000	1670000	So I work in casting, directing, and actually it's funny because David and Greg are both my mentors.
1670000	1673000	I've studied voice acting and acting with both of them.
1673000	1676000	And I've tried to work a little bit in voice acting.
1676000	1683000	I worked on a show for Fusion, formerly TV Reguide, called Like, Share, Die.
1683000	1687000	And I'm doing some stuff for some video games, so it's going to be pretty awesome.
1687000	1689000	Awesome, awesome.
1689000	1693000	Also joining us on our panel tonight, David Sobolov is here tonight, everybody.
1693000	1696000	Welcome, David.
1696000	1698000	David, can you hear me okay?
1698000	1699000	I just got you.
1699000	1702000	On the Skype call, sometimes if you get a phone call, it cuts it off and that's what just happened.
1702000	1704000	Oh, no, you're a popular guy.
1704000	1706000	The people are trying to call you right now.
1706000	1708000	I'm here, I'm back. David Sobolov, happy.
1708000	1710000	Well, welcome to the program, David.
1710000	1717000	I know a lot of gamers probably know you best as, I know, like, Asmodan from Diablo III, Heroes of the Storm.
1717000	1719000	Huge character.
1719000	1723000	What are some other voices some gamers out there might know?
1723000	1728000	Let's see, over the years, I'm literally going to scroll down here.
1728000	1734000	Oh, Army of Two Devils Cartel, if people saw that, I did a performance capture role on that.
1734000	1735000	It was Tyson Rios.
1735000	1736000	Oh, wow.
1736000	1737000	That was fun.
1737000	1740000	I worked on Star Trek in Darkness, that was the movie.
1740000	1742000	There's a Star Trek video game that I was on as well.
1742000	1744000	I play a whole bunch of parts.
1744000	1746000	Dota 2, I was Terrorblade.
1746000	1750000	Oh, that's a huge game, especially in Russia.
1750000	1752000	I think Dota 2 is gigantic.
1752000	1754000	It's very, very big in Asia, I've heard.
1754000	1755000	Yes.
1755000	1756000	It's an e-sport.
1756000	1758000	It is. It was one of those huge e-sports.
1758000	1760000	We were watching Heroes of the Storm.
1760000	1762000	I think somebody was playing Asmodan even.
1762000	1763000	Oh, cool.
1763000	1764000	Yeah, very cool.
1764000	1768000	There's a lot more dialogue in that game than he did in Diablo 3.
1768000	1769000	Really?
1769000	1772000	I would have thought he had a ton more in Diablo 3. Interesting.
1772000	1775000	There's more in Heroes of the Storm, and it's much more comedic, too.
1775000	1779000	Did you enjoy that, getting to put a more comedic edge on a character?
1779000	1782000	Oh, I always do, because I don't get to do that very often with my voice.
1782000	1783000	Yeah?
1783000	1786000	I always play the deep voice, like serious guys.
1786000	1791000	Do you find that you get typecast a little bit sometimes, maybe?
1791000	1793000	Oh, yeah, that's okay.
1793000	1801000	I used to play 12-year-old girls, but it wasn't really paying the bills, so I went into the deeper voice stuff.
1801000	1806000	I don't know. I think you'd make an amazing Powerpuff Girl, but I guess they already filled that.
1806000	1810000	I hope they're listening. I'd love that chance for that role.
1810000	1811000	Awesome.
1811000	1817000	Also joining us tonight on our panel, say hello, everybody, to Greg Berger joining us tonight.
1817000	1818000	How are you doing, Greg?
1818000	1820000	Howdy, howdy. Doing well. Thanks for having me.
1820000	1824000	Thanks for having me. I only go where I'm invited, so thanks for putting out the welcome mat.
1824000	1832000	You are most welcome. Hey, I know. I love Diablo 3 and Heroes myself, so obviously that was the first thing that came to mind with David.
1832000	1835000	And for you, I am a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series.
1835000	1839000	So when they told me that Jecht was going to be on the show, I was like, what? That's awesome.
1839000	1842000	Will somebody have to teach that kid to play Blitzball?
1842000	1845000	Oh, my gosh, that's amazing. I love it.
1846000	1855000	And then, okay, so then I told my co-host here at Dark Soccer, Jamie, I said, you gotta get familiar with Greg, take a look at the IMDB, take a look at the resume.
1855000	1856000	I might have squealed.
1856000	1860000	And she literally squealed. What was the one that you saw that got you to squeal, Jamie?
1860000	1861000	Grimlock.
1861000	1862000	Grimlock.
1862000	1863000	Me munch metal.
1865000	1866000	I love it.
1866000	1868000	You're not playing with your voice.
1869000	1875000	You don't know how many copies of Transformers the movie I have, including the Japanese laserdisc.
1877000	1891000	I've had the great good fortune at convention of being involved in some big screen screenings of the film with popcorn fights in the audience and people screaming and basically knowing the script, you know, by heart.
1893000	1895000	The Rocky Horror Transformers show.
1895000	1912000	I just have enjoyed every time I've seen it. One of them was with Flint Dilly, who was the story editor and one of the producers, and he actually had a stop motion option, which allowed him to tell some behind the scenes story as we watched. Phenomenal.
1912000	1920000	I mean, I remain extremely proud of it. I think it's a great story with lots of twists and turns and a really good movie about robots.
1920000	1921000	That's awesome.
1921000	1933000	I mean, Transformers was pretty much like the first real addiction to any animated series I had. I mean, as a kid, I was a kid in the 80s, and that was like every day for me.
1933000	1945000	I was introduced at a convention by a guy who said when this show was on in the morning, it's the reason I was late for school every day. When they moved to afternoons, it's the reason I always left before the end of my last period class.
1946000	1952000	I'm going to ask Dark Soccer to do some breathing techniques and calm down the fandom just a little bit. It's professional here.
1952000	1967000	But I do have to ask this because it is a video game podcast, and we always stay up on the gaming news. Greg, I don't know if you've probably haven't heard of this, but in Splatoon, the Nintendo title, they oftentimes do what they call Splatfest, where it's Team X versus Y.
1967000	1974000	For example, a few weeks ago, they had Team Cat versus Dog. They had, what was it, Team Roller Coaster versus Team Waterslide?
1974000	1976000	And there was Marshmallow and Hot Dog.
1976000	1982000	Yeah, something like that. Well, the upcoming one is actually the first tie-in with another property, and it's Transformers.
1982000	1983000	Cool.
1983000	1999000	So it's Team Autobots versus Team Decepticons. Now, I would think the answer to this is probably obvious, but you never know. So I'm going to ask, Greg, which team do you think you would be splatting in Splatoon for? Team Autobots or Team Decepticons?
1999000	2015000	Well, Long Haul is a Constructicon, so there's that. And he didn't join his outfit to be no dump truck, but he's a worthy adversary. But meet King! So I kind of got a pull for my team.
2015000	2016000	All right.
2016000	2021000	Now, if it's Autobots versus Marshmallows, I think that remains, that's pretty easy.
2021000	2028000	Well, there it is. It's settled, guys. I think I just ruined Splatfest and had the whole thing tilted in one direction there. All right. There we go.
2028000	2032000	Oh, I wouldn't have the slightest idea. I'm just speculating.
2032000	2037000	I think you should have, like, Greg Burger and David Funanabi. David, you were shockwave on Transformers Prime.
2037000	2043000	Yes, I was. I was also depth charge on Beast Wars, so I was on both sides.
2043000	2044000	Oh, jeez.
2044000	2045000	Oh, my God.
2045000	2052000	But he was, you know, depth charge was barely good. Just on the good side, just like 5%.
2052000	2061000	Love it. Well, again, thank you guys so much for joining us tonight. And if you guys have questions for our trio in the chat room, head on over to live.vognetwork.com.
2061000	2068000	We have some comments here in chat. Bonds006 says, I'm looking at the IMDB stats. The fandom is high tonight.
2068000	2078000	Let's see, another comment in chat here. Everyone in the OLR chat room just wetted themselves there at the Grimlock. Awesome.
2078000	2084000	Well, hey, let me ask this. So you guys are all voice actors, and I'm sure this, you know, kind of brings this first question to mind.
2084000	2091000	What made you decide this is the life for me? I want to get into voice acting. This is my calling. This is what I want to do.
2091000	2093000	Andrew, I'll start with you.
2093000	2099000	My thing is I've been trying to get more into voice acting. I've done a few things non-union.
2099000	2105000	It's funny, the more I do that, the more I get pulled into doing, like, casting and voice directing, more so casting than that.
2105000	2115000	But the reason I particularly liked voice acting or I like it and it's something I want to pursue is I studied theater in Florida and I studied theater out here.
2115000	2121000	And I just found it more freeing to be able to just get behind a microphone and embody a character.
2121000	2132000	I feel like it's a little bit, for me, less anxiety or some sort of stress, but it capitalizes on creativity because they don't really care that I'm 5'6".
2132000	2138000	It's like, oh, you're Frodo Baggins. You are not going to play an action hero. And it's like, yeah, yeah, I understand that.
2138000	2151000	You know, so I like the idea that if I can sound like a character, if what I'm saying is believable and what I bring to the table is what they, you know, want, then that's all they care about.
2151000	2156000	It doesn't matter what I look like. I could show up in, like, feedie pajamas and wear a T-Rex hat and they wouldn't care.
2156000	2160000	Casual Friday is every day in voice acting, right?
2161000	2166000	Love it. Greg, what about you? What made you decide that voice acting is for me?
2166000	2179000	Well, I can abbreviate the story and tell you the emphasis is more on the acting than the voice because when the character is three-dimensional and true, the voice goes wherever the rest of it carries.
2179000	2198000	I came to Los Angeles as an actor with a show. I actually have always pursued this as supplemental, but I was seen in a show that started in New York and I was in the L.A. company by someone notable who asked to say hello after the show.
2198000	2208000	He said if I was as versatile as what they had seen on stage, they should know about me for animation and without missing a beat, I said you've had my demo for several months now.
2208000	2214000	If you can move it from the bottom of the pile to the top of the pile, it's exactly what I'd love to be doing.
2214000	2223000	I've been smitten by it since my, you know, chin was on my fist on Saturday morning watching shows on the floor of the living room.
2224000	2252000	So I have a great loyalty to all of the greats and when I was seated next to Mel Blanc and in the room with Don Messick and June Ferre still, I'm working with my heroes and they may or may not be well-known names to other people, but to have been allowed in the course of my career to work with most if not all of my heroes is just jaw-dropping for me.
2252000	2263000	And you know what's so funny is like right as you're telling this story, SSG100Matt just posted a question in our chat, who is your idols or inspiration in voice acting and so it's so funny that you said that and then Dark Soccer, you know, June Ferre.
2263000	2264000	You named one of mine.
2264000	2271000	Yeah, I mean she's flawless, she's amazing and Mel Blanc's certainly like one of the just originals, so.
2271000	2283000	We actually, I don't know how many know, but in addition to Grimlock, I'm also Odie, Haridee, Alley Cat, Herman the Mailman and Squeak the Mouse on the Garfield show.
2283000	2296000	And June Ferre has over the past few seasons been an irregular regular, so she's dropped in with some frequency and you know, just to be able to call her a friend is fantastic for me.
2296000	2302000	I think we're all excited that we get to call Grimlock a friend now, having been on OLR.
2302000	2304000	Me no kisser!
2304000	2306000	Okay, fair enough, fair enough.
2306000	2311000	David, how about you? What made you decide voice acting, this is what I want to do?
2311000	2321000	Well I had studied acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and I was thinking I would be doing theater, I was thinking I would be doing on camera and I did a lot of theater, I did about 30 plays.
2322000	2332000	And while I was doing the plays, people were saying, I've got this great voice for villains, you should do these villains. And I kind of have a great face for radio, like a thug look to me.
2332000	2335000	I get the same thing, I get the same thing all the time, I hear you.
2335000	2347000	Yeah, so the parts I was being offered on camera were just not really that interesting. And it got way more interesting when I got into voice acting, so I stuck with it, they kept encouraging me with a paycheck.
2347000	2356000	And I also had a lot of fun along the way and it just became something I was trying out and became my life. That was about 20 years ago I started it.
2356000	2364000	I think you guys are all very fortunate to just be born with that type of voice, you know what I mean?
2364000	2370000	Because when you guys are talking, I'm like, I would just listen to a podcast with these guys, just talking.
2370000	2373000	I think we are listening to a podcast with these guys.
2373000	2376000	I think we are right now listening to a podcast with us talking.
2376000	2377000	Rob's going meta tonight.
2377000	2386000	Sadly, I only get you for 30 minutes, but I'm talking on the regular. Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom over at live.vogue.com says, just erase the rest of the show role and keep them on.
2386000	2389000	I'll keep them here as long as I can. I will.
2390000	2402000	Well, here's the deal. A distinctive voice can only help to serve you. However, if your acting chops are honed, and both David and I are teaching for Grey Knight Productions right now,
2402000	2414000	but if your acting chops are honed, you'll come up with something original, unique, and memorable if that's what you're suited for.
2414000	2423000	If I hadn't studied acting, I'd probably have about 5 credits on my IMDB instead of 100, because you have to be able to just go in 50 different directions.
2423000	2429000	I don't really have the type of voice, the type of comedic training that I think Greg has.
2429000	2441000	I think a lot of what I'm doing is variations on a theme, but it's really based on telling the story, living truthfully under these crazy given imaginary circumstances we have in animation and video games.
2441000	2451000	Often they'll throw the character in front of me and I'll make it up on the spot. I'm sure Greg's had to do that at times, too. I don't really have a lot of voices that I pull out of a hat.
2451000	2457000	If I may chime in, by the way, I completely agree with my mentors and the people I've studied with, and I completely agree.
2457000	2467000	A lot of the stuff that they talk about actually came into casting for me, because I found that the projects that I've worked on, I've had someone with a voice that I'm like,
2468000	2475000	I literally push my chair back. That's great, but then I don't believe a darn thing that they're saying.
2475000	2483000	I've had people that have the everyday approachable average voice, but their performance is so captivating that you feel for them.
2483000	2488000	That's what I think it's about, reaching out and finding a way to make your audience care about what you're saying.
2489000	2500000	So let's talk a little bit more, Andrew, about this Grey Knight productions that you have, because I know you are, since we're talking about having the voice but then learning how to refine the voice,
2500000	2509000	I know this is a big passion that you guys have, is that you're actually helping people learn how to more refine the voice and how to act and so forth.
2509000	2512000	So tell us a little bit about this school that you've set up, Andrew.
2512000	2520000	So I started Grey Knight as a means, because I've taken acting classes all throughout Los Angeles, and there's some predators out there who will take your money and go,
2520000	2522000	Ha ha ha, you're so good at acting.
2522000	2524000	Predators? In Hollywood? Get out!
2524000	2526000	No, they're all so honest and caring.
2526000	2537000	But no, I started my production company because I'm like, okay, well, I know some of the best people on the planet who do what they do, and I figured those are the best teachers.
2537000	2544000	Now, granted, just because someone's famous or does this and is in this project doesn't mean that they're qualified to teach.
2544000	2553000	A lot of people that I bring in, I've either studied with or they've gotten ridiculous references, or their background really supports their argument.
2553000	2563000	But yeah, so the goal is, you know, I work in casting, and I've discovered that a lot of people, especially with my generation, some of them don't have the substance.
2563000	2573000	They go, oh, that looks easy, and, you know, Greg and David can tell you the same thing, where it's like, they go, wow, you know, I do a great Donald Duck impression, or I do this really well.
2573000	2578000	And it's like, oh, that's nice. Can you act? And they're like, uh, uh, uh.
2578000	2587000	So the whole point of Grey Knight was just, it's to basically offer the highest quality classes, you know, in a premier environment.
2587000	2596000	I mean, like, we're using Formosa Interactive, and they did, like, God of War, and they worked on, like, Last of Us, and they worked on Carlson Riddick, and some of the stuff for Frozen.
2596000	2604000	So, you know, it's creating the best possible environment with the best teachers, and, you know, trying to make it competitive and fair so it doesn't kill a student's pocket.
2604000	2612000	I think that's a really good point, too, about the whole I can do an impression versus can you stay in that impression, because I know I can do a mean Miss Piggy.
2612000	2614000	It's all about you.
2614000	2616000	I can do a Miss Piggy.
2616000	2618000	You can't do a happy Miss Piggy?
2618000	2620000	Only a mean one.
2620000	2622000	You might need to do a happy one sometimes.
2622000	2626000	I can do a Miss Piggy, but I can't, like, you asked me to act, I would never be able to do it.
2626000	2632000	So, you know, I think I might need a class or seven to teach me how to get that better.
2632000	2640000	But this is, unfortunately, I know we're a global show, but you're mostly focused in the Los Angeles area, right?
2640000	2649000	For now, actually one of the things I'm trying to figure out or work out, I'm figuring out if I can do a phone patch or if I can do, ISDN is way too expensive.
2649000	2664000	But I'm trying to find a way to actually make it so that people can study if they're in, you know, like freaking New Zealand or Australia or London or whatever, and they can kind of tap in, you know, finding a way to make it so that people around the globe can actually take these classes.
2664000	2678000	And, you know, I'm currently trying to find a way to kind of just, you know, I guess the best way to put it is put up the resources and the materials so that people who really want to do this, this is a passion for them.
2678000	2687000	They can't live without it, you know, they're doing it because they enjoy it, not for the money, you know, that they have the ability to pursue it.
2687000	2695000	I don't think anyone's location should really necessarily limit them for their ability to educate themselves for what they want to do in their lives.
2695000	2701000	Well, excellent. I hope through, you know, web conferencing technologies or things like that, you guys are able to do that.
2701000	2712000	You know, I know we have the podcasting, but, you know, sometimes, you know, it's kind of difficult to set that up in like a school type format, but I think that would be great because actually Greg and David are two of the teachers, correct?
2712000	2720000	Yeah, no, they're amazing teachers and yeah, they're the ones who actually kind of justified me doing it.
2720000	2735000	Greg and David have been the staples for my education in the entertainment industry and really just nailed and drove home the whole acting element and I had brought this idea forward and I'm like,
2735000	2751000	Hey, Greg, David, I'm going to try to do this thing. Do you want to try to do it? Oh, yeah. Oh, no questions asked. I would love to teach. I would love to be able to do this. This is great. I love, you know, and I'm pretty sure that you guys have been approached by other people before, right?
2751000	2758000	I mean, it's just it's one of those things that's found on ethics. I like to think they like they're doing it because they like what I'm trying to do.
2758000	2769000	It definitely seems like the voice acting circle is a very tight knit, like little family I noticed because, you know, I see again, it seems like you guys are going to a lot of the same conventions and so forth.
2769000	2782000	And, you know, I know our pal Marissa here in Los Angeles was actually the one that got us all introduced. And, you know, she's she's talking about all these wonderful people she's meeting and networking with which shout out to Marissa hearts.
2783000	2785000	Yeah, Marissa Meisel.
2785000	2787000	Love that woman.
2787000	2789000	She's great.
2789000	2794000	So let me let me ask a couple more questions about video game voice acting and so forth.
2794000	2804000	Let me let me ask Greg and David, because you guys have such diverse resumes. You guys have done cartoons, movies, you know, screen capture and so forth.
2804000	2816000	What is what are the challenges that go into video game voice acting specifically as opposed to I'm going to be doing a cartoon or something like that? How are video games different?
2816000	2823000	Well, in a cartoon, quite often you have the entire cast. So it's like doing a radio play and you can work off of each other.
2823000	2832000	But I think I have about fifty five or sixty video games on my resume and I'm DB and only twice have we ever had more than one cast member in the room.
2832000	2839000	It's usually me by myself and any other dialogue that's happening. I either have to just have it in my head or the director might say it.
2839000	2842000	So it is a lot harder without other actors there.
2842000	2848000	I would think, too, the whole fact that the dialogue can branch in a video game, whereas, you know, with a cartoon, it's static.
2848000	2852000	But, you know, you kind of have to suddenly be like, OK, this is the good answer. This is the bad answer.
2852000	2856000	You know, I could I could see where that like just is is so easy.
2856000	2860000	It would it would not make it possible to have everybody in the same room, I would think, in some cases.
2860000	2865000	Well, I'm sorry. I'm just echoing everything David said up to this point.
2865000	2869000	And he and I did a game called Halo Wars to get Halo Wars together.
2869000	2873000	Oh, I think a few people have heard of that one. Halo Wars.
2873000	2877000	Yes, Halo Wars is it's pretty popular. That was one of the notable exceptions.
2877000	2881000	That's one of the two. We did it ensemble style.
2881000	2884000	I'm sure it was inconvenient from a production standpoint.
2884000	2888000	And part of the reason for that is actually understandable.
2888000	2898000	And that's because there are so many nearly infinite possibilities that the only way to really cover an actor is isolated in the booth.
2898000	2907000	It's much more difficult to cover that ground ensemble, although it's way more fun for actors to play with actors.
2907000	2919000	But the relationship in in games, which David was was pointing at, is is really more between the director and the actor, because you're kind of acting in a vacuum.
2919000	2930000	The director on the other side of the glass has to paint you in and out of scenes and help you find levels that are consistent with other people who may have recorded before you.
2930000	2934000	But you don't have the luxury of working directly opposite them.
2934000	2941000	Quite often they have a writer there as well, because on Guild Wars 2, for instance, I get called in to work on that fairly often.
2941000	2948000	And they will sometimes have three different studios going with milk crates full of scripts.
2948000	2952000	And we all have our own little section that they've they're very organized.
2952000	2958000	But I've seen in the one studio and imagine this is times three studios, you have three milk crates.
2958000	2970000	Each milk crate has maybe, I don't know, 4000 pages in it and a quart of milk and a little bit of cream cheese because it's delicious.
2970000	2976000	A little voice acting schmear. But no, they they'll take out the binder and take out your section and off you go.
2976000	2982000	And if there's one hundred and eighty thousand lines in a game, there's no way the director is going to have read all that.
2982000	2987000	So they often will have a producer and they'll have the writer there to help them.
2987000	2992000	Wow. I can I can only imagine like, well, and that's got to be like so much.
2992000	3003000	And this this leads into a great question from our chat room over at live.vognetware.com from SSJ100Matt saying that the various voice acting con panels he's gone to, he's heard it put stress on your voice after long sessions.
3003000	3011000	How long normally does it take for your voice to recover after a recording session or an entire voice acting project?
3011000	3020000	Let me ask Greg something here. Does your agent generally limit you to two hours of screaming or do you sometimes get the four hours of screaming from video games?
3020000	3027000	The effort is always to confine the I mean, if it's a war game or if it's a extreme stress.
3027000	3039000	First, I believe they have to include that language so that there's an option of whether or not you're strong enough, vocally strong enough to withstand that kind of stress.
3039000	3045000	Because when you say yes to an engagement, you better bring one hundred and fifty percent of your abilities with you.
3045000	3050000	That's no time to find out that you've overreached your grasp.
3050000	3066000	But yes, efforts are made on on behalf of clients to confine those high, high intensity and stress sections of a game to a two hour period rather than a full four hour session.
3067000	3073000	Although if you're doing, it's not a video game, but if you're doing a feature film, the language is a bit different in that contract.
3073000	3082000	I've been in situations where I was in a group situation with say about ten voices and we'd be there seven, eight hours.
3082000	3088000	And it sounds like, oh, well, hey, I work forty hours a week. What's the big deal?
3088000	3097000	You know, everyone out there saying that. But when you're screaming at the top of your lungs for four hours, that's pretty much all they're going to get.
3097000	3101000	You're not going to be able to do it. You asked about recovery. Oftentimes I'll take a day off.
3101000	3109000	I will schedule, if I can, the video games on the times of the week when I know I have an extra day afterwards before I have to do anything else.
3110000	3115000	And there is no single answer to recovery time because it differs by different talents.
3115000	3123000	But it also there's no way of knowing how consistently torturous a session is going to be.
3123000	3130000	But as a rule, most of them, especially if they're combat oriented, are going to be stressful.
3130000	3137000	Now, we don't get the scripts in advance for video games. For the most part, we're just walking in cold and we might have six hundred lines.
3137000	3143000	That's a long session. But say we have four hundred lines to do in four hours and we will have never seen that before.
3143000	3149000	So there's, I think, an additional vocal stress in just having to come up with characterizations in the moment.
3149000	3152000	Sometimes you've done them before, but oftentimes you haven't.
3152000	3157000	You can do up to three voices in a session and sometimes they have you do more and pay you a bit more.
3157000	3161000	You know, I bet these are things that most gamers never even think about when they're playing the game.
3161000	3167000	Is that, you know, there's all that energy that goes into all those screams and everything else that you're doing in the game.
3167000	3172000	And the fact that because there is such an air of secrecy around video games,
3172000	3177000	like I'm sure you guys have plenty more projects in the works you can't talk about because there's all that secrecy that goes into it.
3177000	3184000	And so you have to go into it cold because, heaven forbid, the script for something like Mass Effect Andromeda or Halo 5 or something leaks.
3184000	3187000	You know, it's going to be huge. Jamie, you want to jump in here with something?
3187000	3195000	I was just thinking that it would probably require the same sort of control like with modulation that goes into singing,
3195000	3202000	especially diaphragm control, controlling your breath, keeping your voice at a particular level.
3202000	3210000	And I've had a friend of mine who halfway through her master's program as an opera singer had to have vocal surgery for overtaxing yourself.
3210000	3211000	Not pretty.
3211000	3214000	Yeah. And so you guys...
3214000	3216000	That's like a football player getting a leg injury.
3216000	3222000	Or if you want to look at more pop culture, Chris Cornell, when he had three surgeries on his mostly singer of Soundgarden.
3222000	3228000	And his voice has never been the same ever since. So, I mean, you guys totally get props from me.
3228000	3237000	Well, like any other artist, you want to acquire whatever mastery you can over whatever instrument it is you're playing, even if it's your own voice.
3237000	3247000	But speaking for myself, I believe that in these sessions, by bringing your A-game every time, by not holding back,
3247000	3250000	you don't go out of your way to damage yourself, obviously.
3250000	3259000	But holding back can make every session take twice as long because it's not translating as true.
3259000	3262000	If you hold back, it sounds held back.
3262000	3272000	So there's just a sweet spot, just like a tennis racket, that you look for that strength for yourself.
3272000	3276000	It's something you learn just through repetition and skill building.
3276000	3285000	And if you're skilled enough and they trust you and you're screaming like crazy, they will sometimes allow you to just do one take and they'll take it.
3285000	3292000	And you're able to come up with a good enough performance that you don't ruin your voice by having to do three or four takes of every line.
3292000	3294000	That's pretty awesome.
3294000	3298000	Wow. This has been so informative. And I'm sad that our time is running out tonight.
3298000	3310000	But if our listeners want to keep in touch with you guys, I want to make sure you guys have a chance to amply plug your Twitter and your websites and what have you so that folks can follow you.
3310000	3312000	So let me just go down the line here.
3312000	3317000	David, do you have a place that people can follow you and find out more information and hear more from you later?
3317000	3325000	I'm at Twitter, at Volo Boss. It's my last name backwards. V-O-L-O-B-O-S. And that's kind of my only social media right now.
3325000	3328000	There's a lot of them. Sometimes you have to focus on one or two.
3328000	3329000	Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now.
3329000	3331000	There's too many. I understand. Greg, how about you?
3331000	3348000	Best is Facebook slash my name G-R-E-G-G-B-E-R-G-E-R at Greg Burger on Twitter and coming soon to a, I don't know, Pinkberry near you. I don't know.
3348000	3349000	Ooh, that's our favorite.
3349000	3351000	Pinkberry.
3351000	3355000	I think we're on the first name basis of the Pinkberry Twitter.
3355000	3368000	No, but hopefully coming soon to a convention near you. And I really love the convention vibe. I love the opportunity to say thank you to the people who are kind enough to come and say thank you to us.
3368000	3374000	Albeit WasabiCon in Florida, October 31st and November 1st.
3374000	3378000	Greg, any upcoming appearances for you convention-wise?
3379000	3396000	TFCon, Charlotte, October 16th through 18th. There's some other things in the pipeline, but boy that NDA, those are the three letters we live with daily. And it's all, things are not disclosed until it's time to disclose them.
3396000	3404000	Well, when they are disclosed after E3 or Game Awards or whatever, they're going to announce it out. We'll have to have you guys back to talk about it.
3404000	3410000	Andrew, I want to make sure you can plug your website as well. And please, one more time, the acting classes.
3411000	3420000	Oh yeah, so my website is greenightproductions.com and you can follow me on Twitter and talk to me. I'm pretty responsive to people.
3420000	3430000	At AJjones828. But yeah, the classes, I'm trying to actually schedule a four-week class with David and Greg in the next couple of months.
3430000	3442000	So, I mean, I always put stuff up. So yeah, just let me know. Message me if you have a question. And that's another thing too. I feel a lot of people are very, that would be my phone freaking out.
3442000	3446000	Sorry you guys are fast at following on Twitter.
3446000	3453000	Oh my god, that was me following you on Twitter that said off your phone? Wow. That's amazing.
3453000	3463000	My phone is amazing. No, it's, you know, I feel a lot of people get a little bit wow or a little bit shy about stuff because they think, oh, it's, you know, it's Greg Burger and David Sobolov.
3463000	3470000	And it's like, no, I mean, they're amazing teachers and, you know, I'm open to questions and so are they.
3470000	3478000	Oh, I am announced at a G.I. Joe, original G.I. Joe panel at Long Beach Comic Con September 12th, I believe.
3478000	3489000	Another favorite. I know we could just, we could just spend hours and hours talking to these guys about all these various roles and impacts they've had on our favorite games and cartoons from way back.
3489000	3496000	But I got it. They got it. They got a busy night ahead. I got to let them go. Thank you so much for taking the time out to be on our show tonight. I really appreciate it, you guys.
3496000	3502000	And best of luck with not only the classes, but all your future projects that you can't talk about yet.
3503000	3505000	Thank you. Thank you for having us.
3505000	3508000	You are most welcome, guys. Take care.
3508000	3509000	Take care.
3509000	3510000	All right.
3510000	3511000	Cheers. Bye.
3511000	3519000	Good one. That was Andrew Jones, Greg Burger, David Sobolov. Some fantastic voice acting talent there on the program.
3519000	3526000	Dark Soccer, you were covering OK from fangirling over there? No, that was awesome. That was awesome.
3526000	3528000	I have happiness.
3529000	3537000	I wish, you know, sadly, I was not born with the deep voice that those guys like David has.
3537000	3544000	But, you know, it is what it is. And I think those guys are extremely talented at what they do.
3544000	3550000	And that was great to hear even those little little excerpts of some of their characters here. Alan, what do you think of all that?
3550000	3551000	It was great.
3551000	3555000	Yeah, we get some great guests here on Orange Lounge Radio. We're so happy. So happy.
3555000	3561000	Hey, if you want to, if you think you have an idea for a guest here for Orange Lounge Radio.
3561000	3564000	Because like I said, Marissa got us and hooked us up and got us in touch.
3564000	3568000	Please feel free to reach out to me anytime. robatvognetwork.com
3568000	3573000	If you want to get in touch and get somebody booked here on the show.
3573000	3578000	ActDeftInChat saying, it's always great to hear voice actors. I agree.
3578000	3583000	SG100Matt says, everyone follow him, break his phone. Good plan. Good plan.
3583000	3591000	And Bobby Black Wolf saying VOG has the best interviews. You know, we're pretty, I try to be humble, but we're pretty darn good.
3591000	3595000	You should have asked me for some interview questions because I had some stuff I could ask them.
3595000	3597000	Oh no, I didn't know you were, you should have thrown something at me.
3597000	3601000	No, I wasn't waving at you. You had it all planned out.
3601000	3606000	Actually, I improved most of that. With the help of the chatters.
3606000	3609000	Rob reached into his underwear and pulled out. No.
3609000	3612000	But I only had 30 minutes, so I had to make the best of the time I had.
3612000	3614000	What would you have asked out of curiosity?
3614000	3620000	If anything jumped out at them where a video game script, especially for the Final Fantasy ones,
3620000	3624000	where the word salad was so bad that they had no problem saying it,
3624000	3631000	but they had to turn to the producer and be like, life ether, what the fuck am I saying?
3631000	3632000	Because I know that's come up.
3632000	3637000	If any of them are still listening, tweet me the answer at OLR, let me know.
3637000	3639000	What do you do about that word salad? That's right.
3639000	3641000	Some video games that have some weird-
3641000	3646000	LeCie, Falsie, Seif, like 13 is awful with that stuff.
3646000	3652000	I just totally want to like find a way to contact Gideon Emery and ask him,
3652000	3658000	okay, do you just crack up every time you say anything as Urianger in 13?
3658000	3659000	Oh yeah.
3659000	3664000	And I love him because he's like all of my favorite BioWare people, practically.
3664000	3670000	But I have to fast forward every time because I can't get over the really bad language.
3670000	3671000	Well, that's just how-
3671000	3673000	That's how the character's written.
3673000	3683000	It's how it's written, but he has to read those pretentious, overly, anon, forthwith, thou, hence-
3683000	3686000	And on top of that, it's grammatically incorrect.
3686000	3687000	Yeah, it's butchered.
3687000	3695000	It's very, oh my god. So anyway, but as like I was saying though, I was a music major for a short while,
3695000	3701000	which is how I met my poor friend who ended up getting vocal surgery halfway through her masters.
3701000	3708000	And I have nothing but mad respect for people who use their voice as their instrument.
3708000	3714000	I mean, your body using that as an instrument for what you do.
3714000	3720000	I've pulled my diaphragm before playing the bass when I played Contralto Clarinet.
3720000	3729000	Any abuse that you put your body through and still get up the next day and do it, mad respect.
3729000	3733000	I think there's always a part of me that thinks, Rob, you really should have done a cartoon character.
3733000	3734000	You really should have gotten into some of that stuff.
3734000	3738000	And I think there's still a part of me to this day that says that, but I really like doing this radio stuff too.
3738000	3740000	It's an awful lot of fun doing the podcasting.
3741000	3747000	I was surprised that one of them had said that for the cartoons, they get to do the ensemble recordings
3747000	3754000	because when Ayesha Tyler had Adam Reed on talking about Archer on her podcast,
3754000	3758000	that show is exclusively separate, each person.
3758000	3762000	That is all spliced together using software and basically the direction that they get.
3762000	3763000	It might just depend on who.
3763000	3768000	Because Ayesha Tyler and H. John Benjamin have a million gigs going on at once.
3768000	3770000	That might be part of it too.
3770000	3774000	So I think that show in particular is probably maybe a bad example.
3774000	3778000	But yeah, I believe that show is almost entirely done piecemeal.
3778000	3780000	Yeah, and Marissa is saving the day.
3780000	3782000	You're asking all these voice acting questions.
3782000	3784000	Marissa is saving the day in our chat room over at live.vogue.com.
3784000	3788000	Marissa is saying studios collect clips of when actors lose it.
3788000	3790000	That's because that cast has so many working actors.
3790000	3794000	Yeah, that is probably a really bad example.
3795000	3800000	All right, well, again, we want to thank Andrew, David, and Greg for joining us tonight.
3800000	3802000	That was a great interview.
3802000	3807000	And the cool thing is, thanks to kind of getting in with those guys and so forth,
3807000	3810000	I'm getting connected with more and more voice actors.
3810000	3815000	So look forward to bringing some more on Orange Launch Radio in the coming months.
3815000	3817000	I'm hoping to meet up with one at Dragon Con.
3817000	3822000	You know, I have like, as far as anything that goes into the production of video games,
3822000	3826000	and I'm just going to actually single it back to video games.
3826000	3831000	My heart, I think, and I appreciate the things that everyone does,
3831000	3838000	but my heart goes to concept art, manual production, and voice actors,
3838000	3840000	and manual production is dying.
3840000	3843000	All right, well, let's move on.
3843000	3845000	We're still at 7.09.
3845000	3848000	We're now we're into the show, and we still haven't even touched a news story yet,
3848000	3851000	but you know what, well worth it for that interview, well worth it.
3851000	3856000	I just want to quickly get into my gaming week because I had to take a quick detour.
3856000	3859000	So I've played a lot of the similar stuff that I've talked about in previous weeks.
3859000	3862000	Still trying to make progress on Gauntlet on the PlayStation 4,
3862000	3865000	which I've surpassed what I did on the PC and gotten a little further.
3865000	3867000	So that was pretty cool.
3867000	3871000	I also was playing a little more of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture,
3871000	3874000	which I talked about in more detail last week, so I'll kind of leave my review there.
3874000	3877000	But I was chasing some trophies in the game last week.
3877000	3879000	Just a couple quick new games I want to mention.
3879000	3883000	On the PlayStation 4, well, this is an old game in new clothing,
3883000	3888000	but they actually have this growing library of what they call arcade archives
3888000	3890000	available on the PlayStation 4.
3890000	3893000	I believe the price to be a little pricey.
3893000	3897000	They won $8 a game, and they have things in the collection like Gradius,
3897000	3901000	but the one I decided to finally pick up this week was Bomb Jack,
3901000	3904000	which had just come out just in this past week, I believe.
3904000	3908000	And Bomb Jack was a game that I remember from the Commodore 64,
3908000	3910000	and I believe there was a version of it on the NES as well.
3910000	3912000	I think Mighty Bomb Jack was on the NES.
3912000	3914000	So I have fond memories of the game, so I decided,
3914000	3916000	what the hell, I'm going to pick up the game.
3916000	3922000	And, you know, it's an 80s arcade game being emulated on the PlayStation 4.
3922000	3924000	Pretty hard to mess that up.
3924000	3929000	But one of the things I like is that they have a lot of options,
3929000	3932000	so you can do all these different ratios in the game.
3932000	3935000	You can flip the screen 90 degrees.
3935000	3938000	So, you know, for emulation of an 80s arcade game,
3938000	3940000	you know, because not every, you know,
3940000	3942000	when you go to like Virtual Console on NES,
3942000	3945000	you don't always see all these options available.
3945000	3946000	What did I say on the NES?
3946000	3948000	When you're doing NES Virtual Console on the Wii U,
3948000	3950000	you don't always see all these options.
3950000	3952000	So it was pretty neat to have all that.
3952000	3956000	But one thing that cracked me up about Bomb Jack was that the trophies are a joke.
3956000	3960000	I got every trophy, I think there's like five bronze and two gold,
3960000	3962000	in ten minutes in that game without even trying.
3962000	3964000	Because the trophies are things like...
3964000	3966000	You started a game, you scored a point.
3966000	3970000	You access the options menu, submit your high score online.
3970000	3973000	Like seriously, you read the manual.
3973000	3976000	Like, the trophies are a joke.
3976000	3980000	But I'm pretty sure that's because the easiest way for them to do the trophies
3980000	3984000	was to program them all into the shell, the emulator shell.
3984000	3988000	And so therefore, none of the trophies have anything to do with the game itself.
3988000	3990000	Like the score you get in the game.
3990000	3995000	But yet, the shell knows enough to extract your high score from the game
3995000	3997000	and put it on an online leaderboard.
3997000	4000000	So you would think there would be some trophies that are like,
4000000	4002000	get a hundred thousand points, get five hundred thousand points.
4002000	4003000	You know, things like that.
4003000	4005000	So I was a little surprised at that.
4005000	4008000	So that would be my only little complaint.
4008000	4011000	I mean, the trophies are a real gimme.
4011000	4013000	And that's kind of a minor.
4013000	4014000	Because, you know, who really cares?
4014000	4016000	There's not a lot of people that super care about trophies.
4016000	4017000	Some do, don't get me wrong.
4017000	4020000	If you're a trophy whore, these are the easiest trophies you'll ever get
4020000	4022000	in these arcade collections.
4022000	4026000	But if you're not, you're probably going to laugh at how easy most of them unlock.
4026000	4030000	Just go into every menu option you have and you'll get, like, all these trophies.
4030000	4031000	It's pretty funny.
4031000	4034000	So that is Bomb Jack.
4034000	4037000	And then otherwise, I want to talk about one other quick game.
4037000	4042000	This is actually a game that is on the phone.
4042000	4045000	And I don't talk about a lot of phone-based games.
4045000	4047000	But it's a brand new one that came out this week.
4047000	4050000	It's called Pac-Man 256.
4050000	4053000	Pac-Man 256 is, of course, a Pac-Man game.
4053000	4055000	I think we've talked about it previously on the show.
4055000	4057000	It was one that was in development.
4057000	4060000	They've taken the concept of an endless runner,
4060000	4064000	like Temple Run, Jetpack Joyride, those sorts of games,
4064000	4066000	and applied it to Pac-Man.
4066000	4069000	And they call it Pac-Man 256 because,
4069000	4072000	you remember how on the 256 board on Pac-Man,
4072000	4074000	half of it glitches out and it renders the game unplayable, right?
4074000	4076000	It's the kill screen version.
4076000	4077000	Yes, exactly.
4077000	4080000	So what they do, instead of it being a left and right thing,
4080000	4084000	they have a glitch at the bottom when you play Pac-Man 256,
4084000	4087000	and the glitching slowly moves up the screen.
4087000	4091000	And the maze is an endless maze vertically.
4091000	4094000	So you're basically forever chomping away vertically
4094000	4098000	to try and escape the glitching that's happening at the bottom of the screen.
4098000	4101000	And they put a bunch of other twists on it too.
4101000	4104000	For example, you have these little power-ups,
4104000	4106000	like lasers and bombs and things like that,
4106000	4109000	that'll help you in taking out the ghosts.
4109000	4111000	But that's where the free-to-play mechanic comes in as well,
4111000	4114000	is that you use coins to get these power-ups,
4114000	4116000	and you can collect them slowly, or...
4116000	4117000	Pay $3.99.
4117000	4118000	Exactly.
4118000	4122000	Or watch a movie, watch a 30-second ad to get some.
4122000	4124000	But you know what, all things considered for a free-to-play game,
4124000	4126000	it's pretty well constructed.
4126000	4130000	So I've got to say, I've played some pretty shitty free-to-play games.
4130000	4134000	I'm always going to say that Act of Time battle, or whatever the square one was.
4134000	4136000	The Soul Calibur one.
4136000	4138000	Oh god, the Soul Calibur game.
4138000	4140000	I'm like, oh, I blocked that from my memory.
4140000	4142000	Why are you doing that to me?
4142000	4144000	So as far as free-to-play games go...
4144000	4145000	I could bring up something worse.
4145000	4147000	I like Pac-Man 256. What?
4147000	4148000	Yaris.
4150000	4152000	Repressed memory. Why did you do that?
4152000	4155000	So anyway, Pac-Man 256, you know, it's free.
4155000	4157000	And I think it's a cool little game on the phone.
4157000	4159000	I would check that out if you haven't seen that yet.
4159000	4161000	So there you go.
4161000	4164000	Alright, that is it for our gaming weeks.
4164000	4165000	I'm reading our chat room.
4165000	4167000	Bonds006 in chat says,
4167000	4169000	I love when I get lazy trophies.
4169000	4171000	You found ammo, food, new player.
4171000	4173000	Yeah, it's even easier than that.
4173000	4178000	And we do have a link, by the way, to greynightproductions.com in our chat room.
4178000	4182000	Oh, I noticed that it looks like Andrew actually joined us there in chat.
4182000	4183000	Hello!
4183000	4184000	Welcome to the chat room.
4184000	4186000	If you guys want to keep asking some questions,
4186000	4189000	maybe he'll be good enough to answer there in the chat room.
4189000	4192000	Before we get into gaming news, some real quick housekeeping.
4192000	4195000	Of course, follow us on Twitter at OLR.
4195000	4196000	We're also on Facebook.
4196000	4200000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
4200000	4204000	As far as upcoming shows go, we will not be here in two weeks.
4204000	4206000	There will be no show in two weeks,
4206000	4210000	because I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta.
4210000	4211000	It's also Labor Day weekend,
4211000	4216000	so many of you guys here in the States are off on travel and so forth.
4216000	4219000	Those around the world who don't have Labor Day, sorry,
4219000	4222000	but it's a week when a lot of people are going to be away
4222000	4224000	if your favorite show tapes on the weekend.
4224000	4226000	I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con,
4226000	4230000	Bobby Blackwell and I participating in a couple of panels.
4230000	4234000	Actually, the Dragon Con app is out and now updated,
4234000	4236000	so if you are attending Dragon Con,
4236000	4237000	you should check out the Dragon Con app,
4237000	4241000	and you're going to want to mark the podcasting past, present,
4241000	4244000	and future panel is the one that I will be attending,
4244000	4248000	and that is on, I believe, Sunday at 1 p.m.
4248000	4252000	That's going to be fun to chat on, because we've been doing OLR for,
4252000	4255000	I lost count, 13 years, right?
4255000	4257000	We've been doing Orange Lounge Radio for 13 years,
4257000	4263000	so I think I'm there to talk about the past before it was in iTunes and so forth.
4263000	4266000	Bobby is going to be doing a panel, I believe it's about community.
4266000	4271000	Podcasting community, you can check that out Monday at 10 a.m.
4271000	4275000	I was trying to pull up my own schedule, but it's updating right now on my phone.
4275000	4278000	And I must say, I actually am not going to be on the show next Sunday.
4278000	4279000	You're not?
4279000	4281000	Because you know who I'm going to get to meet.
4281000	4282000	How dare you?
4282000	4284000	Oh, is that next week?
4284000	4285000	That's next week.
4285000	4286000	Who are you meeting next week?
4286000	4287000	Weird Al.
4287000	4288000	You should get a bumper.
4288000	4289000	I wish.
4289000	4293000	We've got backstage passes and meet and greet tickets to see Weird Al.
4293000	4296000	This is the day before my 10-year wedding anniversary.
4296000	4297000	Ah.
4297000	4301000	So, screw you guys, I'm going to see Weird Al.
4301000	4303000	That's fair, I understand.
4303000	4306000	You know, we sponsored a convention in Atlanta,
4306000	4312000	and Bobby actually left said convention that we paid money to be at
4312000	4314000	to go see a Weird Al concert.
4314000	4320000	So, this is not the first time that Weird Al has completely interrupted something.
4320000	4322000	Bobby is a wise, wise man.
4322000	4327000	And I just interrupted you in something related to Weird Al.
4327000	4331000	And now you're going to drink from the fire hose.
4331000	4333000	That wasn't Weird Al that said that, though.
4333000	4335000	What's his face that was...
4335000	4336000	Seinfeld.
4336000	4338000	Yeah, that show I don't watch.
4338000	4340000	The guy that then went, kind of bonkers.
4340000	4344000	Wheel of Fish.
4344000	4346000	All right, let's get into it.
4346000	4348000	We could talk about Weird Al all night, but we're not.
4348000	4349000	It's not a Weird Al podcast.
4349000	4350000	It's a gaming podcast.
4350000	4352000	So, let's get into some gamer news.
4352000	4354000	Alan, start us off, please.
4354000	4358000	Nintendo is dropping the price of the 2DS starting August 30th.
4358000	4363000	It's going from, I believe, $129.99 down to $99.99.
4363000	4367000	So, $100 will get you a 2DS.
4367000	4369000	And they are now...
4369000	4376000	The core 2DS package will come with a download code for Mario Kart 7.
4376000	4379000	So, that is just standard now.
4379000	4381000	Some caveats about the 2DS.
4381000	4386000	The screen size is not as big as a standard XL 3DS.
4386000	4392000	The slider and ability to view the 3DS with the two screens that overlay is removed entirely.
4392000	4395000	Because it's technically meant for little kids.
4395000	4398000	And that's obviously why it's called the 2DS.
4398000	4400000	So, the 3D ability has been removed.
4400000	4401000	I know adults that use it, too.
4401000	4406000	Yeah, a lot of people that originally liked the 3DS play with it off.
4406000	4410000	Just because I think for some games, like I think Pokémon X and Y,
4410000	4414000	the battles have a slightly higher frame rate if you just turn it off entirely.
4414000	4415000	And I think a lot of other games are like that.
4415000	4417000	A lot of Pokémon don't even do the 3D.
4417000	4419000	I get motion sick from the 3D.
4419000	4424000	And honestly, like in Final Fantasy Theatrhythm, the 3D is distracting.
4424000	4425000	I have to turn it off.
4425000	4430000	Yeah, so if you're like, eh, it was nice, but I don't need it, then that's for you.
4430000	4438000	Also, again, if a game requires the new 3DS, because certain games require
4438000	4443000	whatever new chipset is in the new 3DS, you cannot play that on a 2DS.
4443000	4446000	Because it's a 2DS and not a new 3DS.
4446000	4452000	So, yeah, that's yay for affordable consoles.
4452000	4456000	3DS is still, you know, the DS platform is still dominating the portable market.
4456000	4460000	I'm going to be a little bit tinfoil-hatish here, and I apologize,
4460000	4465000	but do you think they could be dropping the price because they're trying to offload these
4465000	4469000	because there could be a successor on the way relatively soon?
4469000	4473000	Well, whenever I do the gaming predictions for the new year,
4473000	4478000	I always say Nintendo is going to come out with yet another SKU for the DS.
4478000	4485000	So there's going to be the 2DS plus Omega they have to clear shelf space for.
4485000	4487000	I don't know.
4487000	4491000	Alright. Well, also in Nintendo's camp this week, a lot of people talking about
4491000	4495000	a patent application that has been, you know, we get a lot of gaming secrets
4495000	4498000	out of patent applications, but sometimes it doesn't mean anything.
4498000	4502000	Sometimes companies file these patents that maybe they're thinking about doing something
4502000	4505000	and they don't end up doing it, or they just want to have those legal protections
4505000	4509000	or what have you. So this week, a lot of people with raised eyebrows at the fact
4509000	4516000	that Nintendo has filed a patent for a stationary game console without an optical disk drive.
4516000	4518000	Here's an excerpt from this patent.
4518000	4523000	An example system includes an internal hard disk drive storing a program and or data,
4523000	4527000	a communication unit transmitting or receiving a program and or data via a network,
4527000	4533000	and a processor executing a program stored in the hard disk drive to perform game processing.
4533000	4539000	The example system is not provided with an optical disk drive for reading out a program
4539000	4541000	and or data from an optical disk.
4541000	4550000	So this has a lot of people jumping to conclusions that possibly Nintendo's next console
4550000	4552000	may not have a disk drive.
4552000	4559000	Now you may remember, Microsoft got in a lot of poopy water when they announced that
4559000	4564000	Xbox One was going to have all these locks on it and it was essentially going to be digital only.
4564000	4566000	You remember the whole thing about DRM and so forth.
4566000	4572000	Well, if you're not going to have a disk drive on a console, one would assume this means
4572000	4577000	that they're going to a digital only type of system.
4577000	4582000	Well now granted, it would be the only digital only system to have ever existed.
4582000	4587000	I believe that Ouya was a digital only system.
4587000	4590000	Correct? Maybe you could put a USB thing in there and read it that way,
4590000	4593000	but there was no disks in the traditional sense.
4593000	4599000	The Ouya was also only $99 and has recently been sold, as we talked about a couple weeks ago.
4599000	4606000	I'm not sure how gamers would react to a Nintendo console with no disk drive.
4606000	4613000	I think again, there is a certain type of equity that comes in with having a large gaming library
4613000	4616000	because you can sell those games back and so forth.
4616000	4619000	But if Nintendo is about to unveil their new console and say,
4619000	4624000	well, there's not going to be any disks, so you're not going to be able to buy, sell, trade and all that stuff,
4624000	4628000	but all our games are now only going to be 20 bucks.
4628000	4634000	Well, that might be, that might, I don't know, I doubt they'd go that low,
4634000	4639000	but even if they were to say 30 bucks, I don't know, that might make some people think twice.
4639000	4642000	Again, we're hugely jumping to conclusions with this.
4642000	4648000	We can't assume anything is going to happen until we hear it from Nintendo themselves,
4648000	4653000	but a lot of people speculating what could be happening with this whole NX thing.
4653000	4657000	SSG100Matt in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying,
4657000	4661000	I would be worried about this. This is a huge step in the technical direction,
4661000	4666000	and if Nintendo doesn't pull it off right, then it won't go well for them.
4666000	4670000	Bonds006 says, I think Nintendo can go diskless and get away with it.
4670000	4677000	I kind of think they can too, because Nintendo also has a very rabid fan base,
4677000	4683000	where Microsoft, they have a fan base too, but they have just as many detractors as they do fans.
4683000	4686000	I'm not sure Nintendo has that same ratio, honestly.
4686000	4688000	I mean, there's always going to be Nintendo detractors.
4688000	4691000	There's always going to be haters. You're always going to have a hater somewhere,
4691000	4694000	but I just think the ratio is, is different.
4694000	4695000	DarkSaga?
4695000	4698000	I'm just going back to the no disk thought.
4698000	4703000	Nintendo has always been one for wanting to control, though, their format.
4703000	4708000	You know, hence, they had the, they stuck cartridge for so long,
4708000	4714000	and then moved on to their own proprietary disk format,
4714000	4723000	and I think, honestly, going digital is the best way to control their, I mean,
4723000	4727000	then again, I think the other part was it too, is that people would have to pay them for the,
4727000	4731000	the media as well, because it was their proprietary,
4731000	4736000	but still, it just reeks back to having that controllable aspect of it, you know.
4736000	4739000	Well, you know, not everybody sees this as such a bad thing.
4739000	4742000	Grayknight is in our chat room and says, I'd love to have no more disks.
4742000	4744000	GameStop needs to go away.
4744000	4747000	Brad from PodCulture responds directly to that comment saying,
4747000	4752000	only problem, disk space and bandwidth. Games are so huge these days.
4752000	4757000	Well, you know, I think the bandwidth problem, by the time Nintendo puts out their next console,
4757000	4761000	which, you know, even a year from now, I think a lot of that is going to resolve itself out.
4761000	4764000	I'm not as worried about that, but then I also think about, well,
4764000	4767000	DarkStalker just started opening the show talking about the vault and her collection,
4767000	4772000	and to hear that those tangible things might be going away is kind of, it's sad in a way.
4772000	4778000	I don't have the same attachment I do to media today as I do for the older media.
4778000	4785000	I mean, yeah, it's one thing to bust out the Super Nintendo and plug in Chrono Trigger,
4785000	4792000	and go, Chrono Trigger, and then look at my copy of Chrono Trigger on disk and go,
4792000	4796000	do I want to play this one? No, I'd rather play the cartridge.
4796000	4801000	You know, it's the same thing. I don't mind digital content.
4801000	4807000	I mean, every last game I've bought now in the last, actually, I take that back.
4807000	4812000	We've bought two games that were on disk, and they were when we got our PS4.
4812000	4818000	We got Batman, which came with it, and we got Puyo Puyo Tetris.
4818000	4821000	Dungeon Buster in our chat, one more comment here, says,
4821000	4826000	Arguably, though, we've slowly been moving in that direction with more and more games being available for direct download.
4826000	4830000	So if Nintendo's leaping to conclusions with their new console, that's a big bet.
4830000	4833000	Well, you know, and to be fair to the prior comment from Grey Knight, too,
4833000	4837000	is that, you know, if you look at, like, phones, iPhones or Android,
4837000	4840000	you don't put in cartridges in those things right now. It's all digital.
4840000	4842000	That's the digital world we live in.
4842000	4848000	But it's also, you pay 99 cents, or free, or, you know, you know what I mean?
4848000	4855000	Like, it's a lot less, there's very, very few games that can get away with charging $15
4855000	4860000	as an iPhone or Android download, and the only ones that can are usually what?
4860000	4864000	Square Enix games. That's about it. They actually get away with doing that. Anyway.
4864000	4867000	Well, there's something else, actually, that occurred to me.
4867000	4875000	In our big, you know, relocation of the vault back to the house, we found our boxes of laser discs.
4875000	4883000	And Dan and I were having a conversation about, I wonder how many of our discs have succumbed to disc ride.
4883000	4885000	Ooh.
4885000	4892000	And I haven't, I know that video CDs can also have that layer separation.
4892000	4893000	Mm-hmm.
4893000	4902000	And be subjected to the same thing. But I'm wondering, though, for CD, DVD, Blu-ray media,
4902000	4908000	if they have the same susceptibility to layer separation, disc rot.
4908000	4913000	I mean, disc rot is really just another term for the layer separation on the discs.
4913000	4919000	But they don't have the sustainability, I think, that our old cartridge-based media does.
4919000	4925000	So, and this is actually more in a response to Bobby saying,
4925000	4928000	in 30 years, people our age will wax politically about their old Halo discs.
4928000	4934000	Their old Halo discs may not even be functional, if you consider that aspect of it.
4934000	4940000	And I will scream fury if our Tron box set is no longer playable.
4940000	4946000	I will cry bitter, bitter, bitter, slightly manly tears.
4946000	4949000	Tears, tears don't have a gender.
4949000	4958000	They will be angry. They will be, my tears, if my tears had a voice, it would be Lewis Black.
4958000	4959000	I'll put it that way.
4959000	4963000	All right, fair enough. We could talk about this subject for a very long time.
4963000	4964000	It's just, it's one of those great games.
4964000	4966000	Halo will never be classic game of the week.
4966000	4969000	It's one of the, and you'll have to wait for a week, she's not here.
4969000	4975000	It'll be one of those great debates that goes on for a very long time.
4975000	4981000	But, you know, to humor Bobby's comment there, in 30 years, when we're still doing OLR,
4981000	4985000	we might be looking back on, wow, has the industry changed?
4985000	4990000	Remember when he had a big box of video discs and laser discs and so forth?
4990000	4995000	Anyway, to be continued, if Nintendo decides to go in that direction, we will see.
4995000	4997000	In the meantime, we've got more gaming news to cover,
4997000	4999000	so let's go to Dark Soccer for our next story.
4999000	5005000	Well, in other news, and let me get off of the list of every voice actor I'm in love with right now,
5005000	5012000	there actually was a hearing on the 21st, which was two days ago,
5012000	5015000	so I haven't seen anything about the outcome of this,
5015000	5021000	but the California Assembly Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports Tourism, and Internet Media,
5021000	5026000	I wonder if that actually has a decent acronym,
5026000	5035000	had a hearing, an info hearing, called California's Video Game Industry Staying on Top of the Changing Game,
5035000	5040000	to where they're basically looking at seeing what the industry looks like now,
5040000	5047000	and how California can stay a leader in the video game industry.
5047000	5056000	So, they were supposed to go over all kinds of different contributions of computer and video gaming,
5056000	5063000	of the role in colleges and universities for training, the development talent,
5063000	5067000	different opportunities for strengthening California's position in the industry,
5067000	5073000	as in money, money, money, and the future of video games,
5073000	5079000	as how it applies to education, research, and workforce development.
5079000	5085000	It's organized by the 57th District Assembly member, Ian Calderon,
5085000	5089000	and supposed to have just all kinds of people there.
5089000	5096000	There's a few folks from EA, there's folks from the Entertainment Software Association,
5096000	5099000	and a bunch of other folks.
5099000	5103000	I don't know what the result is, if they're going to publish anything,
5103000	5106000	but hopefully we'll see something published before too long.
5106000	5112000	So, I'm glad that they had some people in the industry there,
5112000	5122000	but I think if you want a real grasp on, I guess this really was more about the business aspect of it,
5122000	5131000	but I would have liked to have a little bit more about the social aspects of it,
5131000	5137000	about how this is affecting social media.
5137000	5140000	Well, this is me coming from the sociology background.
5140000	5150000	I would love to see a little bit more about how it encourages education amongst the players,
5150000	5157000	increases the more social aspects, and I want to see more in-person social events,
5157000	5164000	and not just contributing to the deterioration of in-person social interaction.
5164000	5165000	Things like that.
5165000	5170000	But I can see California, we need money, and this is money.
5170000	5173000	All right. Well, thank you.
5173000	5176000	Again, you're bringing up things that will be different.
5176000	5179000	It's so interesting to hear about these things that we research now,
5179000	5182000	but it's all going to change in ten years anyway.
5182000	5186000	All right. Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
5186000	5190000	and some video games that are coming soon to a store near you.
5190000	5196000	With Loki not here this week, I'm going to go ahead and just jump in here with the US release dates.
5196000	5202000	So, all the releases this week seem to, well, most of the physical ones anyway, all on the 25th.
5202000	5207000	So, on the 25th, you have to look forward to Amnesia Memories on the PlayStation Vita.
5207000	5211000	There's Honored Definitive Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5211000	5215000	Gears of War Ultimate Edition arrives on the Xbox One.
5215000	5219000	I Am Bread on the PlayStation 4, and it's Madden week.
5219000	5226000	Madden 16 is out on PlayStation 3 and 4, and Xbox 360 and the One.
5226000	5228000	The Mega Man Legacy Collection is out this week.
5228000	5230000	I know a lot of you are looking forward to that.
5230000	5234000	You can get that on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5234000	5238000	Nova 1-11 on PlayStation 3, 4, Vita, and PC.
5238000	5243000	One Piece, Pirate Warriors 3 on PlayStation 4, 3, and Vita and Windows.
5243000	5246000	Shadowrun Hong Kong, PC, Mac, and Linux.
5246000	5250000	Steins Gate on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.
5250000	5255000	And lastly, Until Dawn on the PlayStation 4 on the 25th.
5255000	5258000	That's the one that they showed at E3, I think, last year with the, what's her name?
5258000	5261000	Hayden Pantoneer, the... I can never say her name.
5261000	5262000	The cheerleader?
5262000	5263000	The cheerleader from Heroes.
5263000	5265000	Right, she's the one that's like motion capture.
5265000	5268000	It was like the scary game where you're running away from the killer,
5268000	5271000	and I'm sure a lot of you horror fans will be into that.
5271000	5275000	Also noteworthy, it's coming on a day that we don't usually get video games.
5275000	5281000	We usually get games on Tuesday, but we're getting some off-cycle game on Sunday,
5281000	5283000	and it's a big one.
5283000	5286000	And when you're this company, you can release a game any damn time you want.
5286000	5290000	Disney Infinity 3.0 is one week from today.
5290000	5293000	On everything. Literally everything.
5293000	5294000	On all the things.
5294000	5298000	It will probably run on an Atari 2600 if they can sell you figures, honestly.
5298000	5299000	All the things.
5299000	5301000	Now I'm just picturing this.
5304000	5307000	We're not picking you up, Alan, for some reason. Is that microphone off?
5307000	5310000	Sorry, it was off because I'm snacking.
5310000	5311000	Try again.
5311000	5313000	You had whispered about,
5313000	5317000	I don't know, I think I'm really going to get Disney Infinity 3.
5317000	5319000	With all the amiibos you already have.
5319000	5320000	Rob, don't do it.
5320000	5325000	Thinking about it, but luckily I have Mega Man Legacy Collection to distract me this week,
5325000	5327000	and I want to check out I Am Bread as well.
5327000	5329000	So as long as you can keep me focused on those games,
5329000	5332000	I probably will be able to put it off for a little while.
5332000	5335000	I always talked about that with Disney Infinity 2.0 as well.
5335000	5338000	I'm going to get it, I'm going to get it, and then I never got around to it
5338000	5340000	because there's all these other games to occupy my time.
5340000	5341000	Rob.
5341000	5342000	What?
5342000	5343000	Dragon Age Inquisition.
5343000	5345000	Play it and do multiplayer with me.
5345000	5346000	That's a thing?
5346000	5350000	Actually, I've played more multiplayer in that game than I probably have single player.
5350000	5353000	I haven't played multiplayer yet and I want to play with my friends.
5354000	5355000	I'm not good though.
5355000	5356000	So?
5356000	5357000	Alright, fair enough.
5357000	5362000	I still can't make it past whatever the, what, bronze and mass effects or whatever.
5362000	5363000	Alright.
5363000	5365000	Going to Japan quickly.
5365000	5369000	On the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week on the 27th, Dishonored HD.
5369000	5372000	Dragon's Dogma Online Limited Edition.
5372000	5373000	Madden 6.
5373000	5374000	Sorry, that's not Japan.
5374000	5376000	That's your update sneaking in there.
5376000	5377000	Until Dawn.
5377000	5380000	Sangeki no Senso is also out in Japan.
5380000	5382000	So that's interesting that that game is also coming out in Japan.
5382000	5385000	At the same time, we're getting it here in the US.
5385000	5394000	On the Xbox One, Dishonored is also being released on the Xbox One for ye few Xbox owners.
5394000	5395000	Devil's...
5395000	5398000	Why are all these Europe dates suddenly showing up on my list?
5398000	5399000	Sorry, guys.
5399000	5403000	Super Mario Maker is the next Wii U title to look forward to in early September.
5403000	5405000	Nothing this week otherwise.
5405000	5406000	On the PlayStation Vita.
5406000	5409000	You know the Vita's kicking in Japan.
5409000	5412000	Yet again, another week where everything's on the Vita.
5412000	5414000	Ayakashi Gohan Omori.
5414000	5416000	Himawari, Pebble in the Sky.
5416000	5419000	One Piece, Pirate Warriors 3.
5419000	5421000	Rere Falaise Red of Another.
5421000	5427000	And Raine des Fleurs in limited edition and limited edition DX packs.
5427000	5429000	All coming out this week on the Vita.
5429000	5432000	Lastly, looking at that other handheld, the 3DS.
5432000	5434000	Oh, this is kind of a big deal.
5434000	5439000	Dragon Quest VIII gets a Japanese release on the 3DS this week.
5439000	5441000	Aren't they also getting a Famicom faceplate?
5441000	5443000	For the new 3DS?
5443000	5445000	The new 3DS.
5445000	5447000	There is like a red 3DS coming out.
5447000	5449000	Oh, the Game & Watch faceplate.
5449000	5450000	Maybe.
5450000	5452000	I'm not seeing it on my list here.
5452000	5453000	It may have already come out.
5453000	5454000	It may have then.
5454000	5457000	I remember hearing about it, which I'd be like, I want one.
5457000	5462000	But, Famicom Remix is also out on 3DS this week in Japan.
5462000	5465000	That would obviously be like Nintendo NES Remix over here.
5465000	5466000	So that's kind of neat.
5466000	5467000	That's nice.
5467000	5468000	Cool.
5468000	5471000	I wonder if it'll have the extra sound channel like the Famicom actually has.
5471000	5472000	Ugh.
5472000	5477000	You know, there was something that we picked up a while back.
5477000	5481000	It was the power base converter with the FM sound chip playability in it.
5481000	5484000	And, I mean, it was really cool playing R-Type and whatnot on it.
5484000	5495000	But I would like, it would just be some, you know, a cool thing if there was like a cheap re-release of like a disc system add-on or something.
5495000	5496000	Yeah.
5496000	5501000	You know, I would love to go back and play like Zelda with a different sound set.
5502000	5512000	Or, Castlevania 3 was one that actually, not only did it have a different sound set, but it had different character animations for some of the other characters.
5512000	5514000	And it's kind of a little bit harder too.
5514000	5516000	Didn't they censor a lot of that too, those Castlevania games?
5516000	5519000	There were some, actually quite a bit of censorship in the Castlevania series.
5519000	5526000	But like, my favorite thing about the, actually no, I don't think it was a disc one.
5527000	5531000	I think it was that it was on the cartridge, but the cartridge had the extra animations.
5531000	5535000	Like Grant could throw his swords, not his swords, but his daggers and whatnot.
5535000	5538000	She could use them as a projectile player.
5538000	5551000	Didn't mean to get on that note, but it also though had different sound processor, different, I think it had, now my brain is failing me, but it did have a different sound set.
5551000	5554000	No, you're right. That extra channel was used to enhance the music.
5554000	5555000	That was it.
5555000	5558000	Anyhow, let's move on. You got Europe released.
5558000	5566000	All of three things. On the 25th of August we have Frozen Freefall Snowball Fight on Xbone.
5566000	5572000	On the 28th we have Doubles Third for Wii U and Until Dawn for PS4.
5572000	5577000	Alright. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
5577000	5579000	But first, Alan.
5579000	5581000	Hello.
5581000	5584000	You got a story about a game you play a lot.
5584000	5599000	I do. So back in February, I believe, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XIV, which got a revamp after its horrific original launch in 2010, had 4 million active accounts.
5599000	5607000	Well, now this week they have announced that Final Fantasy XIV, which just had its first expansion, Heavensward, come out two months ago.
5607000	5608000	Yeah.
5608000	5610000	They're now at 5 million active accounts.
5610000	5633000	What that means is that 5 million people worldwide, this does not include free trials, 5 million licenses have been purchased and entered into their account to give them full access to the game plus the free 30 days that you get as a part of buying the game.
5633000	5637000	So they've sold 5 million copies of the game but those people may or may not be still playing.
5637000	5638000	Exactly.
5638000	5644000	World of Warcraft, which I know announced they're really trying to sweep the Warlords of Draenor cycle.
5644000	5650000	I'm not sweeping under the rug but they've already announced their new expansion and they didn't even wait for Blizzcon to do it.
5650000	5660000	Even though allegedly their subscriber base has been free falling, their last announcement was 5.6 million active subscribers.
5661000	5668000	Which I take it to mean people who are beyond their first 30 days, people who have been rebuilt at least once, and people whose accounts have been active.
5668000	5677000	Which of course is a huge number and when will you fave for all the crap that people talk about World of Warcraft, it's still the juggernaut.
5678000	5686000	It's far more much more money to have 5.6 million recurring subscribers.
5686000	5697000	But it's just proof that I think that a lot of people said WoW was the last MMO that could sustain a subscription based format.
5697000	5712000	And in 2010 or 2013 when Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn relaunched, people were like there's no reason to pay $14.99 a month for a game when you could play three free to play MMOs back to back and give money to none of them.
5712000	5718000	Or just pick the one that you're really into to occasionally give $10 a month to and play the other two on your board.
5718000	5725000	There's no way that it's just not possible in the industry and I guess Square's kind of proven them wrong.
5725000	5731000	There was a time when people would say there is no MMO that can compete against World of Warcraft. There isn't a single one.
5731000	5739000	And not that, again, it's little apples to oranges. I don't always like the Final Fantasy XIV to WoW comparisons because they're two different games.
5739000	5743000	They're two completely different games, they just happen to be in the same genre.
5743000	5756000	And also every big blue chip license like the Bioware's, the Old Republic MMO, Elder Scrolls had a lot of momentum in the first six months.
5756000	5763000	And they've not necessarily gone free to play, but they had a big hump and then a big drop down.
5764000	5773000	XIV is still growing. It's the first MMO that people would say, oh it's going to be the WoW killer, which whatever, no it's not.
5773000	5780000	It's the first one that survived its year and not fallen off a cliff. I think that's safe to say.
5780000	5788000	Because if you think of all the other big titles, like, what are the two that came out? The one that still was really into?
5789000	5792000	Was it Wildstar? Elder Scrolls Online.
5792000	5799000	And then there was another one that I'm blanking on. It came out around the same time as Guild Wars 2.
5799000	5811000	Everyone was like, oh, hype, hype, hype. And it might have sold great the first couple months, but it always has that drop off and then always that announcement, we're going free to play.
5812000	5818000	And I think XIV is the first MMO to really, it's kept its inertia.
5818000	5831000	This might also be the game's Japanese roots or something. I'm talking like business stereotypes. You get the Japanese business stereotype is often very stubborn. We've said that about Nintendo a lot.
5831000	5836000	Final Fantasy XI, you still have to pay to play that. How long is that game?
5836000	5838000	And they're officially ending that.
5838000	5842000	Hell no. They're ending it on PlayStation and 360.
5842000	5844000	But as far as coming out with new content?
5844000	5846000	Yeah, done. But they're still going to charge for it.
5846000	5850000	But then they're going to shift it to mobile. I don't know what the hell is going to happen with that.
5850000	5854000	So anyway, I've said this once on the show before. I'm going to say it again.
5854000	5862000	I think gaming history will be very kind to Naoki Yoshida for what he's accomplished with Final Fantasy XIV.
5862000	5867000	He took the worst MMO of all time and made it one of the very best.
5867000	5876000	Basically, he loves MMOs and he's played a lot, including World of Warcraft. So he's a huge fan of the genre.
5876000	5884000	He's not a suit that barely knows what he's talking about. So his heart is in XIV so much.
5884000	5893000	I think the only bummer about it is that I honestly truly believe the renaissance of Final Fantasy XIV in 2.0 and everybody being really into it.
5894000	5899000	I don't want to say saved Square Enix, but it's put their company on a different trajectory.
5899000	5906000	The only downside is that they're going to pull him and some of his team to work on something else that is another big thing for Square.
5906000	5908000	That's the only thing that I worry about.
5908000	5916000	Yeah, well between XIV and Record Keeper and their mobile games, the ones that are actually good, are making disgusting amounts of money.
5916000	5923000	Obviously we can see how they're spending money in XIV because they have a good content patch come out every three months.
5923000	5931000	They have tons of content and they technically don't have to do that. They can follow the WoW model and be like, new patch in nine months, bye!
5931000	5939000	Well, but to be fair, and I sound like I'm up XIV's ass, which I guess in some ways I'm a little bit of a fanboy, but I will say this.
5939000	5945000	I am a little burned out right now. Heavensward, brilliant expansion, phenomenal story, worthy of the Final Fantasy name.
5946000	5949000	Best campaign story probably since X.
5949000	5956000	Oh my god, I would say since VI, but people will argue with me there and that's fine.
5956000	5963000	But I will say, now that I'm kind of all done with it and I'm in the endgame, I'm in the lull.
5963000	5968000	I'm a little bit, okay, I log on, I grind my tomes, I'm a little bit over it right now.
5968000	5971000	That's why I've been kind of, I need to finish Diablo III.
5971000	5975000	3.31 is on the horizon for next month, I think.
5975000	5979000	Oh, did they say as soon as next month? I know 3.07 is like this week.
5979000	5990000	I'm glad I've taken it so slow, even though it was due to a lot of personal crap that I took a big part of my break with everything going on.
5990000	5993000	But I'm kind of glad that I took it as slow as I did.
5993000	5997000	Oh yeah, and there's a lot of people for various different reasons in your boat too.
5997000	6001000	It means I'm going to have content out the ass for a long time.
6001000	6007000	And I'm really enjoying how much that I've just been able to sit back and do story stuff.
6007000	6019000	I actually, I'm even enjoying doing some of the different battles too, like I just did Moogle Mog.
6019000	6021000	Oh, I love that file.
6021000	6028000	It was kind of a pain in the butt when I died right at the end, but it was still hilarious because of Disco Moogles.
6028000	6040000	But like, I'm ready to do the Ultima fight now and all the, I think the big thing is that there is something for fans of the older series in the past, as well as the newer ones.
6040000	6043000	And that's giving it a bit more longevity apart from just the revamped play.
6043000	6044000	Right.
6044000	6048000	So anyway, that's my 12 cents.
6048000	6052000	Alright, well moving along here, since we are running, we're almost to two hours in this segment.
6052000	6056000	But when you have, this always happens when we have an amazing interview on the show, is that we just run long. That's alright.
6056000	6060000	Let's talk about Konami again. Oh boy, what did they do this time?
6060000	6064000	Well actually, some people are looking a little more favorably on that.
6064000	6068000	Konami apparently released a heritage game survey.
6068000	6073000	They're asking players about some of the IPs and how you feel about them.
6073000	6077000	It's also asking, what do you want to see brought back?
6077000	6079000	I'll tell you what's on the list here in a minute.
6079000	6083000	There's well known and obscure on here, but not on the list.
6083000	6085000	Silent Hill and Metal Gear.
6085000	6091000	Does this mean that they're already, I mean, obviously we have a new Metal Gear game coming out in a week.
6091000	6095000	You know, is Silent Hill still continuing?
6095000	6097000	Survey be damned, who knows?
6097000	6102000	Or could this just be the Konami's trying to get in people's good favor again?
6102000	6106000	By throwing out these names of reminding us why we love them.
6106000	6112000	And teasing us, giving us just a taste that we could be seeing it again in the future.
6112000	6114000	Here's a list, here's what they put out.
6114000	6117000	Jamie, you're going to be surprised at some of the things on this list.
6117000	6119000	Rocket Knight. What?
6119000	6121000	Bishi Bashi. Ooh, Bishi Bashi.
6121000	6123000	Parodius. What?
6123000	6125000	Sunset Riders. Parodius.
6125000	6127000	Contra. Parodius.
6127000	6130000	Suikoden. Parodius.
6130000	6132000	Gradius. Parodius.
6132000	6135000	Okay, but can we talk about Gradius? Sure.
6135000	6137000	Track and Field.
6137000	6140000	Bomberman, because remember they have Hudson now.
6140000	6142000	Castlevania.
6142000	6144000	Mystical Ninja, or Goemon.
6144000	6146000	Zone of the Enders.
6146000	6148000	Vandal Hearts.
6148000	6150000	Yu-Gi-Oh.
6150000	6152000	And I love that there's an option, none of these.
6152000	6154000	Parodius.
6154000	6155000	Yeah.
6155000	6157000	Parodius.
6157000	6159000	Well, you know.
6159000	6161000	I do know. And I think a lot of the listeners by this point know.
6161000	6164000	But just in case we have new listeners, Dark Soccer.
6164000	6166000	Sunset Riders is a freaking good game, by the way.
6166000	6168000	But Parodius. These are all good games.
6168000	6170000	Oh my god. I could totally,
6170000	6172000	totally stand to have
6172000	6174000	a
6174000	6176000	a
6176000	6178000	Parodius.
6178000	6180000	Dark to see you.
6180000	6182000	I just lost my brain. Dark to see you in chat says
6182000	6184000	I did vote for a new Sunset Riders.
6184000	6186000	Fifth Dream says Zone of the Enders.
6186000	6188000	Act F. Zone of the Enders. Bonds. 006.
6188000	6190000	Zone of the Enders. Hmm.
6190000	6192000	We got a lot of Zoe fans in our chat there tonight.
6193000	6195000	Anyway. We'll see. I don't know.
6195000	6197000	It's a poll. It's a survey.
6197000	6199000	I'm kind of looking at it going
6199000	6201000	whatever until I see some evidence
6201000	6203000	that it's actually going to happen. We'll see.
6203000	6205000	Anyhow. Let's
6205000	6207000	Actually, I would like to say
6207000	6209000	if they did anything in the Castlevania series
6209000	6211000	as much as I like the new
6211000	6213000	series. You know, the ones that have been on the handhelds
6213000	6215000	in the last few days. I would
6215000	6217000	daze my butt. I would
6217000	6219000	like to have a continuation
6219000	6221000	of the Dracula X storyline.
6221000	6223000	You know, we had Dracula X.
6223000	6225000	We had Rondo
6225000	6227000	of Blood. We had Symphony of the Night or
6227000	6229000	Nocturne in the Moonlight
6229000	6231000	as it was in Japan. I would love
6231000	6233000	to have a direct
6233000	6235000	trilogy. You know.
6235000	6237000	That would be pretty rad.
6237000	6239000	Alright. Well, let's go back to a
6239000	6241000	classic time. Let's go back to a time when Konami
6241000	6243000	was actually making all these series.
6243000	6245000	Even when Konami
6245000	6247000	was making games people liked.
6247000	6249000	I get it. To be fair,
6249000	6251000	I'll give her a solid five. I'm sure tons of people are going to like.
6251000	6253000	But anyway, it's just one game.
6253000	6255000	Dark Soccer is going to step into
6255000	6257000	the vault. Newly refurbished and remodeled
6257000	6259000	vault. And find a game, which actually
6259000	6261000	tonight isn't Konami. It isn't exactly
6261000	6263000	remodeled as much as shits everywhere.
6263000	6265000	She's going to go into the archive
6265000	6267000	and find a game that she thinks, hey, brats
6267000	6269000	check out this game. This is a classic.
6269000	6271000	Or, I think,
6271000	6273000	and she sometimes does this, because a game
6273000	6275000	to qualify as a classic game of the week has to be at least
6275000	6277000	ten years old. So sometimes Dark Soccer
6277000	6279000	comes in here and goes, ha ha
6279000	6281000	remember this game? It's because you're old.
6281000	6283000	And I think that's what she's
6283000	6285000	I think that's what she's doing to us tonight.
6285000	6287000	This is called
6287000	6289000	Watch Out My Foot's
6289000	6291000	Heading Toward Your Age Balls.
6291000	6293000	Dark Soccer, what is the classic
6293000	6295000	game of the week tonight?
6295000	6297000	Zuma. Yes.
6297000	6299000	Zuma is over ten years old.
6299000	6301000	How does it make
6301000	6303000	you feel? You are a rude
6303000	6305000	rude individual.
6305000	6307000	Oh yeah.
6307000	6309000	Zuma, like when old people go to the
6309000	6311000	YMCA and do calisthenics? No.
6311000	6313000	No, that's
6313000	6315000	Zumba. That's Zumba.
6315000	6317000	And it's not Zima, which is
6317000	6319000	And it's not what cleans your house. That's a Roomba.
6319000	6321000	See, here I was going for
6321000	6323000	even more old and going for the Zimas
6323000	6325000	which was what the
6325000	6327000	drink of
6327000	6329000	of the preppy frat plays
6329000	6331000	everywhere.
6331000	6333000	Anyway,
6333000	6335000	Zuma is a tile
6335000	6337000	matching puzzle game. It was put up by
6337000	6339000	PopCap and
6339000	6341000	you can still play it for free a bunch of places
6341000	6343000	because no one
6343000	6345000	cares about putting any more money into it
6345000	6347000	because Zuma's revenge is out.
6347000	6349000	And that will make you feel
6349000	6351000	old because that will be a ten year game in 2019.
6351000	6353000	That came out in 2009.
6353000	6355000	Good lord, people. Stop
6355000	6357000	blowing up my chat here.
6357000	6359000	For those of you that know Extover from
6359000	6361000	Horde House,
6361000	6363000	this is like, I have
6363000	6365000	my god, he played so much Zuma, you guys.
6365000	6367000	This is probably like his classic game of all time.
6367000	6369000	He played a lot of this game.
6369000	6371000	Until he discovered Devil's Crush.
6371000	6373000	Yes.
6373000	6375000	On the Wii U
6375000	6377000	or the Wii release.
6377000	6379000	Anyway,
6379000	6381000	it received
6381000	6383000	the 2004 Game of the
6383000	6385000	Year award from Real Arcade.
6385000	6387000	So,
6387000	6389000	anyway,
6389000	6391000	with this particular game, I always called
6391000	6393000	it kind of like, bust a move
6393000	6395000	on a track.
6395000	6397000	I can see that. Yeah, because, I mean, you basically
6397000	6399000	have the different multicolored balls
6399000	6401000	and you move a little thing around in a
6401000	6403000	He said balls.
6403000	6405000	I didn't say deez nuts.
6405000	6407000	Deez nuts for president.
6407000	6409000	Anyway.
6409000	6411000	Anyway.
6411000	6413000	Ah, don't get me started.
6413000	6415000	So,
6415000	6417000	as I was saying, before Rob
6417000	6419000	rudely interrupted me. I'm just waiting for you to
6419000	6421000	actually pick the game, Balls,
6421000	6423000	as the classic game of the week.
6423000	6425000	Just for, I think I've done, um
6425000	6427000	Balls has a better chance than Halo, you guys.
6427000	6429000	Oh, I should do
6429000	6431000	Balls. I did, um, Vector
6431000	6433000	Man before and he's made of balls.
6433000	6435000	Wait for election day. You can do Balls.
6435000	6437000	In honor of deez nuts.
6437000	6439000	Anyway, go ahead, I'm sorry to keep interrupting.
6439000	6441000	I'm sorry to keep interrupting. Go ahead. No, I'll probably
6441000	6443000	because when
6443000	6445000	Bernie wins, I have to do something relatively
6445000	6447000	Jewish. Back to the
6447000	6449000	game.
6449000	6451000	So, anyway, um,
6451000	6453000	the balls are gonna go, are on like
6453000	6455000	a track and you have a little
6455000	6457000	360 degree
6457000	6459000	ball shooter thing
6459000	6461000	that looks like a big Aztec
6461000	6463000	monument head face thing.
6463000	6465000	So, um, basically
6465000	6467000	the balls, you have to stop the balls before
6467000	6469000	they reach, um, a skull or
6469000	6471000	else, you know, game over.
6471000	6473000	So, um, you eliminate
6473000	6475000	the balls by shooting a colored
6475000	6477000	ball of the similar color
6477000	6479000	until you, um,
6479000	6481000	uh, match up a particular
6481000	6483000	color. So when you have three or more of the same color
6483000	6485000	in contact, they'll explode
6485000	6487000	and they can even trigger
6487000	6489000	explosions and chain reactions. And the
6489000	6491000	level's completed when you fill up
6491000	6493000	your bar for as many of them
6493000	6495000	as you do. You get bonuses
6495000	6497000	for collecting coins that show through the
6497000	6499000	different gaps and making
6499000	6501000	things explode.
6501000	6503000	And then you have, um,
6503000	6505000	different power ups you can get. There's the
6505000	6507000	backward ball that pushes
6507000	6509000	the furthest out chain
6509000	6511000	backwards for a little bit.
6511000	6513000	And there's a slow down, uh, ball that
6513000	6515000	slows down time. Or,
6515000	6517000	you also get, um,
6517000	6519000	an accuracy ball that
6519000	6521000	lines up your shots.
6521000	6523000	Um, and then you have
6523000	6525000	an explosion ball that just makes
6525000	6527000	things go boom. I like that.
6527000	6529000	Um, you've got
6529000	6531000	adventure mode, you've got gauntlet mode,
6531000	6533000	um, you've got
6533000	6535000	all kinds of different stuff in it.
6535000	6537000	But there was a controversy about this.
6537000	6539000	There was, um, a
6539000	6541000	Japanese developer called, uh, the Mitchell
6541000	6543000	Corporation that said Zuma infringed
6543000	6545000	on a 1998
6545000	6547000	game called Puzloop that
6547000	6549000	was released as ballistic outside
6549000	6551000	of Japan.
6551000	6553000	The game was, uh,
6553000	6555000	uh, re-released, um, for
6555000	6557000	the Nintendo DS.
6557000	6559000	Um, well, I'll
6559000	6561000	backtrack on that one. They re-released
6561000	6563000	the design as a game called Magnetica.
6563000	6565000	And PopCap,
6565000	6567000	um, basically went
6567000	6569000	back and forth and saying that it wasn't an exact
6569000	6571000	clone. And
6571000	6573000	that they were actually
6573000	6575000	happy that the games were getting copied.
6575000	6577000	It was a whole bunch of odd stuff.
6577000	6579000	So, but anyway, yeah,
6579000	6581000	um, congratulations. Everyone feels
6581000	6583000	old now because Zuma is
6583000	6585000	officially a classic.
6585000	6587000	Not a real
6587000	6589000	classic, but it's old enough to be
6589000	6591000	considered classic.
6591000	6593000	Classic enough.
6593000	6595000	I suppose.
6595000	6597000	And this is just really one of my
6597000	6599000	little spiteful ones. Like, hey, guess what?
6599000	6601000	Heh heh.
6601000	6603000	Alright. There it is.
6603000	6605000	This person's not playing very well.
6605000	6607000	There it is, your classic game of the week.
6607000	6609000	Zuma!
6609000	6611000	Not to be confused with Zumba, or Zima.
6611000	6613000	To
6613000	6615000	register participation for this week's
6615000	6617000	episode of Orange Lounge Radio at
6617000	6619000	vognetwork.com, use the passphrase
6619000	6621000	Rake. As pointed
6621000	6623000	out in our chat room,
6623000	6625000	Bobby Blackwolf says Zuma is backwards
6625000	6627000	compatible on the Xbox One right now.
6627000	6629000	So it's a classic that's playable on a very modern console.
6629000	6631000	That's a very good point. You can check that out.
6631000	6633000	That's gonna do it for this
6633000	6635000	first half of our show, but we've got plenty
6635000	6637000	more. It's more like first two thirds.
6637000	6639000	But we still have more show to come
6639000	6641000	when we come back. We're gonna get into rapid fire news.
6641000	6643000	The fugal question of the week
6643000	6645000	about voice acting tonight, in honor of the
6645000	6647000	guests we had on earlier. And we're gonna get to our
6647000	6649000	mailbag, the FUs of the week, and your
6649000	6651000	calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR
6651000	6653000	or on Skype, at Orange
6653000	6655000	Lounge Radio, all one word. We're gonna get to
6655000	6657000	all that when we come back after this
6657000	6659000	with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6665000	6667000	Welcome back everybody to Orange

6673000	6675000	episode of our show
6675000	6677000	already in progress. And
6677000	6679000	yeah, we've had a great
6679000	6681000	interview with a trio of very
6681000	6683000	talented voice actors there
6683000	6685000	at the top of the show. So if you're just joining us
6685000	6687000	live, again, you need to go check out the podcast feed once
6687000	6689000	it's posted. Available on iTunes
6689000	6691000	or Stitcher Radio or pretty much

6693000	6695000	on demand there. Show is always posted

6697000	6699000	Anyhow, we're
6699000	6701000	gonna get right back into it. We're running a little long tonight
6701000	6703000	so we're gonna get right back into the gaming news
6703000	6705000	and remember if you want to participate along
6705000	6707000	with our show, we like to read comments and things like that
6707000	6709000	live.vognetwork.com
6709000	6711000	Alan's joining us tonight in place of Loki.
6711000	6713000	Hello. Hi.
6713000	6715000	What do you got for us for rapid fire news tonight?
6715000	6717000	I'm gonna actually
6717000	6719000	make these very quickly, quick
6719000	6721000	because I don't have much personal
6721000	6723000	commentary to make about any of them.
6723000	6725000	So people are all a
6725000	6727000	flutter about a job posting
6727000	6729000	that Bungie put on their website
6729000	6731000	specifically asking for a
6731000	6733000	PC compatibility tester.
6733000	6735000	This is exciting because
6735000	6737000	I don't believe Bungie has put a game out
6737000	6739000	on the PC platform since Halo
6739000	6741000	or Halo 2 and those were, I think,
6741000	6743000	probably just ports. They weren't developed
6743000	6745000	natively for the PC.
6745000	6747000	So the scuttlebutt
6747000	6749000	or the popular opinion
6749000	6751000	is that they're
6751000	6753000	thinking about bringing
6753000	6755000	Destiny to PC
6755000	6757000	though Bungie has not
6757000	6759000	announced anything
6759000	6761000	like that. But the
6761000	6763000	job description says
6763000	6765000	evaluate PC hardware specific features
6765000	6767000	and ensure various systems work together
6767000	6769000	across multiple PC configurations
6769000	6771000	to provide a great experience.
6771000	6773000	So basically it's a
6773000	6775000	quality assurance
6775000	6777000	beta tester for PC.
6777000	6779000	So people think that that is
6779000	6781000	interesting to note.
6781000	6783000	There
6783000	6785000	was a lawsuit between
6785000	6787000	3D Realms, Gearbox Software, and I believe
6787000	6789000	another software company called
6789000	6791000	Interceptor about a spinoff Duke Nukem
6791000	6793000	game that 3D Realms
6793000	6795000	licensed to Interceptor.
6795000	6797000	Except Gearbox is like, no, we
6797000	6799000	own that intellectual property now.
6799000	6801000	It was a part of us doing Duke Nukem forever.
6801000	6803000	That case
6803000	6805000	has finally
6805000	6807000	I don't think
6807000	6809000	Yeah, they all
6809000	6811000	voluntarily ended their litigation
6811000	6813000	so I believe it was settled out of court.
6813000	6815000	Gearbox is now the sole
6815000	6817000	owner of the Duke Nukem license
6817000	6819000	and Interceptor and 3D Realms is
6819000	6821000	working on their own new game.
6821000	6823000	So hooray
6823000	6825000	Gearbox, even though
6825000	6827000	that wasn't really their fault but Duke Nukem forever
6827000	6829000	wasn't the best and I don't really know if there's
6829000	6831000	even any hype for that franchise to live on.
6831000	6833000	Yeah, it's kind of, hooray, it's
6833000	6835000	been settled, a franchise that I think
6835000	6837000	most people are done with.
6837000	6839000	I don't know, I think
6839000	6841000	Duke Nukem could be reinvented still.
6841000	6843000	He's a classic character.
6843000	6845000	The statements from 3D Realms and
6845000	6847000	Interceptor were very gracious in
6847000	6849000	saying, you know, we did this on Good Faith
6849000	6851000	didn't know there was a legal
6851000	6853000	issue, congrats to Gearbox, we look
6853000	6855000	forward to future blah blah blah.
6855000	6857000	If Sonic can survive Sonic
6857000	6859000	2006, then
6859000	6861000	If Britney Spears can survive 2007
6861000	6863000	then you can make it through this day.
6863000	6865000	I say
6865000	6867000	that to myself every morning.
6867000	6869000	Finally, there's a game
6869000	6871000	on Steam which I believe is on HellasHale
6871000	6873000	this weekend called Zombie Army Trilogy.
6873000	6875000	Valve and Steam
6875000	6877000	put out this weekend a
6877000	6879000	free update that puts all
6879000	6881000	six, or sorry
6881000	6883000	six or eight, all eight, excuse me
6883000	6885000	Left 4 Dead protagonists in
6885000	6887000	Zombie Army Trilogy so you
6887000	6889000	can play as the cute redneck
6889000	6891000	or the sleazy
6891000	6893000	guy in the white blazer
6893000	6895000	or the biker dude that kind of looks
6895000	6897000	like the guy from Grand Theft Auto 4.
6897000	6899000	They are playable characters now in
6899000	6901000	Zombie Army Trilogy for you
6901000	6903000	Left 4 Dead fanatics out there and that's all I have
6903000	6905000	done.
6921000	6923000	because that's
6923000	6925000	what you learn when you do something like that
6925000	6927000	is you get off the internet.
6927000	6929000	S2100Matt says about the Duke Nukem
6929000	6931000	What I'm hoping for with this is that Duke Nukem could make a guest
6931000	6933000	appearance in Borderlands.
6933000	6935000	Imagine him as the villain in the next Borderlands game
6935000	6937000	as a rival Vault Hunter.
6937000	6939000	Just saying, that would be epic.
6939000	6941000	That would be pretty rad.
6941000	6943000	S2100Matt, you need to write a letter.
6943000	6945000	Or something.
6945000	6947000	Let's go and talk about
6947000	6949000	Pokken Tournament.
6949000	6951000	It's going to be happening on the Wii U.
6951000	6953000	It's coming next spring.
6953000	6955000	They announced the release of
6955000	6957000	Pokken Tournament for the Nintendo Wii U.
6957000	6959000	It's an arcade game in Japan
6959000	6961000	but it will be released worldwide
6961000	6963000	in Spring 2016.
6963000	6965000	Being developed in collaboration with Bandai Namco
6965000	6967000	who of course made Tekken
6967000	6969000	so they know a thing or two about fighting games.
6969000	6971000	Will you play Tekken with Pokemon
6971000	6973000	Dark Saga?
6973000	6975000	No. I'll play Tekken with Gon.
6975000	6977000	I will. I will.
6977000	6979000	Look, if Tekken can have a panda bear
6979000	6981000	and whatever
6981000	6983000	that tree thing was
6983000	6985000	the wooden- Mokujin.
6985000	6987000	Mokujin, that's it. By the way, to go back to
6987000	6989000	the last segment, I just told
6989000	6991000	Konami that Silent Hill, all of Silent Hill
6991000	6993000	is Silent Hill ever forever.
6993000	6995000	Did you actually fill out that interview?
6995000	6997000	Yes I did. And I put Silent Hill.
6997000	6999000	Sorry, did I say interview? I meant survey.
6999000	7001000	Survey, yes.
7001000	7003000	My wires are crossing tonight. I'm in a short circuit here any moment.
7003000	7005000	Alright, well Dark Sakura
7005000	7007000	pay attention because I know you want to know about this
7007000	7009000	because it has to do with Gunstar Heroes.
7009000	7011000	No, I'm not announcing a new Gunstar Heroes
7011000	7013000	game, I apologize. But
7013000	7015000	a remake, sort of,
7015000	7017000	of the Gunstar Heroes
7017000	7019000	game is available on the 3DS
7019000	7021000	eShop as of August 20th.
7021000	7023000	This is,
7023000	7025000	I don't know if this is a
7025000	7027000	oh yeah, it is a 3D version of Gunstar Heroes.
7027000	7029000	It's the Gunstar 3D Heroes
7029000	7031000	for the Sega Ages thing
7031000	7033000	that already came out.
7033000	7035000	But this has already been
7035000	7037000	a thing. On the 20th.
7037000	7039000	Right? Yeah, I think actually I
7039000	7041000	have this, I think.
7041000	7043000	I don't know, I've got so many copies of
7043000	7045000	Gunstar Heroes that it's ridiculous.
7045000	7047000	I'll ask Dan, he knows. Well it's Gunstar.
7047000	7049000	I don't know, I'm reading here, it just came out this week.
7049000	7051000	Maybe it was in a collection, now it's not.
7051000	7053000	So, whatever, it's Gunstar Heroes.
7053000	7055000	I want to say it was one of the Sega Ages things.
7055000	7057000	Yeah, that makes sense.
7057000	7059000	Also, you know, last week on the show
7059000	7061000	we talked about how Resident Evil 2 is being
7061000	7063000	remade. Well,
7063000	7065000	there was a fan project, if you didn't know,
7065000	7067000	that was already in the works, Resident Evil 2
7067000	7069000	Reborn. And it was going to be made
7069000	7071000	in Unreal 4. So what happened this week?
7071000	7073000	It got shut down
7073000	7075000	is what tends to happen with these fan
7075000	7077000	projects all the time. But,
7077000	7079000	good guy Capcom,
7079000	7081000	doing this the right way, because usually like
7081000	7083000	if Square Enix or Nintendo does this to you,
7083000	7085000	like when Nintendo pulled that Mario 64
7085000	7087000	thing, you disappear.
7087000	7089000	But, in a good
7089000	7091000	guy Capcom, which I don't use that phrase
7091000	7093000	very often anymore on this program,
7093000	7095000	but Capcom actually reached out to
7095000	7097000	the Reborn team and has invited
7097000	7099000	them to share their ideas
7099000	7101000	for it. So,
7101000	7103000	Capcom saying, hey look, legal
7103000	7105000	reasons, got to shut you down,
7105000	7107000	but you know what, let's talk,
7107000	7109000	let's have a meeting. So, that's
7109000	7111000	a reasonable end
7111000	7113000	to this situation.
7113000	7115000	Alan? I was going to say,
7115000	7117000	the fact that they would give them
7117000	7119000	the time of day and be like, okay
7119000	7121000	we'll see what
7121000	7123000	ideas you had. Because, I mean,
7123000	7125000	this type of thing happens
7125000	7127000	all the time where, you know,
7127000	7129000	with the Streets of Rage
7129000	7131000	compilation, Sega see indeed that,
7131000	7133000	it happened so often that they could have
7133000	7135000	just, okay, seasoned assisted because
7135000	7137000	intellectual property rights, blah, blah, blah,
7137000	7139000	and then been done with it and I don't think anyone
7139000	7141000	would have faulted Capcom
7141000	7143000	worse than they fault anyone else when this happens.
7143000	7145000	So the fact that they're meeting with them is
7145000	7147000	pretty cool. Exactly.
7147000	7149000	Alright, let's move on, Dark Sakura. Stuff.
7149000	7151000	Um,
7151000	7153000	there is a big reason why
7153000	7155000	Dan and I have been on our Chrono Trigger
7155000	7157000	kick lately.
7157000	7159000	And the big reason for the
7159000	7161000	Chrono Trigger kick is because Chrono Trigger
7161000	7163000	has had its 20th birthday.
7163000	7165000	My tummy hurts, I don't feel good.
7165000	7167000	I know, right?
7167000	7169000	God, you thought the Zuma thing made you feel old.
7169000	7171000	That would make you feel.
7171000	7173000	We were in high school. Next year
7173000	7175000	is our 20 year high school
7175000	7177000	reunion. Fuck off. Mine already passed.
7177000	7179000	Anyhow,
7179000	7181000	sorry Dark Sakura.
7181000	7183000	We had to whine.
7183000	7185000	Get off our lawn.
7185000	7187000	So, and I mean,
7187000	7189000	this was, it just had such a great
7189000	7191000	creative team. It had
7191000	7193000	Sakaguchi, who's the guy who created
7193000	7195000	Final Fantasy. It had
7195000	7197000	Hori, who was
7197000	7199000	the creative
7199000	7201000	Dragon Quest. And of course,
7201000	7203000	one of everyone's favorite
7203000	7205000	mangaka, Akira
7205000	7207000	Toriyama
7207000	7209000	was in it.
7209000	7211000	I
7211000	7213000	did the right away
7213000	7215000	ending just so I could see
7215000	7217000	his little sprite in the game.
7217000	7219000	So, it was
7219000	7221000	such a good game. Such a good game.
7221000	7223000	In fact, Dan and I were actually just
7223000	7225000	whenever character music would play, we'd just like
7225000	7227000	stop the dialogue and do the Robo
7227000	7229000	dance. The Robo's theme
7229000	7231000	is incredible to this day. Yeah.
7231000	7233000	Actually, I'm going to be ring toning
7233000	7235000	that before too long
7235000	7237000	because it's so great.
7237000	7239000	But yeah,
7239000	7241000	you actually,
7241000	7243000	I mean,
7243000	7245000	the battle system in it was
7245000	7247000	I'd say fairly
7247000	7249000	revolutionary too. I mean, you had
7249000	7251000	your different techniques and the combination
7251000	7253000	techniques and
7253000	7255000	the fact you could actually
7255000	7257000	bypass certain fights.
7257000	7259000	It was a little unheard of.
7259000	7261000	It wasn't just the woosh woosh
7261000	7263000	random encounter. Oh my god.
7263000	7265000	But you could get away with some.
7265000	7267000	In fact, Dan today, he
7267000	7269000	runs right through the middle of the enemies, leaves
7269000	7271000	the room and is like, hey, weren't enemies supposed
7271000	7273000	to spawn here? Went back and they spawned.
7273000	7275000	Because he went back to check.
7275000	7277000	Good job.
7277000	7279000	The humor and everything was great.
7279000	7281000	Okay, so I would
7281000	7283000	add enough gushing on that one for me.
7283000	7285000	Super Mario Maker.
7285000	7287000	Some news about that.
7287000	7289000	It's going to have different skin tones
7289000	7291000	and fur
7291000	7293000	colors.
7293000	7295000	So basically,
7295000	7297000	it's supposed to be
7297000	7299000	a dog's paw.
7299000	7301000	Why are they focusing on the dogs?
7301000	7303000	Where's the cat love?
7305000	7307000	But you're going to have different
7307000	7309000	skin tones that will go with what you
7309000	7311000	associate with if you want to.
7311000	7313000	Oh, I remember. Or you have the gloved hand
7313000	7315000	like Mario. There was a controversy
7315000	7317000	on this a while ago when people were like
7317000	7319000	why is the hand only this
7319000	7321000	one white hand that you can play in the game?
7321000	7323000	And so they
7323000	7325000	said they would have more.
7325000	7327000	So it sounds like now they've shown like, oh, you can be
7327000	7329000	a dog's hand if you want. Or you can be a
7329000	7331000	cat paw. A Mario hand. Why all the cat hate
7331000	7333000	Nintendo? I know. Took them forever
7333000	7335000	to add Nintendo cats. Maybe that's in there too.
7335000	7337000	Super Mario Cats is already a game.
7337000	7339000	It's called Super Mario 3D World.
7339000	7341000	Fair
7341000	7343000	enough. Fair enough. And
7343000	7345000	then this
7345000	7347000	I laughed so hard when
7347000	7349000	I read this. And I even
7349000	7351000	like how you put it in the show Roll Rob.
7351000	7353000	PS4 in my
7353000	7355000	pants.
7355000	7357000	A shoplifter
7357000	7359000	tried to fit a PS4
7359000	7361000	in his pants.
7361000	7363000	On top of that is Florida Man.
7363000	7365000	You know Florida Man
7365000	7367000	is my favorite criminal.
7367000	7369000	Florida Man, Florida Man. You know about the
7369000	7371000	Florida Man theme.
7371000	7373000	You say Florida Man.
7373000	7375000	Florida Man has a sexual relationship
7375000	7377000	with all of their relatives.
7377000	7379000	And they smoke tons of crack and bath salts in there
7379000	7381000	in every story ever. Wasn't Jack Voldemore
7381000	7383000	a lawyer in Florida? Yes.
7383000	7385000	But no, Florida Man has kind of
7385000	7387000	made a bit of a meme.
7387000	7389000	Where, you know, they'll say like on Twitter
7389000	7391000	Florida Man accused of this.
7391000	7393000	And then just over and over. So Florida
7393000	7395000	Man has become this
7395000	7397000	like super villain. And so
7397000	7399000	now Florida Man tries to stuff
7399000	7401000	a PS4 in his pants. Sorry.
7401000	7403000	You just say Florida Man, I think of Jack Voldemore.
7403000	7405000	And it's funnier.
7409000	7411000	I'm done. I quit.
7411000	7413000	How did they find the PS4
7413000	7415000	in his pants?
7415000	7417000	Let's see.
7417000	7419000	He managed to stuff the PS4
7419000	7421000	and the accessories in his pants
7421000	7423000	while going to a Walmart.
7424000	7426000	Only at Walmart.
7426000	7428000	And he walked out of the store
7431000	7433000	without paying and was stopped and
7433000	7435000	arrested on a felony
7435000	7437000	grand theft charge. Oh, I get it.
7437000	7439000	I feel so uncool. He was already on probation.
7439000	7441000	I feel so uncool for not having
7441000	7443000	heard of this before. Tigerclaw linked me to a Wikipedia
7443000	7445000	article, which by the way, I'm surprised this is on
7445000	7447000	Wikipedia and not like Encyclopedia Dramatica
7447000	7449000	or one of those other websites.
7449000	7451000	What's the meme? Urban Dictionary.
7452000	7454000	So anyway, link me to Wikipedia
7454000	7456000	and it actually says the reason why it's
7456000	7458000	Florida Man is because that's the way all the headlines
7458000	7460000	always read. Florida Man steals PlayStation
7460000	7462000	4 in his pants. Florida Man got it.
7462000	7464000	I get it. Now it's funny.
7464000	7466000	And I don't want to mention Florida Man's
7466000	7468000	actual name here. But Florida Woman's
7468000	7470000	just as crazy. But he's 36 years old.
7470000	7472000	Which makes me think that he still
7472000	7474000	had a pair of jinkos in his closet.
7474000	7476000	From like 1994.
7476000	7478000	It's either sweatpants, a big old pair
7478000	7480000	of sweatpants, or he's still got the jinko, the raver jeans.
7480000	7482000	I'm going to vote for the jinkos.
7482000	7484000	Because if you like
7484000	7486000	cinch off the ends of them, you could probably fit
7486000	7488000	like a small family in those things.
7488000	7490000	Alright, well
7490000	7492000	let's see.
7492000	7494000	I think it's time
7494000	7496000	for us to get into the foogle question
7496000	7498000	of the week.
7498000	7500000	Every week we ask you guys a question on our
7500000	7502000	Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
7502000	7504000	You put Facebook and Google together,
7504000	7506000	you get foogle!
7510000	7512000	Tonight,
7512000	7514000	I thought we would ask about
7514000	7516000	voice acting. Because you know,
7516000	7518000	we had some voice actors on our show tonight
7518000	7520000	so why not?
7520000	7522000	I mentioned that we were going to have our interview tonight and said
7522000	7524000	what or who is your
7524000	7526000	favorite voice acting performance
7526000	7528000	in a video game and why did you pick that
7528000	7530000	performance? So
7530000	7532000	what was a voice acting performance
7532000	7534000	that really resonated with you?
7534000	7536000	Redertainment answered over on Google Plus and said
7536000	7538000	due to the fact that we don't regularly see
7538000	7540000	actor in roles in video games
7540000	7542000	like how we see the actors in movies, TV
7542000	7544000	shows and plays and so forth.
7544000	7546000	Individual actors don't stand out to me as much as the
7546000	7548000	characters do. Unless the actor has
7548000	7550000	a really distinctive voice that I know from
7550000	7552000	some other platforms, I don't remember
7552000	7554000	what actor plays what roles. So that's
7554000	7556000	why my answer is Stephen Merchant from Portal 2.
7556000	7558000	You know,
7558000	7560000	if a voice actor is doing an amazing
7560000	7562000	job though, that would mean that you
7562000	7564000	shouldn't necessarily be able to tell. I mean
7564000	7566000	sometimes you do, it just depends on the type of character
7566000	7568000	but I think when you look at
7568000	7570000	especially the resumes of some of the gentlemen that were on the show tonight
7570000	7572000	say whoa, that was the same person?
7572000	7574000	That's cool. You know and I think a lot
7574000	7576000	of you guys probably have done that when you go to
7576000	7578000	one of those websites that list everything that the
7578000	7580000	voice actors do that I know
7580000	7582000	Marissa linked one of those sites earlier in our chat room.
7582000	7584000	I had no idea that Jennifer Hale was
7584000	7586000	as prolific as she was. Yes.
7586000	7588000	Like I knew obviously that she was a big
7588000	7590000	name but it's like no, she was
7590000	7592000	voicing stuff. She's in Baldur's Gate
7592000	7594000	and all this stuff from way back
7594000	7596000	when. I also love
7596000	7598000	Marc Meer not because
7598000	7600000	he was Commander Shepard because a lot of
7600000	7602000	people, not maybe the best
7602000	7604000	acting in some of the lines he delivered
7604000	7606000	but as a personality if you see
7606000	7608000	his YouTube videos and his cosplay he's
7608000	7610000	really funny. Well
7610000	7612000	do you guys remember Hitoshi
7612000	7614000	Doi? He had the
7614000	7616000	Seiyu database. Yes.
7616000	7618000	Which was basically
7618000	7620000	a visual novel,
7620000	7622000	video game, anime
7622000	7624000	and drama.
7624000	7626000	Drama programs.
7626000	7628000	Yeah. For Japan.
7628000	7630000	And then I think there was supposed to be a
7630000	7632000	branch out of it
7632000	7634000	when anime started getting bigger in the
7634000	7636000	US. And I don't know what
7636000	7638000	happened to that. I don't even know if his Seiyu
7638000	7640000	database is still around.
7640000	7642000	Alright.
7642000	7644000	Well let me move on here
7644000	7646000	with some of the answers on Facebook.
7646000	7648000	Chad B says
7648000	7650000	Gideon Emery is Balthier
7650000	7652000	Without a doubt Balthier and Fran
7652000	7654000	made Final Fantasy XII for me and
7654000	7656000	it was quite a nice surprise to hear Emery pop up
7656000	7658000	through the Dragon Age franchise as well.
7658000	7660000	And I just found out he played one of the Russian brothers
7660000	7662000	in the Daredevil Netflix series which makes it that much
7662000	7664000	better. That's one of my all time favorites too.
7664000	7666000	Like that's an amazing
7666000	7668000	performance. Balthier and Fran for that matter.
7668000	7670000	Both are fantastic in that game.
7670000	7672000	Elliot B says
7672000	7674000	I'll get the obvious out of the way. Portal would not be
7674000	7676000	Portal without Ella McClain as GLaDOS.
7676000	7678000	And Stephen Merchant was great in Portal too
7678000	7680000	especially in comparison to other voice over work by
7680000	7682000	big name actors.
7682000	7684000	DeGenere Johnny says
7684000	7686000	Sarah Kestelman's performance as
7686000	7688000	Kreia in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2
7688000	7690000	The Sith Lords. Her portrayal matched
7690000	7692000	every aspect of the character and how she was written
7692000	7694000	which was the highest quality I've ever
7694000	7696000	seen in a game. It takes a great deal of
7696000	7698000	talent to sell a villain that the player will sympathize
7698000	7700000	with and she nailed it perfectly.
7700000	7702000	To this day I still get teary eyed when
7702000	7704000	remembering her performance.
7704000	7706000	Dark Tetsuya says
7706000	7708000	David Hayter as the original Solid Snake.
7708000	7710000	The Phantom Pain just won't sound the same
7710000	7712000	with Keith or Sutherland taking over.
7712000	7714000	Honorable mention for Cameron Clark as
7714000	7716000	Liquid or Master Miller.
7716000	7718000	I do have to insert there.
7718000	7720000	Playing the Dragon Age Inquisition DLC
7720000	7722000	because he voiced Ren.
7722000	7724000	And I was just having
7724000	7726000	major Metal Gear flashbacks
7726000	7728000	the whole time.
7728000	7730000	Let's see. Moving on to
7730000	7732000	SSJ100Matt says
7736000	7740000	He also has a long resume working on many games.
7740000	7742000	Wing Commander, Darksiders, Kingdom Hearts
7742000	7744000	and of course Batman Arkham games.
7744000	7746000	His Joker role is iconic and
7746000	7748000	certainly can have the case made of
7748000	7750000	being the definitive Joker even
7750000	7752000	amongst the movie Jokers.
7752000	7754000	And I don't think there's really a lot of
7754000	7756000	people that would argue with you on that to be honest.
7756000	7758000	So, let's see.
7758000	7760000	Asking around in the room here.
7760000	7762000	Dark Sakura, what is your favorite
7762000	7764000	voice actor or actress performance in a game
7764000	7766000	and why is it Jennifer Hale?
7766000	7768000	Laughter
7768000	7770000	Laughter
7770000	7772000	Laughter
7772000	7774000	Am I right or am I right?
7774000	7776000	I love Jennifer Hale so much.
7776000	7778000	Well, I mean it's not just the whole
7778000	7780000	You're gonna cry at GamerX3
7780000	7782000	I just know it.
7782000	7784000	It's not the whole fem-shep thing.
7784000	7786000	She plays so many
7786000	7788000	good, strong female characters
7788000	7790000	that I can't help but go
7790000	7792000	doki-doki in my heart.
7792000	7794000	But
7794000	7796000	I'm actually gonna go
7796000	7798000	This is
7798000	7800000	his favorite voice actor
7800000	7802000	in games in general.
7802000	7804000	Or his particular performance.
7804000	7806000	Like Balthier for me
7806000	7808000	would have probably been my answer too.
7808000	7810000	I've got voices that I can
7810000	7812000	pick out anywhere.
7812000	7814000	I can pick her out.
7814000	7816000	Everyone who has
7816000	7818000	ears can pick out Gideon Emery in anything
7818000	7820000	he ever does because
7820000	7822000	that gravel. Oh god.
7822000	7824000	Shivers, shivers, shivers.
7824000	7826000	You alright? You need a moment?
7826000	7828000	Laughter
7828000	7830000	But the hard thing for me is that
7830000	7832000	I can't, once I recognize
7832000	7834000	a name with a voice
7834000	7836000	I can't unrecognize it.
7836000	7838000	Do you know what I mean?
7838000	7840000	So I keep, there's characters
7840000	7842000	who I would probably think were kinda crap characters
7842000	7844000	but I love them for the voice actor.
7844000	7846000	I mean
7846000	7848000	there's voice actors that I
7848000	7850000	would love to hear in
7850000	7852000	modern games. I mean
7852000	7854000	God, my youth.
7856000	7858000	Oh, is that it?
7858000	7860000	No, I just actually had
7860000	7862000	a moment of nostalgia because
7862000	7864000	Chris Latta
7864000	7866000	I would have loved if
7866000	7868000	he was still around.
7868000	7870000	Alan
7870000	7872000	you pretty much already said yours
7872000	7874000	any other shout outs you want to give there?
7874000	7876000	Shout out to the voice actor
7876000	7878000	for Hoagie in Day of the Tentacle
7878000	7880000	he was the big kind of chunky
7880000	7882000	rock and roll dude with Bernard
7882000	7884000	and the way that
7884000	7886000	that voice was delivered was very
7886000	7888000	I guess against type where he sounded
7888000	7890000	sort of like the rich snotty
7890000	7892000	dude on Gilligan's Island. That's in the early
7892000	7894000	days of voice acting too because voice
7894000	7896000	acting showed up on computers way before
7896000	7898000	there was the CD talky version that was
7898000	7900000	ten dollars more when these people just got it on
7900000	7902000	three and a half diskette.
7902000	7904000	So that, the way that character was done
7904000	7906000	I really like. And then
7906000	7908000	for his weird, bullshitty
7908000	7910000	sort of fairy tale Xanadu
7910000	7912000	the green ending in
7912000	7914000	Mass Effect 3 is with the whole Shangri-La
7914000	7916000	and everyone. Oh my God.
7916000	7918000	The monologue that Edie gives
7918000	7920000	is incredible. Oh my God.
7920000	7922000	Trisha Helfer
7922000	7924000	Six from Battlestar Galactica
7924000	7926000	Yes.
7926000	7928000	Like, you will be moved
7928000	7930000	to tears. Like, it's so good. She's so
7930000	7932000	good. Oh my God.
7932000	7934000	And I was going to say, Balthier
7934000	7936000	probably would have been mine, but for newer
7936000	7938000	performances go, like, you know, again
7938000	7940000	here I go, fanboy, but seriously
7940000	7942000	one of my favorite performances
7942000	7944000	Sivan Hewlett, who does
7944000	7946000	Yasael in Final Fantasy 14
7946000	7948000	He was going to say Yasael in Heaven's
7948000	7950000	World is great. Oh my God. She is
7950000	7952000	so good. And some of the
7952000	7954000	scenes in Heaven's World with her
7954000	7956000	wow. That's all I'm
7956000	7958000	going to say. I don't want to spoil, but wow.
7958000	7960000	I am going to, though, bring up
7960000	7962000	actually a pair of performances because they're in
7962000	7964000	the same game.
7964000	7966000	OK. I had really high
7966000	7968000	standards for the Berserk games
7968000	7970000	as in Berserk as in
7970000	7972000	from the manga and anime
7972000	7974000	you know, with Gatsu and everything
7974000	7976000	because one of my favorite Japanese voice
7976000	7978000	actors was Gatsu
7978000	7982000	Great. Now I can't
7982000	7984000	say his name, but he was also
7984000	7986000	Toski in Fushigi Yugi
7986000	7988000	and who else did
7988000	7990000	Basara in
7990000	7992000	Macross 7 and
7992000	7994000	why can't
7994000	7996000	Nobutoshi
7996000	7998000	first name. Anyway, so
7998000	8000000	I was like, OK, I'm not going to like the
8000000	8002000	US version of Berserk. I'm not going to like it. I'm not going to like
8002000	8004000	I'm not going to like it. And then I heard Michael
8004000	8006000	Bell. I was like
8006000	8008000	and then I heard BJ Ward and I'm like
8008000	8010000	I was like
8010000	8012000	it's like Voltron in a
8012000	8014000	different universe. My brains, I can't shut
8014000	8016000	them off. So, yeah.
8016000	8018000	And I actually have to think
8018000	8020000	S.J. 100 Matt for bringing up Tim Curry
8020000	8022000	doing voice actors. Yeah, I was just going to say
8022000	8024000	S.J. 100 Matt, let's not forget the various
8024000	8026000	roles Tim Curry did. Honestly,
8026000	8028000	you just won right there. And Nolan
8028000	8030000	North. That's it. Nolan North. There's nothing
8030000	8032000	else to say after Tim Curry. Our Deadpool.
8032000	8034000	Nothing else to say. Tim Curry
8034000	8036000	the end. Rob.
8036000	8038000	What?
8038000	8040000	Ah, Tim Curry.
8040000	8042000	Alright, let's get back into some more. He was the first
8042000	8044000	man that ever scared me in a movie.
8044000	8046000	Oh, what? As Darkness or It?
8046000	8048000	Legend. It was all legend.
8048000	8050000	Or Rooster in Annie.
8050000	8052000	No, it was
8052000	8054000	Legend.
8054000	8056000	Alright. We're going to get back
8056000	8058000	to some gaming news and then of course your phone calls
8058000	8060000	coming up in a little while. 1877 Game OLR
8060000	8062000	username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio
8062000	8064000	all one word. But some more gaming news
8064000	8066000	to get out there. Alan. As we like to say
8066000	8068000	on OLR, hackers going to hack.
8068000	8070000	Not necessarily
8070000	8072000	the standard usage for that phrase
8072000	8074000	with this story. But a third party
8074000	8076000	has come out with
8076000	8078000	a little device which I imagine
8078000	8080000	is going to be sued
8080000	8082000	into the atmosphere and stripped off
8082000	8084000	the face of the earth. They have a little
8084000	8086000	neat device called the Amico.
8086000	8088000	Or Ami-quo. It's A-M-I-I-Q-O.
8088000	8090000	The price
8090000	8092000	given is
8092000	8094000	49.75 pounds. So I
8094000	8096000	believe it is a European creation.
8096000	8098000	I think that's what? 60 or 70 bucks
8098000	8100000	American. What this thing
8100000	8102000	does, and why it's going
8102000	8104000	to be probably blasted off the face of the earth
8104000	8106000	is a lot of people
8106000	8108000	when the Ami-Bos, the little Wii U
8108000	8110000	figures were announced, a lot of people were upset
8110000	8112000	that they can only store data for one game at a time.
8112000	8114000	So if you have your Princess Peach
8114000	8116000	Amiibo, you can have your Smash
8116000	8118000	your custom Peach Smash character on
8118000	8120000	the figure. Or
8120000	8122000	you can have your custom Peach Mario Kart
8122000	8124000	on the figure. What this thing does
8124000	8126000	is it lets you, you also have to
8126000	8128000	have an NFC compatible
8128000	8130000	Android device
8130000	8132000	like any Samsung phone from the past three years
8132000	8134000	to interact with this
8134000	8136000	thing. What it does is it lets you
8136000	8138000	back up those
8138000	8140000	NFC
8140000	8142000	or ARFID, whatever, the
8142000	8144000	little data that is on the
8144000	8146000	Amiibo. You can back it up so you can
8146000	8148000	not have to buy the Fireball Mario
8148000	8150000	versus the regular doing the
8150000	8152000	Mario pose Amiibo because they have three different
8152000	8154000	Mario ones now. You can
8154000	8156000	just swap out the data using this device
8156000	8158000	and not
8158000	8160000	have to go completely bankrupt on Amiibos.
8160000	8162000	Also, and this is the
8162000	8164000	big, the real big one,
8164000	8166000	it lets you download
8166000	8168000	Amiibo
8168000	8170000	character profiles like the
8170000	8172000	unique identifier for NES, the unique identifier
8172000	8174000	for Pac-Man. And it lets
8174000	8176000	you emulate that so
8176000	8178000	that when you put it on the Wii U
8178000	8180000	pad, it'll think that you have
8180000	8182000	whatever character that is and it'll unlock
8182000	8184000	whatever goodies.
8184000	8186000	It honestly doesn't surprise me
8186000	8188000	that
8188000	8190000	something like this happened.
8190000	8192000	I'm surprised it took
8192000	8194000	this long, honestly. I'm surprised
8194000	8196000	it's not on the phone because of all the near-field
8196000	8198000	stuff on the phone.
8198000	8200000	So this is just
8200000	8202000	an interesting thing.
8202000	8204000	Yeah.
8204000	8206000	So each
8206000	8208000	Amiibo device comes preloaded with
8208000	8210000	data for 10 figurines
8210000	8212000	and 200 figurines can be stored
8212000	8214000	in it in total.
8214000	8216000	The downside, of course, is you don't get the figurines
8216000	8218000	themselves, but
8218000	8220000	I would think that if you sought out this device
8220000	8222000	and purchased one, you knew exactly what you were
8222000	8224000	doing and what you were going to use it for.
8224000	8226000	That means your figurines can stay
8226000	8228000	on your shelf and look pretty forever.
8228000	8230000	When was the last time there was a sort of
8230000	8232000	bootleg device like this?
8232000	8234000	What if we needed
8234000	8236000	one like that? Because
8236000	8238000	usually peripherals, they don't
8238000	8240000	really need to be... I keep thinking back
8240000	8242000	to the Ninja Pass and the
8242000	8244000	loaders.
8244000	8246000	3DS loaders, yeah.
8246000	8248000	3DS loader, exactly.
8248000	8250000	Alright. Well, moving
8250000	8252000	on to a story. I just have to bring this up in chat
8252000	8254000	because this is so hilarious what's happening right now.
8254000	8256000	Oh, act deaf.
8256000	8258000	SS2-100 Matt, because we brought up
8258000	8260000	Tim Curry a minute ago, right? And what a
8260000	8262000	legend he is just in everything
8262000	8264000	but that he also did voice acting against.
8264000	8266000	Oh, come on. I can watch the worst witch on repeat
8266000	8268000	because of him. SS2-100 Matt brought up in chat.
8268000	8270000	Oh, my God. I just realized Greg Berger
8270000	8272000	worked with Tim Curry on
8272000	8274000	Real Monsters. We had someone on the show
8274000	8276000	who worked with Tim Curry and that just made me
8276000	8278000	realize I has failed you as an interviewer
8278000	8280000	in every possible way. You didn't fail.
8280000	8282000	No, I completely failed. But here
8282000	8284000	it is. Gray Knight
8284000	8286000	potentially saving the day in our
8286000	8288000	chat room over hearing all this saying, did you want me to
8288000	8290000	ask Greg another question for you?
8290000	8292000	And I was like,
8292000	8294000	yes.
8294000	8296000	Yes, please.
8296000	8298000	I just need to find the old
8298000	8300000	Rocky pictures of you in the corset.
8300000	8302000	Or not. Maybe
8302000	8304000	some things our listeners don't need to see.
8304000	8306000	It's a radio show. Let's leave
8306000	8308000	it that way.
8308000	8310000	Why did you say that
8310000	8312000	on air? I hate you.
8312000	8314000	People don't know that you've been Frank
8314000	8316000	before, Rob.
8318000	8320000	Gray Knight says,
8320000	8322000	what do you want me to ask him?
8322000	8324000	Okay, because we just know
8324000	8326000	that we had a connection with someone on the show
8326000	8328000	who worked with Tim Curry.
8328000	8330000	I think the question would be what?
8330000	8332000	Did you get to meet
8332000	8334000	him?
8334000	8336000	How was
8336000	8338000	working with Tim Curry, I guess.
8338000	8340000	But then I worry that it was the whole thing where they were
8340000	8342000	isolated in the booths and he's going to come back and say
8342000	8344000	I never got to meet the guy because we all did
8344000	8346000	our stuff at the same time.
8346000	8348000	That's not a game.
8348000	8350000	It doesn't matter. Oh yes, right.
8350000	8352000	Cartoons are sometimes a group reading.
8352000	8354000	We're going to gamble. Did you get to meet him?
8354000	8356000	And if so, just
8356000	8358000	literally tell us anything about Tim Curry because we all
8358000	8360000	worship him here at OLR.
8360000	8362000	And in life.
8362000	8364000	Is there anybody out there who doesn't worship
8364000	8366000	Tim Curry? If so, I need you to
8366000	8368000	stop listening.
8368000	8370000	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
8370000	8372000	Just to comment on what Dungeon Buster said about
8372000	8374000	Tim Curry as Gabriel Knight in the
8374000	8376000	Sierra Adventure Game Classic.
8376000	8378000	Which wasn't Roberta Williams.
8378000	8380000	It was another woman
8380000	8382000	who wrote that.
8382000	8384000	I've played that game.
8384000	8386000	Tim Curry is incredible as Gabriel Knight.
8386000	8388000	However, the fact that
8388000	8390000	Gabriel Knight is supposed to be
8390000	8392000	a creole womanizing
8392000	8394000	20-something with a thick New Orleans accent.
8394000	8396000	Tim Curry was a very
8396000	8398000	strange choice
8398000	8400000	because his attempt at a New Orleans accent
8400000	8402000	isn't the best.
8402000	8404000	He's still great as Gabriel Knight, but that was just weird
8404000	8406000	casting.
8406000	8408000	Alright.
8408000	8410000	Let's move on to talking about this story here.
8410000	8412000	About Windows 10.
8412000	8414000	You know, a lot of you guys have been upgrading your
8414000	8416000	devices to Windows 10.
8416000	8418000	You know, because they're giving it away now
8418000	8420000	that they are competing with Apple on that front
8420000	8422000	who also gives them away.
8422000	8424000	Windows 10, apparently
8424000	8426000	not playing nice with
8426000	8428000	some DRM. The infamous
8428000	8430000	Secure ROM having issues
8430000	8432000	in Windows 10, as is SafeDisk.
8432000	8434000	Now, Microsoft
8434000	8436000	is saying everything that ran in Windows 7
8436000	8438000	I'm sorry, this isn't the company,
8438000	8440000	but Microsoft's Boris Schneider
8440000	8442000	John, who is
8442000	8444000	being interviewed at Gamescom,
8444000	8446000	saying, everything that
8446000	8448000	ran in Windows 7 should also run in
8448000	8450000	Windows 10. There are just two silly exceptions.
8450000	8452000	Antivirus software and stuff that's
8452000	8454000	deeply embedded into the system.
8454000	8456000	And there are old games on CD-ROM that have
8456000	8458000	DRM. This DRM stuff is also
8458000	8460000	deeply embedded in your system.
8460000	8462000	And that's where Windows 10 says, sorry,
8462000	8464000	we can't allow that because that would be a
8464000	8466000	possible loophole for computer viruses.
8466000	8468000	That's why there's a couple games from
8468000	8470000	2003 to 2008 with Secure ROM that
8470000	8472000	don't run without no CD patches and such.
8472000	8474000	We can just not
8474000	8476000	support that if it's a possible danger for
8476000	8478000	our users. There are a couple patches from
8478000	8480000	developers already and there's stuff like good old games
8480000	8482000	where you'll find versions of those games
8482000	8484000	that work. So, this
8484000	8486000	is also in response to, I think, a lot of those
8486000	8488000	sensational headlines
8488000	8490000	that were out last week that Windows 10 is gonna
8490000	8492000	sneak into your house in the middle of the night and
8492000	8494000	install all your pirated software and things like
8494000	8496000	that. And in reality, there's
8496000	8498000	nothing in the user license agreement
8498000	8500000	that wasn't already there before.
8500000	8502000	But
8502000	8504000	we all know that Secure ROM and all that
8504000	8506000	DRM stuff was way too restrictive and terrible
8506000	8508000	so it's no surprise that it's
8508000	8510000	already broken as
8510000	8512000	Microsoft regulates heavier
8512000	8514000	which you can and can't do.
8514000	8516000	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us next?
8516000	8518000	Stuff and things. In this case,
8518000	8520000	some UK news because we like to
8520000	8522000	give some attention to our friends
8522000	8524000	overseas. The UK
8524000	8526000	Committee of Advertising Practice
8526000	8528000	which is pretty much a watchdog agency
8528000	8530000	for advertising rules
8530000	8532000	and making sure they're enforced
8532000	8534000	has put out official
8534000	8536000	guidance for video game
8536000	8538000	content makers that take
8538000	8540000	payments to promote
8540000	8542000	products in their game. Basically,
8542000	8544000	it's controlling product placement.
8544000	8546000	So, you know, when you're driving along in your
8546000	8548000	racing game and you see a Valvoline
8548000	8550000	ad for it, they're
8550000	8552000	going to be the watchers for this in the
8552000	8554000	UK. So in the new rules,
8554000	8556000	basically, you can't
8556000	8558000	endorse or
8558000	8560000	promote a product that
8560000	8562000	has been paid without offering a
8562000	8564000	full and highly visible
8564000	8566000	disclosure. So basically,
8566000	8568000	if you take the money for the product
8568000	8570000	and
8570000	8572000	the ad is there, it has to
8572000	8574000	be marked as such.
8574000	8576000	So this is
8576000	8578000	really going in after an
8578000	8580000	advertising standards authority investigation
8580000	8582000	basically found that content
8582000	8584000	creators were failing to properly
8584000	8586000	disclose that they had been paid to
8586000	8588000	promote the products.
8588000	8590000	So,
8590000	8592000	yeah, it's got to be fully
8592000	8594000	in place on there now.
8594000	8596000	However,
8596000	8598000	it has said that
8598000	8600000	YouTubers basically
8600000	8602000	who are doing streaming content, they don't
8602000	8604000	have to say anything about
8604000	8606000	that because
8606000	8608000	they didn't pay for the content.
8608000	8610000	However, YouTubers that are
8610000	8612000	being paid to promote the games,
8612000	8614000	they need to be
8614000	8616000	upfront and say, we were paid
8616000	8618000	to play this and review it.
8618000	8620000	Interesting.
8620000	8622000	You know, and the YouTube gaming is just going to
8622000	8624000	get bigger and bigger. You know, I thought their dedicated
8624000	8626000	gaming thing was supposed to launch by now. Maybe
8626000	8628000	I thought it was late August. Maybe it was September.
8628000	8630000	But I think that's just, there's
8630000	8632000	heavy, heavy rumors too. You know,
8632000	8634000	rumor, can of salt, that
8634000	8636000	the next PlayStation 4 firmware
8636000	8638000	that's coming out towards the end of the year will
8638000	8640000	stream to YouTube gaming
8640000	8642000	when that is all worked out. So maybe they're
8642000	8644000	waiting on that. I don't know. Anyway, sorry.
8644000	8646000	Interesting timing with
8646000	8648000	what you're saying. Well, there have been,
8648000	8650000	there was kind of a stink going
8650000	8652000	on around that about Twitch players
8652000	8654000	and folks on YouTube and whatnot who
8654000	8656000	were live reviewing
8656000	8658000	or doing reviews of games, you know,
8658000	8660000	without saying, well, hey,
8660000	8662000	we were given a promo
8662000	8664000	copy of this or so and so.
8664000	8666000	I
8666000	8668000	personally would like to know up front, by the
8668000	8670000	way, if someone is reviewing a promotional
8670000	8672000	copy and
8672000	8674000	that they say up front, I am,
8674000	8676000	this is an unbiased review
8676000	8678000	of whatever the
8678000	8680000	hell game this is. And
8680000	8682000	just so y'all know, over at vognetwork.com
8682000	8684000	where we do have reviews,
8684000	8686000	Eric RPG's been posting a lot of
8686000	8688000	cool video game reviews. In fact, he just
8688000	8690000	did the Oni Chimbara sequel just
8690000	8692000	today that went up. And we always do say, we
8692000	8694000	say it at the end, we don't say it at the beginning, but it's there
8694000	8696000	in the same size font and everything else. And it
8696000	8698000	actually says how we got the game. Did we
8698000	8700000	get a code? Did we, you know,
8700000	8702000	and if for whatever reason we were
8702000	8704000	actually paid to play a game, that never happened,
8704000	8706000	but if it happened, it would be there.
8706000	8708000	It would be there. Yes. Now,
8708000	8710000	I've been paid to break
8710000	8712000	software. Now,
8712000	8714000	before we get to the next story, this is
8714000	8716000	very important. Uh oh.
8716000	8718000	Tonight has come back with an answer
8718000	8720000	from Greg.
8720000	8722000	Frequently, I worked with
8722000	8724000	Tim Curry on Ah, Real
8724000	8726000	Monsters and Duckman.
8726000	8728000	So you guys,
8728000	8730000	it's official.
8730000	8732000	We here at Orange Lounge Radio,
8732000	8734000	as of tonight, are two
8734000	8736000	degrees of separation from Tim Curry.
8736000	8738000	I
8738000	8740000	need a minute. Rob's a little
8740000	8742000	verklempt. You thought you fan-boyed
8742000	8744000	over the... Talk amongst yourselves. You thought you fan-boyed
8744000	8746000	over the Grimlock thing.
8746000	8748000	I'll give you a topic. My love
8748000	8750000	for Tim Curry is
8750000	8752000	very, very deep.
8752000	8754000	Really? Tell us how you really feel.
8754000	8756000	Don't take it to a dirty place.
8756000	8758000	I didn't! I've loved him
8758000	8760000	since I was in grade school, so don't make it
8760000	8762000	dirty. Wadsworth and Clue,
8762000	8764000	there it is.
8764000	8766000	Oh my gosh. Yes, the answer
8766000	8768000	is yes.
8768000	8770000	Great. Would you like to
8770000	8772000	interview Tim Curry? If his health is up to it.
8772000	8774000	Yes, if his health is up to it. That's the most
8774000	8776000	important thing in the world, is his health.
8776000	8778000	Because he is a national treasure and must be protected.
8778000	8780000	But if he's up to it...
8780000	8782000	I have to say it was
8782000	8784000	actually a little heartbreaking to see
8784000	8786000	the pictures that came out after
8786000	8788000	his recovery. My dad
8788000	8790000	had a stroke.
8790000	8792000	I just was...
8792000	8794000	It's sort of when you know someone
8794000	8796000	who's been through that and then you see someone
8796000	8798000	who's been an icon of
8798000	8800000	most of your life suffering
8800000	8802000	through the same thing, it's sort of
8802000	8804000	the empathy level is there.
8806000	8808000	I will say
8808000	8810000	this as well though is that
8810000	8812000	people can also make great
8812000	8814000	recoveries. Like Nichelle Nichols
8814000	8816000	going to be at Dragon Con. She had that.
8816000	8818000	And
8818000	8820000	Tracy Morgan from 30 Rock
8820000	8822000	was in that horrific car accident in New Jersey.
8822000	8824000	Was in rehab,
8824000	8826000	physical rehabilitation, not the other type of rehab
8826000	8828000	that a lot of people used to go to. And he's actually going to be
8828000	8830000	doing Saturday Night Live in October and that's fantastic to see.
8830000	8832000	So...
8832000	8834000	SSJ 100 Matt says, I'm happy I derailed
8834000	8836000	the show for this. Oh and that's really
8836000	8838000	good. Gray Knight says
8838000	8840000	Charlie Adler is very good
8840000	8842000	friends with him. Tim is doing fairly well
8842000	8844000	to my knowledge. Yeah.
8844000	8846000	I think that could be like
8846000	8848000	a lifetime goal up there.
8848000	8850000	I actually have done a bit of
8850000	8852000	design work for a few
8852000	8854000	stroke survivor and
8854000	8856000	therapy non-profits.
8856000	8858000	My...
8858000	8860000	I'll just go ahead and say this right now. I lost
8860000	8862000	my maternal grandmother
8862000	8864000	after complications from several
8864000	8866000	strokes and my dad is in a nursing
8866000	8868000	home right now. I think you've
8868000	8870000	mentioned some of this in prior episodes.
8870000	8872000	This is what you've been dealing with this year.
8872000	8874000	Anyone who has
8874000	8876000	been through that and recovers from it
8876000	8878000	it takes a lot
8878000	8880000	of determination so
8880000	8882000	it's kind of a big thing for me.
8882000	8884000	Sure. I understand. Anyhow,
8884000	8886000	I'm going to try my best not to just lose it
8886000	8888000	and fanboy out right now.
8888000	8890000	My people will have to talk to your people. Good sir.
8890000	8892000	In the interest of
8892000	8894000	the utmost professionalism, I must move
8894000	8896000	on with more gaming news.
8896000	8898000	Alan, you've got more for us.
8898000	8900000	This story is near and dear to my heart.
8900000	8902000	A
8902000	8904000	creator named Thomas Cole has released
8904000	8906000	a fan game
8906000	8908000	called Halfline. It is a
8908000	8910000	mashup of Half Life 2 and Hotline
8910000	8912000	Miami. It has the graphical
8912000	8914000	8 slash 16 bit style
8914000	8916000	of Hotline Miami, the top
8916000	8918000	down isometric view and the incredibly
8918000	8920000	fast paced
8920000	8922000	sort of
8922000	8924000	tank control run and gun action as
8924000	8926000	Hotline Miami except the
8926000	8928000	sprites and the overall
8928000	8930000	levels are
8930000	8932000	basically follow the story of Half Life 2.
8932000	8934000	The first one is the train station
8934000	8936000	and then I imagine you go to the
8936000	8938000	prison. You can
8938000	8940000	download it on
8940000	8942000	I think it's
8942000	8944000	itch.io
8944000	8946000	itch.io
8946000	8948000	just
8948000	8950000	google
8950000	8952000	Halfline
8952000	8954000	fan game
8954000	8956000	and check it out. I'm definitely going to
8956000	8958000	get it before it disappears.
8958000	8960000	Before it gets cease and desisted. Yeah.
8960000	8962000	Like all the good ones do, right?
8962000	8964000	Alright, well the Game Awards
8964000	8966000	was an experimental thing that happened
8966000	8968000	last year and it was
8968000	8970000	it was okay. I mean it was
8970000	8972000	it had some flaws but for a
8972000	8974000	first year thing it really, it could have been a lot
8974000	8976000	worse. Let's put it that way.
8976000	8978000	Excuse me.
8978000	8980000	It is happening
8980000	8982000	again this year and
8982000	8984000	apparently this, I don't know
8984000	8986000	why it's making the rounds on game blogs this week
8986000	8988000	because I think it was announced in June
8988000	8990000	but now all the news sites are
8990000	8992000	picking up on it because it was tweeted
8992000	8994000	that the Game Awards 2015
8994000	8996000	are coming this December and
8996000	8998000	stay tuned for more news soon
8998000	9000000	and that was on the official Twitter.
9000000	9002000	I think the problem was the news came
9002000	9004000	out during E3 so most people
9004000	9006000	missed it there so we'll see
9006000	9008000	if they make some of the improvements this year. I got to say
9008000	9010000	it was really awkward the whole like
9010000	9012000	I'm going to interview you and then oh hey you won
9012000	9014000	this award. I'm just going to pull this out of my jacket. You got
9014000	9016000	an award too. I understand they got to keep
9016000	9018000	it moving quickly but then
9018000	9020000	there were some things they did right
9020000	9022000	like the tribute to
9022000	9024000	Roberta Williams and that
9024000	9026000	whole, that was fantastic.
9026000	9028000	So there's
9028000	9030000	there's room for improvement
9030000	9032000	but it could have been a lot worse.
9032000	9034000	Anyhow it's time to get to the mailbag
9034000	9036000	every week Dark Soccer jumps into the mailbag
9036000	9038000	but was there
9038000	9040000	anything to be found this week?
9040000	9042000	Not a damn thing.
9042000	9044000	I'm actually sad.
9044000	9046000	At this point I would
9046000	9048000	take Ross till UT sending an email.
9048000	9050000	Oh stop. You like reading his
9050000	9052000	emails. I do like reading his emails.
9052000	9054000	Um.
9054000	9056000	Well that's it. Kill the music.
9056000	9058000	No. No emails.
9058000	9060000	No.
9060000	9062000	Now it's gotten to the point. See usually Dark Soccer
9062000	9064000	is like I don't want to work but now
9064000	9066000	it's been so many weeks.
9066000	9068000	Dear Rob. Dear me.
9068000	9070000	Jamie is the best
9070000	9072000	email reader in the universe
9072000	9074000	and bite my butt.
9074000	9076000	Love Jamie.
9076000	9078000	P.S.
9078000	9080000	Alright
9080000	9082000	well this seems like an appropriate
9082000	9084000	transition to get into a reoccurring
9084000	9086000	segment we do every week here on Orange
9086000	9088000	Lounge Radio. Why?
9088000	9090000	I don't know because we got feelings and stuff.
9090000	9092000	It's the FUs of the week time.
9106000	9108000	Dark Soccer?
9108000	9110000	FU to the person who
9110000	9112000	was doing
9112000	9114000	how fast were they going?
9114000	9116000	30 in a 45 zone
9116000	9118000	because drivers
9118000	9120000	and
9120000	9122000	FU
9122000	9124000	to situations.
9124000	9126000	Um.
9126000	9128000	Not going into a lot of detail.
9128000	9130000	Pretty personal.
9130000	9132000	But
9132000	9134000	situations.
9134000	9136000	Uh. Alan you want to go next with your FU of the week?
9136000	9138000	Sure.
9138000	9140000	FU to work not having
9140000	9142000	very many hours.
9142000	9144000	Um. Not really.
9144000	9146000	FU to not paying attention to your diet
9146000	9148000	and what you eat and how active you've been and then
9148000	9150000	gaining weight because that's what happens when you
9150000	9152000	do those things. And FU to
9152000	9154000	being kind of starving because you forgot
9154000	9156000	to eat lunch and I make star dinner after
9156000	9158000	my last story. Alright that's fair.
9158000	9160000	It's going to be spaghetti. That's fair.
9160000	9162000	Mmm spaghetti. Uh.
9162000	9164000	My FU of the week. Actually you know I talked about
9164000	9166000	my big personal change last week on the
9166000	9168000	show and I have nothing bad
9168000	9170000	to say about that. Everything
9170000	9172000	my send off at my prior job
9172000	9174000	everybody was fantastic and
9174000	9176000	it was really more than I could ask for.
9176000	9178000	And I'm really excited about
9178000	9180000	the prospect of new jobs so how can I possibly
9180000	9182000	be mad at any of that right now? I'm
9182000	9184000	actually have nothing to say negative at all.
9184000	9186000	So I guess I'm going to give like a completely
9186000	9188000	like not serious
9188000	9190000	like tongue in cheek FU and I'm just going to
9190000	9192000	say FU to
9192000	9194000	the blue team at Ingress who have been
9194000	9196000	stepping up the pressure lately and Megan Allen
9196000	9198000	and I actually work harder. Do I need to download
9198000	9200000	that game again? Yes play with us.
9200000	9202000	Play with us. But I
9202000	9204000	deleted it because I needed the brain.
9204000	9206000	Enlighten the planet Dark Saga. Being real
9206000	9208000	Jamie I wouldn't worry about it.
9208000	9210000	Yeah.
9210000	9212000	Because like it was funny that Konami thing is like
9212000	9214000	how often do you play games
9214000	9216000	on this device? Well on
9216000	9218000	your mobile phone I'm like I play Bejeweled.
9218000	9220000	No I don't. You got to do your Bejeweled
9220000	9222000	daily. As much
9222000	9224000	shit as you all give me for it which is fine it's
9224000	9226000	deserved. I do get hardcore about it but I get hardcore
9226000	9228000	a lot about a lot of MMOs.
9228000	9230000	I do more exercise because of that game
9230000	9232000	period. It has impacted me
9232000	9234000	positively in that regard. If Ingress
9234000	9236000	actually did have the functionality to use my
9236000	9238000	Apple Watch I would probably play it a lot more.
9238000	9240000	See because they're a Google company it works
9240000	9242000	with the other watch but I don't think the
9242000	9244000	Apple Watch works yet.
9244000	9246000	It's probably coming though. Actually with
9246000	9248000	the Google alphabet thing
9248000	9250000	and the antique who made Ingress is now
9250000	9252000	separate from Google. So that may
9252000	9254000	happen in the future.
9254000	9256000	That and WatchOS
9256000	9258000	2.0 is out eventually.
9258000	9260000	It's in testing right now.
9260000	9262000	I mean the open beta is for it.
9262000	9264000	Gotcha. And for those
9264000	9266000	listening. I didn't really mean that.
9266000	9268000	I mean just
9268000	9270000	in case you happen to be a blue player that's
9270000	9272000	listening it's whatever.
9272000	9274000	It's just a game for fuck's sake.
9274000	9276000	But I can still get huffy and puffy.
9276000	9278000	Evidence that Rob
9278000	9280000	is really into this game.
9280000	9282000	Blow your portal over. Two weeks ago or
9282000	9284000	last weekend he asked us
9284000	9286000	so Alan would you judge me if
9286000	9288000	I agreed to do an op.
9288000	9290000	And an op in Ingress is when a bunch of people
9290000	9292000	go out because it's a GPS game.
9292000	9294000	So you have to go out to the location to do whatever
9294000	9296000	stuff you want to do. Would you be mad
9296000	9298000	if I went and did an Ingress op at 3 AM
9298000	9300000	on Saturday?
9300000	9302000	And I was like I'll judge you a little bit
9302000	9304000	but you do you girl.
9304000	9306000	You do what you want. The late night
9306000	9308000	stuff is fun. And they do it at
9308000	9310000	3 AM because obviously
9310000	9312000	anyone with sense is asleep.
9312000	9314000	So whatever
9314000	9316000	you choose. When I was
9316000	9318000	kind of playing
9318000	9320000	I did go over to Dad's
9320000	9322000	kitchen in Folsom and saw
9322000	9324000	the bottle cap bench
9324000	9326000	that is like one of their landmark
9326000	9328000	whatever the hell it is.
9328000	9330000	And I rubbed my butt on it.
9330000	9332000	Because it was the other team.
9332000	9334000	I
9334000	9336000	I
9336000	9338000	because I wasn't high enough to attack
9338000	9340000	or do anything.
9340000	9342000	And then I was like and
9342000	9344000	Dan's like what are you doing as like
9344000	9346000	I'm just rubbing my butt on this portal.
9346000	9348000	I was like I did it at
9348000	9350000	a spike.
9350000	9352000	And I think that was when
9352000	9354000	I finally stopped playing. I know exactly
9354000	9356000	what portal that is.
9356000	9358000	And exactly yeah
9358000	9360000	that portal is usually blue for reasons
9360000	9362000	but it's oh my god I'm dying.
9362000	9364000	I'm dying. I thought that you would
9364000	9366000	appreciate that story. And I said it
9366000	9368000	live on air. Thank you.
9368000	9370000	So that you would stop fangirling over
9370000	9372000	Tim Curry. All right. Thank you.
9372000	9374000	I appreciate you taking my mind off Tim Curry
9374000	9376000	with your assing of portals.
9376000	9378000	All right.
9378000	9380000	Just a couple more stories for you guys.
9380000	9382000	And then we're going to get to the Skype line at
9382000	9384000	1877 Game OLR. Our username
9384000	9386000	on Skype Orange Lounge Radio.
9386000	9388000	Alan? Is it me? Yeah.
9388000	9390000	OK. So. Is it me? It's you?
9390000	9392000	I try
9392000	9394000	not to be a petty person but
9394000	9396000	sometimes it's a lot of fun.
9396000	9398000	Shut up.
9398000	9400000	So someone noticed
9400000	9402000	that at JB Hi-Fi
9402000	9404000	which is a retailer in Australia
9404000	9406000	someone who worked at that
9406000	9408000	store did their own
9408000	9410000	little banner
9410000	9412000	for their shelf that has
9412000	9414000	pre-order copies of Metal Gear
9414000	9416000	Solid 5 The Phantom Pain.
9416000	9418000	Someone put on it
9418000	9420000	it's a Hideo Kojima
9420000	9422000	game because
9422000	9424000	Konami or as I like to refer to them
9424000	9426000	as toilet clowns
9428000	9430000	they
9430000	9432000	they are trying to do some weird
9432000	9434000	Jason Bourne Men in Black
9434000	9436000	number six I'm not a number I am a free man
9436000	9438000	sort of thing
9438000	9440000	Hideo Kojima who's that?
9440000	9442000	We don't like him. He's gone.
9442000	9444000	Just strip the name off. So this
9444000	9446000	this petty video game employee
9446000	9448000	put up their own
9448000	9450000	Who's one of your heroes?
9450000	9452000	For this? Yeah.
9452000	9454000	So just put up hey this is a Hideo Kojima game
9454000	9456000	and Kojima caught wind of it on
9456000	9458000	Twitter and retweeted it
9458000	9460000	and was like oh yes it is nice
9460000	9462000	for me to get some
9462000	9464000	credit and notoriety that I did in fact
9464000	9466000	make this game. Ooh shade.
9466000	9468000	That's pretty good.
9468000	9470000	So petty, petty, petty
9470000	9472000	but people can be as petty as they
9472000	9474000	want to Konami. So.
9476000	9478000	SSG100Matt in chat says what a
9478000	9480000	rant by Alan and Act F says
9480000	9482000	and you were worried Alan wouldn't fill the rant quota.
9482000	9484000	There
9484000	9486000	it is. Congratulations there Alan.
9486000	9488000	Yes. Speaking of um
9488000	9490000	shade throwing we gotta talk about our fries
9490000	9492000	trivia today. I'm gonna go ahead and uh
9492000	9494000	oh wait shit I got one more story. Hold this thought
9494000	9496000	we're gonna talk about shade throwing
9496000	9498000	right after I talk about this
9498000	9500000	which is just gonna make you
9500000	9502000	well actually this might make you happy.
9502000	9504000	It's gonna make you angry because
9504000	9506000	we're gonna talk about Silent Hills yet again
9506000	9508000	and how it's not happening but
9508000	9510000	do you remember that somebody
9510000	9512000	remade PT and called it
9512000	9514000	Allison Road? They actually
9514000	9516000	kind of remade that PT demo and it was
9516000	9518000	inspired by that. Well now
9518000	9520000	That was named something different
9520000	9522000	cause I still have the freaking installer for it
9522000	9524000	on my Mac. Well
9524000	9526000	It was a punity.
9526000	9528000	Oh there was that too.
9528000	9530000	This is something else. This is something different.
9530000	9532000	But uh Allison Road has actually gone
9532000	9534000	to what else? Kickstarter
9534000	9536000	Hey y'all figure
9536000	9538000	PT would end up on Kickstarter. Kojima
9538000	9540000	and Yomototaro will end up on Kickstarter at some point
9540000	9542000	so the folks behind
9542000	9544000	Allison Road have actually gone to Kickstarter
9544000	9546000	and they are looking to fully
9546000	9548000	realize their game
9548000	9550000	that started as a PT
9550000	9552000	clone essentially. You need to get more
9552000	9554000	information AllisonRoadgame.com
9554000	9556000	I'm gonna have to see if we can get them on the show. I think it'll be fun
9556000	9558000	to talk about. This will take
9558000	9560000	my Kickstarter virginity. Really?
9560000	9562000	Hell yeah.
9562000	9564000	Alright. I'm gonna go ahead and open up the
9564000	9566000	Skype line 1877 game OLR
9566000	9568000	or a username on Skype orange lounge radio
9568000	9570000	all one word. Can we talk about fries? Yes
9570000	9572000	Can we talk about the fries trip and the hilarious
9572000	9574000	thing we saw there? Go ahead. You're a better story
9574000	9576000	teller than me. Go ahead. So obviously
9576000	9578000	this was just a coincidence
9578000	9580000	of them being in between
9580000	9582000	uh moving inventory
9582000	9584000	around. No it was on purpose. Okay it was
9584000	9586000	on purpose. So in the video
9586000	9588000	game section one aisle over
9588000	9590000	the header where on every
9590000	9592000	shelf there's a little thing that tells you what should be on
9592000	9594000	that shelf. At the top there was the
9594000	9596000	Xbox 360 logo and it said
9596000	9598000	360 or Xbox 360
9598000	9600000	accessories except what was
9600000	9602000	actually on the shelf were those little
9602000	9604000	like in a corporate environment when
9604000	9606000	you have your office desk the little trash
9606000	9608000	can. It was trash cans.
9608000	9610000	So they were saying Xbox 360
9610000	9612000	accessories aka trash bins
9612000	9614000	put your 360 in the garbage. I think
9614000	9616000	was the subtext
9616000	9618000	there. Yes. And we
9618000	9620000	saw it and had a good laugh and you
9620000	9622000	put a picture on Twitter. I did at my personal
9622000	9624000	Twitter. Twitter.com slash SKIE
9624000	9626000	I actually was sky SKIE I actually put
9626000	9628000	a picture of the Xbox
9628000	9630000	360 accessories trash but then also
9630000	9632000	like Shane pointed out Shane was with us
9632000	9634000	like just next to that it was something like
9634000	9636000	um Xbox like regular
9636000	9638000	accessories and it was a bunch of frozen
9638000	9640000	lunch pails or something
9640000	9642000	so I was like frozen
9642000	9644000	everything. Frozen has gone too far
9644000	9646000	too far this time
9648000	9650000	anyway again the skype line is
9650000	9652000	open 1877 game

9682000	9684000	a little empty I guess I guess people don't want to follow

9686000	9688000	tonight but I will put out

9944000	9946000	I'm really over due for a trip

9992000	9994000	oh no I was just going to say
9994000	9996000	when he was doing the interview I liked how he would
9996000	9998000	slip into some of his voices there
9998000	10000000	as he was doing the interview does he do that when he's teaching too
10002000	10004000	if somebody asks
10004000	10006000	you know he's really wonderful about that
10006000	10008000	he doesn't mind
10008000	10010000	he's just a sweetheart about that
10010000	10012000	and it's been a great thing
10012000	10014000	putting all these classes together because
10014000	10016000	if you're not in town you might not know about it
10016000	10018000	but you know it's like an old
10018000	10020000	LA thing about all sorts of classes
10020000	10022000	you know there's so many things
10022000	10024000	to choose from and it's really nice
10024000	10026000	for these wonderful teachers
10026000	10028000	so although Jamie was actually asking
10028000	10030000	about the strain on your voice
10030000	10032000	and I hear that a lot
10032000	10034000	what they alluded to
10034000	10036000	specifically with video games
10036000	10038000	well you know even
10038000	10040000	I didn't want to make it about me
10040000	10042000	but now I can make it about me because
10042000	10044000	we're old friends and we're at the back
10044000	10046000	of the show but you know I used
10046000	10048000	to MC Rocky Horror Picture Show and other cult
10048000	10050000	movies like Repo and some of
10050000	10052000	that stuff here in Sacramento and
10052000	10054000	even just yelling at Rocky Horror
10054000	10056000	for two hours on end the next day I've come
10056000	10058000	into OLR and you guys go back a couple
10058000	10060000	years in the show I've done OLR sounding
10060000	10062000	like this and it's because of the strain I put on
10062000	10064000	my voice the night before when I was doing
10064000	10066000	Rocky Horror and that's just
10066000	10068000	a couple hours of being loud and obnoxious
10068000	10070000	in front of a cloud of 500 and then
10070000	10072000	you know I'm a teacher by day as
10072000	10074000	well the corporate type
10074000	10076000	and so you know that can put a strain on my voice
10076000	10078000	as well so like I
10078000	10080000	hear you in it but it's one of those things
10080000	10082000	like until David or Gray
10082000	10084000	you know says it like
10084000	10086000	oh yeah my god when they go into those
10086000	10088000	booths there must be like
10088000	10090000	that time when they have to do the war
10090000	10092000	calls and the my character's getting
10092000	10094000	shot and stabbed stuff you know
10094000	10096000	and it's like oh my gosh that's got to be crazy on the
10096000	10098000	voice. Allen?
10098000	10100000	Oh yeah especially with a lot of those fantasy
10100000	10102000	games or war games
10102000	10104000	there's an incredible amount I've heard all sorts
10104000	10106000	of interviews and actors talking about
10106000	10108000	you know just streaming for hours
10108000	10110000	I mean you know it depends on the context
10110000	10112000	for example like you know if it's a union
10112000	10114000	job you know they make efforts
10114000	10116000	to try to protect the actors or
10116000	10118000	you know things happen anyway at the job
10118000	10120000	or they try to give them notice but even
10120000	10122000	I had a session you know where I went in and
10122000	10124000	I did no shit about it
10124000	10126000	I was screaming for two hours at the top of my lungs
10126000	10128000	so I mean people try to employ
10128000	10130000	you know various vocal
10130000	10132000	techniques too or you know there are certain
10132000	10134000	ways to scream you know that don't
10134000	10136000	damage your voice as much but you know if it's really
10136000	10138000	emotional you have to try to do it and
10138000	10140000	I guess the best you can try to do is
10140000	10142000	you know like the first
10142000	10144000	time as much as you can I guess
10145000	10147000	Alan wanted to jump in here and say something too
10147000	10149000	I've heard from other
10149000	10151000	podcast interviews that a lot of
10151000	10153000	beginning
10153000	10155000	voice actors sort of a rookie mistake they make
10155000	10157000	when they're just starting to get regular work
10157000	10159000	is they will come up with a voice
10159000	10161000	for a character for like a Cartoon
10161000	10163000	Network show and they really love
10163000	10165000	the voice that they came up with and they can't wait
10165000	10167000	to show the producer and then when they get
10167000	10169000	in the recording booth it's like oh this voice
10169000	10171000	involves me screaming this voice is totally
10171000	10173000	not sustainable for like a regular character
10174000	10176000	you're absolutely right
10176000	10178000	yeah we hear that a lot
10178000	10180000	or somebody they'll be like at the highest
10180000	10182000	part of their range
10182000	10184000	but you know
10184000	10186000	your voice levels change with emotion
10186000	10188000	so if you're at the highest
10188000	10190000	part of your range you can't go anywhere
10190000	10192000	you know where to go
10192000	10194000	so yeah that's a great point I forget yeah
10194000	10196000	they talk about that a lot too like you have to make
10196000	10198000	sure that you can do it and
10198000	10200000	you're not going to be strained and I see that all
10200000	10202000	the time honestly you know sometimes
10202000	10204000	people got to do these big growly things
10204000	10206000	and they swear that they can do it all day and you can hear
10206000	10208000	you're like no I know you want to take the job
10208000	10210000	but you know you're going to
10210000	10212000	hurt yourself
10212000	10214000	oh my gosh
10214000	10216000	wow I get to answer this question
10216000	10218000	in our chat room again making it about me
10218000	10220000	sorry Marissa but ST100Matt is asking
10220000	10222000	didn't you meet at least
10222000	10224000	didn't you meet at least one
10224000	10226000	cast member from Rocky Horror in
10226000	10228000	your shadow cast years Rob?
10228000	10230000	believe it or not no
10230000	10232000	when I went to the 25th in Vegas
10232000	10234000	years ago this would have been the year 2000
10234000	10236000	I went to the 25th
10236000	10238000	they taped some VH1
10238000	10240000	shows and so I was in the audience
10240000	10242000	they used to have a show called Celebrity Karaoke
10242000	10244000	which is so funny that now there's that
10244000	10246000	lip syncing show on Skype
10246000	10248000	on Spike TV because it's like
10248000	10250000	okay they used to have like karaoke on
10250000	10252000	TV and now it's lip syncing whatever
10252000	10254000	but they did a karaoke thing and
10254000	10256000	Richard O'Brien, Little Nell
10256000	10258000	and Patricia Quinn were all there and in it
10258000	10260000	so we got to see them and that was cool but I didn't get to meet them
10260000	10262000	but here in Sacramento
10262000	10264000	actually we are having a big con coming
10264000	10266000	up called Sinister Creature Con

10566000	10568000	and haven't set him on fire yet
10570000	10572000	I did scald him once that was an accident

10582000	10584000	for being on our show tonight thank you so
10584000	10586000	much they were great they were so
10586000	10588000	fantastic oh my gosh I'm just like
10588000	10590000	and it seems like now we've like
10590000	10592000	we've broken the seal and now like
10592000	10594000	there's going to be more voice actors on OLR in the future
10594000	10596000	which I'm super excited about
10596000	10598000	that's awesome because that's like a movie
10598000	10600000	podcast getting actors and actresses
10600000	10602000	so why wouldn't we want voice actors
10602000	10604000	and actresses on our show I can't wait
10604000	10606000	they totally get mad respect
10606000	10608000	for me in fact I have to
10608000	10610000	say that
10610000	10612000	Greg was one of the first ones that I actually
10612000	10614000	got an appreciation for versatility
10614000	10616000	of voice acting when I was a kid
10616000	10618000	for that one episode in Transformers
10618000	10620000	where Grimlock gets really smart
10620000	10622000	and I was like
10622000	10624000	is that the same person
10624000	10626000	and as a kid so I think
10626000	10628000	that's sort of what started my fascination with
10628000	10630000	just learning more about it so
10630000	10632000	very cool awesome and yes Dan is definitely
10632000	10634000	the man for me respect
10634000	10636000	respect for
10636000	10638000	voice actors and actresses respect
10638000	10640000	for other gamers keep on
