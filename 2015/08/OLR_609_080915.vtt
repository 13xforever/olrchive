00:00.000 --> 00:17.840
This week, Rera unloads a slew of old games for us to enjoy all over again, ranging from

00:17.840 --> 00:21.000
arcade and PC-type classics to games from only one generation ago.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
There's sure to be something for everyone in this episode, and it all starts right now

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:26.000 --> 00:35.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 609 for this

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
August 9th of 2015. My name is Rob Roberts, you can find me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E,

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
and joining me here in Studio N7 with me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
Word.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
How you doing, Jamie?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
My stomach hurts.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
But it's full of avocado, which makes me happy.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Well, that avocado shouldn't be making you sick, I hope.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
No, just life makes me sick.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
So we're back at our normal time. Well, I'm sorry to hear that life is making you sick.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Are you allergic to the program?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Well, I'm allergic to air.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.000
I know it doesn't make you sick. So we had the early show last week, so we're back at our normal time tonight.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Hi everybody. We do tape live, I always say this, we do tape live every Sunday night at the

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
Voice of Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
But we did an early show last week, in part so that our friends in Europe and in the different time zones

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
could partake in the show, which is always fun, we had some different callers last week,

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
but also so that you and I could get in the car and go straight out to San Francisco,

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
which there's no such thing as going straight to San Francisco with all the traffic.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
We went curved to San Francisco.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
I think a lot of you use this app on the phone called Waze, and I'll just shout it out,

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
I mean they're not paying me to, but it's a great app because it accounts for traffic.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
But man, we took back roads the whole way to San Francisco, it was actually a really pretty drive.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
We went down the river and all around.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
So we went to San Francisco and you for the first time got to eat at the Brazilian meat place.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
What did you think of the meat buffet?

02:07.000 --> 02:13.000
It was amazing. Except it took me like five days to recover from the sugar I had.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
That and being sick, because I actually did come back sick on Monday.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Oh no. Well, I definitely had a great time.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
I think even for five days of sick it would have been worth it.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Less worth it though is our pal Victoria, who we were seeing off.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
She has officially moved to Southern California.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
But we appreciate everybody being flexible with the schedule last week.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
We're back to being on time this week.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
On time with us here in studio, of course, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Hello.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
How you doing, Loki?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Fine.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
What are you watching here on YouTube? Call of Duty Black Ops 3 multiplayer.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Oh, this is Gamescom stuff.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah, I was just checking out the video.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
Yeah. Is this one of these fancy YouTube videos that runs in the 60 frames a second?

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
It is one of those fancy YouTube videos.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
I was just trying to see, you know, because it looks very similar to Advanced Warfare,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
and I just want to see how it looked differently.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
And there's a wall running. I don't know. I'll check it out, I guess.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
As if you weren't going to be buying this game anyway. Let's be real.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
I don't know. See, I bought Advanced Warfare, I played through the campaign,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
and then I bought the season pass and everything.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.000
I was like, oh, yeah, all my friends will do it, and then I stopped playing it.

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
So I have the season pass, and I have all this content waiting for me to play it.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I just need to go play it.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
All right. Get on it. Anyway, we have a really busy show tonight.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
You know, with Gamescom having gone on this past week,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
there's a lot of news coming out from overseas.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
So we're going to get into that, of course, tonight.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
But I want to get into our kickoff topic here tonight,

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
and I invite you guys to participate with this topic or anything on the show.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
We do, of course, tape live on Sundays, and if you are listening live,

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
you can head on over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
and have your say on what we're talking about here in studio.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
Tonight's kickoff topic, you know, a big game was released this week,

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
but it wasn't really a new game. It was a game made up of old games.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
Of course, I'm talking about Rare Replay, and I'll talk about my personal thoughts

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
and a little mini review of the game in a little bit when we get into

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
how is our gaming week.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.000
But I wanted to talk a little bit about kind of the fixation on retro classics,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
because, you know, certainly Rare Replay isn't the only retro collection,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
you know, that's coming out soon.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
I want to give a shout-out to my pals over at SacGamers Unite.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.000
Of course, Gabe and Bree have been on this program before with the SacIGDA.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
They were kind enough to have me on their show this past Wednesday,

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
and they do two guests on their show because it's a two-hour program,

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
and I was on the first hour.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
And the second hour was a gentleman who was involved with the Mega Man update

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
that's happening, and I think they finally dated that for the end of...

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Is it this month?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Is it this month?

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
It is this month.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Oh, it's coming real soon, so it's within weeks.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
And I know there's a lot of people looking forward to that too, although I know...

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
I don't know. I'm not entirely looking forward to it,

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
because I'm going to all of a sudden go, man, I'm not as good as I used to be at this.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Well, and that's kind of what I want to get into.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
And, you know, I'm not going to talk about a game that's not released.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I haven't got a chance to try.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
I definitely am interested to check it out, because, yes,

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I realize that GameCube collection is out there,

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
but I also realize that the GameCube is not going to look on my new high refresh rate.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Television is not going to look the same as PlayStation 4 or Xbox One,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
you know, with this Mega Man update.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
So I'm still curious to check it out on the online leaderboards and all that stuff too.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
But I digress.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
I kind of want to go into what you're talking about a little bit, Loki,

05:28.000 --> 05:32.000
with the whole, sometimes these games aren't really as good as I remember them.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.000
And some of the things I'm seeing on Twitter about Rare Replay is,

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
you know, I'm having fun with Banjo-Kazooie and RC Pro-Am,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
but there's a lot of crap in this collection.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
There's a lot of filler in this particular collection.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
I don't know. For one, certainly I can see where, you know,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
one person's trash is another's treasure.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
I think there might be some people that are really into a game that maybe you didn't even know about.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
For me, that's Cobra Triangle.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
And I admit that game is hard as hell.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Oh, I used to play the hell out of it.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
See, I have so many memories with that game that it just kind of gives me a warm fuzzy just to even go play it.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
But here's my question.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
Why do we have this fascination with retro things?

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
And do they hold up against our imagination sometimes?

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
Because it seems like, based on some of the vibe I'm seeing about Rare Replay, it doesn't.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
What do you guys think in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com?

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
Do retro games hold up, or is it just we want them to be as good as we remember them 20 years ago?

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
I think a lot of this collection, it's kind of an easy way for them to make money off of that stuff.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Some of the more well-done collections, I think, have been like those Dreamclass collections

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
or the Model 2 collections that they had from Sega.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
You remember they had that, was it that big Sega collection?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
The Sonic retro collection, stuff like that.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I was really well done, too.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
So I'm down with those types of things.

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
Well, to be fair to Rare Replay, despite the oddity about it adding all these Xbox 360 games in your library,

07:01.000 --> 07:08.000
which I'll talk about in a minute, it isn't just a menu with games and click the game.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
They really took time to build a little shell around the games.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
They have all these interesting kind of remixes of the songs that will play on the menus.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
So there's some neat little tracks.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
They make a little theme. They sing a little song about Rare games, which I thought was really cute in the beginning.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
So they added a lot more than just front-end menu, play the game type of thing.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
It's more than what Nintendo has with Virtual Console. Sorry for the shade, but it's true.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
Virtual Console could be so awesome. They could just do so much with that.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
Imagine, if you would, your virtual living room, and all your games are up on the shelf.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
You could pull the boxes out, look at the box.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
The Microsoft Game Room was kind of sold out.

07:50.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, sort of like that. They could do so much with that, and they just have it.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
They're just like, aaaand rum.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
I mean, so it's like, I don't know. Just take the extra step, and people will appreciate that much more.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
I was reading a tweet or something that called out an amazing fact about Rare Replay,

08:08.000 --> 08:15.000
is that with the release of Rare Replay, there are now more Nintendo 64 games playable on the Xbox One than there are the Wii U.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
And I kind of had to do a second take at that fact.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
I kind of don't think it's counting that there are Nintendo 64 games on the Wii Virtual Console,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
and you can kind of back-end into the Wii on the Wii U.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
But still, it is kind of a jarring, like, wow, you would think they'd have a lot of these games available on the Wii U, and they're not.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
How hard is it to bring that stuff over? I don't understand.

08:40.000 --> 08:49.000
If it runs natively in the Wii U anyways, are you telling me that the Wii U can't emulate a Nintendo 64 game?

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Because my fucking phone can emulate a Nintendo 64 game.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
Like, I think the PSP could emulate a phone, you know, one of those games.

08:56.000 --> 09:04.000
You can't tell me that the Wii U does not have the processing power, nor do they have the skills to create an emulator to run a Nintendo 64 game.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
Dark Soccer, the queen of the classic game of the week.

09:07.000 --> 09:14.000
I want to get your thoughts on this in a minute about how retro games hold up, but I want to go to some comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Dungeon Buster says, some retro games do, others just don't.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.000
I played GoldenEye again a while ago after hooking up my N64 back up, and yeah, yay, progress.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
You know, speaking specifically of GoldenEye, it's interesting he mentions that one.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
VomitEye.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Well, because the motions. You know what's funny?

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
Even when I was playing Banjo-Kazooie, I don't usually get motion sick, but I was definitely like, whoa, okay, some of those turns and things are way too fast.

09:39.000 --> 09:48.000
Granted, these games were not designed with a 60-inch TV and high refresh rate in mind, but I mean, still, I was like, oh, crap, I gotta look away for a minute.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
So, it's like...

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
Hold on, I just want to call out, the GoldenEye, some people are lamenting about the games that aren't there.

09:54.000 --> 10:00.000
Like, you know, with the Rare Replay, everybody's quick to say, well, there's no GoldenEye, there's no Donkey Kong Country,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
there's no anticipation.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
There's no jumping in Perfect Dark.

10:04.000 --> 10:10.000
But, I mean, I understand licensing makes that whole thing very, very tricky.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Anyway, Loki, what were you about to say?

10:12.000 --> 10:20.000
I... oh, I was just asking, I didn't realize GoldenEye wasn't in there, I was gonna ask if they had online multiplayer with that.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Perfect Dark, I'm assuming they have online multiplayer since the Xbox Live Arcade version.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Exactly, what they did for some of those games is it's just the Xbox Live Arcade version.

10:28.000 --> 10:36.000
So, when you're getting Perfect Dark, you're not getting the N64 version, you're getting the 360 version, which was basically the N64 version with better textures, things like that.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
One other comment here in chat, then I'll go over to Jamie.

10:38.000 --> 10:43.000
Raginator says, I like retro stuff, I have all the Sega stuff on Steam.

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
Hell, I called y'all two weeks ago complaining that Steam needed more retro stuff.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
So, maybe what's out there just isn't enough.

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
Checking in with our queen of the retro classic game of the week here on OLR.

10:54.000 --> 11:03.000
Darcyra, what do you think? Do retro games hold up, or are some of them better left in our memory and we probably shouldn't go back?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Yes.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
To which part?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Both, depends on the game.

11:09.000 --> 11:17.000
Some things that you think are fun when your brain is less developed that ends up not being so much fun once you have an adult brain.

11:17.000 --> 11:29.000
Interesting facts you're delivering there is that your brain is not fully developed when you're a kid, and so maybe there's certain things that you are entertained by a little differently than you are when you're in your 30s.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
I'm gonna go into a little bit of neuroscience.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Okay, not too much though.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
No, just a little bit.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
Don't bore the show.

11:35.000 --> 11:46.000
Basically, your brain hasn't finished creating all of its neural pathways for men until oldest about between 24 and 27, and for women it's a little bit earlier than that.

11:47.000 --> 12:01.000
That means that anything that gives you immediate reward is going to appeal more to a younger mind than it will for something that's gonna take longer to build up to.

12:01.000 --> 12:11.000
So you can play a game that might have been one of those instant reward games, but it's not gonna have the same payoff for you as an adult who's looking for something that wants something more cumulative.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Yeah.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
So at that respect, you've got it.

12:14.000 --> 12:27.000
Then again, if you've got something that's gonna combine that immediate result, yay, I passed the level, I'm going on to the next, and build on that, then that's gonna be the type of things that's gonna have, I think, a little bit more staying power.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Do you think our bullshit tolerance was higher when we were kids?

12:29.000 --> 12:36.000
And maybe part of that is the technology, but I feel like there's some games you go back and play and you go, this really wasn't very good.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
What was I thinking?

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
And I'm not saying that with about Rare Replay, but just other retro things.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
Raise your hand if you liked the Back to the Future game on the NES.

12:43.000 --> 12:52.000
I, okay, I will raise my hand for this, and I defend this game to this day. I liked Friday the 13th on the NES.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
That game was funny.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
And I realize a lot of people hate that game.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Well, it's just like Goonies 2.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
Goonies 2 was awesome too, but you're right, you go back and you play some of those games, it's a little rough now these days.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Yeah.

13:03.000 --> 13:09.000
You know, look at things that we just instantly put as a classic, like, we have the Guardian Legend.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
We're gonna use that one because that is the best game in the universe.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
Why do we still like it to this day?

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
Because it's maintained staying a difficult game, yet you've got the progression through it as you keep going.

13:22.000 --> 13:28.000
It's got great music. It's visually a good game, you know, for an early compile game.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
You know, but it's got all of those factors that made it cool for us as kids.

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
You know, you'd get the instant payoff of finally beating that one boss, but when we go back to it and we can still do it,

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
or we still have the progressive difficulty, you know, we're not aware of that as kids, we're aware of it as adults.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
Yeah, and you know, and certainly I'm definitely not saying that all retro games, none of them hold up,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
because like, I still to this day go back, and who doesn't?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Like, there were so many different ways to play it.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
Go back to like Mario 3 and be like, I'm gonna just play through all the stages on World 1 just in a sitting,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
because I just remember this game and I love it.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
Like, you know, and some games like that just are never gonna get old.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.000
Or for me, you know, like the Guardian Legend, like you talk about Kid Icarus.

14:09.000 --> 14:15.000
When I went to Penny Arcade Expo East and I was in the classic game room, I was waiting for Bobby or something.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
I don't remember what I was doing, but I was like, you know what?

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
I'm gonna get a copy of Kid Icarus and play it on an old school Nintendo the way it was meant to be played.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
And it was so fun and I still love that game to this day and it holds up amazingly well.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
So does any version of Metroid.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
Why do you think we still have the collection?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
I mean, that's pretty much it.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
Um, you know, or here's another one, like playing through Dracula X.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
I mean, there's a reason why that game to this day is a hundred plus dollars.

14:41.000 --> 14:48.000
You know, because it is a solid game and it's got everything that's going to appeal no matter what age you are,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
or how you remember playing it, it's still gonna be fresh every time you pick it up.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
Let me get to some more comments in our chat room over at Live.VogueNetwork.com.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.000
Alan Alchemy says, how many damn trash movies can you watch now as an adult,

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
only because you first saw it because you were 13 and you know damn well if it wasn't for that,

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
you couldn't stand it for longer than a few minutes.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
I still love Xanadu.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
That's a really good analogy, but I have to admit, some of them I love even more as an adult.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.000
Like Clue of the Movie, that was my favorite movie when I was eight years old.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
I shoot you not. I watched it every day.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
Clue's not bad.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
No, it's not. It's cheesy and I think a lot of people look at it and go that movie's so cheesy,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
but like that movie just got even better as I got older.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.000
And Pee Wee's Big Adventure, you get more of the jokes when you get older.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
You realize how fucked up some of those movies were.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
You know, actually it's the same thing for going back and watching Rocky and Bull Eagle.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.000
Yes, or even like the Animaniacs or Tiny Toons, you know,

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
because when those, at least for you and me and a little bit Loki,

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
we were right at about that age where all the jokes started to make sense,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
you know what I mean, when those shows were new.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
Anyway, also comments in our chat room.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Akuma JP says, for me, I think it's imagination.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
We had more of that when we were young.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
And Dungeon Buster piggybacks on that saying, I agree, imagination filled in a lot of gaps

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
because the hardware was only capable of so much back then.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
Why do you think all the artwork on the Atari 2600 was epic

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
and so unrepresentative of the final game?

16:11.000 --> 16:15.000
Because when you're playing a game like combat,

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
they don't want you to see these crappy little boxes on a screen that are firing.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
That was all about gameplay. It didn't matter that it looked stupid.

16:22.000 --> 16:26.000
It was just cool. It's a tank game where you get to fight each other.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
But you know they're tanks because on the box you see an epic,

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
and I think with combat it wasn't just tanks because people forget this,

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
but you had the game switch, which is a huge part of Atari,

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
and there was like an air battle mode because airplanes and other stuff too.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
It wasn't just tanks.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
The big plane versus the three planes, that was always fun.

16:44.000 --> 16:48.000
And of course, Tiger Claw bringing up the opposite here in our chat room.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
I'm sure you remember the artwork for Mega Man and then playing the actual game.

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
Mega Man didn't look like the cover art. Well, there's always exceptions.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
Yes, and I would like to also remind everybody to fuck you Konami,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
and also fuck you Capcom.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
I had to add the Konami one in there, but fuck you Capcom for teasing us

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
to the fucking box art Mega Man versus Capcom 3.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
And fuck you Konami just for the fuck of it.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Just while you're at it.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Just while I'm at it. I'm mad at you still.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
Why is everybody in the games industry so angry, Loki?

17:19.000 --> 17:22.000
So angry all the time.

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
Because of, what was it, sexual violence or what was that?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
What?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Erotic violence, that's why we're angry.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
Oh, oh god, you're talking about the, that was in last week's show, right?

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
The pachinko trailer that came up at the end of last week's show?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Yes.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Alright, anyway.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
You just took it to an awkward place, talking about erotic violence.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.000
Anyway, and Dark Tetsuya said, bad box art Mega Man was taken across Street Fighter.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
Whatever. It doesn't matter. Still Capcom, still fuck them.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
Alan Alchemy is talking about Street Fighter 2010, that horrible NES game.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I love that game! That's unfortunate.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Everybody's got that game. They're gonna stick up for it.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I still love that game.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
You know what? Yeah, it was stupid. It was incredibly stupid.

18:09.000 --> 18:15.000
But you know what? That was back in the day where you fucking go and rent your games and shit.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
And that's, it looked cool, played it, you know, whatever. I played the hell out of that.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
Alright. I think that's gonna do it for our kickoff topic this week. Lots of good discussion.

18:25.000 --> 18:31.000
I think in a future week we need to get into, though, what game do you still defend to this day that everybody else hates?

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
I feel like we might have done it on a previous show. I mean, with 600 previous episodes, it's easy to duplicate things sometimes.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Should do it by, like, generation.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Yeah, maybe. Maybe that'll be a fun thing to get into one night.

18:41.000 --> 18:48.000
Alright, anyhow, we'll do that another week. For now, let's get into our gaming week and talk about the types of games that we've been playing this week.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
It was a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition because of the DLC coming out next week.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
Which, I couldn't find the story to talk about that, so...

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
DLC coming out next week. It'll be awesome.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Now, Jamie, it's not time for the news yet.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
You know what? I don't care.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Rule breaker!

19:06.000 --> 19:12.000
I also played some Final Fantasy XIV, just so that my free company didn't think I was dead.

19:12.000 --> 19:19.000
Playing a lot of Peach World, honestly enough, because it's been sort of my brain break game.

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
And I got Pillars of Eternity from my Mac. I haven't installed it yet, but I just got it the other day.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
So I will be giving it a try.

19:28.000 --> 19:34.000
Alright. Awesome. So good luck with the Dragon Age DLC this week. I'm curious to hear how that goes.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
I really need to go back and beat Inquisition. That's still on my list of, like, to-do.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.000
But, you know, MMOs, other games, they all fight for my attention.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
Loki, what got your attention this week? How was your gaming week?

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
I played a bunch of weird stuff this week.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.000
So I played a little bit of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes because my son's still playing that game.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
He's, like, almost 180 hours in it now.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
Wow.

19:54.000 --> 20:00.000
Probably over 250 hours by the time the next game comes out.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Unfortunately.

20:01.000 --> 20:09.000
You know what? Just on a random side note, when your son's our age, like, you know, we'll say mid-20s, Wink, our age.

20:09.000 --> 20:18.000
When your son's mid-20s, I bet he'll say the best PlayStation 4 game was this LEGO game because it's the one that he'll have memories of playing with you.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Not to be cheesy, but I bet that'll totally be it.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
Well, yeah, because, well, here's the thing, though.

20:22.000 --> 20:30.000
It won't be frickin' No Man's Sky or Uncharted. It's gonna be LEGO because that's the one he remembers playing with you.

20:30.000 --> 20:37.000
Well, here's the funny thing about that, too. It's, like, I've been pointing out, like, all the glitches in the game, and so now that he points out all the glitches in the game.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.000
Oh, God! It's a mini Loki!

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
And so, like, he's all, he's all, Dad, look at this glitch! Look at this glitch!

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
And there'll be, like, people walking through the buildings or up in the air or something like that.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
He found a way to clip under the map the other day on accident.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
You got a speedrunner in training.

20:54.000 --> 21:01.000
And so, um, so then I figured out a way to clip under the map, and so we've been just clipping under the map and just breaking the game.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I guess I'm bored. I don't want to play this game anymore.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
Dad and son cheating together.

21:05.000 --> 21:15.000
Like, I don't want to, like, we've been, like, wandering around the city for, like, hundreds of hours now, and I'm just like, okay, I need something else I can do in this game, because you don't want to play any of the levels, so.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Alright, I'm going to clip under the map now.

21:18.000 --> 21:25.000
And so I clip under the map, and I finally got into the helicarrier, like, because all the internal stuff from, like, the helicarrier is just hidden under the map.

21:25.000 --> 21:31.000
And so I clipped into it, and, um, so I was inside the helicarrier while he was outside.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
Which is weird, because when someone goes into the helicarrier, both players have to go in there.

21:36.000 --> 21:44.000
So why the fuck is that limitation in there, since, you know, obviously the game can run just fine with one person in there and not, I don't know, whatever.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
So, we played a little bit of that.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Um, what else did I play this week?

21:48.000 --> 21:55.000
I played, um, I played a little bit of Woah Dave, and, woah man, that game is terrible.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.000
I deleted that. I do not like Woah Dave.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Well, you, okay, but do you like the retro style? Well, speaking of retro-

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
Yeah, I like retro style games, and I understand the point of it, but I just got bored with it really fast.

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
I liked it in a, I see this in an 80s pizza parlor type of way.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Like, it's not something I would sit there for an hour and hours, but-

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
Yeah, I get it, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it, because it was a free game, but I just, I removed it off my hard drive after.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
I gave it a few tries, and I'm like, nope, sorry, I just don't want to play this anymore.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
Um, Justin in our chat room says, get the fuck out of here with that Woah Dave hate. That game is excellent.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Ah, whatever, I mean, it's fine.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
Thank you, at least somebody agrees with you.

22:33.000 --> 22:39.000
I played a little bit more Roundabout. I was trying to show my, because I'm trying to get myself to play something else other than Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
I just play anything else. How about Minecraft? How about, how about Roundabout?

22:43.000 --> 22:47.000
You know, and so I showed him Roundabout, and he just didn't like that. He thought it was stupid.

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
Um, so I played a little bit of Roundabout, um, and then I played a few games.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
I was asked by one of our listeners to play through Dream, and I'm such a stupid chicken shit when it comes to these games.

23:00.000 --> 23:07.000
Like, because I read the achievements on, it's a Nightmare 1, Nightmare 2, Nightmare 3, I'm like, oh shit, this is gonna be one of those games that's fucking jump scares or something like that.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
So, like, the first part, you start off in a house, and you're, you're-

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
Wait a minute, do you get really scared of these games? Do you like-

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
No, I just, I don't play them, so, I just don't like those types of games.

23:16.000 --> 23:22.000
Am I the wrong person to be broadcasting Five Nights at Freddy's? Should it have been Loki this whole time, doing these games?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
You want me to buy you a copy?

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
I have, I don't, no, I don't need to buy, have you buy a copy. I have enough games in my library.

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
No, but seriously, um, so I ended up, cause, like, it was a glitchy game, so I heard, like, a door shut.

23:33.000 --> 23:38.000
I'm like, oh shit, it's gonna be fucking jump scare time, cause now they're trying to tell me to turn off all the lights and go to bed.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
I'm like, okay, there's gonna be some, like, ghost or something, like, waiting for it to jump out at me, and so I'm like, okay, off.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
And then, so I was like, okay, fine. I promised I'd play it, so, I played through all that, and apparently there are no jump scares in that part.

23:49.000 --> 23:57.000
But, the game, I guess you explore dreams or something, so, like, this, the first part of it, you're in this, like, desert, and you have to go through these caves,

23:57.000 --> 24:08.000
and turn off the lights, and you do that by walking under the lights, and then when you turn off the lights, all of the lights, it traps a smoke monster or something in there.

24:08.000 --> 24:15.000
And so, like, it's kind of weird because it's, like, it talks about, like, you know how they do dream interpretation stuff, what that's supposed to mean?

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
So, like, you find, like, a fragment and tells you, okay, a maze means this, and smoke means this.

24:20.000 --> 24:28.000
So, yeah, that's the only, like, it's not even scary, it's just like, ooh, I heard, like, something chasing after me, you know, so there's this smoke monster thing I'm running from.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
Oh, sorry.

24:29.000 --> 24:39.000
Oh, I was going to say, it's very similar to, like, um, like, was it the, um, Ether One? Like, it's one of those first person exploration games, I guess.

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
So, it's like a puzzle game. I want to go back and play Ether One, but it's broken.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
Um, there's an, okay, so Shane has already picked out the next scary game I need to play.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
Okay.

24:49.000 --> 24:57.000
And I forget the name in the moment, I'm hoping he's listening and he'll text it to me, or somebody in chat will just shout it out based on, uh, what my description of the game.

24:57.000 --> 25:04.000
But it's, like, a multiplayer scary game. I know we talked about it on the show before, too, which makes the fact that I can't remember the name more frustrating.

25:04.000 --> 25:11.000
But, like, some people are the ghosts, and then some people are the ones in the house trying to basically outlive the ghosts.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
And I know it's something Shane's been playing with Flocko, he's like, we need to play this, we need to play this.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
But since it's a multiplayer game, Loki, I think it's something we all need to play. I think Jamie needs to play, too.

25:18.000 --> 25:23.000
They're saying that I should play Five Nights at Freddy's. I thought I had Five Nights at Freddy's. I swear I played that game.

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
I don't remember, because I played it and, like, I got, you know, one of the things jumped at me and I was like, alright.

25:30.000 --> 25:40.000
Like, I don't know, it wasn't like I was scared by it or startled by it, it was just kind of like, eh, I don't really want to play this anymore.

25:41.000 --> 25:48.000
It's just, you know, it's going to be too hard to get past these levels, you know, I don't know. I think, I'm pretty sure I have it, I gotta check my Steam library.

25:48.000 --> 25:54.000
But, anyway, speaking of Steam library, another game I played was Bionic Commando.

25:54.000 --> 26:04.000
And I had bought Bionic Commando when it first came out, because, you know, I'm a huge fan of Bionic Commando, and I even, I don't give a shit, even the 3D one, you know, I'm totally into that.

26:04.000 --> 26:15.000
But I tried playing it on Steam, and man, that game is fucking terrible. And I'm not saying that it's a terrible game, as in, you know, the story's terrible, I'm sure the story's terrible, but I don't give a shit about that.

26:15.000 --> 26:26.000
The controls are fucking terrible. Like, I'm literally standing two feet away from a soldier and I can't fucking hit him with my gun, because the goddamn controls are all just fucked up.

26:27.000 --> 26:37.000
The sensitivity, I could never get it right on the controller, it just felt very delayed, I even dropped, my laptop's not that strong, but shit, it should be able to run fucking Bionic Commando.

26:37.000 --> 26:49.000
That game's fucking old, so, I dropped down the resolution, down the 720, and it still was running very choppy and like shit, so, I don't know.

26:49.000 --> 26:59.000
I may give it another try, I thought it ran pretty good on Xbox 360, and I know I've played it on that, but, I don't know, maybe I'll go back and play Rearmed or something.

26:59.000 --> 27:14.000
So I played that, and then, what else, I don't think I worked on my game this week, I've been trying to figure out, trying to design logos and stuff, because I want to work on my website to go with all that, for like leaderboards and stuff, and I just want to get to look nice first before I get to it.

27:15.000 --> 27:21.000
God, I thought I played another game, maybe that was it. Yeah, that was my gaming week.

27:21.000 --> 27:29.000
Alright, fair enough. Let's see, let's get into my gaming week, and like I mentioned before, I played Rare Replay.

27:29.000 --> 27:42.000
So I picked that game up, and I was checking that out on Xbox One, and reliving some of the old, all the way from the old Spectrum stuff, like I actually enjoy Jetpack, but then there's some other games in there that are really bad.

27:42.000 --> 27:50.000
Like Gun Fright, I don't understand what the hell's going on in that game. And I know I can hit a button and read the manual on the side, but I kind of don't like that setup.

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
Like I really think some of these old games could have just benefited from like a splash screen that says, here's how the game plays.

27:56.000 --> 28:06.000
And I really can't believe, especially with all the polish that they put on the game, they didn't put something that simple in there to help people who may not have known these games understand a little quicker how to play them.

28:06.000 --> 28:09.000
It seems kind of self-explanatory, like it's just like...

28:09.000 --> 28:18.000
Not that game. I don't understand why there's a one, I imagine there's one particular guy you're looking for, but I don't know who's good, I don't know who's bad. It's just a weird setup.

28:18.000 --> 28:25.000
I mean, yeah, some of them are really easy to pick up, like Slalom, you know, the skiing game on NES, that doesn't really make the game good.

28:25.000 --> 28:35.000
But I don't want to sound all negative on Rare Replay, because actually it's a really fantastic deal for $30, and there's enough really, really good stuff in there to justify the purchase.

28:35.000 --> 28:41.000
I mean, games like RC Pro-Am are still great today, except for the excessive squeaking noise when you're making corners.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
That still bugs me to this day, there's too much squeaking.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
But RC Pro-Am 2, I think I only ever played that game like one time, so it was really cool to see that again.

28:48.000 --> 28:55.000
And I even love the games like Cobra Triangle, even Snake Rattle and Roll, even though it can be infuriatingly difficult sometimes,

28:55.000 --> 29:02.000
because if you can't control the snake just right, then you fall into the water and it's doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know, just really silly stuff.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
But I would have no idea what to do in Snake Rattle and Roll if I didn't remember some of the concepts from when I was a kid.

29:08.000 --> 29:16.000
By the way, the goal, you're trying to get as many pieces for your snake so that you weigh down the bell at the end, which is what will open the door to the next level.

29:16.000 --> 29:23.000
And so you want to eat anything that's circular, but not if it's going to turn into a bomb, or, you know, things that are not pieces of snake.

29:23.000 --> 29:28.000
And you actually hit a button when you're over the little trapdoors, and some of them have pieces of snake in them.

29:29.000 --> 29:36.000
So that's what that is. If you're wondering what the eff that game is all about, there you go. I gave you a little overview right there.

29:36.000 --> 29:42.000
I like Alan's comment. Slalom is a bad name for that game. It should be called Skiing Butthole.

29:42.000 --> 29:49.000
Well, the reason why he says that is I was playing the game and your character kind of bends over as he's like skiing down the hill.

29:49.000 --> 29:54.000
So Alan walks in the room and kind of goes, that is a giant butthole on the screen right now.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
And it's because of the slalom. You're just going down and skiing down the mountain. That game's kind of bad though.

29:58.000 --> 30:04.000
But like, there's some games that Rare has done that I didn't get to experience the first time.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
You know, I know we do this podcast, but you all know this isn't how we pay our bills.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
We don't have time to play every single game that's ever been out.

30:11.000 --> 30:19.000
And there was especially a few years in there during the Nintendo 64 era, you know, right at the end of N64 and beginning of PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast and all that.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
They're like, I missed a lot of games. And one of those games I just never got around to playing before was Banjo-Kazooie.

30:23.000 --> 30:28.000
And I know there's a lot of love for that game and especially with the spiritual successor coming out, right?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Yooka-Laylee, that whole thing, right?

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
So getting to go back and play Banjo-Kazooie was actually kind of rad because I had not played it before.

30:36.000 --> 30:44.000
And yeah, even though the graphics are a little rough and so forth, it was actually a lot of fun kind of playing the game and exploring the first level and getting...

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
It's very Mario 64-esque if you, for whatever reason, have never played it.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.000
But obviously with some different mechanics with the fact that you learn like new moves everywhere.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
So you're putting all these moves together to get through different stages.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
But yeah, getting to play that for the first time was pretty cool.

31:00.000 --> 31:06.000
So for every stinker like Gun Fright, there's some gem in there probably that you haven't experienced before.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
So I think for 30 bucks Rare Replay is worth it.

31:09.000 --> 31:16.000
But I have one more, as much as I enjoy the game and I recommend it, I do have one more thing I gotta be picky about because I don't get it.

31:16.000 --> 31:23.000
Okay? So when I put Rare Replay, the disc and the drive, my Xbox goes, I gotta download 5 gigabytes worth of updates.

31:23.000 --> 31:36.000
What? 5 gigab... Well, what it's downloading is because it's putting all the 360 games, get their own little entry, thanks to the backwards compatibility thing, get their own little entry in your game library.

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
So the 360 games and the way it interfaces with Rare Replay is kind of clunky.

31:42.000 --> 31:53.000
And I guess I understand why they did it because if you already had the game in the past and have achievements and stuff, they wanted to be able to just tap into the old library and so forth, but it's really clunky.

31:53.000 --> 32:00.000
And you know, my Xbox 360 wasn't wired and it was taking forever to download things, so I had to go get the wire and plug it into my 360.

32:00.000 --> 32:10.000
It was just kind of a hassle. So I don't... And now if I go into my game library, it's filled with all the Xbox 360 Rare Replay stuff.

32:10.000 --> 32:20.000
And so I kind of wish... I don't know, I just wish they'd taken a different approach with that because that whole thing felt really clunky to me in what otherwise is a fairly slick interface.

32:20.000 --> 32:26.000
So that's my other minor, minor complaint. Otherwise I thought the game was a lot of fun and worth it for $30.

32:26.000 --> 32:36.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, the only thing I disliked about Banjo-Kazooie was it kind of brought in the OMG play the game 20 times to collect all 254 pieces of 40 different tokens mechanic.

32:37.000 --> 32:49.000
So, let's see. Tigerclaw wants to know, did the N64 ports fix the framerate issues? Seeing as I hadn't played that game on N64, I couldn't tell you.

32:49.000 --> 32:57.000
But what I will tell you is that it's the 360 versions of most of those games. If Rare put it out on the 360, then you're getting that version.

32:57.000 --> 33:04.000
So Banjo-Kazooie, 360 version. Perfect Dark, 360 version. So take that for what it's worth.

33:05.000 --> 33:12.000
Other than that, I played a lot of the same stuff. I've still been playing a crap load of Final Fantasy XIV because, you know, MMO addiction.

33:12.000 --> 33:18.000
What else did I play this week? I felt like there was something else new I wanted to play that I wanted to tell you guys about.

33:18.000 --> 33:24.000
And now I'm forgetting into the moment what I was playing. So I guess that'll have to do. More Clicker Heroes.

33:24.000 --> 33:29.000
Because I'm still addicted to that game. That's not really a game though. That's just kind of a pastime.

33:30.000 --> 33:37.000
You can appreciate this, Loki. Last night, I went out and played Ingress for three hours with friends.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
We went out on the town. I know you love my Ingress addiction, so...

33:42.000 --> 33:48.000
I don't have a problem with it, honestly. In songs you don't have a problem with me cheating like crazy at fucking Clicker Heroes.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
You do what you want.

33:50.000 --> 33:55.000
The game plays itself. I mean, literally plays itself. Because I had an autoclicker on and I didn't want to have to do it.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
I think a ton of people use an autoclicker.

33:57.000 --> 34:03.000
And here's why. It's because I was already so far in the game before the Flash version stopped working.

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
And so I'm like, fuck it. I just want to finish all the achievements on this. I don't even fucking care.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
I don't just want to play it anymore.

34:10.000 --> 34:15.000
If you want to play a single player game like Clicker Heroes and cheat, that's fine. Do your thing. Nobody cares.

34:15.000 --> 34:20.000
But as long as you don't cheat in a multiplayer game like Ingress, because everybody hates the people that cheat in Ingress. It's awful.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
How do you cheat in that?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
Wow.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
But I'm hoping we can at least have a little get-together somewhere.

34:56.000 --> 35:02.000
You know, maybe an official meet-up spot somewhere. So we'll work that out in the coming days.

35:02.000 --> 35:11.000
The other thing I want to mention, I already gave my shout-out to SacGamersUnite, but I did want to just shout them out one more time for having me on their show this week. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.

35:11.000 --> 35:16.000
I want to give a shout-out to Anime Jam Session, which is Tuesday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network.

35:17.000 --> 35:24.000
They're going to be bringing us a special programming Saturday from noon Eastern to five Eastern, which will be 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Pacific.

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
They are going to be bringing us International Sailor Moon Day. Did you know that Sailor Moon has a day?

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Everything has a day.

35:32.000 --> 35:37.000
Sailor Moon has a day, and it's Saturday, and there's going to be little mini conventions all over the world.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
I think yesterday was International Cat Day or something.

35:40.000 --> 35:47.000
There was National Underwear Day this week as well on Twitter, so I think Twitter invents a lot of shit.

35:47.000 --> 35:56.000
But International Sailor Moon Day I think is a little more legit. I think National Sailor Moon Day is up there with Talk Like a Pirate Day.

35:56.000 --> 36:00.000
You're not going to see either one officially recognized on a Hallmark calendar.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
It's up there with Steak and a Blowjob Day, right?

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
We'll have to ask Rama where that all lay.

36:06.000 --> 36:13.000
But anyway, tune in on Saturday for Sailor Moon, and everybody will transform magically on cue.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
And I think Rama's going to call on the show later to talk a little more about that, so we welcome that.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
So, there you go.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
That is, I think, all I have for Housekeeping Tonight. I'm probably forgetting something. I'll have to come back to it later.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
But in the meantime, we need to get into some gaming news, because there is a lot going on.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
So, Loki, let's get into it.

36:30.000 --> 36:35.000
Hey! It's a game, a sequel for a game that we never asked for a sequel for.

36:35.000 --> 36:41.000
But Halo Wars, the RTS Halo game, is getting a sequel.

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
And it is coming out on Windows 10.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.000
I wonder, probably Xbox One as well. Yeah, Xbox One as well.

36:49.000 --> 36:54.000
And, hooray! I don't know.

36:54.000 --> 36:59.000
It's also being developed by Creative Assembly, and of course they did the Total War series.

36:59.000 --> 37:07.000
Along with that, they were announcing at Gamescom something more towards your mainstream Halo fan.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
The Halo World Championships.

37:09.000 --> 37:15.000
They're going to be doing basically a competition, a multiplayer competition along with that.

37:15.000 --> 37:23.000
Around the same time, they will be offering the brand new Halo 5 Guardians limited edition console.

37:23.000 --> 37:28.000
That's one terabyte. It has a one terabyte hard drive, and it looks pretty nice.

37:28.000 --> 37:34.000
I dig how that is painted with all the blue and silver and... yeah.

37:34.000 --> 37:40.000
That did look like a really pretty machine. It almost made me sad I already bought an Xbox One, but not...

37:40.000 --> 37:47.000
If only certain games were coming out this year and not being pushed to next year.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
Crackdown, you say?

37:49.000 --> 37:51.000
Yes, crackdown I say.

37:51.000 --> 37:56.000
But, yeah. I'll just have to wait for that one, I guess.

37:56.000 --> 38:03.000
Well, now, I know a lot of people out there were big fans of Halo Wars, but I wasn't really expecting that game to ever get a sequel.

38:03.000 --> 38:07.000
So, it's kind of neat that I guess something is coming, after all, for that.

38:07.000 --> 38:13.000
Well, it's also good to see that there's another RTS game, because there's not a whole lot of mainstream RTS games nowadays.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.000
True.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
So, I guess it's good in that sense.

38:18.000 --> 38:24.000
I guess it's better than that Gears of War one that they were showing off at one time.

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
So, I don't know. And I guess with Halo 5, they're also kind of trying to...

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
They have that brand new game mode that's supposed to cater more towards the esports thing.

38:33.000 --> 38:40.000
So, I think they're really trying to jump on that esports bandwagon to kind of get up there with the Call of Duty's and Dota's and all that stuff.

38:40.000 --> 38:45.000
Makes sense. Bobby Blackwolf with a fun fact in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

38:45.000 --> 38:53.000
Bobby says, the first Halo World Championships were broadcast on G4 before the TechTV acquisition and commentated on by Will Wheaton.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
Because Will used to do the arena show on G4, right? For at least a short time.

38:57.000 --> 39:03.000
I've been listening to lots of Will Wheaton lately, because I started listening to the audiobook version of Armada.

39:03.000 --> 39:11.000
Which is not interesting so far, but I'm listening to him talk in my ear for several hours at a time.

39:11.000 --> 39:18.000
Well, there you go. So, the Halo World Championship is not exactly new, but I guess, hey, why not?

39:18.000 --> 39:22.000
The Nintendo World Championships, 25 years later, all the rage.

39:22.000 --> 39:26.000
I bet they do that again at E3 next year, or at some other time.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
So, why not? Why not? Microsoft wants their World Championships to get people excited about, too.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I want more Maker games.

39:32.000 --> 39:35.000
You want more Mario Maker games?

39:35.000 --> 39:42.000
I want Nintendo Maker. No, seriously, I want to be able to cross Zelda, Metroid, Mario...

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
You want NES Remix Maker?

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
Basically, yeah. I think that would be fucking amazing.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.000
Can you imagine doing a Legend of Zelda game skin like Metroid or something?

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
You know, like top-down shit with all the fucking Metroid enemies and graphics and all that stuff?

39:55.000 --> 39:58.000
You know Nintendo's afraid of all the sex games people are going to make, though.

39:58.000 --> 40:03.000
You know Nintendo's afraid of, well, I don't know if I want to say afraid, but concern.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
Nintendo's concerned about all the penises that will be drawn out of Mario and Lincoln.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
Who cares? It's just...

40:09.000 --> 40:12.000
Just let people get it out of their system and then done.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
The more attention you pay to it, the more people are going to do it.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
Haven't you had kids before? Don't you know if you want to, you know, get rid of a bad behavior?

40:20.000 --> 40:24.000
You ignore it. And then unless they keep doing it, then you smack the shit out of them.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
Or you put them in timeout. Whatever your choice of discipline is.

40:28.000 --> 40:35.000
Alright. Before I get into my next story here, which is all side of gamescom, I remember the other thing I wanted to bring up in housekeeping.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
So I'm going to say it now.

40:37.000 --> 40:41.000
So, you know, here at OLR, we do this show for free.

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
And we don't ask for your money. I'm not asking for your money.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
You know, we say just tell a friend or five about the show.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
And spread the word. That's all we ask here at OLR.

40:51.000 --> 40:56.000
But out of the goodness of their hearts, sometimes listeners will send us gifts.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
And, you know, I don't just go giving out the shipping address to anybody.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
I kind of have to know you a little bit, right?

41:02.000 --> 41:07.000
But we still have some listeners that, you know, I've known for a while who are good enough to actually send us things once in a while.

41:07.000 --> 41:10.000
Like, Dara Sagar, you got booze from a listener, right?

41:10.000 --> 41:17.000
Yes. Although I can't have it unless I've been super, super, super vigilant with my healthy stuff.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.000
Well, I have to tell you guys, we got a box this week.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
What?

41:22.000 --> 41:28.000
And speaking of stuff you probably can't have, Dara Sagar, I apologize in advance, but you're just going to have to deal with it.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.000
We got a box this week from Akuma JP from Japan.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
And I want to make sure you guys got this because there were some cool things for me.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
And he was very cool and got me some amiibo, so I was very happy for that.

41:41.000 --> 41:44.000
He's only helping your addiction there.

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
But I want to point out, Loki, he got that for you. There's a little Mario.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
Nice.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
From Japan.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
That's cool.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
And then this is for you, Dara Sagar, a little Kirby.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
So I'm going to throw that over there.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
Oh my God, he's so cute.

41:58.000 --> 42:02.000
I'm assuming these are for you, Dara Sagar, because I can't read a lick of Japanese.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
But there's some gaming magazines here, and Dara Sagar, I'm sure you will enjoy that.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
And then as well as this poster here.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
Maybe we'll hang that up in the studio.

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
But then remember, do you remember when Akuma sent us all the candy?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Yes, it was delicious.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
And there was one in particular.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
The green melty kisses.

42:22.000 --> 42:27.000
He sent us nine boxes of the pear candy.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Oh my God, that's the best stuff.

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
Nine boxes. Look at that right there. Sorry, I know this is radio.

42:34.000 --> 42:40.000
But nine boxes of the pear candy because we loved it so much.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.000
And all I'm thinking in the back of my mind is Dark Sagar's on a diet.

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
But she's going to have to go on the fuck it diet for a few minutes.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
You know what? I have totally been excellent and good. Let me read the label.

42:54.000 --> 42:55.000
There it is.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
It's so good.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
Akuma JP in the chat is apologizing. I'm so sorry. No more amiibo.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
What are you apologizing for? Don't apologize for anything.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
Alright, they want a picture in chat of this.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
So we'll get the magazine and some of this stuff all together.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
We'll take a little picture. We'll put it on our Twitter account.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
Doesn't it look like he just picked the whole damn thing up off the shelf?

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
I'm just taking a picture of the candy.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
Just the candy.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
Alright, so there it is.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
So I wanted to make sure Akuma JP got a shout out.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
And thank you so much.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.000
Thank you so much. And again, our listeners don't have to do that.

43:27.000 --> 43:32.000
And I think that's awesome that, you know, anybody would take the time out to do that.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
Especially when it's from other places.

43:34.000 --> 43:37.000
Because I can't walk into a store and get pear candy.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.000
And in the US, I can't walk into a store and get pear candy.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
You can have it over at the Corianna Plaza or whatever.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
I've checked at the Corianna Plaza for this. They don't have this candy.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
They do have green tea KitKats.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
You know this is weekly Famitsu, right?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
That is Famitsu. I figured it was Famitsu, yeah.

43:52.000 --> 43:57.000
I was gonna say, I found the Melty Kiss that was so good.

43:57.000 --> 44:01.000
But I've been asking Oto's to get the pear candy and they haven't gotten it.

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
Well, Akuma JP is actually clarifying in our chat right now.

44:04.000 --> 44:07.000
You can't get the pear candy anymore. It's seasonal.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
Holy crap.

44:09.000 --> 44:12.000
This is like pumpkin spice right here.

44:12.000 --> 44:16.000
So it's like the pumpkin spice trade. It's like the modern, you know.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
This is the other seasonal thing then.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
Because the buffalo sweat, the vanilla bean is seasonal as well.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
That's what I need to send to Akuma JP.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
I'm gonna send him just a box full of pumpkin spice stuff.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
He'll probably be like, I hate pumpkin. What are you doing?

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
I'm gonna have to airdrop the pictures to myself and e-mail to you for the official Twitter.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Oh, you don't have the OLR Twitter?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Not on my phone.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Darsakra, give it the program. Alright.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Anyway, more stuff.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
As I'm sitting here airdropping it to myself because, hello.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
Alright, back to some gaming news.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Speaking of Japan and things that come out of Japan.

44:49.000 --> 44:53.000
Obviously the Xbox One kind of starving for some content there.

44:53.000 --> 44:57.000
Because I would bet one thing that Akuma JP couldn't send me from Japan.

44:57.000 --> 45:05.000
Maybe something I could send Akuma JP that he probably doesn't have in Japan would be like anything that has an Xbox logo on it.

45:05.000 --> 45:09.000
Or anything Xbox One really. Like an Xbox Magazine. It's probably unheard of over there.

45:09.000 --> 45:14.000
So anyhow, Scalebound though, hoping to make a splash on the Xbox One.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
They announced more about Scalebound at Gamescom.

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
Including the fact that the gameplay trailer shows four player co-op.

45:22.000 --> 45:26.000
And that the game is not out until holiday 2016.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
So if you were thinking it was this year, you gotta wait a little longer.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
But the game still does look really cool.

45:31.000 --> 45:37.000
And you got a good glimpse at the hero and they actually put out a trailer which you can check out on their YouTubes.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
So there you go. Platinum Games of course releasing that in holiday 2016.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
I'm interested in Scalebound.

45:44.000 --> 45:49.000
Wait, DarkSakura is freaking out and she doesn't have a mic. So we can't hear her.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.000
I just did the barcode scan and it actually is in my fitness palette.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
And this stuff is called Choco London pear flavor.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
Well it's delicious.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Yeah, and it actually doesn't have a little bit of sugar.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Oh, she's rationalizing people.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
No, it really doesn't. It's only got like 3 grams per piece.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
Alright. Can I talk about more Microsofts?

46:06.000 --> 46:07.000
No pear candies.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Well they're both green.

46:09.000 --> 46:17.000
Anyhow, for your Pear Box 1, I'm sure a lot of you are looking forward to Backwards Compatibility.

46:17.000 --> 46:22.000
Well Backwards Compatibility is coming out for everyone in November.

46:22.000 --> 46:27.000
That is what we've learned that Backwards Compatibility will be out for everybody in November.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
We don't know any more details than that.

46:29.000 --> 46:35.000
Although, there was a little bit of a movie thing that they were showing to tease it.

46:35.000 --> 46:38.000
And you could see some more box art that's not already there.

46:38.000 --> 46:43.000
You could distinctly see Alan Wake as one of the games that would be Backwards Compatible.

46:43.000 --> 46:47.000
That's another great 360 game that I think a lot of people might have missed.

46:47.000 --> 46:56.000
And on top of that, they were promising to think with that,

46:56.000 --> 47:02.000
that upcoming Xbox Games of Gold games that are going to be offered for 360

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
were going to be Backwards Compatible as well.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
So you can kind of build up your library that way.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
But how long are they going to keep the Games of Gold thing for 360?

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
Because I would think there's not a lot of 360 games coming out.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
But maybe that's it.

47:14.000 --> 47:20.000
You've got lots of people that have a 360 that don't have an Xbox One.

47:20.000 --> 47:26.000
So it would be kind of cool to enhance that Sony.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
I mean that would be pretty nice.

47:28.000 --> 47:32.000
I'd love to play all my PlayStation 3 games on my PlayStation 4.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Hey, we're waiting for the Sony response to this.

47:35.000 --> 47:40.000
Come on, my PlayStation Portable could play PlayStation 1 games.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
I think a PlayStation 4 can probably handle that.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
Same argument goes with Nintendo, like as I mentioned earlier.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
We're going to wait and see how that...

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
Don't tell me that your fucking processor that can handle so many particles and shit

47:52.000 --> 47:58.000
can't render the advanced low-poly engines that were in PlayStation 1 titles.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Calm down, we'll see.

48:00.000 --> 48:03.000
If they do another one of those PlayStation fan...

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
What did they call that thing they did in Vegas last year?

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
PlayStation Experience, was that it?

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
If they do another one of those this year, that would be a great time for them to just

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
whip out backwards compatibility on stage.

48:12.000 --> 48:15.000
That would be cool. Or announce whatever the fuck they have coming for fourth quarter.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
Because right now it's Zilch, so I don't know what they've got for fourth quarter this year.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Alright, third party.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
The Call of Duty, that's why they bought the Call of Duty exclusive stuff.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
I'm sorry.

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
You got DLC slightly early in Call of Duty.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
We're getting on another tangent.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
At least Microsoft has Halo.

48:32.000 --> 48:35.000
And they fucking have, you know, Forza, so we know what they've got coming.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Dark Sakura, what's next?

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Did you get the pictures? Because I sent them to you.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I did. I'll get them on Twitter later.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.000
Okay.

48:43.000 --> 48:50.000
Well, Steam is giving out full unconditional refunds for Journey of the Light.

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
It was a PC puzzler that was supposed to be one of the hardest puzzle games on Steam.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.000
And yeah, it's really hard, because you know why?

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
Because eight of the puzzles don't exist.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
No, seven of the puzzles don't exist.

49:04.000 --> 49:12.000
So, yeah, people were trying to open the game, and yeah, there was only the one level, so there's nothing else.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
So yeah, Steam just like, here's all your money back.

49:15.000 --> 49:23.000
So yeah, the game has also been...

49:25.000 --> 49:34.000
Yeah, there's actually another note on here that the guy who made the game is not sure why it happened that way,

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
but he said that that's not how it was when he released it, so whatever.

49:40.000 --> 49:44.000
He said it was an error in a patch that he released.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
Yeah, somehow that I copied over all the levels with the same level.

49:47.000 --> 49:54.000
But here's the funny thing, apparently the first level is also unbeatable, so I don't know.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
Interesting.

49:56.000 --> 49:59.000
That's why they have the Steam refund policy, so...

49:59.000 --> 50:05.000
Well, and I thought there was one interesting thing I caught when I was reading about this before the show,

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
is that, well, Steam will let you refund anything up to two hours, right?

50:09.000 --> 50:13.000
But with this game, they're opening it up for, you can play it however long,

50:13.000 --> 50:19.000
because, I guess one of the things was, the trading cards don't unlock until you've played it for two hours.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.000
Yeah.

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
And I didn't realize that they could set that by the game.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
I thought they all unlocked every 20 minutes or whatever, I thought that was a Steam standard rule.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
So I didn't realize that you had to play the game for more than two hours to unlock the cards,

50:32.000 --> 50:38.000
and then I was thinking about it, I was like, that's a really wicked way to work around the whole two hour return thing,

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
is that now you're gonna start not getting cards until you've played the game for two hours.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
Who cares, they're fucking trading cards.

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
I know.

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
But you know some people are super into that.

50:46.000 --> 50:52.000
Well cool, then you're dumb enough to buy a broken game and keep playing it for two hours until you get stupid trading cards for that game.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
Woo.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Alright.

50:57.000 --> 51:03.000
I hope that when you do finally end up crafting those cards into a badge, you get a giant wallpaper that says,

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
You purchased a broken game, you dumbass.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
But hey, ha ha, you played it too long, so no refunds for you.

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
No tixie-baxies.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.000
Loki, you're in a mood tonight, but why don't you go to the next story, Loki.

51:24.000 --> 51:32.000
Alright, so Microsoft is offering a free DVR program, or DVR service, I guess, for over-the-air TV.

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
And apparently they're gonna allow you to record footage.

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
It can be played back on any Windows 10 device.

51:38.000 --> 51:43.000
And of course that would include the Xbox One, Windows 10, and Windows phones.

51:43.000 --> 51:48.000
They're saying that you can remotely schedule the programs via the One Guide.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
And then I guess recording, it's done seamlessly.

51:52.000 --> 51:59.000
What I'm curious though is, how the fuck do you get over-the-air TV into the Xbox One?

52:02.000 --> 52:07.000
Because it doesn't have a cable jack in it.

52:07.000 --> 52:12.000
So how's that work? Is it gonna be a separate adapter that's gonna be plugged into it?

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
Doesn't it have an import for HDMI or something?

52:14.000 --> 52:15.000
Yeah, it has that HDMI input.

52:15.000 --> 52:19.000
Could you do a TV output to the input? Just your TV?

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
I guess, but that would be kind of... I don't know if that would work.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
I mean, and even still, they're only limiting it to over-the-air.

52:29.000 --> 52:34.000
It can't be cable or anything.

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
And a lot of TVs, I'm not sure if they have HDMI out.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
Justin is pointing out in our chatroom, you can buy an HDTV tuner accessory.

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
I wasn't aware that they even sold an accessory like that.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
Okay, so that makes a little bit more sense.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
So it's like the DVD player on the original Xbox.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
That's kind of cool that they have that.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
I kind of want to set something up like that on my TV,

52:51.000 --> 52:56.000
because I had to put an antenna in the attic and I just...

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
I don't want to go in the attic.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Because that means crawling through the attic.

53:00.000 --> 53:05.000
And there's like fiberglass up there, and spiders and shit,

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
and it's fucking hot, and I'm going to fall through the ceiling.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
And it's totally what's going to happen.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
There's a part of me that thinks this sounds super cool.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
Obviously, I would be really into this if it could do the cable box.

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
Because, what? Comcast wants to charge an additional $10 a month

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
to literally push a button on the box.

53:23.000 --> 53:31.000
It can already do DVR, but they only enable it if you pay the extra $10 a month.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.000
Oh my god, I could just put the fucking antenna in my garage.

53:34.000 --> 53:37.000
Duh! Stupid! Run the cable outside!

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Loki's brainstorming in his head right now.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
Makes sense.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
So there's a part of me that... I mean, you still can get a lot on over-the-air channels.

53:44.000 --> 53:49.000
I mean, not everything, but I could watch the new Heroes.

53:49.000 --> 53:54.000
I'm wondering, where's that service that was for $15 where you get cable channels and shit?

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
I'm down with that.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
Are you talking about Arrow? Didn't they get sued out of existence?

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
No, no, no. Not Arrow. There was another thing that you got, like a beta test.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
Was it Sling or something like that?

54:04.000 --> 54:09.000
Where they were going to have it on the Xbox One, actually, where you can actually get...

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
It wasn't Arrow, because Arrow was all local stations.

54:13.000 --> 54:22.000
This was basically TBS, TNT, Comedy Central, MTV, Food Network stuff for like $15 a month.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.000
Or it starts at $15 a month, I think.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Because I'd be down for those channels for $15.

54:28.000 --> 54:34.000
Well, also, maybe Microsoft may be getting into their own cable thing,

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
kind of like we've seen Sony starting to get into in some cities as well.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
So maybe that's why... I don't know.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.000
Maybe there's a reason Microsoft really doesn't want to piss off the cable companies.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
I mean, maybe that's just a battle they decide isn't worth fighting.

54:45.000 --> 54:51.000
I don't know. At least it's free, like over-the-air TV always has been.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
So it's interesting enough, but I think you're right.

54:53.000 --> 54:58.000
It's only going to be in certain circumstances, if I'm willing to run a wire a certain way or what have you,

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
that I'm really going to benefit from it.

55:00.000 --> 55:05.000
I've got an over-the-air tuner for my Boxee Box, which I think is fucking old as shit.

55:05.000 --> 55:11.000
But maybe it's universal. I mean, it's by Hopage, so...

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
I don't know.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
There's a lot of channels I can get just through my TV without really an extra accessory.

55:16.000 --> 55:20.000
You know, I bet if I bought a cheap little HD antenna, I'd get a lot more.

55:20.000 --> 55:23.000
At least the local, like 310 and 1340 and all the local ones.

55:23.000 --> 55:29.000
We used to get the fucking... what was it? The over-the... I forgot to call those now.

55:29.000 --> 55:33.000
It was the over-the-air stations through your cable line.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
Normally, if you have cable TV and you can do that...

55:37.000 --> 55:43.000
I forget the term for it, but basically you would just plug into that and you would get those without having to have an antenna.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.000
And then they caught wise and went,

55:44.000 --> 55:49.000
Wait a second, you know, you weren't buying our cable package. Shut off!

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
So they don't have that anymore.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Alright, well, moving on to some very different news.

55:55.000 --> 56:01.000
You know, Microsoft was not the only ones at Gamescom that were announcing some big updates and changes and what have you.

56:01.000 --> 56:05.000
Activision Blizzard, namely the Blizzard part of that equation,

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
was also making some announcements at Gamescom.

56:07.000 --> 56:13.000
One of them including that Starcraft 2 Legacy of the Void, it will release within 2015.

56:13.000 --> 56:18.000
We've been waiting a long time for this final part of the Starcraft 2 trilogy.

56:18.000 --> 56:23.000
Because, you know, Starcraft 2 started a while ago and, you know, we're finally getting to that last part.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
Then what the fuck are they going to have at Blizzcon?

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
That's a very good question. I'll get to that in a minute.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
They're saying the final third of the story will be released within 2015.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
It is currently in closed beta, which you can get if you've pre-ordered the game.

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
This is the version of the game that's going to focus on the protoss.

56:39.000 --> 56:43.000
There are, of course, some new modes for casual and competitive play.

56:43.000 --> 56:47.000
So, maybe they're going to announce a release date at Blizzcon because they could do that.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
Or, oh, it's going to be their mob-

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
Don't they have, like, another game coming or something like that?

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
Like some, like, Team Fortress 2 type thing?

56:54.000 --> 56:55.000
Yeah, Overwatch.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
But anyway, one other game that will certainly be playable at Blizzcon, I'm sure,

56:59.000 --> 57:04.000
is the newest World of Warcraft expansion. Legion was announced at Gamescom.

57:04.000 --> 57:09.000
So, World of Warcraft Legion is the next expansion pack for World of Warcraft.

57:09.000 --> 57:15.000
No idea when it's coming out, but I imagine that's something they will give more details on at Blizzcon.

57:15.000 --> 57:20.000
Coming in the game for Legion is a new class.

57:20.000 --> 57:24.000
Demon Hunter is a new hero class that will be playable within the game.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
So, you can check out Demon Hunter in the game.

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
I guess it's tank and DPS. No healer. No healieros or anything.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
Artifact weapons will be a new feature in the game.

57:33.000 --> 57:39.000
You get artifact power and you unlock ability and traits and customize the weapon to do what you need it to do.

57:39.000 --> 57:44.000
The Broken Isles will be the new zone where you can now level to 110.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
You can level your character to 110 out in the Broken Isles.

57:47.000 --> 57:53.000
There will be a new order hall where NPC members of your class carry out missions at your command.

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
I don't know if that's part of the garrison or what that's all about.

57:56.000 --> 57:59.000
And a brand new PvP honor system. This sounds very interesting.

57:59.000 --> 58:04.000
They're really going to change PvP with this whole new way you rank up and you can get the points

58:04.000 --> 58:10.000
and spend them on accessories and things for PvP and show-offy things.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
So, all that sounds very interesting.

58:12.000 --> 58:18.000
I have to admit, as a former World of Warcraft player who I kind of quit during Pandaria

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
and now I pretty much play Final Fantasy XIV exclusively.

58:21.000 --> 58:25.000
I tried to go back to World of Warcraft during Warlord's Draenor, but I don't know.

58:25.000 --> 58:28.000
I just wasn't feeling it the same way I used to.

58:28.000 --> 58:33.000
And I've got to admit, when I'm watching the trailer, I'm not getting really excited about it.

58:33.000 --> 58:37.000
So, I don't know. I guess my time with WoW is all done. I don't know.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Dear Blizzard, no incur.

58:39.000 --> 58:45.000
Well, no. There's a lot of people that still care, but that number is certainly less than it used to be.

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
You know, I was talking with Twitter earlier this week about where the sub numbers,

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
because, you know, they had taken a dive not that long ago,

58:51.000 --> 58:57.000
but when Warlord's Draenor came out, the sub numbers skyrocketed to, what, like 10 million?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
So, will that happen again with Legion?

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
I don't think it's going to get that high, but there certainly will be a spike.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
But I kind of think World of Warcraft has peaked.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.000
Like, I think we've seen the peak of World of Warcraft.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
And that's okay. Blizzard has other ways.

59:11.000 --> 59:16.000
I mean, a lot of people that left World of Warcraft went to go play Heroes of the Storm.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
Still a Blizzard game.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Probably going to check out Overwatch.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Still a Blizzard game.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
Diablo 3.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
Starcraft.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
Hearthstone.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
A lot of people playing Hearthstone.

59:26.000 --> 59:29.000
You know, these are all still Blizzard games, so they're still making money off you one way or another.

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
So, I don't think Blizzard has anything to worry about.

59:33.000 --> 59:36.000
As far as what are they going to announce at BlizzCon this year,

59:36.000 --> 59:42.000
I kind of suspect it'll be a Diablo 3 expansion pack,

59:42.000 --> 59:45.000
because the game's done well on console.

59:45.000 --> 59:50.000
It's one of their few games that's console and PC.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
So, I sort of think they'll squeeze out a little more Diablo 3.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
That's what I would expect to hear about at BlizzCon.

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
By the way, if you're interested in going to BlizzCon,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
and you have the money for a ticket, and you want to go,

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
hit me up, A-S-A-P, on Twitter.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Twitter.com slash Sky, S-K-I-E.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
And you want to get a hold of me before the 14th is the last day for name changes.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
The reason why, due to a personal conflict that has come up,

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I can no longer go to BlizzCon.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I was going to go, and this has nothing to do with the fact that Horde House has been on hiatus.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
In a couple weeks, I'll tell you guys what's going on.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
But there's a personal thing that's happening that now I can no longer do BlizzCon.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000
So, I do want to sell those tickets at face value.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I'm not going to scalp you. No shenanigans.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I think it was 406 for two tickets.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
So, just 200. 200 pop.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I am looking for somebody to buy both, but if I get desperate,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
we get to like the day before, I will look at breaking them up.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Or if I can find two individual buyers, then fine, I'll break them up. I don't care.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
So, just a heads up.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
If you're interested in going to BlizzCon and checking that out,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
swag bags all yours, let me know on Twitter,

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
because I'm trying to unload those tickets.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
So, there you go.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Blizzard updates out of Gamescom.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
We are going to get to release dates soon,

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
but Dark Soccer has got a quick note for us before we do.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
That I do.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
This is kind of a switch up in something EA's been doing.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.000
They're basically going to start releasing their games in the UK a day earlier.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
So, instead of doing it Friday in the UK, they're going to do it Thursday in the UK.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So, pretty much, it's going to be, from what I can tell,

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
the equivalent of simultaneous releasing,

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000
because, I mean, the day before there is, yeah, it's kind of weird.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
So, yeah, but basically, they want to make sure that everyone in Europe

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
gets their games at the same time as everyone everywhere else.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
So, yay.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
All right.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I wonder if this will be a trend that moves on to other companies.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Maybe EA starts this and then a whole lot of other companies start releasing their games earlier.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Yeah.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
We'll see.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Timey-wimey stuff.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
All right.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Well, before we find out, we've still got many more weeks to get through,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
including this week and what is coming out in the US, Japan, and the UK.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
So, Loki, what is coming out in the US this week?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Fuck if I know.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Is that your official answer?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
It's my answer currently.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I'm just pulling it up real fast.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I do apologize.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Loki was unprepared for a release date segment that we do every week here on OLR.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Well, yeah.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Hey, I finally got a text back from Shane on that game that I'm supposed to check out on Steam.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Oh, which game was it?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Dead Realm is the name of the game.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Dead Realm?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
That's the game I'm supposed to check out on Steam in the scary game.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I don't know.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Look at it later when you're not looking up release dates.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Okay.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:02.000
So, this week, not a whole lot, actually.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Basically, it looks like they're doing a, I guess this is an update,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Toy Soldiers War Chest Hall of Fame Edition for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Then, for some stupid reason, they have a Paddington Adventures in London game for 3DS.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
X-Blaze, Lost, and then Memories.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
That's on PlayStation 3.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Oh, that's right.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I did remember there was a big game this week.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Garfield Kart on 3DS.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Oh, yay.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
X-Blaze, Lost, Memories is also coming out on Vita as well.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
And not a game you can buy at retail, but everybody's gone to the Rapture

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
or should be coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I was going to say, I see AndyScout mentioning that in chat right now.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Everyone's gone to the Rapture.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
I know they've been pushing that on PlayStation as well in the digital store,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
so I want to check that out too.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
It's like a fun game.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
That's it.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
All right.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Moving over to Japan and checking out the releases over there.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:06.000
In Japan this week on the PlayStation 4, actually, there's really not a lot on PlayStation 4.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Things are kind of quiet in Japan right now until the 27th of August,

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
at least on the PlayStation 4.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Looking at some of the other systems, of course, the Wii U.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Ain't got nothing until Mario Maker's out.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
So they're pretty slow there.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
But, you know, you can always usually count on the Vita in a slow week,

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
but this week on the Vita, nothing as well.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
There's a Romeo vs. Juliet chapter pack thing coming out on the Vita,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
but that's not until August 20th.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:35.000
So that just leaves me with the 3DS.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:41.000
The 3DS has one lone game out this week, Atelier Deco La Doll Collection.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
That's right.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
A doll dress-up game is your lone release there on the 3DS this week.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
So a very quiet week in Japan for releases.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Dark Sakura?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Just a few things.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
On the 11th, we have Everybody's Gone to the Rapture,

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Goat Simulator on PS4 and PS3, and Olli Olli 2.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Oh, God.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Is that coming out over here too?

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I will have to buy it for a third time.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Hasn't Olli Olli 2 been out forever?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
No, fuck that.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
I'm talking about Goat Simulator.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Oh.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Oh, God.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Goat Simulator's on PC and Xbox One?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Yeah, it's on PC, Xbox One, Xbox 360.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Ah, got it.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Yes, I want to buy that again.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
That'll be the game I get my son to play.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Goat Simulator.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
He'll have to stream that shit.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Are you a fan of Goat Simulator, Dark Sakura?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
I liked it for about five minutes.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I think it's fun.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
All right.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Just a couple more stories, and then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Loki.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
All right.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Let's talk about Konami.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
I know.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
It's depressing.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Apparently, there's some information coming out from Nikkei's report about the company.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000
I guess from some insiders.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Some of the things coming out of the report.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Apparently, they have renamed the computers that were originally part of Kojima Productions,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
now known as Number 8 Production Department, and they're not connected to the internet

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
and only can send messages internally.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Employees who leave office during lunchtime are monitored by time cards, and those who

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000
take too long have their names announced throughout the company.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Developers, including relatively high-ranking ones, who aren't seen as useful, they are

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:33.000
being reassigned to different jobs, including sometimes security guards or even cleaning

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
staff of Konami's health clubs.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Apparently, also, the company, they've monitored the farewell Facebook post of a soon-to-be-leaving

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
employee, who had gotten a job at another company, and any employees who'd liked the

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
post were reshuffled within the company.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
That sounds like a pretty hostile work environment, if you ask me.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Well, not that I'm gonna say, oh, I agree with all this stuff or necessarily defend.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000
There is a big part of me that says, well, wait a minute, I'm gonna take a huge grain

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:15.000
of salt with this, because is some of this being sensationalized for headlines sensationalism

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
in my gaming journalism?

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Maybe, I don't know.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000
It's more real than you think, Loki.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
So, I mean, okay, some of it is extreme.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
The whole thing where people are getting reassigned to be the janitor and stuff, that's a little

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
weird.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
But, okay, the computers are not on the internet.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000
That does not seem like a crime against humanity, because putting the computers on the internet

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
puts them at risk of getting hacked.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
The developers of the games probably don't have a need to be on the internet, because

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
all the tools they use are internal.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Whatever they need access to are probably on their internal network.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Well, I think what they're doing is because maybe they're getting rid of that team that

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.000
they don't want information being sent out from them externally or something like that.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
But it's not unheard of for other companies as well.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Especially in a lot of non-office environments, you probably don't have access to the internet

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
where you work.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Even in my work, the internet, a lot of stuff is blocked.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Is it a crime against humanity?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000
No.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
I understand why I can't play on Facebook during the workday.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Which also, again, if people are clicking like on a post or whatever about somebody's

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000
work, you've got to be careful what kind of crap you post on Facebook about the workplace.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
You really, really do.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Again, it's not that I agree, but I question how much of this is a little bit like the

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
movie version.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
I don't know.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
This is Konami, though.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I'm willing to believe a lot of it, because look at what they did.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
They literally scrubbed Kojima off of his game.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I mean, who does that?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
That's just bullshit.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I think that's why a lot of this is believable.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I'm sure morale is in the toilet at Konami.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I'm sure morale is absolutely in the toilet.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
There's no arguing that, really, based on everything we're seeing and hearing.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Again, the urge to kick them while they're down, you've got to put that in check with,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
but what's the reality?

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
But that's okay, though.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
I've got good news for you.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Oh, goodie.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Because I know that everybody was so disappointed that PT came up there and they took it down

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
off the internet and you're like, ah, damn, what about a new Silent Hill game?

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
There's a brand new Silent Hill game coming.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
They just announced it.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Get excited for mobile games.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
It's a slot machine.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
It's really happening.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
We were joking about that on the show a couple months ago when all this fuckery was hitting

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
its peak.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
There really is a Silent Hill slot machine happening.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Yes.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
God.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
All right.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Okay.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Whatever.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Dr. Sakura's making a motion with her hand that's not safe for work.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.000
But really, the best news out of all this probably is completely unrelated, but I've

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
been kind of watching some of their coverage of the test locations of the new DDR machine,

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
but BomaniStyle's back.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
BomaniStyle.com.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Check it out.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
It's back.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Oh, yeah.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Our pals at BomaniStyle are back after this.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So to show there are still some good and some fans and stuff of Konami and, well, music

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
gaming in general, because they're running a lot of stuff on Guitar Hero and other stuff

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.000
too.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
But yeah, it's good that they're back.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
So welcome back.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Rolling out the red carpet.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Ticker tape parade.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I'll have to get Eddie back on the show at some point.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
It's a lot of fun to have him on.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Especially in light of everything that's been going on, I'd really like to hear because

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
he probably follows them even more closely than we do.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
So when are we going to start seeing the Silent Hill machines like at Red Hawk or something

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
like that?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I don't know if they would ever bring the Silent Hill machines here because I don't

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
think it really fits in with the old grandmas who fill up the arcade.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Oh my heart!

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000
You know, you look at the slot machines in Reno and it's more like, you know, the Ellen

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
show and the Hangover movie.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000
They have an Ellen show slot machine.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000
I won 40 bucks off a Dolly Parton slot machine.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
It was awesome.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
But they also had a Dungeons and Dragons.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
That's what makes me understand.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
I don't understand.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Maybe this is bigger in Japan or something.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
They have a really healthy gambling scene in Japan.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I mean, where are these slot machines going?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Because I know over here in the states that do allow slot machines, I just don't see this

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
type of slot machine being a draw.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
It's probably other Asian regions.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
It may not even necessarily be Japan.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
It could be Macau.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
It could be, you know, other parts of the world where there's gambling.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I just don't know.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Whatever, that's the direction you want to take the company in.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I guess I can only...

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
No, I can mock you as long as I want, I guess.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
So I will continue to do so.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
All right.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
I got to give a shout out to this real quick.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.000
It's on my mind.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I got to say it.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000
So our pal, Dekeman.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
You know, Dekeman?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
We owe Dekeman a lot.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
We would have a website right now if it wasn't for Dekeman.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I know it's very old, and one of these days we'll get it updated.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
But Dekeman, he has a Tumblr, and I still keep in touch with him on Tumblr,

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
and he posted a picture.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
He was behind a Konami car.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
And remember, Dekeman lives like in the middle of nowhere Canada.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
With all due respect, you know, Dekeman, you're great,

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
but you live in the middle of nowhere Canada, right?

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000
He knows that.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So he's behind this Konami car in the middle of nowhere Canada

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
at a McDonald's drive-through.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
And so he took a picture of him flipping the car off in the McDonald's drive-through.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
And on Tumblr, I couldn't help but add the line.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I said, how apropro that Konami is now resorting to buying from the dollar menu at McDonald's.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
But apparently he's got casinos, because he's in a remote part of Canada,

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
he's got casinos where he's at.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I think it's a touristy area, because without giving away his home address,

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000
I think he's in like a lake, which a lot of Canada is by a lake.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Would the dollar menu be considered microtransactions at McDonald's?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Fuck off.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Or is really any transaction a microtransaction at McDonald's?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000
I mean, especially when you look at calories, I guess.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
So next time you go to, I can just see Loki.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
This is angry old man Loki driving to the McDonald's.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Yeah, I want a hamburger and a large diet coke.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000
You want fries with that?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Fuck your microtransactions!

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
First off, I have to question my sanity ordering a diet coke,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000
because that's like, I'd rather drink water than diet coke.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
That shit is nasty.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Although, like, my wife had like some, I don't know what it is,

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
like hipster green coke or something like that.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
It's something like green canned shit that has like,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
something that's not sugar, it's unnatural.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Oh, it's the stevia coke.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Oh yeah, it's okay, I guess.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
It's coke life.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
I got one of those once before they even had a price on it at the store.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
They basically rolled it out a month early.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I'm sorry, you just said hipster soda and Dark Sakura says,

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
well, I got it a month before everybody else did.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.000
No, no, no, my grocery store actually put it out on the shelves

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
before they were supposed to, so they didn't have a skew for it.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
You know, it's just, you're being hipster about hipster soda, but I love it.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Arts.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
I mean, one of those things.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
You want, you want some parakeet?

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
You want, you want a whole box?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Cause we got nine boxes.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I'll take a box home.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Take a box home.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Give me one now.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Take two boxes home.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Get it out of my house.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Thank you.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I'll just give some as a housewarming thing when people come over.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.000
I only went to my wife.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
She always wants exotic candy.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
There you go, exotic candy.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Pear candy for, there you go.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
I'll give, make sure Alan eats a box.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
I just don't want to open the box.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
What is it?

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
It's like a chocolate.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
It's like pear peanut brittle stuff.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000
It looks like what it does on the front there.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Anyway.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
It's pear nut brittle with chocolate.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000
This is great radio.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000
So let's move on and talk about Killer Instinct season three.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Yeah, Killer Instinct's still going and Killer Instinct announced that season three is going

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:11.000
to be coming to Xbox One and of course, as mentioned at E3, Windows 10.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
The date will be March of 2016.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
There is no gameplay footage available.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
However, Killer Instinct is apparently going to feature guest characters from Rare Replay.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Imagine that crossover.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Rash from Battletoads will be a character in Killer Instinct.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Actually, not even will be.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
He is a character available in Killer Instinct right now.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000
So you can check out Rash, a preview character from Killer Instinct season three.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
And a cute little tie in there for Rare Replay.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
So if you want to know if GameStop has Battletoads, yes they do.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000
And it's available even on the Xbox One as well.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Battletoads everywhere.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Now just, how about just a new Battletoads game?

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I feel like that's the thing that Microsoft's been dancing around for ever since they picked up Rare.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
How about a new Battletoads game? How about it?

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000
Microsoft is to Battletoads as Nintendo is to F-Zero.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
It is kind of irritating, isn't it?

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Alright, let's go back to a more classic time.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Let's go back to a time when Battletoads was new and relevant.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Well, maybe a little past that actually.

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Still pissed us off.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
hey, this is worthy of your attention.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
A classic game that you ought to be playing.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And the rule is...

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
It's so old.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Ten years old or more.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Because I think tonight's is like right on the line, right?

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
It's like April, 2005.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
So if you can believe it, this game is ten years old.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Get ready to feel old.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Psychonauts.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Yes, Psychonauts.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
It came out in 2005.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Released by Double Fine Productions through Majesco.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:04.000
So basically you play as a boy who has psychic powers.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Who runs away from the circus to sneak into summer camp for other people who are psycho.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I mean, have psychic powers.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
So you can be a Psychonaut.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
And there is a plot going on at the camp.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
The only he can stop.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So he basically also works with a few of the other characters in the game.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Solves puzzles.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And one of the things about this one that made it really...

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
I'd say a special, special snowflake.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Is that not only is it a platforming game or has platforming elements to it.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:44.000
But it also sort of throws in the type of dialogue options that you get from an adventure game.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.000
You have to find hidden items you can use to buy items at the camp.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Or get psy cards that boost your ranking.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000
You have to do like little levels within the game.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.000
And then you have the quote real world that's the camp that you're in.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
You also have an insane asylum in the game.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And every game needs an insane asylum.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.000
One of the other things that I thought was fun is finding the tags to match to emotional baggage.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Which is how you unlock different things in the game.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:23.000
And break mental vaults to get slideshows that let you know a little bit more about the character and whatnot.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
So it's just really a fun little quirky game.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:33.000
He's got powers like telekinesis, pyrokinesis which is great.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Clairvoyance, PsyShield, PsyBlast, confusion, levitation, and invisibility.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
So pretty, pretty fun stuff.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:52.000
And I'm not going to go too much into that because honestly I think most of you have played this already since it's not, you know, it's just ten years ago, you know.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Loki was just telling me he was playing it yesterday. Isn't that right, Loki?

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.000
No, I have never played this game. It's in my library. I have not played it.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Ten years.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
I have a feeling, unfortunately, there's a lot of people who picked up Psychonauts and let it rot in their library.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
So this might be a gentle reminder to go check it out.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Well, at any rate, it got a really good score when it came out.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:26.000
It actually was, one of the best descriptions is actually one of GameSpot's sources.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
The whole look of the game feels like an unholy love child of Tim Burton and a Pixar animation team.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Yeah, I can see that.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
It's pretty accurate.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Well, and it's funny because we're talking about the whole, like, I was talking about Banjo-Kazooie earlier and it's almost kind of like this is that type of game evolves a little bit.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I mean, obviously there's a lot of differences. It's not tit for tat.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
But, you know, the whole, like, platformer, you know, what that looked like years later.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Well, it also won, like, a bajillion awards in 2005.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:02.000
2006 it won Best Screenplay, Games Magazine, Electronic Game of the Year, Best Writing.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:08.000
It got Top Hero, 10 out of 10 for certain magazines.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
So it basically won all of these awards.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000
But despite winning all of that, it actually was a commercial bomb.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000
It failed.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
So, however, it's got a huge, like, cult following.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000
So it's remained popular even after that.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
You know, just sort of like Xanadu, you know?

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
Or the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Or Xanadu.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
That's what this is. Or the Rocky Horror Xanadu Show.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Or with showgirls.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
In fact, I heard that coming to the Castro, Peach is Christ and Jinx Monsoon are doing Psychonauts.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
Believe it or not.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I think that's the thing that's happening.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Maybe not.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Psychonauts.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
It's probably in your Steam library.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Go check it out already.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Dig it up.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
I think they were giving it away for free at one point.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I swear, like, they were.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
It was like a Humble Bundle or something.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Yeah, Humble. It's been Humble.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
One of the earliest ones had it.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Yeah.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
So there you go. Classic game of the week.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Hey, we've got plenty more show coming up.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
We still have some more news out of Gamescom.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.000
We're going to get to the foogle question of the week as well.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000

And we're going to read some of those.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
I think we actually got some this week.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
So we'll get to those.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.000

When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Episode number 609 already in progress.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000
This is part B. Live on this August 9th of 2015.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
I just realized the episode number is 609.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
It's almost 69.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
But there's, like, a zero in the middle.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
There just comes a certain...

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000
It's for the threesome.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000
That's right.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000
They just put an O.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
The giant fat man.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Yeah.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Yeah.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Yeah.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
That's right.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
They just put an O.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
The giant fat man that's just sitting there doing nothing.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Or an O face in the middle.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Nope.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
It's the cat.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Hey, what are you doing?

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Are you cuddling?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
I want to cuddle.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Purr, purr, purr, purr, purr.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Wouldn't that be 63?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Because the cat face is colon 3.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Yeah, but if it's, like, Shermie-sized, it's no.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Okay.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
All right.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Well, believe it or not, it's not a total perverted show.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Just sometimes.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
We talk about video games here on the program.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
And we're going to get back into rapid-fire news here, but I wanted to mention this, because

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.720
Loki, you were talking during the break, you were mentioning you had to get this new Humble

01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:34.720
Bundle.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.280
And it does sound pretty awesome, actually.

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.720
You know, they put together some really good deals over at Humble Bundle, I got to say.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:44.040
So what is it that people can catch up on this week?

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.040
It's all Namco games, right?

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.340
It's all Bandai Namco stuff.

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:50.280
So they've got Pac-Man Championship Edition DX.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.280
That's the version with all the DLC.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:52.600
Do you know how much I paid for that?

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.600
Yeah, though.

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:54.600
And now they're just giving it away.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.600
The all-you-can-eat bundle.

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.600
That's true.

01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.600
For a dollar.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:03.800
That's Platform Mines, Dead Core, and then for, if you beat the average, you get Ridge

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:10.400
Racer Unbounded Bundle, Enslaved Odyssey to the West, Ace Combat and Assault Horizon,

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:14.120
and then for $10, Dark Souls Prepared to Die Edition.

01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:16.800
Plus more games that they'll announce all later today.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.520
Yet to be announced!

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.840
Maybe one of the Pac-Man Ghostly Adventure games.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:22.760
I haven't played Ridge Racer Unbounded too much.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:25.680
I played just a very little bit of it.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.640
And, I don't know, it's Bugbear, so it's not too terrible.

01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:30.640
It's just not...

01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:34.160
Damn, it's about time for a new Ridge Racer game, Namco.

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.160
I mean, seriously.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:39.920
Well, I'm telling you, that whole thing is worth it for Pac-Man DX alone.

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:40.920
I love that game.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:46.040
That's a great update of the Pac-Man series, so, I mean, just get that, even if nothing

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.040
else.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.040
Drop the dollar.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.040
Although there's a lot of other good stuff in there, too.

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.440
I'm just saying, the Pac-Man one just really jumps out at me.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.440
I was like, wow, what a deal.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:57.240
If Namco really wanted to do right by Ridge Racer fans, it would get reskinned R4.

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:02.480
Now, going back to the whole retro glasses thing we were talking about at the very beginning

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:03.480
of the show.

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:04.480
That's for nothing.

01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.480
R4 was the best Ridge Racer game.

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.200
It's the best Ridge Racer game there was.

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:09.880
Okay, so you would take it just a reskinned HD R4?

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.880
I would just take R4, period.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.080
I mean, I've got R4.

01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:14.560
R4 for PS4?

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.760
R4 was amazing.

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:18.200
With JotCon compatibility.

01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.120
The JotCon was not very good.

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.760
It was actually pretty fun.

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.460
That was playing Wipeout with the NegCon.

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.460
That was pretty fun.

01:24:26.460 --> 01:24:31.200
ActDeft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, I would kill for the Ridge Racer 5 HD

01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.200
remaster.

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.620
Let's see, Ragenator says, I got the Namco Bandai bundle.

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:36.620
Everything minus the Dark Souls.

01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:40.880
I ended up giving Pac-Man CEDX Plus away since I already had it.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:45.320
I imagine a lot of folks out there probably already have it, but if you don't, this is

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.960
a great time to jump on that.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.960
Just saying.

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:52.200
Alright, let's go around and check out some other quick news and little quick bites we

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.840
call rapid fire news.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.840
Loki.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:59.780
We seriously need to play the R4 theme at some point, like maybe break next week or

01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:00.780
something like that.

01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:01.780
It's amazing.

01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:02.780
Remind me, we'll do that.

01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:04.880
I'm pretty sure I have it from old OLR rotation.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.960
It might even be in VOG rotation right now.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:09.680
It is absolutely amazing.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:16.920
Anywho, so as I mentioned, I was back into reading, or well, I started reading, but then

01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:21.960
I got lazy, and actually I like listening to the audiobook version better, but Armada.

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:27.520
And of course, Armada is by Ernest Cline, who also wrote Ready Player One, which as

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:33.680
you may know is getting adapted into a feature length movie by Steven Spielberg.

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:34.680
That is amazing.

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:38.440
And no, it's even more amazing, we have a release date for it.

01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:44.320
That's right, Steven Spielberg's adaption of Ready Player One should be out December

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:47.160
17th, 2017.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:50.960
It's two years away, but I can't wait.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.160
It's gonna be awesome.

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:57.440
That's a little bit of a wait, but considering they haven't even casted one yet.

01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:58.440
I don't care.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.520
I will be waiting and hyped.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.200
Go get in line right now, like those Star Wars people.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.200
They're crazy.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:07.880
It's gonna be amazing.

01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:13.460
Along with that though, Uncharted, and there's a brand new Resident Evil movie.

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.500
Those also have release dates.

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:21.020
So Uncharted's supposed to be scheduled to come out June 30th, 2017.

01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:28.200
Also the new Resident Evil movie, slated, called Resident Evil The Final Chapter.

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:30.420
The search for even more money.

01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:31.420
Scheduled to be coming out January.

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:33.380
Is it really gonna be the final chapter?

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:35.100
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see.

01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:36.580
Is Mila Jovovich finally done with this shit?

01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:39.100
It's the final chapter until they reboot that shit.

01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:47.020
And then so, that's gonna be coming to theaters January 27th, and then non-gaming related.

01:26:47.020 --> 01:26:50.500
Bad Boys 3, February 17th, 2017.

01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:55.980
Ghostbusters, they rebooted that July 7th, 2016.

01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:57.540
Which apparently Bill Murray is in now.

01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:59.220
I just heard that today.

01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:00.220
Cool.

01:27:00.220 --> 01:27:02.020
Is he gonna be a ghost in that one?

01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:04.140
It's a cameo, so maybe.

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:06.980
Jumanji, they're rebooting that.

01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:16.540
That's Christmas 2016, Magnificent Seven September 23rd, 2016, and Underworld 5, yet

01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:21.040
another series of movies that really should end.

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:24.300
That's gonna be October 21st, 2016.

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:26.300
Alright.

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:31.220
Embryon in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, Resident Evil, the really honestly final

01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:33.260
chapter, we swear for reals.

01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:35.380
I am seriously, I caught a movie.

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:36.860
Like Five Nights at Freddy's?

01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:41.740
Didn't the final chapter suddenly disappear from all the Five Nights at Freddy's 4 stuff?

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:45.260
I bet the reason why we got Five Nights at Freddy's 4 early is because he took his final

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.860
game and split it into two.

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:50.220
I bet he took some of his ideas and split them.

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.220
Just saying.

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:52.220
Just saying.

01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.220
Five Nights at Freddy's 5.

01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:56.740
I know, you would think there's gotta be a fifth Five Nights at Freddy's game.

01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:57.740
Then you end it.

01:27:57.740 --> 01:27:58.740
The fifth night.

01:27:58.740 --> 01:27:59.740
There you go.

01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:00.740
At Freddy's.

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:01.740
There you go.

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:02.740
Anyway.

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:07.300
Yeah I caught like one of the Resident Evil movies in the middle and like, I think that

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:10.100
series stopped being Resident Evil quite a long time ago.

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:13.500
Like I was like, this is like the fucking Matrix shit.

01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:14.740
And I'm okay with that.

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:20.700
Cause I'm not like a huge fan of Resident Evil but I'm pretty sure from what I know

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:23.480
of Resident Evil, that was not Resident Evil.

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.340
That was some crazy Matrix bullshit that I watched but.

01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:27.340
Those movies are gross.

01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.700
I'm okay with that.

01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:29.900
I don't need all that gore.

01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:30.900
I'm not into that stuff.

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:31.900
No it wasn't very gory.

01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:34.060
It was just ridiculous.

01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:36.380
Like why are there all these clones of you?

01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:40.060
And why are they jumping off of a building and skydiving in slow mo?

01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:42.460
I don't understand what the fuck is going on here.

01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:44.180
Wesker is cool.

01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:45.940
But I didn't understand what the hell was going on.

01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:46.940
Alright moving on.

01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:50.580
And of course Ally Larter is in that.

01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:51.580
Yeah.

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.180
I'm sick of her after Heroes.

01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:55.180
Anyway sorry.

01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:56.260
This is pretty exciting though.

01:28:56.260 --> 01:28:59.660
They're gonna be doing an Attack on Titan game for the Playstation 4.

01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:06.460
It's gonna be developed by Omega Force behind the Dynasty Warriors series.

01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:14.900
That's supposed to be coming out sometime, I don't know, 2016 sometime?

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:15.900
Something like that.

01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:18.020
I'll play that.

01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:27.540
And then along with that there's gonna be a VR game based on John Wick.

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:36.140
So this is gonna be done by, I guess, the studio behind the Darkness, Payday 2, and

01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:38.820
the Chronicles of Riddick, Escape from Butcher Bay.

01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:42.380
So Starbreeze, I mean Payday 2 is fucking amazing.

01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:46.580
So I think that'll be awesome.

01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:53.500
It's apparently, they're saying right now that they have like a promo experience version

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:57.340
of the game that's on the HTC Vive world tour.

01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:03.500
So if you happen to come across that, you can check out a demo that's gonna be on the

01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:06.620
HTC Vive through SteamVR.

01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:07.940
Alright.

01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:13.100
Well, traveling around for some other rapid fire news, out of Gamescom this week, I know

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:17.940
a lot of you are looking forward to Street Fighter 5, and Vega was confirmed.

01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:20.260
That's our Vega, or Claw.

01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:22.900
He was confirmed for the game.

01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:27.220
And not everybody a fan of what's hiding under the mask though.

01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:29.260
Vega and Ken could possibly be brothers.

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:31.180
Maybe that'll be a plot twist, I don't know.

01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:32.660
Re-imagine Ken.

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.660
But I don't know.

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:34.660
You know what?

01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:35.740
I'm still hyped about Street Fighter 5.

01:30:35.740 --> 01:30:36.740
I don't care.

01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:37.740
I'll still play it.

01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:38.900
So will you.

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.660
Who cares if they look a little weird?

01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:45.040
They're gonna have reskins anyway available for, you know, $1.99 in the store.

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.040
Let's be real.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.040
So there you go.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.660
Vega happening for Street Fighter 5.

01:30:49.660 --> 01:30:54.220
Final Fantasy XV also got a new trailer out of Gamescom.

01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:56.860
I gotta admit, didn't care for it.

01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:01.860
And I'm hyped about Final Fantasy XV, but considering how much they hyped up that trailer,

01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:06.300
I wasn't, like, then it came out, you know, I was like, that's really pretty.

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:07.860
That's very artistic.

01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:09.260
But it tells me nothing about the game.

01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.420
It's just like, oh, pretty pictures.

01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:14.800
Which, to be fair, I guess is a lot of Final Fantasy, but I wasn't, I don't know, I guess

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:15.800
I was just expecting a little more.

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:18.580
I still haven't gone back to play that, like, updated demo that they have.

01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:19.580
Episode Disque, yeah?

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:20.580
Yeah.

01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:21.580
No, you should.

01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:22.580
I haven't.

01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:23.580
No.

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.580
You know what else I haven't gone back to?

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:26.740
That's what I kind of thought we would see out of Gamescom is other scenes from the game

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:28.060
besides what we saw in Disque.

01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:29.060
Yeah.

01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:30.060
I thought that's what we'd get.

01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:31.060
Yeah, I kind of regret buying that.

01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:32.060
Maybe Tokyo Game Show.

01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:34.340
Kind of regret buying the other Final Fantasy game for that demo.

01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:36.340
You didn't like it?

01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:40.460
That's what you get.

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:41.460
They knew a lot of people.

01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:42.460
It was okay.

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:43.980
They knew a lot of people would buy the game just for that demo.

01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:51.620
I thought it looked good, like, the trailer looked good for that game, but not so much.

01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:57.180
Well, anyhow, you know, it's only, like, a couple minutes, and it is pretty, so you might

01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:00.900
as well go watch the damn trailer, so it's out there if you haven't seen it yet.

01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:06.820
Now, by the way, also, regarding Final Fantasy XV, there was a little update that was going

01:32:06.820 --> 01:32:07.820
on.

01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:11.500
Apparently, they actually showed off the Marlboro enemy and what it looks like now, and then

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:15.060
they were talking a little bit about the big villain in the game, and they're actually

01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:20.900
talking about that the villain in Final Fantasy XV is going to top all of the previous Final

01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:23.900
Fantasy villains.

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:27.220
They also said that there is the girl with the black hair that you see in some of the

01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.220
previews.

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:33.160
The girl with the black hair is mysterious, but integral to the story.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:38.820
They're also saying a playable city demo will be released soon, but no idea when that will

01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:39.820
launch.

01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:40.820
Probably just like the game.

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:43.200
They have no idea when that is actually going to launch.

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:48.140
Speaking of Final Fantasy series in a game I was very hyped about, you might have heard

01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:54.380
throughout the past week that Arnie Roth, who is the Distant Worlds Final Fantasy composer,

01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:59.460
he kind of slipped up at a concert and talked about a Final Fantasy XII Remake, to which

01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:04.300
I said, yes, I was so excited for Final Fantasy XII Remake.

01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:09.140
Like, look, I get not everybody was into the story, but Final Fantasy XII probably had

01:33:09.140 --> 01:33:13.780
the best battle system out of any of the Final Fantasy games, and it brought us Balthier

01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:14.780
and Fran to the world.

01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:18.940
So we have things to be thankful for, and you know you want some Balthier and Fran in

01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:19.940
HD.

01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:20.940
Let's be real.

01:33:20.940 --> 01:33:25.660
You will put up with the van scene, you will put up with that shit so you can see Balthier

01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:31.220
and Fran in HD, especially if they're still keeping the same voice act, anyway.

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:38.260
But, well, Arnie Roth put out a statement and retracted the word remake, saying it was

01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:40.700
used in error.

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:45.180
Following conversations with composer Hitoshi Sakamoto regarding new concert arrangements

01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:50.420
of music from Final Fantasy XII, regrettably, the term remake was used in error during one

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:53.900
of the announcements that took place from the stage during the concert.

01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:57.260
Maybe they meant they remade the song or remade the arrangement.

01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:58.260
I don't know.

01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:01.380
Maybe they're gonna HDify the game.

01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:05.980
Hopefully they're just covering their ass for a Tokyo game show reveal.

01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:10.460
That is my hope, but, uh, I guess I won't hold my breath, but I just, I really want

01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.620
a Final Fantasy XII HD.

01:34:12.620 --> 01:34:14.500
Why won't you give it to me square?

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:16.620
Why won't you?

01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:19.220
Dark Sakura, save me.

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:21.940
There's no saving you from fandom, Rob.

01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:24.540
No saving.

01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:30.580
Real quick from chat, sorry, live.vognetwork.com, Embreon in chat says, the world deserves Bosh's

01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:32.980
chest and Fran's butt in HD.

01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:35.860
Eye candy for everyone.

01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:42.940
So, um, we've been talking off and on about Guitar Hero Live and what, uh, we had some

01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:46.140
thought for it, but they actually have confirmed there's going to be singing in it.

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:51.980
So you get to belt out, you know, the, the greatest hits involved in it.

01:34:51.980 --> 01:34:56.940
Hopefully in key, they should put in like a auto-tune for stuff.

01:34:56.940 --> 01:34:59.940
Or we get Loki to sing it in the key of funny.

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:07.140
So moving on, um, Lego, uh, Marvel Avengers have been delayed to 2016.

01:35:07.140 --> 01:35:08.140
Boo!

01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:10.140
Big, fat, boo.

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:11.940
And I know why they're doing it too.

01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:14.340
It's for that fucking Lego Dimensions bullshit.

01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:18.540
Yeah, let's sell us our $30 fucking expansion packs for that game.

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:20.540
Jamie, I think you pushed a button.

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:22.540
No, no, we'll push a button.

01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:24.540
I didn't do shit.

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:29.540
No, I read the article too.

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:32.140
They even bring up Lego Dimensions, so.

01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:34.140
Yeah, it's fucking $100 for the base.

01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:35.140
It's Lego.

01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:36.140
Okay.

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:37.140
It's Lego.

01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:38.140
It's the Lego premium.

01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:42.940
You know, $100 for the fucking base set and $30 for fucking expansions.

01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:47.740
Dark Sakura again, making back and forth, not safe for work signs with her hand.

01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:48.740
Thank God.

01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.740
This is why it's not a video show, people.

01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:51.740
Yep.

01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:56.740
So speaking of delays, of course, some Mighty No. 9 has been delayed until 2016.

01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:58.940
No!

01:35:58.940 --> 01:36:01.940
Sorry, I just felt after what Lowkey did.

01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:05.940
Comcept posted about this, saying, and I'm just going to read the quote.

01:36:05.940 --> 01:36:08.940
We can acknowledge that the game will no longer meet its current release.

01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:12.940
Bad use of an apostrophe, geez.

01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:19.940
Will no longer meet its current release date and will now, in fact, appear in Q1 2016.

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:23.940
We will announce a firm release date and further details once we have it later.

01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:29.140
Basically, they say it's for bugs and quality assurance.

01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:35.140
I think it might have a little bit more to do with Red Ash failing.

01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:36.140
A little bit to do with it.

01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:42.140
By the way, Red Ash has a investor now, so it's going to have its releases after all.

01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:45.140
I don't know if it has anything to do with Red Ash.

01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:48.140
I just think they, you know, video games are hard, people.

01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:50.140
They're not easy things to make.

01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:53.140
And I think sometimes people are too aggressive with how long it's really going to take to make them.

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:56.340
They heard that 2016 was going to be the year that everyone was going to be releasing their game,

01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:58.340
so they're like, hey, you know what, let's do it too.

01:36:58.340 --> 01:37:03.340
We want to be in with that action, so let's do that.

01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:07.340
Maybe it's punishment for Red Ash not meeting its Kickstarter.

01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:08.340
It's because they really...

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:09.340
We'll get them.

01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:15.340
It's because, just like LEGO Marvel Avengers, they really wanted to highlight another game

01:37:15.340 --> 01:37:18.340
that was coming out, and that being the Mega Man collection.

01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:22.340
They didn't want to steal any thunder away from them, so that's why it's coming out later on.

01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:24.540
And they're going to bug fix the hell out of it.

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:29.540
All I'm saying, every little thing that goes wrong with this Kickstarter

01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:32.540
is going to affect future Kickstarters, just saying.

01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:34.540
Bloodstained better do it right.

01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:36.540
Whatever, what Kickstarter has come out on time?

01:37:36.540 --> 01:37:38.540
Like, hardly any, so...

01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:42.540
I got my Exploding Kittens in the timeframe they said it would come out.

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:44.540
I mean, granted, that's a card game, but...

01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.540
And it's sitting there in a box, unopened,

01:37:46.540 --> 01:37:49.540
and everything I hear is about how the box is amazing,

01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:51.740
but I'm not going to open it until I have people over.

01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:52.740
We have a party.

01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:54.740
Play some Exploding Kittens.

01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:55.740
Open it.

01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:57.740
No, I'm not going to open it now, because...

01:37:57.740 --> 01:37:58.740
The box is amazing.

01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:00.740
Don't you want to see how amazing it is?

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.740
Maybe we'll do a YouTube thing or something,

01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:05.740
because apparently I have to have Sanrio in the room when I do it.

01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:07.740
So...

01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:08.740
Alright, anyhow...

01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:14.740
It doesn't shoot out like some sort of compressed catnip or something.

01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:17.740
It's just a catnip bomb goes off in the room.

01:38:17.940 --> 01:38:20.940
It's like someone dropped a flashbang, but catnip bang.

01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.940
DungeonBuster in chat says,

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:25.940
The new Hong Kong sequel is on target for this month, actually,

01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:27.940
even with the expanded content due to the Kickstarter.

01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:31.940
DungeonBuster saying Shadowrun Returns was a month or so off target,

01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:33.940
but it came out relatively close.

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:35.940
Once again, another game that I backed by Kickstarter

01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.940
and have the content and haven't played it.

01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:41.940
And I was super hyped about that, and I really need to go back and play it,

01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:42.940
but, you know...

01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:44.940
That and Shadowrun Online, yeah,

01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:46.940
I'm going to dedicate myself to an MMO.

01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:48.140
Have that as well.

01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:49.140
I think.

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:50.140
Do I have it?

01:38:50.140 --> 01:38:53.140
This is a comment on a story that Jamie read a little earlier,

01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.140
but it's good, so I'm going to read it.

01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:57.140
Andy Scout in our chatroom over at live.voguenetwork.com says,

01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:00.140
Guitar Hero Live is going back to basics.

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:02.140
Now we added singing.

01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:04.140
How long until drums?

01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:06.140
That's a good point, though.

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.140
They said they're going back to basics,

01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:09.140
then all of a sudden here comes the whole band.

01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:12.140
I'm hoping it's just because singing is easy,

01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:14.140
and maybe can be done through the iPhone,

01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:15.140
like SingStar is now.

01:39:15.140 --> 01:39:16.140
You don't even need a microphone.

01:39:16.340 --> 01:39:19.340
Like, by the way, if you weren't aware about that with SingStar,

01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:22.340
all you need is the mobile phone and the PlayStation 4,

01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:23.340
and it's magic.

01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:24.340
The whole Bluetooth magic.

01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:26.340
You don't even need a mic now.

01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:27.340
Sing into your phone.

01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:28.340
Like, I was almost...

01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:33.340
Because my one son's super into Let It Go from the Frozen movie.

01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:35.340
What child isn't into that song?

01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:36.340
I don't understand it.

01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:41.340
I mean, I think it's the daycare they play it.

01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:43.340
Like, he is obsessed with that fucking video.

01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:45.340
We played that for about an hour today.

01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:46.540
But I was almost like...

01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:47.540
Because they like dancing, too.

01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:48.540
So I was like, okay, well, maybe...

01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:50.540
Let's see if this is in Just Dance.

01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:51.540
It's got to be in Just Dance.

01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:52.540
And sure enough, it is.

01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:56.540
But now they have in Just Dance was the Angry Birds theme,

01:39:56.540 --> 01:40:00.540
and there's people dressed up like angry birds,

01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:02.540
and it's kind of creepy.

01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:07.540
Seeing the angry birds with people feet and arms.

01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:11.540
It's like the Reddit forum where they've got...

01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:14.540
Or the subreddit where birds with human arms or whatever it is.

01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:18.540
Yeah, some of those Just Dance videos are very, very creepy.

01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:21.540
But, you know, they got some really awesome songs in that game, too,

01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:22.540
so I can't complain.

01:40:22.540 --> 01:40:26.540
Anyhow, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:30.540
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:33.540
You put Facebook and Google together, you get FUGL.

01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:43.540
And yes, Google Plus is still a thing, as far as I know.

01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:46.540
It's still running, so until it isn't running...

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:49.540
If people stop answering all together on Google Plus,

01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.540
then I'll stop asking it there.

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:53.540
But we're still getting one or two answers a week.

01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:55.540
That's something.

01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:57.540
That's more phone calls than we got last week.

01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:02.540
So might as well run the Google Plus page as well as the Facebook.

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:04.540
So we're an equal opportunity here at OLR.

01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:07.540
Actually, we got four answers on Google Plus this week.

01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.540
So here's the question this week.

01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:12.540
It is about the news about the DVR service.

01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:16.540
We want to ask you guys about something not directly related to games.

01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:20.540
Microsoft announced that they will roll out a subscription-free DVR service for the Xbox One.

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:23.540
This will allow you to record TV over the air, not cable.

01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:26.540
They can be played back on any Windows 10 device,

01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:28.540
meaning the Xbox One or your PC.

01:41:28.540 --> 01:41:30.540
Are you interested in a feature like that?

01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:34.540
Or do you think Microsoft needs to keep the message about the games?

01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:37.540
Let's start on Google Plus tonight, since four is a lot on Google Plus.

01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:39.540
We'll start with Redertainment, who says,

01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:42.540
As I'm considering my options as far as TV is concerned,

01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:48.540
what keeps me going back to satellite is being able to watch WWE, ESPN, and local channels via a DVR.

01:41:48.540 --> 01:41:53.540
If I can get the local channels on my Xbox One and can get ESPN on Sling TV,

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:58.540
the only thing keeping me on satellite is being able to watch full complete episodes of WWE Raw,

01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:02.540
which isn't currently possible via any legal online platform.

01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:06.540
So yes, DVR on Xbox One is very appealing to me.

01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:08.540
Josh Wye replied and said,

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:11.540
No, I think that Microsoft has muddled the message already.

01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:14.540
You either walk on the side of the street or the other.

01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:17.540
If you try to walk in the middle, you get run over.

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:20.540
Also where I live, Sony tried DVR with their PlayStation TV.

01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:22.540
That didn't go anywhere.

01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:24.540
Anyway, I thought the future is streaming.

01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:26.540
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they shouldn't do this,

01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:28.540
it's just that they shouldn't lead with it.

01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:33.540
You know, interesting in that comment, the part about the smartphone,

01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:36.540
it's interesting in that comment, the part about the streaming,

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:39.540
because I think he does make a very good point there,

01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:44.540
is that it's interesting that NBC and CBS and Fox and all of them

01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:48.540
haven't really answered with full on streaming.

01:42:48.540 --> 01:42:50.540
I guess in a way they have, because somebody is going to jump in and say,

01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:53.540
Hulu, Hulu is an NBC thing and Fox partnership.

01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:56.540
So I guess in some way they have and CBS has their own thing.

01:42:56.540 --> 01:42:59.540
But again, then you all know how we feel about the fragmented

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:01.540
when you got one guy over here, one guy over here,

01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:03.540
like you don't want to pay ten bucks each for all that stuff.

01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:07.540
So I think it is interesting that the whole part about streaming,

01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:11.540
where maybe some of these shows just need to be more accessible in streaming.

01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:14.540
And some of these companies need to wake up to the reality that,

01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:16.540
you know, the game has changed and over the air TV

01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:18.540
isn't how everybody is watching their TV anymore.

01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:22.540
Anyway, ActDeft says on Google+, it's free.

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:25.540
Unless it's utter crap and useless, I don't mind.

01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:28.540
Extra Futures do sell a console for lots of people.

01:43:28.540 --> 01:43:32.540
Brozame replies and says, for me a console is about games,

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:35.540
so adding in features that don't add value for everyone buying an Xbox One

01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:37.540
seems like a huge waste to me.

01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:40.540
I'd much rather see games that make me want to buy the console,

01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:42.540
instead of just waiting for the PC version,

01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.540
since there's maybe two games I'm missing out on

01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:47.540
between both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:51.540
Over on Facebook, we had Fabrice A who said,

01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:53.540
this would be very interesting for cable,

01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:56.540
but no use to me since I only get four channels over the air.

01:43:56.540 --> 01:44:01.540
Tigerclaw says, it's great that Microsoft is offering a free DVR service,

01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:03.540
but the fact it's only over the air isn't good enough.

01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:05.540
Not many people can get a good quality signal

01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:07.540
for over the air channels on their TV.

01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:10.540
If they just allowed the functionality to control your cable box,

01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:11.540
it would make the service better.

01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:14.540
Andy R said, I don't even have cable, so not really.

01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:17.540
In the days of Hulu and such, DVR seems less and less relevant.

01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:21.540
The few cable shows I do watch, like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter,

01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:24.540
are up on the studio's website the night of airing for cable subscribers

01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:26.540
and a week later for non-subscribers.

01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:29.540
Why bother setting up something to record if they're going to do it for you?

01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:31.540
I'd rather focus on games.

01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:33.540
I already have a PlayStation 4, Wii U, and both handhelds,

01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:35.540
and not enough time to play everything on those.

01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:37.540
If they want me to buy an Xbox One,

01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:41.540
I need games I want to play that I can't already get elsewhere.

01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:42.540
Well, to be fair to Microsoft,

01:44:42.540 --> 01:44:45.540
I do feel like a big part of their campaign this year has been,

01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:50.540
you know, these are the games you're going to play on Microsoft only this fall.

01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:53.540
They're running the Rise of the Tomb Raider and the Halo 5

01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:57.540
and the Rare Replay and all the stuff that's on their console.

01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:01.540
Silent Tom says, I think that it will be forgotten and underused,

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.540
just like Nintendo's TV.

01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:07.540
They just need to focus on games and not weird bells and whistles.

01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:10.540
Rageinator says, I'd use a free DVR service.

01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:12.540
Okay, so it's not games related. So what?

01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:18.540
We all may be gamers, but we all don't live, breathe, and shit games 24-7-365.

01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:22.540
Well, I don't know about you, Rageinator, but we have other interests, too,

01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:27.540
and it would be nice to consolidate devices that enable us to enjoy our non-gaming interests.

01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:29.540
Alan H. replied and said,

01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:34.540
Consoles have been a household multimedia appliance since the 360 and Netflix integration,

01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:39.540
arguably easier for those who watch DVDs via their PlayStation 2.

01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:41.540
I understand why Microsoft, a giant in their own right,

01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:46.540
would absolutely not want to go near negotiations with Comcast or Time Warner Cable,

01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:49.540
two companies with reputations for not playing fair.

01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:52.540
They have little reason to view Microsoft as a competitor,

01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:54.540
and Microsoft is too smart to start giving them one.

01:45:54.540 --> 01:46:00.540
That said, obviously, that limitation is going to make it useless to the vast majority of consumers.

01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:02.540
And lastly, sj100matt says,

01:46:02.540 --> 01:46:08.540
I may be in the minority, but I love these TV, TV sports, TV features that consoles roll out.

01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:13.540
I think it broadens and enhances the experiences that you can have with a console, but I digress.

01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:18.540
I think the hot item about this DVR feature is that you should be able to stream your saved shows on your Windows 10 tablets.

01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:20.540
People will eat that up.

01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:24.540
Yeah, I got to admit, part of it that does seem really interesting to me

01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:29.540
is the fact that it's not just the fact that it DVRs to the same TV that your Xbox is on anyway,

01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:34.540
but you could then, with the streaming, you could then watch that same show on your computer

01:46:34.540 --> 01:46:37.540
or watch it on your Windows tablet or whatever.

01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:39.540
That part is kind of interesting to me.

01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:44.540
So that is definitely an enhanced feature there, so I'm keeping that in mind.

01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:46.540
Anyway, some really great answers tonight, you guys.

01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:47.540
Thanks for participating.

01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:53.540
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:55.540
Be our friend on social networking.

01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.540
Darn it, be our friend.

01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:59.540
Let's get back into some other news. Loki.

01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:06.540
Alright, I was just checking out my friend who used to work at a, well, he still runs a game store

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:10.540
and he's an actor and stuff, and he's going to be in some Disney film.

01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:11.540
Good for him.

01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:12.540
Oh yeah, you were talking about that.

01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:15.540
He also got sued by Pepsi, so he lives a strange life.

01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:17.540
Alright.

01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:20.540
Anyways, so this is kind of cool.

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:28.540
Cities Skylines, you know, kind of the SimCity, but not SimCity, at least not shitty as the last SimCity game was.

01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:34.540
It'll be coming to consoles, and of course, it'll be coming to the Xbox One first.

01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:42.540
That is scheduled to be coming out, I'm not sure, doesn't really mention yet when, but soon.

01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:50.540
And then of course, you know, hopefully other consoles after the Xbox One at a later date.

01:47:50.540 --> 01:48:01.540
Also, Crackdown 3, the game that was going to get me to buy an Xbox One, not coming out until 2016.

01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:05.540
But they did show off some development footage.

01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:13.540
Now, one of the things that they were touting about the series was that it was going to be using that Microsoft cloud server stuff

01:48:13.540 --> 01:48:18.540
to allow for this really crazy destruction in the game.

01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:25.540
However, that destruction is only going to be available in multiplayer, but it's 100% destruction,

01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:31.540
so you can blow up any building that you see in the game, and it will dynamically be destroyed.

01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:34.540
And that is amazing, so I'll have to check that out.

01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:39.540
But yeah, unfortunately, Crackdown 3, not coming out until summer 2016.

01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:42.540
So, got a year away.

01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.540
Alright.

01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:47.540
I'm excited to try that new Crackdown game, too.

01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:51.540
I wasn't as huge on the series as you were, but you know I gotta go collect orbs.

01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:52.540
You do.

01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:54.540
That's what everybody was into, right?

01:48:54.540 --> 01:48:56.540
Hey, I'm excited about this.

01:48:56.540 --> 01:49:00.540
You know, with the whole talk we've had tonight about retro being new again and all this,

01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:06.540
I think this is a retro series that is really long overdue for reimagining.

01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:12.540
And I realize it already had one, but anyway, the series I'm talking about is A Boy and His Blob.

01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:14.540
Remember that game on the NES? I love that game.

01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:15.540
Yes.

01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:16.540
It's a great little puzzle game.

01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:19.540
You feed the jelly beans and it turns the blob into these different things.

01:49:19.540 --> 01:49:21.540
Very cool little NES game.

01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:25.540
And I know they had the 3DS, it was like 3DS or a Wii?

01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:26.540
It was both, yeah.

01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:27.540
Yeah, it was on both.

01:49:27.540 --> 01:49:29.540
Did it ever actually come out?

01:49:29.540 --> 01:49:30.540
No, it did.

01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:33.540
Okay, because I remember playing it at E3 and then it seemed like it disappeared.

01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:40.540
But anyway, apparently Majesco Entertainment has appointed a new CEO,

01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:44.540
and they're actually going to be focusing on digital games, not just the retail games.

01:49:44.540 --> 01:49:47.540
The company Majesco is working on Glue,

01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:52.540
and it's also working on a new entry for the Boy and His Blob series.

01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:56.540
Sometime in the next two fiscal quarters is when we'll see this game,

01:49:56.540 --> 01:50:01.540
and it's going to be across all next generation consoles, and in some cases, PC.

01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:06.540
So who knows, The Boy and His Blob will be very logical to show up on the PC as well.

01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:11.540
David Rector, by the way, now taking over as Majesco's new CEO and Chairman of the Board.

01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:14.540
So yeah, very cool that's been worked on.

01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:20.540
I hope it's not treated like shovelware, because I could really see where this just gets thrown into a kid's game.

01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:25.540
But yeah, that was a game I remember really loving in the NES days.

01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:28.540
So we'll be looking forward to that reboot.

01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:30.540
Meanwhile, Dark Sakura.

01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:32.540
Stuff. The end.

01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:34.540
No, really.

01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:36.540
That's going to do it for tonight, Solr.

01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:41.540
If you want an alternative to Mighty No. 9 and you're tired of waiting,

01:50:41.540 --> 01:50:47.540
there is a game that's actually under Steam Early Access right now called 20XX.

01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:50.540
And it looks like it's pretty good.

01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:53.540
It's $12 right now through Steam Early Access.

01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:55.540
It keeps getting updated.

01:50:55.540 --> 01:51:00.540
It's in beta right now, but it's got really, really good ratings.

01:51:00.540 --> 01:51:08.540
And it actually originally was named as Echoes of Eridu, but got renamed to 20XX.

01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:13.540
Raised over $20,000 from backers on Kickstarter, so hey.

01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:21.540
And I thought Mighty No. 9 ripped off Mega Man. Holy crap.

01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:25.540
What's funny isn't the 20XX, isn't that the opening of Mega Man 2?

01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:26.540
Yeah, that's the Mega Man thing.

01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:29.540
Where it goes in the year 20XX.

01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:34.540
So it's like, not even is the game biting a little bit of Mega Man there,

01:51:34.540 --> 01:51:38.540
but the name is, at least I kind of see it as a Mega Man reference.

01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:41.540
A very subtle one, but it's there.

01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:43.540
In the art world, it's called a quote.

01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:45.540
A quote.

01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:52.540
Meaning if you see remnants of another painter's style from an earlier era, it's called a quote.

01:51:52.540 --> 01:51:54.540
So this is a quote.

01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:58.540
So when I make a happy little cloud in Mario Paint, I'm quoting Bob Ross.

01:51:58.540 --> 01:51:59.540
You sure are.

01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:00.540
Hey, there you go.

01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:03.540
It sounds like a roguelike Mega Man game.

01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:08.540
Alan Alchemy in chat says, that reminds me of Homestar Runner when it made fun of Mega Man.

01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:11.540
In the year XDXD6.

01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:13.540
20XD6.

01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:15.540
Yeah.

01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:17.540
Hey, Stickley Man, what are you doing?

01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:21.540
Wasn't there a new Homestar Runner this week that was talking about how Flash is dead?

01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:24.540
Like, and then there was a part of me that was like, wow, they're still making Homestar Runner?

01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:25.540
That's awesome.

01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:28.540
Like, it came back after like a huge break.

01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.540
Alright, anyhow, Loki.

01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:40.540
Alright, so Bethesda has released some more information about Fallout 4, including a little bit of endgame stuff for Fallout.

01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:46.540
With that, there is going to be no end to the game after the main story is done.

01:52:46.540 --> 01:52:50.540
You know, I think that's pretty similar to the other games that Bethesda has released.

01:52:50.540 --> 01:52:53.540
And also, no level cap for Fallout 4.

01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:56.540
So you can level, level, level, level some more.

01:52:58.540 --> 01:52:59.540
And more.

01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:02.540
The level cap is 20XDX.

01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:04.540
20XDX.

01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:06.540
Yes.

01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:08.540
Are you excited for Fallout 4, Loki?

01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:11.540
I am, even though I've not really played a Fallout game.

01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:15.540
And I, you know, I have Fallout 3 and I bought it and it made a big deal of it.

01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:18.540
But it's such a pain in the ass to get it to work.

01:53:18.540 --> 01:53:20.540
Because of the stupid games for Windows shit.

01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:26.540
It just, update your shit so I don't have to do all this work around crap to get your fucking game to work.

01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:31.540
Well, this is funny because after E3, I seem to remember.

01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:35.540
I don't know if this was a conversation Bobby and I were having or if Bobby said it on his show.

01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:37.540
Probably both, honestly.

01:53:37.540 --> 01:53:41.540
But we were talking about, or he was saying on his show about how,

01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:46.540
now that Shenmue 3 has showed up on the Sony stage,

01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:50.540
how much longer until Kickstarters on stage at conferences become the norm?

01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:53.540
Well, guess what happened at Gamescom?

01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:55.540
Microsoft had a Kickstarter on their stage.

01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:58.540
This one was a little different though because it was already funded.

01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:03.540
Koji Igarashi got up on the Microsoft stage to talk about Bloodstained.

01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:07.540
And so, yeah, they give a little update on Bloodstained.

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:11.540
Talking about a new character in the game, they showed some models and art.

01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:15.540
Didn't really say if this character is playable or not, but he sure looks it, so we'll see.

01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:24.540
Also, Bloodstained is given a release window of March 2017 for PlayStation 4, Vita, Xbox One, Wii U, and PC.

01:54:24.540 --> 01:54:32.540
They also mentioned on the stage there that the game will feature cross-play between Windows 10 and Xbox One.

01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:35.540
So that is something else a little bit Microsoft-centric there.

01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:37.540
So, pretty cool.

01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:39.540
I'm looking forward to Bloodstained.

01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:45.540
I hope just because they're saying March 2017 now doesn't mean it actually gets delayed to February 2018.

01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:47.540
But be prepared for anything.

01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:49.540
Games always get delayed.

01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:53.540
I got reminded when I was talking about Shadowrun and everything.

01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:55.540
Oh yeah, Shadowrun Online. Yeah, I backed that.

01:54:55.540 --> 01:54:58.540
That was supposed to be out in 2013.

01:54:58.540 --> 01:54:59.540
Really?

01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:03.540
The last update that I just read because I don't follow it too closely.

01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:06.540
The company is filing for bankruptcy.

01:55:06.540 --> 01:55:09.540
I don't think I'm going to be playing that game apparently.

01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:10.540
Sorry to hear that.

01:55:10.540 --> 01:55:12.540
Thankfully I didn't back it for too much money.

01:55:12.540 --> 01:55:13.540
Alright.

01:55:13.540 --> 01:55:16.540
Well, every week we like to take a trip to our mailbag.

01:55:16.540 --> 01:55:20.540
Participate at Orangelauntrader.com is the place to send us emails.

01:55:26.540 --> 01:55:32.540
Dark Soccer is going to suit up and head on into the mailbag and find some emails worthy of reading on tonight's show.

01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:35.540
And after a very slow response past few weeks, we actually got a few tonight.

01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:36.540
Two?

01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:37.540
Two.

01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:38.540
I'll take them.

01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:39.540
Two emails.

01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:41.540
So the first one comes from Robert M.

01:55:42.540 --> 01:55:44.540
And it's disjointed.

01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:46.540
Apparently comes the warning.

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:50.540
Briefly Loki, yes there's at least one unofficial LEGO Loot Crate type service.

01:55:50.540 --> 01:55:53.540
Look up Brick Builders Club for one.

01:55:53.540 --> 01:56:01.540
Secondly, I saw some developers Twitter post showing the two dozen or so games Scott Cawthorne did before the Five Nights series.

01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:05.540
I wonder if the games have any easter eggs that call back to his previous games.

01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:12.540
Third, I imagine we'll have an Angry Birds the Movie the Game, still not sure about the characters having bodies.

01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:14.540
That is so true though about Angry Birds the Movie the Game.

01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:22.540
For the record, when I was in Illustrator class, one of our assignments was to make a CD or, you know, a game cover.

01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:25.540
So I did Silent Hill of the Movie the Game.

01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:28.540
So I did, anyway.

01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:34.540
I've recommended OLR slash VOG to a few others and gotten recommendations for other indie casts.

01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:41.540
The Slash Films Toboloski Files with poignant stories from the character actor.

01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:51.540
The St. Louis based Geekly Podcast and BCX Beyond Comics Radio with DJ Jacob Riles whose style reminds me a bit of Travis's.

01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:55.540
Does he also orbit around the earth when doing his show?

01:56:55.540 --> 01:57:00.540
Because you know Travis broadcasts from the satellite of VOG so we'll have to look into that.

01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:02.540
Last email?

01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:03.540
Yes.

01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:07.540
God, this is long. Holy!

01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:08.540
It's from Raw Steel UT.

01:57:08.540 --> 01:57:09.540
Yeah, I get that a lot.

01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:10.540
Oh, Raw Steel UT.

01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:15.540
Balking at the size of the email there.

01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:16.540
You're gonna read parts.

01:57:16.540 --> 01:57:17.540
Okay.

01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:19.540
Dear Raw Steel UT.

01:57:19.540 --> 01:57:21.540
And anybody sending long emails.

01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:24.540
Don't send a novel.

01:57:26.540 --> 01:57:30.540
I don't want it annotated with footnotes.

01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:32.540
I want the cliff notes.

01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:36.540
Or put it up on the forums.

01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:42.540
Yes, you can write novels on our forums all you want because nobody's loving those forums.

01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:46.540
Although, I will say, Ray Genator posted a Final Fantasy XIV question so I was like, yay, forums.

01:57:46.540 --> 01:57:50.540
Hey guys, I just bought Rare Replay in part due to the mostly positive buzz it's been receiving.

01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:56.540
And it is here once more that I learned to avoid buying based mostly on positive buzz.

01:57:56.540 --> 01:57:58.540
See, the game does something rather odd.

01:57:58.540 --> 01:58:01.540
It installs the base menus and the menu of the game straight away.

01:58:01.540 --> 01:58:11.540
However, anything that received Xbox Live Arcade or on-disk 360 releases is running rather ghetto on the clearly experimental Xbox 360 emulation software.

01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:14.540
This is where the issue begins for me.

01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:16.540
See, the games install off the disk just fine.

01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:20.540
Although, they're all their own separate entries in the apps list.

01:58:20.540 --> 01:58:23.540
However, this is a big fucking deal.

01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:27.540
Each of them requires a separate update in the hundreds of megs.

01:58:27.540 --> 01:58:39.540
And seeing that this is an Xbox One title, those updates not only take longer to download than they would on literally any other piece of hardware, but also fuck up bandwidth on any network the Xbone is on.

01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:43.540
I kinda referenced this when I mentioned that I put in the disk and it wanted to do like 5 gigs of updates.

01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:47.540
I think he's talking about this just using more colorful language.

01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:50.540
Ray Genator, don't you fucking dare.

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.540
What was Ray Genator threatening?

01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:54.540
A War and Peace sized email.

01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:57.540
Just, ooh, it fell in the trash. Imagine that.

01:58:57.540 --> 01:58:59.540
We accidentally lost your email, Ray Genator.

01:58:59.540 --> 01:59:01.540
This is a long email and I want to get it read.

01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:02.540
Alright.

01:59:02.540 --> 01:59:09.540
Not only that, but while 360 titles start fine without the updates, you can't play them because for some weird reason you have to download your profile.

01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:14.540
That's right, there's no option for profile creation or simply using the Xbone profiles.

01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:17.540
I'm just saying Xbone because it's funny.

01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:24.540
Nope, and a separate X360 profile needs to be downloaded in order to play the games, meaning there's no real option to play your games.

01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:29.540
Or use the Xbone at all until a few extra gigs of data have been downloaded onto the system.

01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:33.540
Can I just quickly say, I did not have that problem, so I actually don't know what he's talking about here.

01:59:33.540 --> 01:59:38.540
And I don't know if that's because I was in the emulation thing already, but I don't even remember ever going through that.

01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:46.540
So, my question is, where it's downloading all the games and stuff like that, do you get those, like the Xbox 360 ones, do you get those on the Xbox 360?

01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:53.540
I don't think so, because these specifically say Rare Replay at the top. So, anyway.

01:59:53.540 --> 02:00:02.540
This, mind you, for games that are almost a decade old at minimum, and for a compilation being re-released in mid-August, that has no real reason to be rushed.

02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:09.540
This brings me to the real issue, most likely the massive downloads are for updates to the emulators being written for each and every game.

02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:17.540
The fact that I got Banjo-Kazooie to start suggests that the games themselves are on disc, but as the backward compatibility is clearly being cobbled together desperately,

02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:26.540
they're probably being worked on for each game, casting further doubt on the future of much ever coming out on Xbone's backwards compatibility initiative,

02:00:26.540 --> 02:00:32.540
simply due to the apparent effort that is being exerted to get each game a decent emulator.

02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:40.540
Now, that's entirely possible that the coming OS update for the Xbone will have an emulator. Okay, it's going way into it, okay.

02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:49.540
Okay, complaint, complaint, complaint. Okay, I'm really not trying to be...

02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:52.540
It's long your editing, it's fine.

02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:54.540
I'm trying not to be rude about it.

02:00:55.540 --> 02:00:57.540
Okay, so I'll just skip down to the last.

02:00:57.540 --> 02:01:03.540
If you're buying the collection for the games that haven't been seen Xbox 360 released before, then you'll likely have a good time.

02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:11.540
If you're buying the game for the games that have seen 360 released before, you're better off dusting your 360 off and playing those games there,

02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:18.540
unless, of course, you're among the very elite who can afford and have access to Google Fiber or similar highly expensive internet speeds,

02:01:18.540 --> 02:01:21.540
at least if the emulator issue isn't resolved soon.

02:01:21.540 --> 02:01:26.540
And that has been today's warning from the Office of the OLR Minister of Unpopular Opinions. Have a great day.

02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:28.540
Regards, Ross Steel UT.

02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:35.540
Actually, I don't know who gave you that title, Ross Steel UT, but it should actually be the OLR Minister of Long and Unpopular Opinions.

02:01:35.540 --> 02:01:37.540
Just, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:40.540
Well, you know, he goes into the missing games, which...

02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:48.540
Which we talked about a little bit earlier in the show, and then I did notice the complaint about, like, Conker's Bad Fur Day and Grabbed by the Ghoulies.

02:01:48.540 --> 02:01:55.540
I guess they did something a little different there, and to be honest, I haven't really dipped into both those games yet, so I didn't catch the same thing.

02:01:55.540 --> 02:02:03.540
But I guess they did the N64 version of Conker's Bad Fur Day for some reason, but then they did the Xbox version of Grabbed by the fucking Ghoulies.

02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:07.540
He says he was not a fan of that, so, interesting.

02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:10.540
Thank you for the paraphrasing for me, because my...

02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:16.540
I'm trying, I'm hoping I didn't screw that up, but seeing as I haven't played either of those games yet, I may be fucking up his opinions, I apologize.

02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:23.540
And I, sometimes, I mean, actually more often than not, I tend to agree with some of his stuff.

02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:32.540
I mean, I haven't played the game, so I can't make a judgement on it, and I'm probably not gonna get it, because, honestly, I think I own all of those games.

02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:35.540
On their original consoles.

02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:39.540
Well, a Spectrum, though, but yeah, I mean, you're not gonna go back and collect Spectrum.

02:02:39.540 --> 02:02:41.540
There's other emulators for the Spectrum.

02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:48.540
You know what? Sometimes you have to hear unpopular opinions, and I think that's one thing I want this show to bring.

02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:55.540
But it works both ways, too, is that, you know, I want the people, like, and I'm just picking on RustyOuT, because he happens to be the current emailer.

02:02:55.540 --> 02:02:58.540
I want him to be able to hear the other side as well.

02:02:58.540 --> 02:03:08.540
So I think as long as we can have a respectful, underlined, italicized, bolded dialogue about, you know, things that we like and we don't like, and, you know, have a...

02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:14.540
I think that's a great thing that we can do on this show, is make people think differently. Put ourselves in other people's shoes for a little while.

02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:19.540
Even if it doesn't change your opinion, at least respecting that another opinion exists and is just as valid.

02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:20.540
Yes.

02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:21.540
And keep in mind...

02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:25.540
And sometimes it can strengthen your own opinion to understand why another person thinks the way they do.

02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:28.540
And keep in mind, don't confuse opinion for fact.

02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:31.540
And I actually don't think anything he's saying in this email is actually unpopular.

02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:36.540
I've heard a lot of people complaining about the Xbox 360 load times and some of the other stuff with the game.

02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:38.540
And to be honest, I felt the same way, so...

02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:41.540
Yeah, we're probably not getting it. Like I said, we've got most of the games. There's no point.

02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:42.540
Yep.

02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:50.540
Okay, well, regardless, it is time, after the email bag, to get into our FUs of the week.

02:03:50.540 --> 02:03:51.540
Here we go.

02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:07.540
Dark Sakura.

02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:10.540
FU to the weekend being too damn short.

02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:12.540
And me for sleeping most of it.

02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:14.540
That's it.

02:04:14.540 --> 02:04:15.540
Loki.

02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:19.540
FU to my wife and kids for...

02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:24.540
Well, mainly my wife for yesterday when the kids went to sleep.

02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:27.540
She takes a nap on the couch and took up the entire couch.

02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:33.540
So I couldn't nap on the couch, so I ended up just because I was exhausted laying on the floor.

02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:35.540
Well, the floor is cement.

02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:40.540
And so now my back has been fucking hurting for the last two days because I was laying on that hard fucking floor.

02:04:40.540 --> 02:04:45.540
I would have slept in our bedroom, but the baby wasn't yet asleep yet.

02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:48.540
So I had to wait for him to go to sleep before I could go in there.

02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:50.540
And I was too tired for that.

02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:53.540
And FU having to work on Saturdays until the other day.

02:04:54.540 --> 02:05:00.540
That's going to be a tough change, but like I said before the show, having the weekday off for appointments.

02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:02.540
And working until 7 o'clock at night.

02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:08.540
That's weird too because I'm used to going in at 7 or 8 and it's going to be like 10 or 30.

02:05:08.540 --> 02:05:11.540
But that means you can stay up until 3 AM and it's justified.

02:05:11.540 --> 02:05:14.540
No, I still have to wake up early to get the kids off from school.

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:15.540
No.

02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:16.540
So no it's not.

02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:20.540
But I get a little bit... I'm easy to work I guess.

02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:21.540
Alright.

02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:29.540
My FU of the week goes to the fact that I cannot get over the mental block that change is scary.

02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:33.540
Because you know, change usually ends up a good thing.

02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:38.540
If you do the same thing every single day for your life, you're always going to get the same end result.

02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:40.540
So change kind of has to happen.

02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:43.540
But yet, all that being said, I still...

02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:50.540
There's still a big part of me that is very nervous about a big change that's happening very soon.

02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:54.540
And so of course I'm a little scared about that.

02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:56.540
But it'll all work out kids.

02:05:56.540 --> 02:05:58.540
It'll all work out.

02:05:58.540 --> 02:05:59.540
Alright.

02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:01.540
Let's get to a couple more stories.

02:06:01.540 --> 02:06:05.540
And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:06:05.540 --> 02:06:07.540
And our user name on Skype.

02:06:07.540 --> 02:06:08.540
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:10.540
All one word.

02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:12.540
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:13.540
Stop vague blogging.

02:06:13.540 --> 02:06:14.540
This isn't Facebook.

02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:15.540
Hey, you know what?

02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:17.540
It isn't Facebook.

02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:18.540
It's OLR.

02:06:18.540 --> 02:06:21.540
The vagueness is sometimes even worse on this show.

02:06:21.540 --> 02:06:22.540
You must be new here.

02:06:22.540 --> 02:06:24.540
Alright.

02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:26.540
Let's get to a couple more stories for you guys.

02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:28.540
And then the Skype line.

02:06:28.540 --> 02:06:29.540
Loki.

02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:32.540
So, take note Nintendo and Sony.

02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:36.540
This is how you should really do your pre-order bonuses and stuff like that for games.

02:06:36.540 --> 02:06:37.540
Just Cause 3.

02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:42.540
If you happen to order that on the Xbox One,

02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:50.540
you also get a backwards compatible version of Just Cause 2 on the Xbox 360 to play as well.

02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:52.540
I think that's pretty awesome.

02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:58.540
And, of course, Just Cause 3 is coming out December 1st on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

02:06:58.540 --> 02:07:02.540
But you'll only be able to get that free game on the Xbox One version.

02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:05.540
Now, I want to say this isn't the first game they're doing this with, too.

02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:07.540
They had, I think...

02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:09.540
There were some other ones, too.

02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:11.540
Among that, of course, would be Gears of War.

02:07:11.540 --> 02:07:16.540
The Gears of War Ultimate Edition, which is actually coming out in a couple weeks here.

02:07:16.540 --> 02:07:21.540
If you do happen to purchase that game, you'll get access to Gears of War,

02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:28.540
Gears of War 2, Gears of War 3, and Gears of War Judgment all for free via backwards compatibility.

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:33.540
So, the Ultimate Edition, that'll be coming out August 25th.

02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:37.540
And then you're going to have that offer until the end of 2015.

02:07:38.540 --> 02:07:43.540
This seems like a very interesting trend, where buy the game and get the old game free.

02:07:43.540 --> 02:07:45.540
Yeah, now...

02:07:45.540 --> 02:07:47.540
Maybe that's how they enhanced the digital...

02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:53.540
However, with at least this version of it, that's not necessarily...

02:07:53.540 --> 02:07:58.540
Not the same with Just Cause, but in this one, you don't actually get those games for free.

02:07:58.540 --> 02:08:01.540
You get them for free until the end of the year.

02:08:01.540 --> 02:08:03.540
And then they're not free anymore.

02:08:03.540 --> 02:08:07.540
Oh, interesting. It's a way to raise hype, I guess.

02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:12.540
All they want you to do, they want you to push A and pre-order digitally.

02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:15.540
And if they have to throw games at you to do it, that's what they're going to do.

02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:17.540
Old games to get you to press A.

02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:23.540
Well, I liked how they did it with the PlayStation versions of...

02:08:23.540 --> 02:08:29.540
For example, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare did this, where you had your PlayStation 4 version.

02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:33.540
You got the other version for free. It was cross-buy.

02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:38.540
And I thought that was awesome, because my friends don't have that version of the game.

02:08:38.540 --> 02:08:41.540
And thankfully, my PlayStation 4 had broken.

02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:45.540
And so I was still able to play a version of the game while it was being fixed.

02:08:45.540 --> 02:08:48.540
And that was awesome that they offered that.

02:08:48.540 --> 02:08:50.540
And I think more they should do that.

02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:54.540
Especially Nintendo! Hello! You have all these fucking virtual console games!

02:08:54.540 --> 02:08:57.540
Start throwing that shit in like crazy!

02:08:57.540 --> 02:08:59.540
Give it away like pear candy!

02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:02.540
You buy the Wii U, guess what? You get 20 virtual console games.

02:09:02.540 --> 02:09:05.540
I mean, that would totally sweeten the deal, I think, for a lot of people.

02:09:05.540 --> 02:09:07.540
That's what they did with the 3DS, remember?

02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:09.540
Yeah, do that again!

02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:14.540
It's not helping that you have one game that released a few weeks ago,

02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:17.540
and then the next game's not releasing for a few weeks from now.

02:09:17.540 --> 02:09:20.540
Fucking fill in that shit in the middle.

02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:23.540
Alright, AndyScout in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com points out,

02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:26.540
Sword Art Online, Lost Song does it too.

02:09:26.540 --> 02:09:30.540
If you pre-order on PlayStation 4, you get re-Holo Fragment free.

02:09:30.540 --> 02:09:34.540
So, I think you'll be seeing that a lot more with sequels and series,

02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:39.540
where the old stuff is bundled in to get you to buy the new stuff.

02:09:39.540 --> 02:09:44.540
Anyhow, just a couple other quick little tidbits here before we open up the Skype line.

02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:48.540
One of them about Rare Replay, because it's kind of all the rage this week.

02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:51.540
Rare has announced that they are teaming up with iam8bit,

02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:56.540
and they're going to be releasing limited edition vinyls for some of their classic titles.

02:09:56.540 --> 02:10:00.540
It's in vinyl records, so that's pretty rad.

02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:03.540
These soundtracks will be around $25 to $35,

02:10:03.540 --> 02:10:07.540
and you can see there's some for Perfect Dark and Battletoads and Banjo-Kazooie.

02:10:07.540 --> 02:10:10.540
So that's pretty rad, especially if you're into vinyl collecting,

02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:12.540
and especially some of the art that goes with those vinyls.

02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:16.540
I think you might be interested in this, so very cool.

02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:19.540
And lastly, speaking of music,

02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:24.540
Nintendo will be releasing a Super Mario 30th Anniversary soundtrack.

02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:27.540
It's for Japan, but it will be coming out on September 30th,

02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:30.540
and thanks to the internet, I'm sure once it comes out in Japan,

02:10:30.540 --> 02:10:32.540
it's going to be on piracy websites anywhere.

02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:38.540
Not that I'm saying that's okay, but you would think they would just bundle this in with pre-orders of Super Mario Maker.

02:10:38.540 --> 02:10:43.540
But I digress. 3,240 yen, two discs full of classic songs,

02:10:43.540 --> 02:10:50.540
from Super Mario Bros., 2, 3, Land, World, USA, as they call it in Japan,

02:10:50.540 --> 02:10:52.540
which was our Mario Bros. 2,

02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:59.540
Super Mario Land 2, 6 Golden Coins, 64, Sunshine, Galaxy, New on the Wii,

02:10:59.540 --> 02:11:06.540
Galaxy 2, 3D Land, New 2, New You, Mario 3D World, and Mario Maker, the bonus track.

02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:10.540
So much Mario. You probably know all the songs by heart already,

02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:15.540
but there you go. You have a soundtrack to blast in your car, if you so desire.

02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:20.540
Anyhow, that is it. We are to the end of the show,

02:11:20.540 --> 02:11:23.540
and this is the part where we open it up for your feedback.

02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:25.540
If you want to talk about anything you've heard on the show tonight,

02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:28.540
or maybe something you haven't heard, or you just want to say,

02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:31.540
hey, at least talk to us about something gaming, give us a call.

02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:36.540
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:11:36.540 --> 02:11:39.540
The Skype line is open now, and it's lighting up.

02:11:39.540 --> 02:11:42.540
We're already getting calls. This is crazy.

02:11:42.540 --> 02:11:43.540
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:11:43.540 --> 02:11:45.540
Hey, guys. It's Jason.

02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:46.540
Hey, Jason. How you doing?

02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:47.540
I'm doing pretty good.

02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:49.540
Great. Great to hear from you. What's up?

02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:59.540
I need to talk about a rare replay game that nobody else has mentioned tonight, as far as I'm aware.

02:11:59.540 --> 02:12:06.540
It's kind of right in the middle, but it's been one of my, I would openly call it obsession,

02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:15.540
but it's been one of my favorites since the first time I played it back in 97, and that would be Blast Corps.

02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:18.540
I was trying to think which one of them is from 97.

02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:19.540
It's got to be one of the later games.

02:12:19.540 --> 02:12:23.540
Definitely one of the N64 games, and it's really interesting,

02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:30.540
because I never had an N64, and Blast Corps is one of those games that just doesn't emulate well.

02:12:30.540 --> 02:12:39.540
For about a year, a buddy of mine runs stores in New Mexico, Albuquerque and Rio Rancho,

02:12:39.540 --> 02:12:45.540
that does mostly game trade-ins on a lot of classic games,

02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:50.540
but still gets his own fair share of shipments of new games and that kind of stuff.

02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:53.540
It's a game store, period.

02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:58.540
Great guy. I've known him for, wow, if not two decades now,

02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:02.540
pretty damn close to it, even though I never went to school with him or anything like that.

02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:07.540
But I've been talking to him for a while and various other friends,

02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:10.540
and I've been planning on getting an N64 for a while.

02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:16.540
I never had one when I was younger, so any time I played it, I was either renting it from Blockbuster,

02:13:16.540 --> 02:13:21.540
borrowing it from a friend, or just over at a friend's house and playing it.

02:13:21.540 --> 02:13:26.540
Something really interesting when I've been talking to people about Rare Replay and Blast Corps

02:13:26.540 --> 02:13:31.540
is there was a question earlier about whether or not frame rate bugs were fixed.

02:13:31.540 --> 02:13:36.540
You made the comment about if there was a 360 release and it's a 360 version.

02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:41.540
There was a bug in Blast Corps where you could...

02:13:41.540 --> 02:13:45.540
I don't know the specific details, so it's kind of hard to explain it,

02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:49.540
but Blast Corps has a mechanic that there are multiple vehicles in the level,

02:13:49.540 --> 02:13:53.540
so you can get out of a vehicle, get into another one, that kind of thing.

02:13:53.540 --> 02:13:55.540
It's a puzzle element, so on and so forth.

02:13:55.540 --> 02:14:03.540
There was a bug where if you just held down the leave button, the disembark button,

02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:07.540
that it would overwhelm the game's engine or something like that,

02:14:07.540 --> 02:14:12.540
and it would just destroy the building in front of you after about five seconds or something like that

02:14:12.540 --> 02:14:16.540
after just holding down the button.

02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:23.540
I've never legitimately beaten that game until Rare Replay,

02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:27.540
until I actually streamed the vast majority of it over this week when I saw it,

02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:31.540
and I was jumping up and down and flipping out because there are certain levels in that game

02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:34.540
that are fucking difficult, and I was so happy to have cleared it.

02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:43.540
But I assume just because of the speed of the N64, the frame rate issues that are suffered,

02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:50.540
how many calculations happen in the game even when nothing is being drawn?

02:14:50.540 --> 02:14:52.540
I need to find a better way to explain this.

02:14:52.540 --> 02:14:58.540
Do you remember the old DDR glitch that let people access the hidden challenge charts

02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:06.540
for Last Message, Blue Impulse, Love Shine, and the fourth one I can't remember?

02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:08.540
Yeah, so long ago, yeah, yeah.

02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:13.540
The trick where you would go, you would rig the popular courses and switch between,

02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:16.540
I think it was Naoki standard and popular one.

02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:21.540
It's a similar kind of thing, and if you listen to any speedruns,

02:15:21.540 --> 02:15:25.540
if you watch speedrun streams or listen to speedrunners talk about the details,

02:15:25.540 --> 02:15:31.540
I can only assume that it has something to do with the rendering power of the N64

02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:37.540
and the slowdown that happens when there's this input calculation physics massacre

02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:42.540
compared to the Xbox One that can emulate it more reliably,

02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:46.540
that building destruction spam trick doesn't work anymore.

02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:53.540
So in my classic fashion, I get to this one towards the last level of the game.

02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:58.540
I get through a very obnoxiously long, like 15, 20-minute level.

02:15:58.540 --> 02:16:04.540
I get to the very end of it, and I didn't actually know how to beat the level legitimately,

02:16:04.540 --> 02:16:09.540
so I just fell back on my old spam the exit button trick,

02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:12.540
and I do that for like 30 seconds and nothing happens.

02:16:12.540 --> 02:16:16.540
So I'm sitting here. This is streamed. It should be in my past broadcast

02:16:16.540 --> 02:16:18.540
if anybody wants to look it up on Twitch.

02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:24.540
I'm just standing there with this unable to leave the vehicle sound playing repeatedly

02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:28.540
over and over and over and over, and so I finally have to give up

02:16:28.540 --> 02:16:33.540
and replay the level a couple times to figure out how to actually do it legitimately.

02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:39.540
The long story short of this game is that Blast Corps is amazing,

02:16:39.540 --> 02:16:46.540
and I'm working through the rest of Rare Replay because I have played very, very few of those games,

02:16:46.540 --> 02:16:52.540
but Blast Corps is a game I have been dying to own, like I said, since 97 or 98,

02:16:52.540 --> 02:16:56.540
whenever it originally came out, and now I do, and it's more faithful.

02:16:56.540 --> 02:17:02.540
It's forced me to actually be able to play the game legitimately, and it is so much fun.

02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:06.540
Thank God. I've already decimated the game, but I had such a fun time doing it.

02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:11.540
That's so interesting that they fixed the bug like that, because that makes me think like,

02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:17.540
what if they were to release, let's say, Blaster Master, which, God, I'd love to see that come back,

02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:23.540
but then they fixed the bug where pausing will no longer kill the bosses in an instant, right?

02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:27.540
Remember that trick where you would pause the boss and the grenade would just fire over and over again?

02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:30.540
You could kill the boss super easy that way? What if they got rid of that?

02:17:30.540 --> 02:17:34.540
We would all be screwed, because that game was hard to begin with.

02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:38.540
So, I mean, this is funny, because when you're talking about this bug in Blast Corps,

02:17:38.540 --> 02:17:42.540
that's the scene that's running through my mind, is like, what if they took out the pause glitch?

02:17:42.540 --> 02:17:47.540
Because there are certain glitches in old games. We've been talking a little bit about old games and glitches.

02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:56.540
There are certain ones that we all did as kids. Not really a glitch, but very few people can get through Contra

02:17:56.540 --> 02:18:01.540
without some up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA, start. Same thing with Gradius, right?

02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:02.540
Absolutely.

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:05.540
Anyway, it's just funny. Like, what if they got rid of that? We'd be hosed.

02:18:05.540 --> 02:18:11.540
And I don't think they explicitly fixed it. I think it's just a quirk of emulation

02:18:11.540 --> 02:18:15.540
and just what the difference in hardware and software rendering is.

02:18:15.540 --> 02:18:21.540
And the comment especially about the frame rate issues, Blast Corps was a pretty intensive game,

02:18:21.540 --> 02:18:29.540
because it was all about a vehicle running into buildings, sometimes like pushing TNT into it, what have you.

02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:35.540
But it was all about physics and collisions in an N64 game and explosions and everything else.

02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:39.540
So there was a lot of calculation and madness and that kind of stuff going on.

02:18:39.540 --> 02:18:48.540
And if I vaguely recall slowdowns playing it on the N64 back in the day, I would not be at all surprised.

02:18:48.540 --> 02:18:52.540
I would just be willing to wager that I definitely came across them.

02:18:52.540 --> 02:19:00.540
But it played stunningly on the Xbox One. It was such a grand and smooth and clean experience.

02:19:00.540 --> 02:19:06.540
And I really just got to enjoy the game all over again in my hands-on my time from start to finish.

02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:11.540
It is so weird seeing these old-ass games really cleaned up for HDTV and high refresh rate

02:19:11.540 --> 02:19:16.540
and the HDMI cables and things that just weren't a factor in the 80s and 90s.

02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:23.540
And I'm pretty curious. Banjo-Kazooie is on my shortlist as well. I played a fair amount of that as well.

02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:29.540
And I'm kind of curious. I don't think I'm any bit motion sick. I don't get any kind of motion sickness.

02:19:29.540 --> 02:19:35.540
But I'm pretty curious to see the difference in camera interactivity like you were talking about as well.

02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:39.540
Yeah, neither do I. And that game was like setting something off.

02:19:39.540 --> 02:19:42.540
So anyway, Jason, I gotta let you go so we can fit in some more calls.

02:19:42.540 --> 02:19:43.540
But thank you so much for the call.

02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:44.540
Of course.

02:19:44.540 --> 02:19:45.540
Great to hear about. Take care, my friend.

02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:46.540
You too.

02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:52.540
There it is. Orange Lounge Radio. Jason, the voice of the show. If you listen to the intro carefully, you hear Jason.

02:19:52.540 --> 02:19:58.540
If you check in to the show, you know, those of you who listen to the podcast feed, you hear that little do-do-do-do-do-do.

02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:02.540
If you want to check in, use this passphrase at vognetwork.com. Jason does that as well.

02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:06.540
And you should check in. Get your VoG network points. Participate with the show already.

02:20:06.540 --> 02:20:09.540
All right. It is lighting up on the phone lines. I gotta get to another call.

02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:11.540
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:20:11.540 --> 02:20:13.540
Hey, what's up, everyone? It's Ranma.

02:20:13.540 --> 02:20:15.540
Hey, Ranma. Good to hear from you, buddy. How you doing?

02:20:15.540 --> 02:20:16.540
Good to hear from all of y'all.

02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:17.540
What's that?

02:20:17.540 --> 02:20:19.540
It's good to hear from all of y'all.

02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:23.540
Yeah. I mean, we missed you. You weren't here for the early show last week, right? Because we were in a winter time.

02:20:23.540 --> 02:20:28.540
No. I was doing a Love Live school idol project photo shoot when I got back.

02:20:28.540 --> 02:20:34.540
I'm listening and I'm making comments in the chat. I'm like, wait a minute. This was pre-recorded already.

02:20:34.540 --> 02:20:38.540
I know. And you know what? I forgot to run chat last week during the show.

02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:44.540
I should ask Darktitsou here, somebody that was probably here, to send me a chat log, see if there's any really good comments during last week's show.

02:20:44.540 --> 02:20:46.540
I usually try to run it. I forgot last week.

02:20:46.540 --> 02:20:48.540
I can hook you up with that.

02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:51.540
Yes. Nice. Appreciate it. So, what's in your mind tonight?

02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:56.540
Well, I wanted to call in and talk briefly about International Sailor Moon Day, if I can.

02:20:56.540 --> 02:21:01.540
I was gonna ask you about it anyway at the end of the call, so why not? Yeah, let's talk about it. What's going on on the stream Saturday?

02:21:01.540 --> 02:21:11.540
Well, let me give you a brief, a quick history. We started this about, I'd say, two years ago about the announcing of Sailor Moon Crystal.

02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:20.540
And we have a large Sailor Moon cosplay, non-cosplay fan group here in New York City, so we decided to do something to celebrate that.

02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:27.540
It was originally held by another group, which had the event, and then they were not able to do it last year.

02:21:27.540 --> 02:21:34.540
So, Sailor Moon Meetup decided to go ahead and do this, and we did this at a local studio, and we were streaming it online.

02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:46.540
Pretty much, we were talking to people such as Ms. Dream, who does fan scanlations of the manga and translations of the various Sara Miu musicals online.

02:21:46.540 --> 02:21:59.540
And there is a local group, I forget their name, they're based out of the area, they do Sailor Moon slash K-pop style videos and dance routines.

02:21:59.540 --> 02:22:06.540
Fun. Yeah. So, this year we decided, you know, let's do it again and do things slightly different.

02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:17.540
So, part of this is that we're celebrating, like, the resurgence of Sailor Moon, as well as, if you notice, there are other classic animes that are making a big comeback in recent years.

02:22:17.540 --> 02:22:27.540
That is very true. Well, now, and I noticed when I was looking this up on Facebook, trying to get some more information on it, I noticed that there is, like, international Sailor Moon stuff all over.

02:22:27.540 --> 02:22:32.540
Like, they're doing something in San Francisco. This is not a New York-centric thing. It's everywhere.

02:22:32.540 --> 02:22:39.540
It started out in a New York event, and then there were other people that said they wanted to hold their own event.

02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:47.540
So, we have people across the country, around the world, that are having their own versions of International Sailor Moon Day.

02:22:47.540 --> 02:22:53.540
Some of them are doing, like, a Skype get-together. Some of them are actually having events in their local cities.

02:22:53.540 --> 02:22:55.540
That's fun. Are you going to dress up?

02:22:55.540 --> 02:23:01.540
I am staffed, so most likely that's not going to happen, but I will most likely be wearing my Artemis hat.

02:23:01.540 --> 02:23:07.540
That's awesome. You know, I know we're not the anime show on the network. You guys are. We're the video game show.

02:23:07.540 --> 02:23:13.540
But, you know, fandom, those lines blur a lot, and there's a lot of people who are into games who are into these other things.

02:23:13.540 --> 02:23:16.540
And certainly, I have a lot of Twitter followers who love their Sailor Moon.

02:23:16.540 --> 02:23:23.540
I can't profess personally to following it very closely, but I have seen some of the old 90s anime, and it is awesome.

02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:25.540
I'm a big fan of Tuxedo Mask, so...

02:23:25.540 --> 02:23:29.540
Who does the least amount of work out of all of them at all together?

02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:32.540
I know, I know. But, you know, can't help it.

02:23:32.540 --> 02:23:34.540
He one-time cosplayed Santa Claus.

02:23:37.540 --> 02:23:43.540
So, you're streaming from one of the live events with all these routines and things and tribute performances.

02:23:43.540 --> 02:23:51.540
This year, what we're doing is we're going to have different guests who have been part of the Sailor Moon community from, like,

02:23:51.540 --> 02:23:55.540
scanlations, cosplay, performances. We're going to have that.

02:23:55.540 --> 02:23:58.540
We're also going to do a Sailor Moon-themed match game.

02:23:58.540 --> 02:24:00.540
Oh, my favorite!

02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:09.540
Yep, karaoke contests. We're going to have the Jubon Fashion Show, which is pretty much everybody in cosplay gets up on the stage and strut their stuff.

02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:13.540
And we're going to have a special guest.

02:24:13.540 --> 02:24:16.540
Oh, are you going to tell us who it is? We've got to wait.

02:24:16.540 --> 02:24:22.540
Absolutely. You might not know the name, but you'll know the commercials that she has done.

02:24:22.540 --> 02:24:28.540
She's sang various songs for the English version of Sailor Moon. Her name is Jennifer Sehe.

02:24:28.540 --> 02:24:35.540
Now, the name may not sound familiar, but do you remember Hot Pockets commercials?

02:24:35.540 --> 02:24:38.540
She sings the Hot Pockets song?

02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:41.540
She does the Hot Pockets? That's her.

02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:54.540
With all due respect, Rama, you know I'm a fan of things that you're a fan of. With all due respect, that's a way bigger deal than Sailor Moon.

02:24:54.540 --> 02:25:00.540
You want to know something? A bunch of people are like, wait a minute, that's her? That's her?

02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:04.540
What are you going to eat? Hot Pockets. Oh, my God, it's the Hot Pockets lady.

02:25:05.540 --> 02:25:10.540
Why don't I just change the banner on the site to a giant Hot Pocket?

02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:16.540
See, if you're going to do that, it's got to show Usagi eating a Hot Pocket because that's the only way it would work.

02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:22.540
Get me the picture and I'll make it happen. The whole chat is lighting up. Hot Pockets!

02:25:25.540 --> 02:25:31.540
No, we do need a new intro for the show. That would be an amazing...

02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:40.540
SSJ100 Man Chat says, come for the Sailor Moon, but stay for the Hot Pockets jingle. That is amazing.

02:25:40.540 --> 02:25:44.540
So she's going to be on your stream. We're going to have the Hot Pockets lady on VoG?

02:25:44.540 --> 02:25:49.540
Yes, she will be coming via Skype online and you'll be seeing her as part of the livestream.

02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:54.540
Oh, my God, we're going to have the Hot Pockets lady on VoG. We are huge, you guys. So excited.

02:25:54.540 --> 02:25:55.540
We made it.

02:25:55.540 --> 02:26:02.540
All laughing and silliness aside because I think this is amazing, but that's so awesome, the Sailor Moon fandom and everything you guys are doing.

02:26:02.540 --> 02:26:06.540
So glad we could be a part of it. Just a quick programming note because I know some people may be curious

02:26:06.540 --> 02:26:10.540
because you guys are going to be on at the same time the Critical Myth marathon is usually on.

02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:16.540
Critical Myth actually ends up coincidentally having the week off, so there's no new shows to air on Saturday anyway.

02:26:16.540 --> 02:26:22.540
We will still rerun their reruns. We're going to do reruns of the reruns on Sunday instead at 9 a.m.

02:26:22.540 --> 02:26:27.540
So if you usually listen to the Critical Myth marathon, we're going to see this once in a year Sailor Moon event happening

02:26:27.540 --> 02:26:31.540
and then Critical Myth will be on Sunday, which, by the way, speaking of those boys over at Critical Myth,

02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:34.540
I mean, they're taking a lot of weeks off right now because it's summer programming anyway.

02:26:34.540 --> 02:26:40.540
There's not as much to talk about during the summer, but they are hitting episode 600.

02:26:40.540 --> 02:26:45.540
Now, granted, they do three shows a week, so it's a little different. It didn't take them as long to get there as it did us,

02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:50.540
but it's still a huge accomplishment. So they're going to hit episode 600 on the Monday when they return.

02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:51.540
So there you go.

02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:52.540
Amazing.

02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:59.540
Amazing. So International Sailor Moon Day this Saturday, 12 to 5 Eastern. Check it out.

02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:03.540
Transform into a giant Hot Pocket with us here at VOG.

02:27:03.540 --> 02:27:06.540
Form of Hot Pocket.

02:27:06.540 --> 02:27:10.540
All right. Rama, thanks so much for the call, and good luck on Saturday.

02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:13.540
Hey, no problem. All right. Before I go, Rama, I just want to say one thing.

02:27:13.540 --> 02:27:17.540
I meant to say it before. You talked about doing cosplay at Dragon Con. I just want to say...

02:27:17.540 --> 02:27:18.540
Oh, it's happening.

02:27:18.540 --> 02:27:27.540
It's awesome. And to answer your questions before, as long as you give credit to whoever you got it commissioned from or whatever, nobody's going to care.

02:27:27.540 --> 02:27:32.540
All right. Awesome. Yeah. I gave her a shout on Twitter. My good friend Victoria, she goes by VicKnives on Twitter.

02:27:32.540 --> 02:27:39.540
She's putting it all together. We did the shopping. We shopped for the material this week, and I've seen her sketches and everything,

02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:42.540
and we did the fitting. Well, I'm sorry. We did the measurements, and then the fitting comes out.

02:27:42.540 --> 02:27:44.540
So what is it? What's your costume?

02:27:44.540 --> 02:27:46.540
Well, I was going to keep it a secret.

02:27:46.540 --> 02:27:47.540
All right. That's fine. No, that's cool.

02:27:47.540 --> 02:27:52.540
No, it's the worst kept secret ever. I put the sketches on Twitter. I'm going to do Joker from Mass Effect 3.

02:27:52.540 --> 02:27:54.540
I helped.

02:27:54.540 --> 02:28:00.540
Yes, you did, because Dark Sakura actually started the whole thing. She gave me a hat, a gamer X.

02:28:00.540 --> 02:28:03.540
She gave me her old SR2 hat, which is the perfect...

02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:05.540
My unworn SR2 hat.

02:28:05.540 --> 02:28:11.540
But it's the perfect Joker from Mass Effect 3, so we went out and bought the stuff it's going to take to make the top and everything.

02:28:11.540 --> 02:28:12.540
I'm really excited about it.

02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:15.540
I need to talk to you about what your friend's charging you.

02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:20.540
Yeah, we'll talk about that. So, yeah, she's great. So, yes, full credit. I would not try to take credit for the costume myself.

02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:23.540
I've decided I want to do a Grey Warden mage for gamer X.

02:28:23.540 --> 02:28:28.540
Oh, and I will. Yeah, and that's the great thing is that I can reuse this costume.

02:28:28.540 --> 02:28:32.540
I will definitely use it at gamer X as well for those of you that are going to be there in December.

02:28:32.540 --> 02:28:39.540
And trying to firm up the plans for MAGFest. Tickets and hotel aren't available for MAGFest yet, because it's still like six months out.

02:28:39.540 --> 02:28:46.540
Still waiting. Normally by now, with both conventions, hotel information is already up, so I'm just like waiting, you know?

02:28:46.540 --> 02:28:50.540
Yeah, I think a lot of people are, but I will say that is definitely in my plan.

02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:54.540
And I can't imagine people don't do cosplay at MAGFest, so assuming I can get away with...

02:28:54.540 --> 02:28:55.540
Oh, trust me.

02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:57.540
Yeah, I'll do cosplay there too.

02:28:57.540 --> 02:29:06.540
Well, I think I told Jamie this, but me and a friend, GBT for cosplay, we are putting together a rival school's cosplay group for MAGFest.

02:29:06.540 --> 02:29:08.540
Oh my god. That's going to be awesome.

02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:10.540
You didn't mention this to me, but that's cool.

02:29:10.540 --> 02:29:12.540
Wait, you're going to be at MAGFest too?

02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:22.540
Yeah, I'm shooting, even though Catsicon's the weekend before, I'm trying to do both, because two of my favorite cosplay friends are coming from the Midwest for Catsicon.

02:29:22.540 --> 02:29:28.540
And your very favorite sassy gay friend is coming out from the West Coast for it, so I think that's a good reason.

02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:35.540
Well, yeah, I'm trying to do both. If they don't come from Katsu, I'm skipping Katsu, you'll see me at MAGFest.

02:29:35.540 --> 02:29:40.540
You'll probably see me passed out, drunk as Luigi, in front of the Ninja Turtle machine with a 40 in my hand.

02:29:40.540 --> 02:29:45.540
Alright, sounds good. Just look for the drunken joker that's clinging to a Burger Time machine.

02:29:45.540 --> 02:29:47.540
You got it, dude.

02:29:47.540 --> 02:29:49.540
Alright, take care of my friend. We've got to let you go to get more calls.

02:29:49.540 --> 02:29:50.540
Awesome. No problem. Okay.

02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:51.540
Bye.

02:29:51.540 --> 02:29:55.540
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:29:55.540 --> 02:30:01.540
Quickly, I want to make sure Loki has a minute to get in some last minute stories here while I wait on another call to come in.

02:30:01.540 --> 02:30:03.540
I don't know if you have anything to share with us, Loki.

02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:05.540
No, sadly I don't, and I've been looking.

02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:06.540
What?

02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:08.540
I've been looking, there's just nothing.

02:30:08.540 --> 02:30:10.540
I guess we had such a busy show in other parts.

02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:14.540
Killer7's celebrating 10 years, like two months ago, so there's that.

02:30:14.540 --> 02:30:18.540
There's that. Oh my god, there's like 17 million calls coming in right now.

02:30:18.540 --> 02:30:20.540
Did you know that this is the 35th anniversary of Xanadu?

02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:21.540
Nope.

02:30:21.540 --> 02:30:22.540
I did not.

02:30:22.540 --> 02:30:24.540
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:26.540
Ah, you're breaking up. Oh no.

02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:28.540
My internet connection bad?

02:30:28.540 --> 02:30:30.540
No, we can hear you just fine if you can hear us. Who's this?

02:30:30.540 --> 02:30:32.540
This is Andy.

02:30:32.540 --> 02:30:33.540
Andy, what's up?

02:30:33.540 --> 02:30:35.540
He's on the chat, or AndyR on Twitter, or on Facebook.

02:30:35.540 --> 02:30:39.540
I don't, I hear your name a lot, obviously, on Facebook and so forth.

02:30:39.540 --> 02:30:42.540
I don't think I've ever heard you on the show. Is this your first call?

02:30:42.540 --> 02:30:44.540
Yeah, I usually listen to the podcast, so.

02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:46.540
Well, welcome.

02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:49.540
And I see you brought your bird friend, he's on video, so I can actually see him and we're looking at his studio.

02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:51.540
Aww, pretty birdie.

02:30:51.540 --> 02:30:53.540
Little birdie Fran. What's birdie's name?

02:30:53.540 --> 02:30:55.540
Yeah, she's been listening to the show with me.

02:30:55.540 --> 02:30:57.540
Well, I hope she doesn't start repeating what Loki says.

02:30:57.540 --> 02:30:59.540
So, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:04.540
Just calling to say hi and thank you for the podcast all the time, and yeah.

02:31:04.540 --> 02:31:07.540
Thank you for listening all the time. We appreciate it. What kind of games do you play?

02:31:07.540 --> 02:31:09.540
I work week, so.

02:31:09.540 --> 02:31:11.540
Do you listen to us on your commute usually, or at work?

02:31:11.540 --> 02:31:13.540
At work, at my desk.

02:31:13.540 --> 02:31:16.540
Gotcha. Awesome. What kind of games are you playing right now?

02:31:17.540 --> 02:31:19.540
A whole lot of Vita, actually.

02:31:19.540 --> 02:31:26.540
Really? It's nice to hear some Vita love out there, because it sure seems like everybody in the U.S. forgot about the Vita.

02:31:26.540 --> 02:31:28.540
So, what are you playing on Vita?

02:31:28.540 --> 02:31:32.540
Well, I guess they're all Japanese games, so maybe the U.S. did forget about it.

02:31:32.540 --> 02:31:36.540
But I imported three rhythm games for it recently and I've been playing those.

02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:40.540
Let me guess. Tycoon no Tatujin's got to be one, because that just came out.

02:31:40.540 --> 02:31:41.540
Yep.

02:31:41.540 --> 02:31:45.540
Let me think. Probably one of the Hatsune Miku knockoffs.

02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:48.540
Yes, I.A.V.T. Colorful. It's another one of the Vocaloid games.

02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:52.540
Yes, we had a story on that a couple weeks ago, I remember. So, yeah. And then what else?

02:31:52.540 --> 02:31:53.540
Persona.

02:31:53.540 --> 02:31:57.540
Oh, Persona Dancing All Night. Of course. Of course. How are you enjoying?

02:31:57.540 --> 02:32:03.540
Which, if you had to rank the three, Sophie's Choice, if you had to rank the three, which one's your favorite?

02:32:03.540 --> 02:32:09.540
I only just got Colorful, like, two days ago, but that might be that one.

02:32:09.540 --> 02:32:14.540
Really? Okay. Interesting. Usually, a lot of fans of Persona that I know are, like, rabid foaming at the mouth.

02:32:14.540 --> 02:32:17.540
But maybe that's just hanging out with Shane too much, because he's kind of like that.

02:32:17.540 --> 02:32:22.540
I absolutely love Persona Dancing. My biggest issue is it's only got 27 songs.

02:32:22.540 --> 02:32:26.540
And, like, seven of them are remixes of songs that are already in the game.

02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:30.540
So, I kind of plat in the game in, like, ten hours.

02:32:30.540 --> 02:32:34.540
Okay. All right. Well, that makes sense. I can see where that string is.

02:32:34.540 --> 02:32:38.540
It's a good game, though. And if I could get the DLC on my Vita, then that would probably make it better.

02:32:38.540 --> 02:32:42.540
Awesome. Well, that's cool. I'm glad to see the Vita getting a little love.

02:32:42.540 --> 02:32:48.540
And this is why systems should be region-free. So, I love that. I love that.

02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:50.540
Well, Andy, thanks so much for listening to the show. Really appreciate it.

02:32:50.540 --> 02:32:54.540
And glad you could get in and say hello and introduce us to your bird.

02:32:54.540 --> 02:32:55.540
Yep.

02:32:55.540 --> 02:32:58.540
All right. Well, take care, my friend. I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.

02:32:58.540 --> 02:32:59.540
All right. Sounds good.

02:32:59.540 --> 02:33:00.540
All right. Take care.

02:33:00.540 --> 02:33:01.540
Bye.

02:33:01.540 --> 02:33:02.540
Bye.

02:33:02.540 --> 02:33:06.540
I should have also mentioned that Andy R. was wearing a Giants shirt. So, clearly a fan of the correct team.

02:33:06.540 --> 02:33:08.540
I want a bird, but Midna won't let me.

02:33:08.540 --> 02:33:14.540
All right. 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:33:14.540 --> 02:33:20.540
AkumaJP in chat saying, every time I hear Hot Pockets, my brain goes non-compute.

02:33:20.540 --> 02:33:25.540
Okay. The phones are lighting up. Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:33:25.540 --> 02:33:30.540
I must be one crazy motherfucker because it's nearly 5 a.m. for me.

02:33:30.540 --> 02:33:32.540
Oh, my God. This is Obi Wan Jabroni.

02:33:32.540 --> 02:33:37.540
Obi Wan Jabroni. And I was going to say, where you're at, you're like, oh, my God.

02:33:37.540 --> 02:33:38.540
5 a.m.

02:33:38.540 --> 02:33:40.540
I love your icon.

02:33:40.540 --> 02:33:43.540
I'll be saying daylight soon, actually.

02:33:43.540 --> 02:33:45.540
Wow. You are dedicated.

02:33:45.540 --> 02:33:47.540
You guys can hear me okay, right?

02:33:47.540 --> 02:33:48.540
Oh, yeah. You sound great.

02:33:48.540 --> 02:33:53.540
We're checking out your Skype icon where you have the little PlayStation, keep calm and defeat Psycho Mantis.

02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:54.540
Love it.

02:33:54.540 --> 02:34:00.540
Yeah, Dark Sakura mentioned that last time, but yeah, I'm calling you from bed. Holy shit.

02:34:00.540 --> 02:34:03.540
Wait a minute. Are we all in bed with you right now?

02:34:03.540 --> 02:34:04.540
Yes.

02:34:04.540 --> 02:34:06.540
I'm not in a bed, but I am reclining.

02:34:06.540 --> 02:34:09.540
But we're in bed with Obi Wan Jabroni.

02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:12.540
I'm lounging.

02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:16.540
Lounging in bed, all three of you, all four of us in bed.

02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:18.540
Is there a soft duvet?

02:34:18.540 --> 02:34:24.540
There is. There is a memory foam mattress, pillows, and a duvet.

02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:27.540
Squish.

02:34:27.540 --> 02:34:31.540
I only want listeners to call us from bed.

02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:33.540
You know, we can do some.

02:34:34.540 --> 02:34:39.540
SSG 100 Man Chat says someone's got top bunk.

02:34:39.540 --> 02:34:41.540
Oh, you crazy kids.

02:34:41.540 --> 02:34:43.540
All right. Well, what did you, what, you stayed?

02:34:43.540 --> 02:34:46.540
Well, first off, we did the early show last week.

02:34:46.540 --> 02:34:48.540
I know. I'm making up for this.

02:34:48.540 --> 02:34:49.540
All right.

02:34:49.540 --> 02:34:51.540
I've been, I've been drinking. That's why.

02:34:51.540 --> 02:34:52.540
Oh, great.

02:34:52.540 --> 02:34:53.540
That's why I'm up.

02:34:53.540 --> 02:34:56.540
Great. He's calling us in bed and drunk.

02:34:56.540 --> 02:34:58.540
So, what's the beverage of the evening?

02:34:58.540 --> 02:35:00.540
Budweiser.

02:35:00.540 --> 02:35:02.540
Budweiser.

02:35:02.540 --> 02:35:04.540
All right.

02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:05.540
I'm sorry.

02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:06.540
Well, I'm sorry to hear.

02:35:06.540 --> 02:35:08.540
It's from a bottle though.

02:35:08.540 --> 02:35:10.540
All right. Well, it's a little better.

02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:12.540
All right. What's on your mind tonight, my friend?

02:35:12.540 --> 02:35:14.540
What did you stay up late for?

02:35:14.540 --> 02:35:16.540
I always stay up late to listen to this show.

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:18.540
I'm crazy.

02:35:18.540 --> 02:35:24.540
Listen, if I, if I fall asleep during the show, which happens probably about 80% of the time,

02:35:24.540 --> 02:35:26.540
I'll listen back to the podcast.

02:35:26.540 --> 02:35:27.540
I'm dedicated to this.

02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:31.540
I appreciate that. I mean, you, you listeners that are so dedicated to this show are so-

02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:33.540
And I'm always in the comments.

02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:37.540
You always see, you always see me post some sarcastic shit in the comments.

02:35:37.540 --> 02:35:38.540
So-

02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:42.540
I read all the comments. I don't always reply, but I always read them because there's not a lot of them.

02:35:42.540 --> 02:35:43.540
So, it's enough to be-

02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:44.540
That's cool.

02:35:44.540 --> 02:35:48.540
Act Deft in chat, drunk at 5 a.m. on a Monday.

02:35:48.540 --> 02:35:49.540
Awesome.

02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:54.540
And Embryon in chat saying, oh my God, the total rejection of Budweiser.

02:35:54.540 --> 02:35:55.540
Anyway.

02:35:55.540 --> 02:35:57.540
So, what's up? What's on your mind tonight?

02:35:57.540 --> 02:36:05.540
Well, I wanted to call in and extend the F for you to Capcom because I didn't get into the Street Fighter V beta,

02:36:05.540 --> 02:36:07.540
or beta, wherever you live.

02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:13.540
The funny thing about that whole thing with us in Europe was we had to fill out a form.

02:36:13.540 --> 02:36:16.540
So, we didn't actually have to pre-order the game.

02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:18.540
So, we had to fill out some form.

02:36:18.540 --> 02:36:22.540
And there was a question on it and it said, how many BPD are Battle Points?

02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:28.540
And because I play on Xbox mostly, I have zero on PlayStation.

02:36:28.540 --> 02:36:29.540
Oh.

02:36:29.540 --> 02:36:33.540
So, maybe- I don't know. Maybe that's because I didn't get in.

02:36:33.540 --> 02:36:35.540
No idea.

02:36:35.540 --> 02:36:36.540
I would still think-

02:36:36.540 --> 02:36:38.540
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

02:36:38.540 --> 02:36:41.540
To accurately test a game, you need people at all levels.

02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:44.540
So, you do need some people with zero Battle Points.

02:36:44.540 --> 02:36:46.540
You need some people who don't know what the F they're doing.

02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:51.540
So, I would actually think that shouldn't solely disqualify you, but that's my thought.

02:36:51.540 --> 02:36:52.540
Yeah.

02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:59.540
Second thing was, just a PSA on this whole Xbox One thing, the PVR feature.

02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:05.540
There's a couple of small points they haven't mentioned.

02:37:05.540 --> 02:37:09.540
If you have a hard drive connected because you ran out of storage,

02:37:09.540 --> 02:37:15.540
you need to attach a second hard drive because all that stuff lives separately.

02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:19.540
It can't live on the hard drive that you plugged in the first one.

02:37:19.540 --> 02:37:20.540
You know what I mean?

02:37:20.540 --> 02:37:21.540
Interesting, yeah.

02:37:21.540 --> 02:37:22.540
Yeah.

02:37:22.540 --> 02:37:24.540
I wonder if they're different formats. They're probably formatted differently.

02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:29.540
Yeah, because, I mean, Devia hard drives are standard, but I don't know.

02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:31.540
They use a different system.

02:37:31.540 --> 02:37:38.540
So, you'd have to purchase a separate hard drive as well as the tuner, I guess.

02:37:38.540 --> 02:37:40.540
No, that's good to know. I had no idea.

02:37:40.540 --> 02:37:41.540
Yeah.

02:37:41.540 --> 02:37:43.540
I wonder if you- this is just a crazy thought.

02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:47.540
Could you take one hard drive and do two partitions?

02:37:48.540 --> 02:37:49.540
I-

02:37:49.540 --> 02:37:51.540
I don't know. Just throwing it out there, maybe.

02:37:51.540 --> 02:37:53.540
The tech master might be able to- I don't know.

02:37:53.540 --> 02:37:54.540
I don't know.

02:37:54.540 --> 02:37:55.540
If the tech master could answer that one.

02:37:55.540 --> 02:37:57.540
But, no, I have no idea on that one.

02:37:57.540 --> 02:38:04.540
But, yeah, you have to purchase two hard drives if one's full and if you've extended it.

02:38:04.540 --> 02:38:11.540
It's unfortunate because PlayStation has given us accessible hard drives and Xbox hasn't.

02:38:11.540 --> 02:38:12.540
You know?

02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:13.540
Right.

02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:14.540
And it sucks. It really does.

02:38:14.540 --> 02:38:18.540
I wish you could access it and just, you know, put your own hard drive in.

02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:20.540
And the Xbox drive fills up fast.

02:38:20.540 --> 02:38:21.540
It does.

02:38:21.540 --> 02:38:23.540
I think the game installs are just so much bigger.

02:38:23.540 --> 02:38:30.540
And I have the terabyte system and it's- I've owned the terabyte system for like a month and it's already up to like 22% full.

02:38:30.540 --> 02:38:31.540
Really?

02:38:31.540 --> 02:38:35.540
I have my 500 gigabyte PlayStation 4 and I was actually looking at the storage of it.

02:38:35.540 --> 02:38:38.540
I still have room and I've been buying everything digitally.

02:38:38.540 --> 02:38:40.540
I've filled up the PlayStation 4.

02:38:40.540 --> 02:38:41.540
I have finally filled that up.

02:38:41.540 --> 02:38:47.540
I think with all of the PlayStation Plus games I've had to go through and actually finally delete some of the PlayStation Plus things that I'm just not playing.

02:38:47.540 --> 02:38:49.540
Because I know that at least it's in my library.

02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:50.540
I can grab it later.

02:38:50.540 --> 02:38:51.540
Yeah.

02:38:51.540 --> 02:38:53.540
I mean I use my Xbox one more.

02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:55.540
I do have a PS4 as well.

02:38:55.540 --> 02:38:58.540
But, you know, I'm not favoring any of the system.

02:38:58.540 --> 02:39:02.540
That's my go-to system, the Xbox.

02:39:02.540 --> 02:39:04.540
Mine was full and I had to go through-

02:39:04.540 --> 02:39:10.540
Because I was downloading the gold games, you know, for every month.

02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:11.540
Right.

02:39:11.540 --> 02:39:12.540
And those can be huge.

02:39:12.540 --> 02:39:15.540
I mean, especially when you get one and then it has to update.

02:39:15.540 --> 02:39:19.540
So, you know, there's always that.

02:39:19.540 --> 02:39:21.540
So I had to go through it the other day and kind of delete stuff.

02:39:21.540 --> 02:39:26.540
And it's kind of- I still think that interface is pretty cumbersome, you know?

02:39:26.540 --> 02:39:27.540
Yeah.

02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:30.540
I am really looking forward to the redo of the interface.

02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:32.540
Especially because I don't have Kinect.

02:39:32.540 --> 02:39:33.540
Do you have Kinect?

02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:34.540
Because I don't.

02:39:34.540 --> 02:39:35.540
And so it's-

02:39:35.540 --> 02:39:36.540
Yes.

02:39:36.540 --> 02:39:37.540
I got the day one edition.

02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:38.540
Oh wow.

02:39:38.540 --> 02:39:39.540
I was a sucker.

02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:41.540
No, a lot of people were really into it.

02:39:41.540 --> 02:39:46.540
And I got FIFA 10, which I'm not a FIFA player.

02:39:46.540 --> 02:39:48.540
Which is probably shocking to you guys.

02:39:48.540 --> 02:39:51.540
I'm more of a PES person.

02:39:51.540 --> 02:39:53.540
So yeah, I got FIFA whatever it was.

02:39:53.540 --> 02:39:56.540
FIFA 13, I believe, I think.

02:39:56.540 --> 02:40:01.540
So I went through it and I deleted that because I'm not going to play it.

02:40:01.540 --> 02:40:05.540
But yeah, the menu system on that is terrible.

02:40:05.540 --> 02:40:08.540
I mean, I've unplugged my Kinect, actually, speaking of Kinect.

02:40:08.540 --> 02:40:09.540
Wow.

02:40:09.540 --> 02:40:13.540
The only feature I used was Xbox User Code.

02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:16.540
And I'm sorry if anyone's Xboxes went off there.

02:40:16.540 --> 02:40:19.540
But yeah, that's all I used it for.

02:40:19.540 --> 02:40:24.540
Yeah, I think I would use it for live streaming and then maybe playing Dance Central a few times.

02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:25.540
And that's probably it.

02:40:25.540 --> 02:40:26.540
Oh, and the Fantasia game.

02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:27.540
I want to check that out too.

02:40:27.540 --> 02:40:28.540
That's probably it.

02:40:28.540 --> 02:40:33.540
But I've got Rare Replay coming as well.

02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:34.540
I'm looking forward to it.

02:40:34.540 --> 02:40:38.540
Not looking forward to this whole drama of the installs, though.

02:40:38.540 --> 02:40:40.540
That's going to be a nightmare.

02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:41.540
You get over it.

02:40:41.540 --> 02:40:42.540
It's going to clutter.

02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:46.540
See, the thing is, I think a big problem about it is the interface as well.

02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:52.540
And so when you take the clunky interface and then you're just suddenly going to blow up your library with ten more games, it's a little bit irritating.

02:40:52.540 --> 02:40:53.540
That's the only thing.

02:40:53.540 --> 02:40:57.540
That's more going through your shit and deleting crap, isn't it, after you're finished with it.

02:40:57.540 --> 02:40:59.540
So a couple more quick things.

02:40:59.540 --> 02:41:02.540
Yeah, very quickly because then I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls.

02:41:02.540 --> 02:41:03.540
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

02:41:03.540 --> 02:41:04.540
That's okay.

02:41:04.540 --> 02:41:05.540
I've dragged on.

02:41:05.540 --> 02:41:06.540
When's Dan coming back?

02:41:06.540 --> 02:41:10.540
I want to talk to Dan about Sega because I know he's a big Sega guy.

02:41:10.540 --> 02:41:11.540
When's Dan coming back?

02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:12.540
I don't know.

02:41:12.540 --> 02:41:18.540
Tell him the fans, fans from their beds, drunken fans in their beds are demanding he return to the show.

02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:22.540
Dan says that he likes to come by when no one expects it.

02:41:22.540 --> 02:41:25.540
Something like the Spanish Inquisition.

02:41:25.540 --> 02:41:26.540
Alright, well there it is.

02:41:26.540 --> 02:41:27.540
No one expects it.

02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:28.540
There it is.

02:41:28.540 --> 02:41:30.540
Dan will be back when you least expect it.

02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:32.540
I will keep listening.

02:41:32.540 --> 02:41:34.540
Doctor Who, how is the Apple Watch?

02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:35.540
I love it.

02:41:35.540 --> 02:41:38.540
It reminds me to get off my butt.

02:41:38.540 --> 02:41:46.540
I'm waiting for Gen 2 because the one I wanted was like a grand.

02:41:46.540 --> 02:41:47.540
I'm not even joking.

02:41:47.540 --> 02:41:54.540
You know the space black one and it was black and stainless steel.

02:41:54.540 --> 02:41:57.540
That's the one I wanted but it was way too expensive.

02:41:57.540 --> 02:42:02.540
I got the space grey aluminum with the black sports band because I have certain problems with steel.

02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:05.540
You got the sport one.

02:42:05.540 --> 02:42:06.540
I did.

02:42:06.540 --> 02:42:07.540
It's been just fine.

02:42:07.540 --> 02:42:10.540
It hasn't felt like that weird sweaty band feeling.

02:42:10.540 --> 02:42:16.540
The thing I really like best is that I have a bad habit of getting way too wrapped up in what I'm doing.

02:42:16.540 --> 02:42:22.540
So I get that little tap on the wrist when it's time to stand up even though I will fuss at my watch and tell it not to tell me what to do.

02:42:22.540 --> 02:42:26.540
I like that it tracks my activity.

02:42:26.540 --> 02:42:27.540
I can get texts.

02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:29.540
I do directions on it when I'm driving.

02:42:29.540 --> 02:42:36.540
In fact, this morning that was funny, I was texting my mom but I used my voice to text with my watch.

02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:38.540
Dan's like, what?

02:42:38.540 --> 02:42:40.540
I'm like, I'm talking to my mom.

02:42:40.540 --> 02:42:43.540
It's the whole Dick Tracy thing.

02:42:43.540 --> 02:42:44.540
He just sounded so confused.

02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:46.540
I've made calls to him from Target.

02:42:46.540 --> 02:42:53.540
I am also very curious to see what they do to kind of push it further because Apple does kind of do that a lot with their products.

02:42:53.540 --> 02:42:56.540
Where the first one is, okay, it's the first one and here's the new idea.

02:42:56.540 --> 02:42:59.540
But then the second one is always, here's how we're going to take it a step further.

02:42:59.540 --> 02:43:04.540
Read up about the beta for watchOS 2.0.

02:43:04.540 --> 02:43:06.540
It's in beta right now and there's reviews out around it.

02:43:06.540 --> 02:43:10.540
You're supposed to have a bunch more local apps.

02:43:10.540 --> 02:43:20.540
The reason I'm waiting for Gen 2 is that I'm still on this fence because I got burnt with the iPad 1.

02:43:21.540 --> 02:43:23.540
And I still have the iPad 1.

02:43:23.540 --> 02:43:26.540
I'm looking at it right now.

02:43:26.540 --> 02:43:32.540
That's why I'm kind of like just on that fence, on that Apple fence.

02:43:32.540 --> 02:43:35.540
I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Apple.

02:43:35.540 --> 02:43:38.540
We should start an Apple show, by the way.

02:43:38.540 --> 02:43:40.540
Well, here's the thing.

02:43:40.540 --> 02:43:44.540
Well, first off, I'd love to get more nerdy shows.

02:43:44.540 --> 02:43:45.540
No.

02:43:45.540 --> 02:43:49.540
I'm scared of chat rooms because someone's going to ask me ASL and I'm such a sad person.

02:43:49.540 --> 02:43:51.540
No, not in the vog chat room. Not in the vog chat room.

02:43:51.540 --> 02:43:53.540
ASL.

02:43:53.540 --> 02:43:56.540
I'm such a sarcastic cunt and I'm sorry to say that word.

02:43:56.540 --> 02:44:01.540
But I'm going to reply after sex leave because that's the kind of asshole I am.

02:44:01.540 --> 02:44:08.540
Send me an email to participate at orangeandradio.com

02:44:08.540 --> 02:44:12.540
and I will send you my actual email and we will have a talk.

02:44:12.540 --> 02:44:14.540
All right.

02:44:14.540 --> 02:44:17.540
They're going to talk while Obi-Wan and Jabroni is done.

02:44:17.540 --> 02:44:19.540
We're going to have a pillow talk.

02:44:19.540 --> 02:44:21.540
About watches.

02:44:21.540 --> 02:44:26.540
We should get me, you, and the smooth-talking Jason.

02:44:26.540 --> 02:44:28.540
There you go.

02:44:28.540 --> 02:44:30.540
He's got a dream line up in his head.

02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:32.540
All right, Obi-Wan, Jabroni, I've got to let you go, but have a good night.

02:44:32.540 --> 02:44:34.540
Thank you so much for calling and staying up late. I appreciate it.

02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:36.540
Hey, no problem. Take care.

02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:38.540
I'll start my Nintendo podcast.

02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:40.540
I can't wait for that.

02:44:40.540 --> 02:44:42.540
You know what? I know it's 9 o'clock, but dang it.

02:44:42.540 --> 02:44:44.540
Let's try to squeeze in one more call.

02:44:44.540 --> 02:44:47.540
1-877-GAMO-L-R, our username on Skype, orange loungerio.

02:44:47.540 --> 02:44:51.540
Just because it's been lighting up tonight and there it goes again.

02:44:51.540 --> 02:44:56.540
You guys, some weeks we get no calls and then some weeks it just floods.

02:44:56.540 --> 02:44:58.540
So I'm loving it.

02:44:58.540 --> 02:45:00.540
Thank you guys for blowing up our phones tonight.

02:45:00.540 --> 02:45:02.540
We've got another call on the line, though. Let's get to it.

02:45:02.540 --> 02:45:04.540
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:45:04.540 --> 02:45:06.540
Hey, Rob. It's Embryon.

02:45:06.540 --> 02:45:08.540
Hey, Embryon. How you doing?

02:45:08.540 --> 02:45:10.540
I am super great.

02:45:10.540 --> 02:45:12.540
This is your first time calling into the show, isn't it?

02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:13.540
It is.

02:45:13.540 --> 02:45:16.540
All of a sudden we have all these longtime listeners, first time caller.

02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:18.540
Well, how you doing?

02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:20.540
I'm super well.

02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:25.540
I'm enjoying some wine and I'm playing Mother 3 for the second time,

02:45:25.540 --> 02:45:29.540
but I've never actually beaten it before, so it's all kind of fresh still for me.

02:45:29.540 --> 02:45:32.540
So I'm enjoying that and listening to the show.

02:45:32.540 --> 02:45:35.540
And I couldn't very well let Obi-Wan be the only person to call in who had been drinking.

02:45:35.540 --> 02:45:39.540
I was going to say, what is the theme tonight with people there drinking and listening to OLR?

02:45:39.540 --> 02:45:41.540
Are you in bed?

02:45:41.540 --> 02:45:43.540
Maybe.

02:45:43.540 --> 02:45:47.540
I would do this show drunk every day if I could.

02:45:47.540 --> 02:45:50.540
I mean, let's see. I think my mic reached it far enough.

02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:52.540
I mean, can you still hear me from bed?

02:45:52.540 --> 02:45:54.540
Yes, we can. There it is.

02:45:54.540 --> 02:45:57.540
It's official. There is a second phone call from bed. I love it.

02:45:57.540 --> 02:45:59.540
Very temporarily from bed.

02:45:59.540 --> 02:46:03.540
Mother 3. Why Mother 3 of all the games to attack?

02:46:03.540 --> 02:46:05.540
Because it's fantastic.

02:46:05.540 --> 02:46:09.540
I live in Tucson, Arizona, and recently we had Camp Fangamer,

02:46:09.540 --> 02:46:11.540
which was a little Earthbound convention.

02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:13.540
I remember talking about that on the show, and I went,

02:46:13.540 --> 02:46:17.540
how adorable is that? Because it's Tucson.

02:46:17.540 --> 02:46:19.540
Yeah, I know, right?

02:46:19.540 --> 02:46:21.540
That is so cute.

02:46:21.540 --> 02:46:23.540
So I went to that a few weeks ago when it happened, and it was super cool.

02:46:23.540 --> 02:46:25.540
And I've always been an Earthbound fan.

02:46:25.540 --> 02:46:27.540
I have a Starman tattoo on my chest.

02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:31.540
And so it kind of reinvigorated my excitement for the series.

02:46:31.540 --> 02:46:33.540
And since I had never beaten Mother 3, I figured,

02:46:33.540 --> 02:46:37.540
now is the time right before the college semester starts.

02:46:37.540 --> 02:46:40.540
I'm going to my last semester, so I'm going to be super swamped,

02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:43.540
and I wanted to actually just get into it and dig deep.

02:46:43.540 --> 02:46:47.540
So there I am right now, and yeah, it's been great so far.

02:46:47.540 --> 02:46:50.540
Wow, Andy in chat saying, apparently Arizona is a theme too.

02:46:50.540 --> 02:46:52.540
I called from Phoenix.

02:46:52.540 --> 02:46:53.540
Oh, okay.

02:46:53.540 --> 02:46:54.540
I had no idea.

02:46:54.540 --> 02:46:56.540
Hello. Sorry you live in Phoenix. It's terrible.

02:46:56.540 --> 02:47:00.540
I've been to Phoenix. It's a hot ass mess.

02:47:00.540 --> 02:47:02.540
I can say that. It's a hot ass mess.

02:47:02.540 --> 02:47:04.540
It is a hot ass mess. Tucson's not that much better.

02:47:04.540 --> 02:47:08.540
But I went to the, oh my God, why can't I remember his name all of a sudden?

02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:10.540
Alice Cooper. I went to his restaurant. That was pretty awesome.

02:47:10.540 --> 02:47:11.540
Okay.

02:47:11.540 --> 02:47:12.540
Anyway, what was I going to say?

02:47:12.540 --> 02:47:17.540
Oh, now I want to make sure you get a chance to plug your stuff,

02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:19.540
because our listeners may not know, but you do your own show,

02:47:19.540 --> 02:47:21.540
and I want to make sure you get your shout out here.

02:47:21.540 --> 02:47:23.540
So tell us a little bit about the show that you do.

02:47:23.540 --> 02:47:25.540
Well, that's not why I called, Rob. Come on.

02:47:25.540 --> 02:47:28.540
I know, but I want to make sure you get your shout out.

02:47:28.540 --> 02:47:30.540
Okay, well, that's very nice of you.

02:47:30.540 --> 02:47:35.540
I write and podcast for rpgfan.com, so we run a couple of podcasts,

02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:38.540
and the primary one is Random Encounter.

02:47:38.540 --> 02:47:42.540
It's on iTunes, and we have an RSS feed, and it's all there.

02:47:42.540 --> 02:47:45.540
It's a video game talk show, obviously, focusing on RPGs.

02:47:45.540 --> 02:47:48.540
We just talk about news and what we've been playing and blah, blah, blah.

02:47:48.540 --> 02:47:51.540
And if you're a big video game music fan like I am,

02:47:51.540 --> 02:47:54.540
we also run Rhythm Encounter, which is like a video game music show.

02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:58.540
And most recently, Retro Encounter started up, which is like a video game book club.

02:47:59.540 --> 02:48:02.540
So if you want to listen to people talk about RPGs,

02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:04.540
then we have many options for you.

02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:06.540
It sounds like you have a competing network going on.

02:48:06.540 --> 02:48:08.540
No, I'm just kidding. I think that's great.

02:48:08.540 --> 02:48:10.540
I'm all about supporting the indie podcast.

02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:12.540
Well, the reason why I want to make sure you plug that

02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:15.540
and knowing that you do the work with rpgfan is because

02:48:15.540 --> 02:48:17.540
then I could ask you this question,

02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:19.540
and maybe you can speak with a little bit of authority

02:48:19.540 --> 02:48:23.540
because you've at least been following these games for forever and so forth.

02:48:23.540 --> 02:48:26.540
But why do you think Nintendo is so effing stubborn

02:48:26.540 --> 02:48:28.540
about bringing Mother 3 out to America?

02:48:28.540 --> 02:48:29.540
My God, I don't know!

02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:32.540
I wish they'd just licensed the fan translation already.

02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:36.540
I mean, obviously they're aware that the demand is there, right?

02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:40.540
Because they just released Earthbound Beginnings on Virtual Console

02:48:40.540 --> 02:48:46.540
and they continue to work with Sakurai to put Earthbound characters into Smash.

02:48:46.540 --> 02:48:49.540
I wish I had a good answer for you.

02:48:49.540 --> 02:48:51.540
I don't have any kind of super insider info.

02:48:51.540 --> 02:48:54.540
I just think they're being stubborn as shit for no reason.

02:48:54.540 --> 02:48:56.540
And it's about time they do something about it.

02:48:56.540 --> 02:48:59.540
It is one of the most frustrating things in gaming,

02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:03.540
but then at least at E3 they threw us a frickin' bone with the Earthbound Zero

02:49:03.540 --> 02:49:05.540
and I was like, this is leading up to something.

02:49:05.540 --> 02:49:07.540
Right, exactly. I was like, okay, here it comes.

02:49:07.540 --> 02:49:09.540
Here's the real announcement, it's on the way.

02:49:09.540 --> 02:49:14.540
It's Lucas in Smash Brothers is the thing they're ramping up to, I don't know.

02:49:14.540 --> 02:49:19.540
And that also could be its own lead-in, but I don't know.

02:49:19.540 --> 02:49:20.540
I don't know.

02:49:20.540 --> 02:49:22.540
Was there something else you wanted to call in and talk about tonight?

02:49:22.540 --> 02:49:24.540
No, I just wanted to say hi.

02:49:24.540 --> 02:49:27.540
I thought I heard you hinting in another topic. Well, that's all right.

02:49:27.540 --> 02:49:30.540
I appreciate the phone call nonetheless and being able to talk about Earthbound.

02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:34.540
I love Earthbound as well, but I'm going to tell you a secret.

02:49:34.540 --> 02:49:36.540
I have never played Mother 3.

02:49:36.540 --> 02:49:38.540
I mean, I'm not that far behind you.

02:49:38.540 --> 02:49:42.540
I got about halfway through it last time I tried it and that was, I don't know, five years ago.

02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:46.540
So, it's okay, Rob. You can still do it.

02:49:46.540 --> 02:49:48.540
Okay, I'm glad I could vent that and not be judged for it.

02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:50.540
I'm glad this is a safe space.

02:49:50.540 --> 02:49:54.540
But time is running short because if you haven't played it within the next six months, I'm going to judge you.

02:49:54.540 --> 02:49:57.540
All right, I'll work on it. I promise.

02:49:57.540 --> 02:49:58.540
Okay.

02:49:58.540 --> 02:50:00.540
All right. Well, thank you so much, Embryon, for the phone call.

02:50:00.540 --> 02:50:03.540
I really appreciate it and good luck with everything on your own show.

02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:04.540
Yeah, thanks for having me.

02:50:04.540 --> 02:50:05.540
Hey, you're welcome. Anytime. Take care, buddy.

02:50:05.540 --> 02:50:06.540
You too.

02:50:06.540 --> 02:50:07.540
All right, bye.

02:50:07.540 --> 02:50:11.540
All right, sadly, I'm going to shut the Skype line down at this time

02:50:11.540 --> 02:50:13.540
and I know there are still people trying to get through.

02:50:13.540 --> 02:50:15.540
There's multiple people still trying to get through.

02:50:16.540 --> 02:50:17.540
Please consider sending the show an e-mail.

02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:20.540
Participate at orangewonstrategy.com or a tweet.

02:50:20.540 --> 02:50:24.540
Or you can always go to our forums at thevognetwork.com and click on forums

02:50:24.540 --> 02:50:26.540
and you can still participate with the show.

02:50:26.540 --> 02:50:28.540
You can leave a comment on a past episode of the show.

02:50:28.540 --> 02:50:30.540
Whatever. Send smoke signals.

02:50:30.540 --> 02:50:33.540
We'll get you on the show one way or another.

02:50:33.540 --> 02:50:37.540
But for now, it is well after midnight on the East Coast, after 9 p.m. on the West Coast,

02:50:37.540 --> 02:50:40.540
so we have to start to wrap up the show tonight.

02:50:40.540 --> 02:50:43.540
So, before I go around and get everybody's final thoughts,

02:50:43.540 --> 02:50:45.540
we did run out of last minute stories, right, Loki? We're good?

02:50:45.540 --> 02:50:48.540
Yes, and I've been watching videos of Grand Theft Auto 5.

02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:49.540
Oh, good times. Good times.

02:50:49.540 --> 02:50:52.540
Well, before we wrap up, for realsies, we've got to go around

02:50:52.540 --> 02:50:55.540
and get everybody's final thought for the night.

02:50:55.540 --> 02:50:57.540
But I do want to say, of course, as always,

02:50:57.540 --> 02:51:00.540
thank you so much for downloading our show or listening live

02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:02.540
or however you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio.

02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:05.540
Just thanks for being here for the past three hours,

02:51:05.540 --> 02:51:08.540
two and a half, maybe, on the podcast feed,

02:51:08.540 --> 02:51:11.540
to listen and participate with our show. We really appreciate it.

02:51:11.540 --> 02:51:15.540
We don't ask for your money. All we ask, help spread the word about the show.

02:51:15.540 --> 02:51:18.540
Tell a friend or five about the show because word of mouth

02:51:18.540 --> 02:51:20.540
is all we have here at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:23.540
and that's the only way our show grows is for you to tell a friend.

02:51:23.540 --> 02:51:27.540
If you didn't like Orange Lounge Radio, well, you still made it to the end of the show,

02:51:27.540 --> 02:51:29.540
so I'm hoping there's something you liked about it.

02:51:29.540 --> 02:51:33.540
But I always say, even if you didn't like OLR, support indie broadcasting.

02:51:33.540 --> 02:51:38.540
You heard our buddy there from RPG Fan. Maybe you'd like one of their podcasts.

02:51:38.540 --> 02:51:41.540
Maybe you'd like one of the other podcasts on the Voice of Geeks Network,

02:51:41.540 --> 02:51:43.540
vognetwork.com, or just something out there.

02:51:43.540 --> 02:51:45.540
Just support hard-working, independent broadcasters

02:51:45.540 --> 02:51:48.540
because there's so many people out there who don't get paid to do this,

02:51:48.540 --> 02:51:52.540
who also don't get advertised on big podcasting networks and stuff

02:51:52.540 --> 02:51:55.540
because they don't have money, so I really appreciate your support.

02:51:55.540 --> 02:51:59.540
So go find, and you heard some shout-outs in an e-mail there as well,

02:51:59.540 --> 02:52:02.540
so lots of suggestions for you guys this week.

02:52:02.540 --> 02:52:05.540
So, all right, all that being said, now it is time to go around

02:52:05.540 --> 02:52:08.540
and get everybody's final thought for the night.

02:52:08.540 --> 02:52:10.540
And I guess I'll start tonight. I don't usually go first.

02:52:10.540 --> 02:52:12.540
So my final thought tonight is...

02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:16.540
Ahh! Ahh!

02:52:16.540 --> 02:52:18.540
Darsakra, your final thought tonight?

02:52:18.540 --> 02:52:20.540
I really like cheese.

02:52:20.540 --> 02:52:23.540
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:52:23.540 --> 02:52:27.540
Uh, I need to work more on my game this week.

02:52:27.540 --> 02:52:28.540
Yes, you do.

02:52:28.540 --> 02:52:33.540
And if anybody out there makes logos, I know, I know you do.

02:52:33.540 --> 02:52:35.540
I know I need to send you information, Jamie.

02:52:35.540 --> 02:52:40.540
But anybody else out there too, you know, I need one for my game,

02:52:40.540 --> 02:52:43.540
for my company that I haven't formed yet, but I will,

02:52:43.540 --> 02:52:46.540
because I have a website already that's been sitting there for, like, six months.

02:52:46.540 --> 02:52:49.540
All right, Loki, get on that. I'm excited to play your game.

02:52:49.540 --> 02:52:51.540
You know, I still have a couple more VoG Jam games to play,

02:52:51.540 --> 02:52:55.540
and I'm hoping for the very last one, I could do, like, the quote-unquote

02:52:55.540 --> 02:52:59.540
world premiere, even though you've already premiered it on your own YouTube channel.

02:52:59.540 --> 02:53:02.540
But that doesn't stop other websites from saying exclusive and premiere,

02:53:02.540 --> 02:53:07.540
so I'm going to use that word here at VoG Network to show your stinking VoG Jam game already.

02:53:07.540 --> 02:53:08.540
All right.

02:53:08.540 --> 02:53:09.540
So I'm excited.

02:53:09.540 --> 02:53:13.540
All right, well, that is going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:13.540 --> 02:53:17.540
We will be back next week to talk about whatever should happen in the gaming world

02:53:17.540 --> 02:53:20.540
in the next seven days in whatever games you're playing.

02:53:20.540 --> 02:53:23.540
Have a great time playing video games out there.

02:53:23.540 --> 02:53:26.540
Remember, treat each other with respect online, for God's sake.

02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:27.540
Don't be rude to people.

02:53:27.540 --> 02:53:30.540
And that's it.

02:53:30.540 --> 02:53:33.540
Maybe I'll see you on the battlefield in Splatoon,

02:53:33.540 --> 02:53:36.540
because I've got to level my character up so I can join a squad.

02:53:36.540 --> 02:53:38.540
So I think that's on my to-do list for the week.

02:53:38.540 --> 02:53:40.540
So have a great week, everybody.

02:53:40.540 --> 02:53:44.540
