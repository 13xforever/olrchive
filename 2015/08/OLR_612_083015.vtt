Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
This week, the first infamous shared Mario Maker level has emerged and it will never give you up and never let you down. But does it turn around and delight you? Maybe we need a time to Rick Roll Counter. This is just one of many stories we'll tell you about and they all start right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 612 for this, August the 30th of 2015.

00:44.000 --> 01:00.000
And yes, I think Jason just Rick rolled us all in the intro. I do believe that is a thing that has just happened all these years later. Because Rick rolling is what, so 10 years ago? Maybe not, maybe not as we get into the news tonight and figure that out later. I'm just cracking up that he did that.

01:00.000 --> 01:09.000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California with my co-host here tonight. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Hello.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
Welcome back.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yes.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
I know you had a decent week off last week. I know you're taking care of other obligations, but welcome back.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah.

01:17.000 --> 01:29.000
You were complaining earlier about this abundance of Red Bull. Red Bull giveaways. First off, how do you drink so much Red Bull without having heart problems?

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
I don't drink a ton of it. I drink one a day. Just one.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
That seems like a lot.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
It's not. It's like a coffee. Do you drink a coffee a day?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
Fair enough.

01:39.000 --> 01:57.000
It's basically what it is. It's not like it's a ton of caffeine. And really, it's what I need to stay awake. Because, like, I seriously, earlier, before coming over, I was just, like, working on the computer and I was, like, passing out from being so tired. So, it's how I stay awake.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
All right. So, that's fine. I guess, you know, especially when you consider that, you know, you got the kids and everything. I'm sure they keep up late.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
And I stay up way too late. And, yeah.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
I'm literally drinking coffee as he's talking about his Red Bull thing. So, I guess I can't complain too much.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
It's not like I'm drinking, like, four or five of them a day or something like that. No. One a day and that's it.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Shotgunning them where you did the whole bottom?

02:17.000 --> 02:28.000
I don't. I can shotgun them. But, yeah. I drink one usually in the morning. Right when I get to work. I kind of just. Because, like, I literally am dragging myself in the work and it just kind of keeps me awake.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Okay.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
And then, like, on Sunday, you know, I drink one in the evening because I've been with the kids all day. And it's just, you know, you got to stay awake.

02:34.000 --> 02:45.000
But, because of this, now, you know, of course, we've talked about this weeks ago on the show. But, the whole fact that they are giving away crap in Destiny, the video game. They're giving it away with this Red Bull stuff.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Yeah.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
You're just plucking all these tabs.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
Oh, yeah. I've got, like, six of them at my desk at work.

02:49.000 --> 02:59.000
Like, what was that old urban legend about? Because my dad was super into that. You pluck the tabs off of soda cans and it's what they use for dialysis treatment or something like that. Like, the money for recycling them. I swear to God.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
No, no, no. I know what you're talking about because they have one of those collection things at work. It's for something. Yeah.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Yeah.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Where you can turn them in.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Right?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I don't know.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
So, like, you've got this going in your house except it's Destiny codes.

03:11.000 --> 03:22.000
Destiny codes. Which is funny because I still haven't played Destiny. I have it sitting there since day one that I bought my PlayStation 4. Haven't touched it. That and Watch Dogs.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Both just sitting there completely unused.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
So, what are you going to do with all these codes?

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Probably give them away because I can't do anything with them. I mean, I can only give away one.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
Give away. Awesome.

03:32.000 --> 03:41.000
I don't know what it says. It's like 4A. Let's see here. It says, become legend with flame sword at redbullquest.com.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
Just read the code. Read the code on that tab right now.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
On this tab?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Let's make somebody a winner right now.

03:48.000 --> 04:00.000
Alright. So, we've got X4FFW47X. You redeem that at redbullquest.com.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
Alright. Now you can safely throw that can away.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
I can safely throw this can away and I've got three more in the bag for the rest of the week that have these codes on them plus all the ones on my desk.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
So, I still don't know what the hell it does, but there you go.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
It's a flame sword. I think.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
Cool. I guess. I've played Destiny since the beta, so I don't know.

04:19.000 --> 04:25.000
Alright. Not joining us tonight, unfortunately, is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.000
She has the night off. You might have heard her mention last week. She is off celebrating her anniversary this weekend.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
It's actually her ten year anniversary with DanTheMan. They are seeing Weird Al tonight in Folsom.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Damn it. That's awesome.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I know. Right? I was like, wait a minute.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
In Folsom?

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
I know. Right? I was like, where?

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
Weird Al's in Folsom. That was the first question I asked. Like, where is there a concert venue in Folsom? It's at the college.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Oh, yeah.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Yeah. So, uh.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Oh, man. That's awesome.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
I know. Why are we doing a show right now?

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Exactly. We should have gone and saw Weird Al.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
I had no idea that that was a thing until Jamie was like, yeah.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Oh, man. Next time.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Dan and I have meet and greet tickets and then we're going to Reno because I'm special.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Aww. And they get to meet him too?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Yeah.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Oh, that sucks.

05:03.000 --> 05:13.000
Well, if you know the story about Dan and Jamie. I almost said Jamie and Jan. If you know their story, they got engaged over the movie UHF.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
So, Weird Al is of a particular significance to this.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
That's awesome.

05:16.000 --> 05:23.000
So, the fact that he's touring right now and is here in the town is pretty awesome. So, it all worked out great for them.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
But we do have you guys. You guys are here in our chat room. Live.vognetwork.com.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
And, let's see, Nascent Games. Our buddy Gabe with Nascent Games is listening live tonight and in the chat.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
He was on the show a few weeks ago saying, whoa, Weird Al is in Folsom? What the fuck?

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
And I'm listening to this show. Hashtag nerd priorities.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Exactly.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
We have a guest who hasn't changed her name in chat, vog267, who says, you're better than Weird Al.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
Aw, that's a very nice thing to say. I don't know. I wouldn't go that far. Weird Al is pretty awesome.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
Especially, he did a great job with his last album. The mandatory fun and all that.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Yeah, it was pretty good.

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
You know, actually, another local connection. I understand that, you know, because he did like every song on that album he did a video for, right?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
And he put them all out like all at once, right?

06:09.000 --> 06:15.000
Well, the one for word crimes, which like to make that song good, like that's what Weird Al does.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
He takes those annoying songs and makes them like good.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
So he did the word crimes. You know how it was like an art type video, like a word art video, lyrics video.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Apparently the guy who did it was here in Sacramento.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Huh.

06:26.000 --> 06:32.000
Huh. Who knew? Who knew? So we have all this art and stuff coming out of Sacramento.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
And ActDeft was the one that got the code.

06:35.000 --> 06:41.000
There it is. Oh, there you go. Congrats. ActDeft in our chat room. Does ActDeft even own Destiny?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Who cares?

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
I thought he was a Wii U guy. Oh, well, that's all right.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
Okay. He says he does. There it is. That's fine.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Someday I'll play it again. Or for the first time, I guess.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
Salty is in our chat room. SaltyVog says, ew, Sacktown, so bad. Hey, you know what?

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
First off, this isn't Hoard House. Sorry, you're on the wrong show.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
And second off, it's not so bad. You get used to Sacktown.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
I think most people have bad memories of Sacktown because they took a pit stop here on the way to Oregon or something from LA.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Like you stopped through here on the way to San Francisco or something.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
We're outside of Sacramento. I mean, it's just like we're not in the middle of Sacramento.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
We're in suburbia. It's not that much different.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
Suburbia here is not that much different from suburbia in LA, except you can actually afford a home here.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
Kinda. Kinda.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
And I agree. I mean, I don't like driving down in Sacramento either. I mean, it's just whatever.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
All right. Going to another comment brought up in our chat here.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Dark Tetsuya starting us off tonight actually talking about some games here.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
Dark Tetsuya says, why the hell can't I join a winning team for Splatfest?

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
How many of y'all are playing Splatoon out there?

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
This weekend was the big, I don't know if it's sponsored or licensed or what, but there was a commercial tie-in.

08:00.000 --> 08:06.000
This Splatfest because instead of cats and dogs or, what was it, water slides and roller coasters and all that stuff.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
This time it was Autobots and Decepticons.

08:09.000 --> 08:15.000
It was a Transformers theme. And a lot of my friends signed up for the Autobots.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
So what did I do, Loki?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Decepticons.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
That's right. I signed up for Team Decepticon. And sure enough, we won!

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
Yay! I finally, my second only Splatfest because I was lazy and missed all but the first one.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
And I'm on the winning team for a change. So that was pretty exciting.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
And I actually did, I guess we'll get into my gaming week a little bit.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
I actually did spend a little bit of time in Splatoon.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
I leveled up enough to get, like there's the base level, you get 10 points, the second level, you get 25 points, that next level.

08:46.000 --> 08:53.000
So I, you know, it wasn't a lot. I'm sure some of you guys leveled all the way up to whatever the maximum thing was for Splatfest.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
But still, I put a little more into it than I usually do on Splatoon.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
But I was having quite a bit of fun.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
You know, Splatoon is just a fun little waste of five minutes.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
And I mean that when I say waste, I mean that in the best possible way.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
Like just, you know, jump in and do a little head-to-head battle and there's not a lot of shit talking because, you know, you can't.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
And that's that.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
But the Splatfest thing is kind of cool because they mix it up with some custom music and they make the lobby all different.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
And, you know, with the Miiverse posts, everybody gets really into it no matter how stupid the debate is.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.000
So you saw all this stuff for Team Autobot and Team Decepticon and all this stuff.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
And, yeah, that was fun. I was happy to take part in that.

09:35.000 --> 09:38.000
So I had a good time in the game there.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
Going into our chatroom again at live.vognetwork.com, Dartitsuya says,

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
I was gonna miss it, but I borrowed my stepmom's account to play and tried to get Team Autobot some wins.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
Well, you needed to get him a few more wins, my friend.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
Let's see, also, Act F says, I got to Autobot's king rank.

09:58.000 --> 10:08.000
You know, I thought that there was going to be a big victory for Decepticons in the popularity.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
Because I noticed in one of the matches I got, it was Decepticons versus Decepticons.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And I was like, oh, dang.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Whoever wins, we win.

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
That's right. And I was kind of like, oh, there must not be enough Autobots in the pool because now it's matching up Decepticons and Decepticons.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
But I guess Shane was telling me the same thing was happening on the Autobot side.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I was like, oh, okay. Well, I guess it was just the fluke.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
So I guess it's just somebody just kind of messed up that network code there a little bit.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
Well, no, I'm pretty sure that's what they're doing to push people into a match if nobody else is available,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
is they just match you up with somebody on the same team.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
And it's kind of a win no matter what.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
I don't know how that math all works. I don't think they've really said a lot about that.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
So what they should do then is they should just lie.

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
And so, you know, if you're Autobots and the other team's Autobots, you just say they're Decepticons.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
And then on their side, they see that you're Decepticons.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
And that way, it seems like there's competition.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
Going to our chat room for some more comments over at live.voggenetwork.com.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
ActDef says, Sky, in Europe, it was singing versus dancing.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
And the top dancing rink was Dancing Queen.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
LOL. That's amazing.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
That's amazing. I hope it actually played the ABBA song.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
Although that licensing was probably a little bit too much for that. I don't know.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.000
That is interesting. I forget they do the different SplatFests in different countries.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
So it's not the same thing everywhere.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
Like Europe gets one and Japan gets a different one. I wonder what Japan had.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
I'm sure somebody in chat knows.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Team singing versus team dancing. I don't know what I'd pick.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Team stand in the corner awkwardly with my drink.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
Is that one of the teams I can do?

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
Team Super Sentai versus Team Kaiju.

11:47.000 --> 11:54.000
ActDef says, Japan's SplatFest was Ants versus Grasshoppers.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
And Grasshoppers won.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Ew. Bugs.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Grasshoppers should've won. Because ants are stupid.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
Well, Grasshoppers are pretty cool.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
Isn't that the one where the female bites the head off the male when they're mating?

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
I think you're thinking of pre-mantises.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
This is why I got a D in biology, people.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Alright.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I didn't have a lot of kickoff topics for tonight.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
We have a lot of gaming news, so we'll get into that in just a minute.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
But obviously there's a lot of convention stuff going on.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.000
I didn't even realize that PAX Prime was this weekend until I started seeing the tweets about it.

12:32.000 --> 12:39.000
Because, you know, if you're not on there getting the tickets in the ten minutes they're available, then you're not going.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
That's the way those things work.

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
So I just kind of didn't pay attention to it because I just assumed that PAX was going to be Labor Day weekend again.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Because it's still a four-day con, if I'm not mistaken.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
So I just assumed it was going to be Labor Day weekend again.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
And, you know, in the past few years I've chosen to go to DragonCon.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
I've had a fantastic time at DragonCon.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.000
I think as we've expanded into all realms of geek here at vognetwork.com, I think DragonCon's a better fit.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
And I can read from friends and news sites what's going on at PAX.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
And I've talked about some of my own grievances with PAX East on the show previously.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
I'm not going to get into it again.

13:14.000 --> 13:22.000
But anyway, I just assumed I wouldn't have been able to go to PAX Prime because it would be at the same time as DragonCon.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
But not this year. It's actually going on right now.

13:24.000 --> 13:29.000
And a lot of the news we're going to get into tonight, a lot of it is stuff that's actually coming out of PAX.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Loki, it's been a while since you've gone to a con at all, right?

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Was PAX 08 like the last thing you ever did as far as cons go?

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
I don't remember. Maybe? I think? Maybe?

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Yeah, that might have been the last one.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
I can't remember if we did E3 after that or not.

13:49.000 --> 13:57.000
I don't consider E3 a con, because E3 technically is a trade show where cons are usually more fan-run.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
Which PAX kind of isn't, so I don't know.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Yeah, PAX 08 was probably the last one.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Alright.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
So, but anyway.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
It's been seven years. Wow.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Yeah, I know. I know.

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
Well, you should go to the SacAnime here locally this weekend if you can stop by there.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Oh, this weekend?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah, it's this weekend. They do that all the way.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah, I don't have the money.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Yeah.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
BlackWolf making the distinction a little bit in our chat room.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
Trade shows are for industry. Conventions are for the public.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.000
Whatever. They treat me like public when I go to the trade shows anyway, so.

14:29.000 --> 14:35.000
Well, you know, interesting too is that E3, there's always those rumblings that it's going to go public,

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
or they're going to make one day public, like Tokyo Game Show or what have you.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Oh, could he?

14:39.000 --> 14:44.000
Well, a lot of that started to pick up steam this year with the whole vendor badges.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
I was like, damn. Those Nintendo lines are only five hours long. It's so short.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
If only we could have more people here.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
I mean, there's just not enough people. I can actually move and breathe.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Yes, please. Let's make it public. That'd be awesome.

14:59.000 --> 15:03.000
Nasan Games in chat says, too many effing cons.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
And then says, but I will be attending Geek Girl Con in Seattle to show off our games, which I'm super hyped about.

15:08.000 --> 15:12.000
That's another con in Seattle, even.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
Geek Girl Con?

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah, I had not heard of that one, but I bet that's a lot of fun.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Geek Girl Con.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
What's that?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
I said you'd probably get behind that.

15:20.000 --> 15:27.000
There's that. There's PAX. There's the Sakura Con, which I know is more anime, but you know video games creep into that.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
So, they're pretty bustling up there in the Northwest. It's pretty cool.

15:31.000 --> 15:39.000
Bonds006 says, I've been to trade shows and cons here in New York at Jacob Javits Center. There is a difference.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
I detest cons, but mostly work at trade shows. Very interesting.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Alright, those are some comments from our chat room on conventions.

15:47.000 --> 15:52.000
Of course, Dragon Con. I will be there this next week in Atlanta.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
So, check that out.

15:54.000 --> 16:01.000
VOGG making a few appearances. Unfortunately, I am not on the up and up on any panels that our TV folks are on.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
I missed if they mentioned if they're going to be on any panels.

16:04.000 --> 16:09.000
But I know Brian from British Invaders is at the con again this year, which he usually only goes every other year.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
So, there must be something bringing him back this year.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Our pal from British Invaders, he's going to be there at the show.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
I know John from Critical Myth, at least, will be there. Gary's always there.

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
So, they're going to be at the show. I don't know if John's on any panels this year.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
Stay tuned to our website. I'm going to make everybody round that up in the forums.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
So, if you're going to Atlanta, you want to meet and greet people, you can go check that out.

16:29.000 --> 16:37.000
I can say, though, that I will be on a panel Sunday at 1 o'clock about the podcasting past, present, and future.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
And that's Hilton. I think the room is 203. It's where the podcasting track is.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
So, check that out. I will be on that panel.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
If you can't be there in Atlanta, you can listen online.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
Alpha Geek Radio, kind enough to...

16:50.000 --> 16:56.000
You know what's so funny? I see the same guy from that network at so many cons that I go to, live streaming stuff.

16:56.000 --> 17:00.000
They're working hard over there to bring these cons out there to the universe.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
Because I saw them at BlizzCon, too, during the World of Podcasting last year.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
So, I thought that was really funny. I was like, I know you. I see you at DragonCon.

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
So, there's that. So, you can listen there at Alpha Geek Radio.

17:12.000 --> 17:20.000
And then, Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern, Bobby is going to be on a panel about community.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
And, obviously, we love community and getting people's input and so forth here at VoG.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
So, that's a great fit for Bobby to be talking on that panel Monday at 10 a.m.

17:30.000 --> 17:36.000
I will also be in the parade. I'm going to be marching with Travis Donovan from Understation Live.

17:36.000 --> 17:43.000
And we are part of the N7 Elite. If you've been following the past few weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio,

17:43.000 --> 17:49.000
I have been getting a costume made. And I am going to DragonCon this year as Joker.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
And I do plan to dress up the day of the parade, which I think is Saturday, question mark?

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
I'm probably going to wear my costume Saturday, no matter what.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
If the parade is Sunday, then I'll just wear it Sunday morning as well. I don't even care.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
But, yeah. Oh, you didn't even see it when you came in, did you, Loki?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
No.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Oh, hold on. Hold on. Hold on, guys. I've got to show Loki. Here's the thing.

18:08.000 --> 18:12.000
I'm not showing it to anybody until DragonCon. But since I know Loki's not going to be there, hold on.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
I'm going to show him. So, entertain our listeners here. Live radio, folks.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
And if you want to participate with us, live.vognetwork.com.

18:19.000 --> 18:25.000
The best part about this is he's going to show me a costume for a character I have no reference for.

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
So, I'm just going to assume that, you know, this is an impressive costume.

18:30.000 --> 18:37.000
Because I have no idea, since I don't play Mass Effect at all, who the hell Joker is, aside from, you know...

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Here it is!

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
Okay. Cool.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
There's another part to it.

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
All right. I'll take your word for it. I don't have any idea whatsoever, you know.

18:53.000 --> 18:58.000
It looks good. Sorry. I don't know.

18:58.000 --> 19:03.000
Well, there it is, you guys. My costume is a screaming success. There it is. Loki.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
I'll just have to look at my picture of Joker and to kind of get the...

19:07.000 --> 19:14.000
Oh, my God. Awesome. All right. There it is. Oh, Bobby says I missed the panel posting. My bad.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
I guess I missed that over on our forum. So, wow. The Critical Myth is doing a ton of panels this year.

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
John is going to be on an Arrow panel Friday from 10 to 11 over at the Marriott.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
Game of Thrones, The Dark Time, he's going to be on that panel as well, Friday from 2.30 to 3.30.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
And then Gary is going to be talking about Binge Watching, which I know is a habit for so many people.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
How Binge Watching makes us all TV geeks. That's Saturday at 2.30.

19:39.000 --> 19:45.000
And then also a panel on The Flash, What Kind of Hero Are You, going to be on that panel as well.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
Okay. I guess that sort of looks like the character. I see it now.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh, did you pull it up? There's another top piece I didn't show you that makes that armor piece on top of the shoulders.

19:56.000 --> 20:05.000
So, yeah. All right. Cool. Anyway. All right. Anyhow, so there you go.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
That's Dragon Con coming up. We're going to have a great time there. So I hope to see you guys in Atlanta.

20:09.000 --> 20:17.000
We don't have like a formal VOG meetup because usually we don't know enough people that are going to justify something like that.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.000
But maybe in the future. I don't know. Maybe next year.

20:21.000 --> 20:27.000
So I'm really going to try to get Grandpa from a Horde house to go to Dragon Con next year.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
Because I'm not going to have – Travis swears up and down it's his last year.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
I really wish it wouldn't be. But, you know, I understand with some of his personal obligations and so forth.

20:35.000 --> 20:41.000
He may mean it this time. I'm secretly hoping it'll be like a year or two break and then he'll be back.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
But anyway, so since I'm going to be absent of Travis, I need to figure out something.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
So I'm going to really try to get Grandpa to go to Dragon Con next year.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
Because I know he wants to do it. Because I was telling him, I'm like, Grandpa, Garrett Wong goes like every year.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
You can meet him at the Walk of Fame. They have a whole track dedicated to Star Trek.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
You could nerd the fuck out on this thing the whole weekend.

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
And the Mythbusters go. So I would love to see them.

21:08.000 --> 21:19.000
Exactly. So that's my goal. My 2016 goal is Grandpa from a Horde house or whatever project may be in the near future to get him at Dragon Con.

21:19.000 --> 21:26.000
So, and I'm sad that I won't have Travis in 2016. We're going to make the best of 2015.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
So, there you go. Alright, so there you go. Conventions, conventions.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.000
We're going to get into our gaming week. But, you know, go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.000
I notice they are talking about something else now. It kind of got derailed a little bit, but for good reason.

21:41.000 --> 21:49.000
Apparently, coming from Twitter, and it's a verified Twitter account, Wes Craven has passed away.

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
The horror movie director. That's very sad to hear that.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
All those scary, he's going to come back some evil, I know it.

21:57.000 --> 22:03.000
Ladies and gentlemen, the first one to make a tasteless joke. Right here, everybody. Right here.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Thank you for that, Loki. I appreciate that.

22:06.000 --> 22:12.000
But no, I mean, I know he was an older guy, but I didn't know he was battling health issues or anything like that.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Yeah, we never know.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah, well that's sad. Sorry to hear about that. Anyway.

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
NASA Games in chat says, LOL, he went there. Yeah, he tends to do that. Jerk.

22:23.000 --> 22:29.000
Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about what types of video games we have been playing this week.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
And then we will get into the gaming news right after that. So, Loki.

22:34.000 --> 22:43.000
Mostly I've been working on my game. The beginning portion of the week was just designing a logo, which I didn't like too much.

22:43.000 --> 22:49.000
So I showed it to Cody and he kind of took it and did something better with it and sent it back to me.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
So I now have a logo for my, quote, company.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.000
You know, I haven't registered anything or anything like that, but you know, you can't just say, I made the game.

22:59.000 --> 23:05.000
And then I was working on setting up leaderboards as well, online leaderboards.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.000
So I'm just doing the PHP stuff right now for that.

23:08.000 --> 23:16.000
Mainly I was trying to figure out what exactly I wanted to have on the leaderboards if I was going to do some sort of scoring system too along with the times.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.000
So I just kind of built that all in there and stuff. And I'm going to have Twitter support as well.

23:21.000 --> 23:31.000
So, not necessarily linking to Twitter, but you can put your Twitter name on there and then it will just have a hyperlink to your Twitter account or something like that if you want to.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
And then, now actual games I played, I didn't play a whole ton. A lot of just older stuff.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
My son keeps playing Lego Marvel Super Heroes, so I play a little bit of that.

23:41.000 --> 23:48.000
Mainly just glitching out the game now because there's a super easy way to get under the map, so I've just been messing with that.

23:48.000 --> 23:55.000
And, I don't know. I'm kind of getting bored with it now after 200 hours of the game.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
What else? Plains of Steam backlog stuff.

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
So I tried, I had purchased that Namco bundle from Humble Bundle because it's like, ooh, Ridge Racer.

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
I wanted to play that Ridge Racer Unbounded game or something like that. It looked pretty cool. It was done by Bugbear.

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
That game runs like shit on my computer. I loaded it up, I'm like, nope, delete.

24:17.000 --> 24:25.000
Right away, it just ran terribly. And I'm surprised. I can run Titanfall okay?

24:25.000 --> 24:31.000
Why can't it run this game that's much older and much shittier? I don't understand.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
But for whatever reason, it just didn't run very well.

24:33.000 --> 24:38.000
Also, I think I mentioned I played Bionic Commando. I don't really remember when that was.

24:38.000 --> 24:44.000
And I'm talking about not re-armed, the good one. I played the 3D Bionic Commando.

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
For some reason I remember enjoying it a lot more than I did this time around.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
But it was terrible. It's just such a terrible game.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
And it's not like a terrible game just in general. It's just the controls were shitty.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
So I don't know what was wrong with that.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.000
Then, for some stupid reason, on the streak of really fucking terrible games I decided to play,

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
I decided, hey, you know what? I played Fuel one time. Let's load that up again from Codemasters,

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
their big open world sort of racing game. God, that game is so boring.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
I don't remember how boring that game was, but man, I went back there to play that.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
I remember not thinking it was horrible, but I do remember it was really open.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
It's really open, but it's just really boring. There's like nothing there.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
And so I played it for like, I don't know, maybe 30 minutes or so, and I was just like, I can't.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
I can't play this anymore. It's just so terrible.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
So what else did I play?

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
I think a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 5 because my son wanted to see me do some BMX stuff in there.

25:48.000 --> 25:56.000
So I did that, and then I think I played that Sakura Clicker game a little bit just for the hell of it.

25:56.000 --> 26:04.000
It's just basically, you know, was it Clicker Heroes with anime chicks in it.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
And then what else?

26:07.000 --> 26:11.000
I think that was just about it. Maybe a little bit of Minecraft.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.000
But nothing has really caught my attention. I mean, I don't know.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
I just realized, you know, Mad Max is coming out this week.

26:18.000 --> 26:24.000
I kind of wanted to try that out because, you know, I'm a pretty big fan of the company that made the game.

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
But I don't know. I just don't have the money.

26:28.000 --> 26:33.000
That's a problem. There's all these games that come out and not enough money to play them all.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
I understand. I understand how it goes.

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
All right. Let's see. Some feedback on your gaming week in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Nascent Games, our buddy Gabe, is asking,

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
Loki, when the shit are you bringing your game to our demo feedback night and or our next game jam?

26:48.000 --> 26:52.000
I would love to. No, seriously, I was looking at your progressive game jam stuff,

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
and I like the idea that's over the course of nine months.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
But here's the thing. It's like I can't get away from my house.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Like the time. The timing, unfortunately, is not working for me.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.000
Just my new schedule and everything. Like I work until seven fifteen at night.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
And then that's it. I come home and I can't really leave the house because my wife's like,

27:11.000 --> 27:15.000
well, I've been watching the kids all evening and you can't go anywhere.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
So it's kids and we're lucky to have you here.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
Yeah, if the family wasn't there, then yeah, sure. I'd love to come out to, you know,

27:22.000 --> 27:26.000
the gaming night and do all that stuff and also to the progressive game jam.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
I'm really interested in that, but I just can't go to that.

27:30.000 --> 27:34.000
And it's disappointing because I think it'd be a lot of fun,

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
but I just can't go because I am trapped in my house and at my work.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
So that's about it.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
All right. Well, let's talk about my gaming week.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
Let's see. What have I been up to this week in games? Actually quite a bit.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
I've been getting back into doing some live streams.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
I did a few live streams of Fantasy 14.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
I did some Rocket League. I think I did Diablo the other night.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
Just, you know, the typical type of stuff I might play in a week.

28:00.000 --> 28:04.000
I was giving a little bit of testing to the YouTube games because, you know,

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
that just launched this week.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.000
So I just wanted to see kind of like what were the differences?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
What were some of the pros and cons?

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
I don't know why people had such trouble finding gaming-related videos on YouTube.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
I've never had that problem before.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Yeah, I've never had that problem either.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
It was like, we've solved the problem you never had.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.000
Yeah. I think they just want to compete with Twitch, which I understand.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
I've been saying for forever on the show, Twitch needs a viable competitor.

28:24.000 --> 28:29.000
And I just think anybody that's really tried to compete against them is usually just type a lie.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
I know there's been hit boxes and other things, but nothing's really,

28:32.000 --> 28:37.000
really kind of stepped up with that volume the way that, you know, now YouTube has.

28:37.000 --> 28:43.000
I am liking the fact that they totally are incorporating the live content ID system.

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
I mean, that's awesome that it just fucks up your shit live.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Well, but I haven't had any problem with it yet.

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
I mean, I don't know, you know, again, I haven't tried to play a Nintendo game,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
but it seems fine so far.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.000
Nothing's happened incorrectly yet.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
And, you know, there's a lot of games being run by a lot of these other streams

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
that don't seem to be having issues.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
So, you know, we'll see.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
I don't know.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
But, yeah, I think that whole content ID on the go or a live thing is a little bit like,

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
I don't know about that.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
I don't know how that would work.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
I mean, is it just going to be looking for music or something?

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
I mean, I'm assuming it's looking for music, which to be fair, Twitch has their own.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
I mean, they don't do it live, but, you know, they mute the whole on demand things

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
if there's the copyrighted music in there, which, you know, can screw up

29:26.000 --> 29:30.000
if you're playing a game that just happens to have some licensed music in the background.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
So that can sometimes be unfortunate.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.000
But I don't know.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
I feel like I got some really good quality out of the YouTube streams

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
because I know YouTube will do up to 60 frames a second.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.000
And I feel like the Rocket League one especially that I did over there looked really, really good.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
So I was getting some good quality.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
But Twitch, I think Twitch also right now has some better discoverability.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Like, I think their friends list is really robust

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
and they have a tendency to be able to kind of feature things.

29:55.000 --> 30:00.000
I feel like on YouTube right now they're featuring all the same people

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
and it's all the same channels.

30:02.000 --> 30:05.000
It's all the ones that already have millions and billions of subscribers.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
But on Twitch you're more likely to find a channel you haven't heard of yet.

30:08.000 --> 30:12.000
And so I think that's why right now I kind of prefer Twitch a little bit

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
is for the discoverability portion of it.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
But YouTube's getting their big toe in the water.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
It'll be interesting to see how that all stabilizes.

30:18.000 --> 30:22.000
And I don't know. I still haven't decided do I want to really invest in, you know,

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
because I need to pick one or the other if I want to try and grow a subscriber base or whatever.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
I really need to pick. Do I want to go Twitch or do I want to go YouTube?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
So we'll kind of see. I don't know.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I know Twitch has a big convention coming out

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
and they're probably going to really tease a lot of features

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
that are going to want to really try to keep a lot of their people team Twitch

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
and not defecting over to YouTube.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
So we'll see.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.000
But this competition element is really interesting as far as I'm concerned.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.000
Stream to both simultaneously.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
Well I know a lot of people stream to Twitch and then put their archive on YouTube

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
and that's probably the way to do it.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
I don't know.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.000
Nasan Games in our chat says,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Don't play Super Mario Maker on YouTube.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
Nintendo is already claiming ownership on all of it.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
See, yeah, that's kind of shady to me.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
I don't know if I can get down with that.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
And it's sad because really that, like I got to be honest,

31:08.000 --> 31:12.000
that is, seeing the videos out there of people making stuff on Mario Maker

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
is actually getting me interested in it.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.000
So it's advertising for your game.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
You're being very ungrateful about it.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
I mean, I have not seen any advertisement from Nintendo for Mario Maker.

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
So it's kind of bold of you to not spend much money on advertising this

31:31.000 --> 31:36.000
yet claiming ownership on these videos that are advertising for you.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
Let's see.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
And then also looking at more comments in chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Some people complaining about Twitch Con.

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
Ugh, another con, which I kind of can see that.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
It's getting a little con heavy and I don't know.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
Let's see.

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
And then Murderface says as a side note, fuck Nintendo for claiming like that.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
Technically the game isn't out.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
So I can see where maybe they're a little bit frustrated.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
But at the same time, when the game is out on September 11th,

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
I would hope that they back off on that.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
I was kind of surprised that there was all these people playing it already.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
But I guess it shouldn't be.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
It's all the press copies, I'm sure.

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
And then, let's see, also, bonds006 suggests for the next Splatoon,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Team Twitch versus Team YouTube.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
Hey, that might be a fun one to get into.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
We'll see.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
But anyway, so I've been streaming games on some of those sites.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
And then one that I did on Twitch the other day,

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
because Twitch is still built into the PlayStation 4,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
which is awfully convenient, I must say.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
I'm sure PlayStation 4 will get the YouTube support and a firmware update.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
But for right now, you can only really do the Twitch or Ustream,

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
which we don't even know.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Gaming on Ustream is not really a thing.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
There's too many ads on Ustream for me.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
And I know it's what Travis uses to do his show,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
but he's also not a gaming show, and it's a little different.

32:50.000 --> 32:56.000
Anyway, so as far as Twitch goes, I was streaming Until Dawn,

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
which Shane picked up, and he's a big fan of the scary games.

33:01.000 --> 33:05.000
And he's been playing it, I think, with Flaco Jones and Mrs. Flaco Jones.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
They've been playing Until Dawn very late at night.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
And so Shane was like, you have to play.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
You have to play.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
And you know how insistent he can be sometimes,

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
and especially because you all know how I feel about scary games,

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
and I usually flip out and all that stuff.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
So he got me to play some Until Dawn.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
The good news is it was just like the first little chapter,

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
so it wasn't too scary, but there were some super cheap jumpscares.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
And just some early impressions on the game.

33:30.000 --> 33:33.000
I think it looks really good.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
The game element itself seems very simple

33:36.000 --> 33:42.000
because you're basically choosing do you want to go this way or that way or do nothing.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
And then, of course, there's a lot of that.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
But then there's also, okay, you're in a scene,

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
and can you find the hidden objects in the scene to investigate?

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
And then there was some little action-oriented things.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
There's a lot of quick-time events, a lot of quick-time events.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
And you've got to aim the gun and shoot this thing as fast as you can,

33:59.000 --> 34:02.000
which I'm sure later in the game you're trying to shoot a killer

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
or something like that to try and get away from him for a few extra moments.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.000
But I did notice, I was like, okay, the story in some parts seems to be very heavy-handed.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
There's the butterfly effect in the game,

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
and there's so much butterfly effect stuff.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
It's like shoving it down your throat.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
You see a sign that's like,

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
did you know the Native Americans considered signs of butterflies to indicate duh-duh-duh-duh?

34:25.000 --> 34:29.000
And then it's like this whole system is like, okay, yes, I understand, developers.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
The choices I make will have an impact later in the game.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
Yes, you made that very clear. I understand.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Not very subtle.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Not very subtle, no. Not in that regard.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.000
But that's really one of the only complaints I can muster.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Now what's going to happen is...

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
I think it's going to be fun for a lot of people.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
So what's going to happen is you think that it's just,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
they're just trying to hint to you that it's all these,

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
you know, what you do is going to have effect at the end of the game,

34:52.000 --> 34:55.000
but really it's because at the end of the game you fight a giant butterfly.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
It's like Mothra, but it's a giant butterfly is the villain.

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
It's like, see, we told you it was foreshadowing.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
Dungeonbuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
thanks for not shooting the squirrel.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
Yes, there was a scene where I could shoot either like a bag of sand or a squirrel.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
And I was like, I'm sorry, I'm not having dead animals in this game.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
Dead Hayden Petiniere or whatever, it's fine.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Dead squirrel, no thank you.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
If it's like most of the squirrels that I encounter where you're trying to avoid them,

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
the squirrel will just run in front of the bag as you shot it.

35:26.000 --> 35:31.000
It's like, you are dumb. You are a dumb animal.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
This didn't happen in the game, sadly.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.000
Let's see, more comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
Dungeonbuster says, it's not super scary.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
It's more about trying to keep everyone alive.

35:42.000 --> 35:46.000
Everyone could live depending on what you decide or everyone could die horribly.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Not everyone lived in my first playthrough

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
and one character that I really didn't like survived, darn it.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
Yeah, that's what I'm hearing from a lot of people

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
is that nobody seems to be able to keep everybody alive on their first playthrough.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
That, you know, some of the kids get messed up.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
So, I don't know.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
And then there's things about the game.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
You know I don't like Saw, the Saw movies. I don't like that.

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
And I'm hearing about some of the controversial stuff in the game

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
and it sounds like a thing straight out of a Saw movie.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
And I'm just like, gross, no thanks, not really interested.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.000
But that's me.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
I know there's a lot of you out there that really love that type of stuff

36:22.000 --> 36:23.000
and I think you'll have a good time with it.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.000
It is very interesting to me how it kind of feels like Sony wrote this game off in a way

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
and maybe it's because of how the order was received or what have you.

36:31.000 --> 36:34.000
But it seems like even though Sony kind of wrote this game off,

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
just because you're not seeing a lot of press for it,

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
it didn't get a lot of hype.

36:38.000 --> 36:43.000
We saw a lot about it at E3 last year, but then it just kind of suddenly came out.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Does it still have the move support?

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
Because it was supposed to be a move game at one time.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.000
Actually, there are, I guess I could say this,

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
there are some scenes where it will suddenly come up and it says, don't move.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
And it shows the light on your controller.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
And the assumption is that if you move your controller,

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
then you're going to screw up the scene.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
So yes, there are some things to do.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
And you can actually play with motion controls, but I turned that off.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
So I guess so, yeah.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Because you have the move controllers.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Well, not on the PS4 though.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
No, it works with the PS4.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.000
Does it?

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
I didn't even try to hook that up and do that.

37:15.000 --> 37:18.000
No, but I know it does have some of that motion control stuff built into it.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
So there's that.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.000
So yeah, I know a lot of people are getting a kick out of that.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
So the word of mouth for that game has been really good.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
And I think it's going to end up doing more successfully than people thought it would.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
So I'm sure there will be an Until Dawn 2 at some point. We'll see.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
As far as other games I played this week,

37:35.000 --> 37:40.000
the new stuff that came out, I played VVVVV, which came out on PlayStation 4,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
which is like the third time I've bought that game.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
But I really like that game.

37:45.000 --> 37:48.000
It just takes me back to my Commodore 64 days and the soundtrack is so good.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.000
I was like, whatever, I'll pick it up on PlayStation 4.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
And the Mega Man collection was this week as well.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And I had to pick that up.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
Yes, I know people have their issues with the whole fact that 7 and 8 aren't there,

37:59.000 --> 38:02.000
but I was like, you know what, I want to give this game a fair shot, check it out.

38:02.000 --> 38:08.000
And I got to say, they did a good job of porting the games to the PlayStation 4,

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
the platform I picked it up on.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
They run just like they would on the Nintendo, which, you know,

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
obviously you would hope that a console that's 30 years older than the games that it's running on,

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
or the games that are running on it, would run it flawlessly.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And it does run really well.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
And there's some filters you can put on the screen if you're into that sort of thing.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.000
And there's borders that are representative of the different games as well.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.000
So that's cool.

38:31.000 --> 38:38.000
But what I also like is that they did do some stuff that was also outside just straight emulating the games.

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
And, yeah, they have the museum and artwork, which I think is very customary for these disc collections.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
But there's a challenge mode as well.

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
I thought these modes were put together pretty well where, like, let's say, for example,

38:50.000 --> 38:55.000
one of the challenges you do early on is a Mega Man boss rush.

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000
So you fight every boss in Mega Man 1 back to back to back.

38:58.000 --> 39:02.000
And it's not anything super fancy.

39:02.000 --> 39:08.000
I think they're using a collection of ROM save states strung together to kind of do this.

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
But it works really well.

39:12.000 --> 39:19.000
I was doing one challenge where you had to do the beams in Quick Man's stage without having the time stopper.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
So, I mean, that sucks.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
But when you get to the end, there'll be like a little hole that you see on the screen that has the little galaxy effect behind it.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
And you fall in the hole and it goes flash, flash, flash.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And then your character moves, flash, flash, flash.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
And then you're in another scene suddenly.

39:32.000 --> 39:38.000
So you might go from that to suddenly the scene in Dr. Wily's castle where you're dodging the spike balls as you're falling.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
So I thought that was kind of cool.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
That was something a little different that wasn't necessarily in the older collection.

39:44.000 --> 39:51.000
And to put that whole very modern social gaming aspect on it, you know, they have the leaderboards, right?

39:51.000 --> 39:56.000
But then you can also push a button and watch someone's video of them doing it.

39:56.000 --> 40:02.000
Like it saves the videos of the top 100 players or whatever actually accomplishing that feat so you can watch those on demand.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.000
And I thought that was really cool that they had that.

40:05.000 --> 40:09.000
That is a feature that I remember was in Game Room on the Xbox 360.

40:09.000 --> 40:14.000
Not to keep bringing up how amazing Game Room was, but deal with it.

40:14.000 --> 40:24.000
Between this game and Game Room on the 360, it's like everything I wish Virtual Console actually was on the NES.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
So yeah, I do think there's a little more to it than just on Virtual Console.

40:28.000 --> 40:36.000
But if you already own all the Mega Man games on Virtual Console, will it be worth another $15 to get this?

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
Do they really sell them to you?

40:38.000 --> 40:42.000
Not this collection, but all the games are on Virtual Console.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
But do you want to play $30 for nothing but emulation?

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
Or do you want $15 for at least a couple little bells and whistles in this?

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
Just a little bit of polish.

40:54.000 --> 40:59.000
Yeah, I think this is a better deal. That's how I feel.

40:59.000 --> 41:07.000
So let's see, over at live.vog, network.com, William Murderface reminding us that Diablo 3 Season 4 started Friday.

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
More grinding for all of us addicts. Yep, I just hit level 60 today on my Season 4 character.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
I might have had some power level help.

41:15.000 --> 41:21.000
Let's see, Real Raginator says $5 says that Mega Man 7 and Mega Man 8 will be DLC.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
You know, that would make a lot of sense.

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
That maybe they're going to add that on a little later. I don't know. We'll see how that works.

41:27.000 --> 41:33.000
S.J.O. and Hunter Matt says really miss Game Room and Dungeon Buster saying Game Room really was a great concept.

41:33.000 --> 41:37.000
Bonds006 says I'll say this again, watching others play games is eh to me.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
I paid to play, not so much watch TV. Net & Life already have that job.

41:41.000 --> 41:48.000
I will say though, it is pretty cool because now you can see how they're getting these good times in Mega Man.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
And sometimes you learn something from it like, oh shit, I've been using the wrong weapon.

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
Or, oh, you can cheese the shit out of this.

41:55.000 --> 42:01.000
Like, I didn't even realize, although it makes sense now that I'm watching it again, it's the same trick from Blaster Master.

42:01.000 --> 42:08.000
But like when fighting the Yellow Devil from Mega Man 1, which is that giant stone thing with the red eye.

42:08.000 --> 42:16.000
You can just, you use the elect beam and then you just pause, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause as the elect beam is going through the eye and kill him in one hit.

42:16.000 --> 42:21.000
And that's how everybody's getting like these 19 second times on the leaderboard.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
I was like, oh, so you can just cheese it.

42:24.000 --> 42:35.000
So, that would be one, I guess one minor bitch complaint suggestion I might make is that on the challenge mode, turn pause off and make people actually earn it.

42:35.000 --> 42:43.000
But I guess you still see some other like speed running techniques that aren't, like it's not really cheesing and it's just the same thing people do in speed runs.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
Kind of glitching in some of this stuff. People doing that in some of the Mega Man 2 and other games.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
So, it's kind of neat. Anyway.

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
There you go. Phew. A lot of games to talk about this week for my gaming week.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
But it's nice to be, nice to have a little time to play some games.

42:58.000 --> 43:01.000
Because this week, probably not so much with me going to Dragon Con.

43:01.000 --> 43:06.000
Although, hopefully I'll get to play some Vita or some 3DS on the plane. That's some hopes.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
And who knows? I know Dragon Con isn't a huge video gaming presence, but you never know.

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
Sometimes there's some interesting stuff there and there might be some panels.

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
I think they're introducing Firefly online at Dragon Con.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
So, I'm sure that'll be insanely popular, but I might want to check that out.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Anyway, that leads me into housekeeping for tonight.

43:23.000 --> 43:28.000
Of course, as I always say, Twitter.com slash OLR. We're also on Facebook.

43:28.000 --> 43:34.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio. We appreciate all of those follows and likes and all that good stuff.

43:35.000 --> 43:40.000
We will not be here next week with Dragon Con going on in the three-day weekend here in the States.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
We will not be having a show on Sunday.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
Bobby Blackwolf, who's before us every Sunday night, will not be live either.

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
So, it's a night off for the network.

43:49.000 --> 43:55.000
But, you know, with the three-day weekend, even if you're not going to Dragon Con, a lot of people go to different places this weekend.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
I highly doubt there's going to be too many people around on Sunday night.

43:58.000 --> 44:03.000
So, we'll be back in two weeks with an all-new Orange Launch Radio after tonight.

44:03.000 --> 44:09.000
Anyway, we still got plenty of this episode to get through, so let's get into some gaming news for the week, starting with Loki.

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
So, Yacht Club Games has announced that they're going to be releasing an Amiibo for Shovel Knight.

44:15.000 --> 44:23.000
And what's unique about this is unlike most of the Amiibos that are manufactured by Nintendo, they're actually doing the manufacturing themselves.

44:23.000 --> 44:29.000
Now, what's going to happen with this is you'll be able to use this with the Wii U and 3DS versions of Shovel Knight.

44:29.000 --> 44:37.000
And when you do that, it unlocks an exclusive co-op mode, which allows two players to play through the entire game cooperatively.

44:37.000 --> 44:46.000
And also with that, you can also customize your character and transfer that back and forth between the Wii U and 3DS versions by, of course, using the Amiibo.

44:46.000 --> 44:53.000
So, I was kind of disappointed. I thought originally when I heard about this that, you know, Shovel Knight was going to be added to, like, Smash Brothers or something like that.

44:53.000 --> 44:56.000
And I was like, ooh, that's pretty cool. But, I don't know.

44:56.000 --> 45:02.000
Maybe though, because they're doing the manufacturing and not Nintendo, that these won't be so hard to find.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
Although, they're still saying that they're going to be available in limited quantities.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.000
I'm hoping it's just under promising and over delivering, right?

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Well, we can hope. We can hope.

45:12.000 --> 45:20.000
But, yeah. I am excited. I think it's great that Shovel Knight is getting an Amiibo. I'm very excited about that.

45:20.000 --> 45:27.000
But, yeah. I'm just hoping it's not going to be subject to all this same kind of crap we've been seeing with a lot of the other Amiibo.

45:27.000 --> 45:33.000
And it better fucking not be retailer exclusive. Although, I don't think they would do that with all this song and dance for this particular Amiibo.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
I really don't think it's going to be retailer exclusive.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.000
So, I think it'll be a little easier to find in that regard.

45:38.000 --> 45:44.000
The only other thing I don't like about it is that they're locking co-op mode behind it in Shovel Knight.

45:44.000 --> 45:51.000
And that seems... I don't know. I understand the whole pay for DLC. So, maybe if co-op mode were to be DLC, I kind of get it.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
And so, maybe paying for the Amiibo is just how you pay for DLC.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.000
But, I think there's that inherent worry that I'm not going to be able to find the fucking thing.

45:59.000 --> 46:06.000
Here's my thing, though. I understand with the Amiibos, I thought the whole point was to add additional functionality to it.

46:06.000 --> 46:12.000
And I'm not talking about basically this being a key to unlock a mode or something in the game.

46:12.000 --> 46:20.000
I'm talking about, like, I thought it was supposed to be like in Smash Brothers where you train the character and you can take it and battle against other people and stuff like that.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
You know, a little bit more expanded usage for this stuff.

46:23.000 --> 46:30.000
But, I don't know. They're just kind of like these, you know, okay, you can buy it for this game and it unlocks some shit.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
That's it. That's it. It's just DLC with a figure.

46:35.000 --> 46:44.000
At least some of the figures are really cute because I will confess, and some of you might have seen this on my Twitter and I know Loki went, ugh, when he saw it walking in the door.

46:44.000 --> 46:49.000
I bought two more Amiibo, which, you know, whatever. I got the silver Mario and the Zelda.

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
But, I got a little display thing for it that's actually, I think it's really cute.

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
It looks like the end of a Mario stage with the blocks going up and then a big flag.

46:59.000 --> 47:06.000
And you can actually, the way it's constructed, there's actually little circular cutouts in the blocks so your Amiibo fit perfectly inside.

47:06.000 --> 47:10.000
And so they kind of display like they're standing on the blocks. It looks really cool.

47:10.000 --> 47:16.000
So, I bought that this week and so now I have this whole little display set up, which is cute, I think.

47:16.000 --> 47:23.000
But, I like them mostly for the figures. I've barely been using the unlocks, to be honest.

47:24.000 --> 47:29.000
I don't really, I mean I leveled a couple of the characters in Smash Brothers, but not all of them.

47:29.000 --> 47:38.000
And I've been doing that Amiibo tap thing, where you tap the Amiibo and you get the three minutes from different scenes and different NES games.

47:38.000 --> 47:45.000
But it's like, it's kind of one of those, oh I play it once, oh neat, cool, and then that's it. I haven't really gone back to visit it.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
So, that's it.

47:47.000 --> 47:54.000
Yeah, I don't know. It's a cool figure, I guess.

47:54.000 --> 48:02.000
Act F does point out the Shovel Knight figure will work in any other game that supports it though, so it isn't locked to just one game.

48:02.000 --> 48:07.000
So, who knows, maybe Shovel Knight will show up in Mario Maker or something, you never know.

48:07.000 --> 48:13.000
I mean, that's cool if it does that, but it's just, I don't know, I just don't get the, I don't see the point.

48:14.000 --> 48:26.000
And it's been like a year since, almost a year since these have been out, and there hasn't been really anything that's been like, oh my goodness, I can't imagine playing games without this functionality.

48:26.000 --> 48:34.000
And that's kind of like how they were talking about it at first, it's like, you know, this is going to be like so amazing, it's going to just revolutionize everything.

48:34.000 --> 48:46.000
No, it hasn't. It hasn't done anything. All it is is just, they knew, they got in on a fad because they knew people would collect this crap, just like they collect, you know, Skylanders or fucking Disney Infinity shit.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
They want to get in on that.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
Okay, but to be fair, to be fair, even you want the Tron Disney Infinity figures.

48:50.000 --> 48:58.000
I want it, doesn't even mean I'm going to buy it. Yeah, that's a big thing, because like, I was all gung-ho about LEGO Dimensions, I'm like, yeah, okay, this is the game I'm going to get in on.

48:58.000 --> 49:06.000
But you know what, I'm realistic. It's a fucking $100 game for the base game, and all the expansions are $40. Nope, I don't want it that much.

49:06.000 --> 49:13.000
You know, the same with the Tron stuff. Yeah, those figures look cool. Am I going to drop the money for it? Eh, I don't know, probably not.

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
I mean, they look cool, and I might want one, doesn't mean I'm going to pay for it.

49:17.000 --> 49:25.000
So, I just don't see the point aside, I mean, that's cool if you want to collect figures, fine, but like, people are just going fucking crazy over this shit.

49:25.000 --> 49:32.000
And I don't understand it, because there's really a side, you know what, Nintendo fine, if you want to put out a line of figures, hey, by all means do that.

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
But like, to say that this is some big breakthrough in gaming, it's not, it's just fucking ridiculous.

49:37.000 --> 49:44.000
It's just a fad. It is, it's just a fad, it's just like the fucking Wii Balance Board, oh, this is going to revolutionize shit.

49:44.000 --> 49:52.000
It didn't fucking do anything, or like, you know, these, the Move controller, or the Kinect, it's going to revolutionize, it did not fucking do anything, it's just a fucking fad.

49:52.000 --> 50:02.000
I would agree that probably ten years from now, we're not going to have this Amiibo, Skylanders, Infinity Figures, Lego, we're probably not going to have this in ten years.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
It'll probably be something worse.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
No, yeah, I'm getting, oh, you, just.

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
I think the figure thing is not, I think it's dated.

50:10.000 --> 50:14.000
Just wait, all it's going to take is a fucking Pokemon game.

50:14.000 --> 50:20.000
There's going to be a fucking Pokemon game, and they're going to have an Amiibo for every goddamn Pokemon out there.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
To the point where some people are like, fuck you.

50:22.000 --> 50:27.000
Nope, nope, people are not going to be all, fuck you, they're going to be like, I gotta buy them all!

50:27.000 --> 50:32.000
But they're exclusive to Target, and Walmart, and Gamestop, and Nintendo, and I don't know.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Yeah, no, I'm not, I'm not.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
Denny's.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
I'm not here for that. Denny's.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
299 Breakfast Slam.

50:39.000 --> 50:44.000
Super Meat Boy Amiibo is going to be exclusive to Denny's.

50:45.000 --> 50:50.000
No, it would be, it would be like the really crappy Pokemon that nobody wants.

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
It would be Magikarp. Magikarp with the fish and chips played at Denny's.

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Magikarp, yeah.

51:00.000 --> 51:05.000
And then it's a $20, why am I paying $20 for fish and chips at Denny's?

51:05.000 --> 51:15.000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster says Gamestop recently reported their fiscal quarter and collectibles helped their bottom line.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
Oh, I'm sure it did.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
Well, they gotta love this stuff because you can't just buy it online.

51:19.000 --> 51:22.000
And they have the exclusives and all that stuff.

51:22.000 --> 51:29.000
Anyway, speaking of what Nintendo's future could look like, we talked about a controversial patent,

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
I don't remember if it was last week or two weeks ago on the show, the whole-

51:32.000 --> 51:33.000
It was last week.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Last week, the whole, did you listen to last week's show?

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Nope, I just know the news.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.000
Well, surely, I guess some of our listeners are happy you weren't here to commentate on it.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Some are sad you weren't here to commentate on it.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
I wanted to be here just because of the voice actors. I thought that would have been cool.

51:47.000 --> 51:50.000
That was a lot of fun. We appreciate those guys being on the show.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
If you didn't hear the interview last week, go back and listen.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
I do need to go back and listen to the show.

51:54.000 --> 52:01.000
But, so we had the patent thing last week about the fact that Nintendo may be taking the disk drive out of their next console.

52:01.000 --> 52:06.000
And we see how fabulously those digital-only ideas worked for Microsoft.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.000
But, Nintendo is able to get away with some things that Microsoft cannot.

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
Nintendo has more fanboys than Microsoft when it comes to gaming.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I believe that to be true.

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
I know some will staunchly disagree with me on that.

52:17.000 --> 52:23.000
But I believe there are more passionate Nintendo fanboys than there are Microsoft fanboys for the simple reason,

52:23.000 --> 52:29.000
nobody that is 30 plus grew up playing Xbox.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Microsoft was a late bloomer into the scene.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Nintendo was around in the 80s.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
Microsoft wasn't in the gaming scene in the 80s.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
Big difference.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
You would be surprised how much clout that has.

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
Anyway, but that's not what I wanted to talk about again this week.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.000
I want to talk about some new patents that showed up.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.000
But again, remember, take it with a huge grain of salt.

52:48.000 --> 52:51.000
This stuff can sometimes just be full of crap.

52:51.000 --> 52:55.000
This is about achievement sharing.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.000
Some type of patent they have filed for achievement sharing.

52:58.000 --> 53:03.000
It lets you record moments before you receive an achievement,

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
and then share the footage with other users,

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
and attach a message like Miiverse.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
Now, so far on the Wii U, there's no achievement system,

53:11.000 --> 53:15.000
but of course on the 360, the Xbox One, PS3, or PS4, you do have that.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
I thought Xbox One had this already.

53:17.000 --> 53:23.000
It records in certain circumstances, and you can share achievements, but it doesn't...

53:23.000 --> 53:26.000
I thought that was one of the whole things with the screenshot thing.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
I thought that was...

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
PlayStation 4 does that now.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
In a firmware update, it takes a screenshot when you get the trophy.

53:32.000 --> 53:36.000
But it's kind of what Nintendo might be doing with this patent,

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
is it's taking an idea that people are already doing.

53:39.000 --> 53:44.000
And that is, when I get an achievement, I'm likely to hit the share button,

53:44.000 --> 53:47.000
clip the video of me getting that moment, and then uploading the video.

53:47.000 --> 53:52.000
And how can you patent that if it's an idea someone has already had and done?

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
Because if it's all streamlined, that's the difference.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
That's lame.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
Well, but patent law in this country in general is a goddamn mess.

54:01.000 --> 54:02.000
It is lame, yes.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
And we've talked about that way too many times on this show.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
That's not the...

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
So it looks like some type of achievement system very likely for the next Nintendo.

54:09.000 --> 54:13.000
It'd be cool if it's like Mario Kart 8 stuff,

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
where you have the little highlight video or something like that.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
That'd be kind of neat.

54:17.000 --> 54:18.000
Yeah.

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Nasin Games in chat says,

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
Xbox One can record certain good moments, but not all achievement-earning moments.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.000
Let's see.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Also, Nintendo has filed some other patents.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
And yeah, this is where I don't understand,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
because some of the other consoles do have this,

54:34.000 --> 54:37.000
but I'm just going to say what we're reading out there on the internet.

54:37.000 --> 54:41.000
And, you know, as oftentimes goes with this legal stuff,

54:41.000 --> 54:45.000
most people, like us, don't know what they're talking about with a lot of this legal stuff.

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
But it's still interesting and gives us clues as to what could be in the next Nintendo console.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
So I guess there's going to be some type of in-game chat.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
A monitor for displaying a game image or a television program,

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
and a terminal device having a camera, a microphone, and a loudspeaker.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.000
When a user's playing a game or viewing a television program by using the monitor,

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
another user can have chat by using the terminal device.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
So that kind of makes me sound like,

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
that's what I said should have been in Virtual Console a long time ago.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.000
When you're playing Virtual Console on the TV,

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
what if you're playing two-player mode with,

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
let's say I'm going to play Mario Brothers.

55:22.000 --> 55:27.000
I'm going to be Mario, and my buddy Ranma in New York City is going to be Luigi, as he often is.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
So we're going to play Super Mario Brothers.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
Well, we'll play Super Mario Brothers on the TV,

55:31.000 --> 55:34.000
but then we can chat with each other on the gamepad.

55:34.000 --> 55:38.000
I don't understand why that's not a thing in Virtual Console today.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
I'm assuming the system isn't powerful enough.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
That won't be an excuse the time the next console comes around.

55:42.000 --> 55:46.000
So maybe, I'm certainly jumping to conclusions, tinfoil-hatting a little bit,

55:46.000 --> 55:50.000
but maybe finally that thing I thought would have been inherent to the Wii U

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
that's going to be a part of Nintendo's successor console.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
It's not powerful enough to handle chat? Really?

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
Video chat while you're doing a 30-year-old game? Apparently not.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
Well, I don't know about video chat, but like, I don't know, audio?

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
You would think. You would think.

56:03.000 --> 56:10.000
And then also, let's see, multiple operating modes depending on the amount of power the user wants to use.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
A full power mode, an eco-friendly mode, and a very low power mode that disables network features.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
It communicates with an external apparatus via a network.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
The information processing system is capable of operating in three operation modes.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.000
A first mode, a second mode, which consumes less power,

56:24.000 --> 56:27.000
and a third mode, which consumes less power than the second mode,

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
and where the communication via the network is not performed.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Hmm. Very interesting.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
I don't know. That seems like, once again, it's...

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
Whatever. I mean, that's fine.

56:37.000 --> 56:43.000
I understand that people still dog Nintendo about, like, being, having their consoles be green stuff,

56:43.000 --> 56:46.000
but that's like, I don't think that anybody out there is just like,

56:46.000 --> 56:51.000
yeah, I can't really buy, you know, Wii U because it's just not green enough for me.

56:51.000 --> 56:56.000
I mean, is there seriously some hipster out there that actually does that?

56:56.000 --> 57:01.000
I mean, I just don't understand why invest in this.

57:02.000 --> 57:05.000
Go to our chat room for some more comments at live.vognetwork.com.

57:05.000 --> 57:08.000
Kaijudo says, wait, they showed the new Nintendo? I gots to see this.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
No, no, no, no. These are just some patents that are out,

57:11.000 --> 57:17.000
and a lot of people on the internet this week, including us, reading into these probably a little too much, however.

57:17.000 --> 57:21.000
You know, because sometimes patents are filed just to protect ideas and protect patent trolls,

57:21.000 --> 57:25.000
but sometimes you get things in here that come to reality.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
How about just figure out a way to get third-party support for your system

57:28.000 --> 57:32.000
and making sure that it can stay competitive with your competition out there?

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
How about concentrating that instead of fucking a low-power mode in a lower-power mode?

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
I mean, that doesn't... You're spending the resources on the wrong thing.

57:40.000 --> 57:46.000
Well, I don't necessarily think that's true. But anyway, because you don't know what it's doing in those modes.

57:46.000 --> 57:55.000
You know, the department that figures that out is completely different from the department that massages third-party companies and gets them on board.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
Yeah, but you know what gets them on board is having similar specs to the competition,

57:58.000 --> 58:03.000
when they're like, eh, fuck it, we can have specs from last generation, and it's fine.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
Hold on. Let me read this other comment here.

58:05.000 --> 58:13.000
NASA Games and Chat says, I think it might be a concern about Nintendo being such a family-friendly system, but that's just me.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
Fine. Don't video chat with strangers.

58:15.000 --> 58:21.000
Don't allow the video chat thing for people that aren't on your friends list where you have added them and they have added you.

58:21.000 --> 58:30.000
But if, you know, if I have a friend and we consensually agree we're going to wave our dicks around on video chat while we play Duck Hunt, then whatever.

58:30.000 --> 58:36.000
You could do that playing with Skype today. I mean, the technology's out there if people want to be perverts.

58:36.000 --> 58:40.000
Here's the sex gets into everything. Everything.

58:40.000 --> 58:43.000
Here is the problem with the family-friendly system thing.

58:43.000 --> 58:51.000
You're assuming that parents listen to the companies that are making these devices and informing them on this stuff.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.000
True.

58:52.000 --> 58:56.000
Who did they listen to when the device gets purchased?

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Who gets listened to?

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
The kid.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
It's bitching about not having Grand Theft Auto 5.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
I'm going to die if I don't have one.

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
They're going to buy the system that has fucking Grand Theft Auto 5 or the next Call of Duty because that's what little Johnny wants.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
It's not because it's family-friendly bullshit.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.000
They're going to be like, I don't know what system to buy, but he wants Call of Duty.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Does this play Call of Duty?

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
No, but it plays Mario.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Well, he wants Call of Duty, so I'm going to pick up that one.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
The PlayStation 4, the Xbox One.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
I'm going to pick up that one.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
That is what sells the fucking systems.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.000
Catering the family-friendly, I understand there's some families out there that want to spend their money on this type of thing.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
It's not working for you.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
You need to get out of that.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
That was the whole problem with the GameCube and the Wii.

59:36.000 --> 59:41.000
It's like it was pegged as family-friendly so it couldn't break into that part of the market.

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Get over that.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
Make your system friendly for everyone.

59:46.000 --> 59:54.000
I think that there's enough stuff out there, enough measures where people can make it family-friendly for their kids, but they're not going to do it anyway.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
So who cares?

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
Alright, let's move on.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
We've got plenty of other gaming news.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
See, you think when there's only two of us here it's going to be a short show and then look at it.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
We're an hour and fifteen minutes in.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
It's not because of Nintendo, it's because they're stupid and some of their ideals.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I just don't get it.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Admit it, you want the Wii U Mario Maker console.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I saw you tweet about it.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I can't afford it, but I would love to play Mario Maker because that looks like fun.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
But I'm not going to buy it because it's Nintendo or it's family-friendly.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I'm buying it because Mario Maker looks fun.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.000
If Mario Maker was on Steam, I'd buy it on Steam.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Simple as that.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Moving on.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Alright, so Mighty No. 9.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Of course, remember, it's not coming out this year.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
It was supposed to be coming out next month, but eh, delays.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:51.000
So with that though, they're going to be putting out an exclusive trial that's going to run from September 15th for a full month on PC.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
You'll have access to four levels, one of which hasn't been playable before, and six challenge modes.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Yeah, so they're basically saying that all relevant cutscenes are included since the single player is basically done.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
And yeah, so you'll get to check it out.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And then also of course, backers will get Mighty Gunvolt on Steam as well.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Well good. I know a lot of people were very upset with the whole delays and the fact that people are playing Mighty No. 9, but not them.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Because there was no trial or anything like that out there, so I'm glad that they decided to put out whatever demo they're taking to trade shows and put it out there for their backers.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
That's nice.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
That's good.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I'd like to play the game at some point and check it out.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I did not back the game, so I have to wait, but I'm excited to give it a try.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I will say this, maybe this was an unintended perk of the Mega Man Legacy Collection, but it's making me more excited for these types of games again.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
And I want to check out Mighty No. 9.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Yeah, so I don't know. It looks pretty cool.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Yeah.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Alright, well moving on. This is kind of interesting with impacts and so forth.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Shenmue 3, apparently, having an impact on the sales of a particular gaming console, but it's not the PlayStation 4.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
You think people would be excited about Shenmue 3 and maybe making the plunge and getting a PlayStation 4, but the actual effect it's having?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Dreamcast sales are going up.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Alright, now hold on. At least that's the headline that's running around the internet right now.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
But there are some, like, way hold on.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Double their sales! Two consoles have been sold!

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Yeah, two consoles have been sold instead of one.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
It's according to one indie game shop.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:47.000
So, even though you're seeing this headline everywhere on the internet right now, it's based off of one retailer in an interview with MVC that they were able to move 20 Dreamcast units in one week, and that's because of the success of Shenmue 3's Kickstarter.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Now let me ask you this, Loki.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Were there any new Dreamcast exploits discovered this week?

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Like, are people getting things running on it now that weren't running on it before?

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Or is it really Shenmue hype? Or is there something people don't know about that's really moving these units?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I don't know. Maybe they just realized how awesome a Dreamcast is, but I don't think it's necessarily Shenmue.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I mean, if you're hyped about Shenmue 3 right now, then you've probably played the other two.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Like, I've never played the other two. I'm not hyped about Shenmue 3.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I'm certainly not going to go buy a Dreamcast to play those.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I own a Dreamcast, and I'm certainly not going to go try to find Shenmue 1 and 2.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
Did they even make Shenmue 2 on the Dreamcast, or is that just on Xbox?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Um, oh god, it's been forever. I had only seen it on Xbox, so I don't remember.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Whatever. It doesn't matter, so...

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
SG100Matt says Xbox only.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Okay, so I doubt that's the case. And why is this guy sitting on 20 Dreamcasts anyways?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
He's probably glad to get that shit off the shelf.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And why is that news? That is not fucking news.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
That's because gaming journalism, copy-paste, headline-headline,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Shenmue moves Dreamcast consoles in one shop.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
20 of them.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Uh, let's see. You know what? Let's get, like, all five of our listeners to go buy Atari 2600s this week.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:22.000
And we'll run a headline that says Atari 2600 sales have spiked because of OLR.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Naming it the console of the millennia. I don't know what it is.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
But we'll sell five more, and then it's going to be a headline on Kotaku tomorrow.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
How about we just tell our listeners not to buy Metal Gear Solid 5,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000
and just say because of Konami sucking, Metal Gear Solid 5 is going to tank. I don't know.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Act F says, Sky, but I already have an Atari 2600. Buy another one.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Buy two.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.000
The one you have will break soon enough. Dungeon Buster says Sears would be proud.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Yes, we felt bad for Sears this week, so we're encouraging sales of the Atari 2600.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I did want to kind of get a Nintendo, but I don't know, like,

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I think I'd probably have to get those, like, knockoff Nintendo systems that actually have HDMI out and stuff like that,

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
because it's just going to be too hard to get it to run on my TV.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Akuma JP in our chat saying, over in Japan, where he's at,

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I must say the Dreamcast is selling in second-hand shops here. Price is 200% now.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
So maybe this is an international phenomenon.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I don't know.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
But see, in Japan, they all said they have Hello Kitty Dreamcasts in Japan.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
So, I mean, I want to get one of those.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
It just doesn't, just because you interview one shop doesn't make it a thing.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.000
It's just...

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Hmm. You know what they say. But, yeah, whatever.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
All right, let's move on with another story, Logie.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase search.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000
So I don't know if this is good news or bad news, but Mega64 is going to be developing games now.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:02.000
You may remember them from, you know, acting like asses on YouTube and doing silly videos,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
but, yes, now they're going to be making video games.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
I don't know if this means that they're going to actually make, like, a Mega64 game,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
if this is going to be kind of similar to, like, the Penny Arcade games.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Don't know. But, yay, someone else making games.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
This just in, though, anybody can really make games, and the tools out there are free to get.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
So, yeah.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
But, hey, Mega64.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Um, congrats on them doing, you know, going from, you know, indie production stuff to some of this really, really big stuff.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
I think that's really cool.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I mean, I don't know. I hope their game's good.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
We'll see.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
We'll see.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000
All right. I'm just looking at some of the comments in chat.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
sj100matt says, do they still do their silly video shtick? I haven't watched them in years.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Yeah, they still do their silly video shtick.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I don't even know if I should tell this story. I'm going to get myself in trouble, but whatever.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Nobody listens to this show. It won't be a problem.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
So, I am not familiar with these guys' things at all.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Save that one Nintendo thing that they did.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
They did, like, a Nintendo announcement video a couple years ago.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Yeah, the Reggie one, where he was, like, a robot.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Okay. So, I was with a friend at E3, and I think this was the major year, like, the 2006 year.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
The Paris Hilton year and the Wii year and all that stuff.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000
And my friend, like, totally recognized these guys and was, like, fanboying out a little bit.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Was like, hey, and introduced himself.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
And then, you know, the guys were like, oh, hey.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.000
And then I was like, hi there. I'm Rob.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
And, you know, and I didn't know who they were.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
And I was kind of like, and you are?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
And, like, dude was, like, super offended that I didn't know who they were.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
And I was kind of like, oh, sorry.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Oh, you're an asshole.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I didn't know if you're in the big leagues.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And, you know, to be fair, E3 is a very stressful time.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
There's a lot of stuff going on.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
You don't know if I caught the guy on a bad day, whatever.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
But I just was kind of like, oh, not everybody has humility in this industry.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
I didn't notice your panties bunched up over there.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
So, that was, now, just unfortunately, now it's just everything I associate.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
When I hear about them, I'm like, oh, yeah, that's the guy that was super offended.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I didn't know who he was.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Yeah, I know who you are. I just don't give a shit.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Was I supposed to be...

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
You know, again, I'm not trying...

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Yeah, let me get down on one knee for you.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I'm not trying to, look, I'm not trying to start shit.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
It might have just been a bad time.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Maybe I misinterpreted something. I don't know. Whatever.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Shit happens.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000
No, I'm not going to offend the female gender now.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I'm going to just stop.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I'll leave that internal thought there.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
All right, please don't offend people.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
All right, let's move on.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Let's talk about something that's super not offensive.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
How could you possibly be offended by free things?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Wait, Yaris was pretty offensive, actually.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Well, this is a lot better than Yaris, believe me.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
The announcement came out of PAX this week.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
You know, ArenaNet always seems to show up at PAX and do some different panels and so forth.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And they actually announced today, or I'm sorry, yesterday, Saturday,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
that Guild Wars 2 is now free to download.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Guild Wars 2...

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000
See, usually when an MMO goes what they call free to play,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
it's because that MMO is charging a monthly fee,

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
and now they are no longer charging such fee.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
But Guild Wars' model has always been,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
oh, you buy the box game, and then you get to play online.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
There's no monthly fee to play.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
That's the way it should be.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Yeah, well, but here's the thing now.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
With the original Guild Wars 2, you don't even have to buy the box.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
You can just go download it and play for free.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Why on earth would they do this?

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Well, President Mike O'Brien said in the press release,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
in making Guild Wars 2 free,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000
we're not switching business models to a traditional free to play game,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
and we're not aggressively monetizing free players through microtransactions.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
We're making the base game free because we're confident

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
that anyone who loves Guild Wars 2 will consider buying Heart of Thorns,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
continuing their experience into the expansion and beyond

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
with Living World and our newly announced raids.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
We believe that if people love Guild Wars 2,

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
they're going to buy the expansion pack.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000
There you go.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Very interesting.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
So they're giving away the base game to try and drive sales of the expansion pack.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
That's pretty cool.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Now, it should be said, Guild Wars 2 does have microtransactions in it,

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
which has always been a little bit controversial

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000
because you are buying the box game and so forth,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000
and my understanding is the people that bought the boxed game

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
are going to get these different level perks,

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
and I don't know all the specifics.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
I haven't played Guild Wars 2 in a long time myself.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.000
But I did buy it a long time ago when it first came out.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
The boxed players that did pay the money for it are going to get some perks

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
that the free players aren't going to have.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
So the free players are still going to have some restrictions,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:57.000
but they're going to be able to level all the way to the cap in the first game

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
and pretty much do everything that you could do in the first game.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:03.000
It's just they might be limited on some of the cosmetic stuff and all that.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
So kind of neat.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
I think there will be a lot of people that are going to take advantage of that

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
and checking out Guild Wars.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Bonds006 says,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.000
LOL, I guess because Microsoft gave it to me for free.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
So maybe Guild Wars was already free in some bundles and so forth.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.000
ActDef says,

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
It's basically like when Team Fortress 2 went free.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Yeah, it sounds like it might be very similar.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
There you go.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I think there will be a lot of people wanting to check out Guild Wars 2.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
It's certainly not a bad MMO by any means.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I think this is pretty awesome.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I think there will be a lot of people checking this out.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Your move.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
Funny because I was referencing Hoard House earlier in the show,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.000
but I said that one thing they ought to do in World of Warcraft

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.000
is just make vanilla Warcraft free.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
They've got like five expansions to make money on to sell things out of the box.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Make basic Warcraft free.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
How do you make the first or second expansion free too?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Yeah, why not?

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
I don't understand why Warcraft doesn't go free under the same idea,

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
but who knows?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Because they've got that sweet movie cash coming.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Yeah, I guess that's true too.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
By the way, it's not on our show roll tonight,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
but did you see the whole leaked footage out of Russia?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I tried to watch the leaked footage.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
It was crap-tastic quality.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
It looks like they changed the trailer dramatically from what we saw at BlizzCon a year ago.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Because remember, I don't understand what's been taking so fucking long

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
for them to put out some footage for public consumption

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
because we saw a trailer for the movie in November of last year at BlizzCon.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
It looked fine to me. It looked better than fine. It looked great.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I guess maybe some of the effects might have been rough around the edges,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000
so they say. I didn't notice in the trailer.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Maybe they figure if they put it on YouTube, you're going to have people going frame by frame

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
that are very, very analytical or so forth,

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
but I think it's been far too long for them to not put something more hype out there.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
So it'll be interesting to see if this trailer leak forces their hand,

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
kind of like that Suicide Squad thing that came out of Comic-Con.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Remember Warner Brothers got all pissed?

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Somebody brought a camera out.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
You got your criminals for watching.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Oh my god, fucking babies.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:18.000
It's a fucking movie trailer. It got me hyped about your stupid movie.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
When it leaked out.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
You know what? People fucking leaked that shit out on purpose all the fucking time.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000
But you know what? Some movie studios don't act like little whiny bitches when that happens.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Honest to god, when I saw the Suicide Squad trailer, I was like,

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
this doesn't look as crappy as I was expecting.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And I think that's the way a lot of people reacted to it.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Will Smith is Will Smith. That's fine.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
This doesn't look as crappy as I thought it would.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I just don't understand why they were little whiny bitches about it.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Like fucking Ryan Reynolds and Fox and shit releasing the Deadpool stuff.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:53.000
They're like, hey, just understand it's going to take us some time to release the full thing.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
Glad you like the leaked trailer.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
But they weren't bitches about it.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000
I just don't understand. Warner Brothers, they have like some serious issues.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
SSG100Matt in our chatroom at live.voggenailware.com says,

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Loki is making up for lost rants from last week. Love it.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
You know, Alan was sitting on the couch last week because he actually had the night off.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
He actually had a couple rants in him about some other things.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000
But Loki, making up for lost time.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:20.000
I'm sorry. It's just like, I just don't get it.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000
It was like even, I'm not alone in this opinion.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
I mean, everybody seemed to be just like, what the fuck is your big deal?

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Like, who cares? A trailer leaked.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Ooh, it's not like a big secret. It's not like the movie leaked, okay?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
It's a fucking trailer.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
It's like, calm down.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000
and check out some things that will be coming soon to a gaming console near you.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
A lot sooner than the Warcraft movie, that's for sure.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Hello, it's the fourth quarter because fourth quarter always starts early.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
It's November to, or September to November.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
So, starting the fourth quarter off,

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4,

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Xbox 360, and Xbox One and PC.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Nobunaga's Ambitions, Sphere of Influence on PlayStation 4.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Also, getting a physical release, Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons on PlayStation 4.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Mad Max coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and on PC.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
It looks like also Brothers is going to be coming out on Xbox One as well.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000
Let's see here.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
And Company of Heroes, The British Forces,

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
looks like an expansion will be coming out on PC.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
All right.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Looking in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Alan, and Loki, since I know you didn't have a chance to listen to last week's show,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Alan is giving you a taste of what you missed last week.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Alan says,

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
I may have said BioWare got lost up its own ass

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
and referred to Konami as toilet clowns.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Oh, and I was going to mention also,

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Danganronpa, another episode, Ultra Despair Girls,

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
is going to be coming out on the Vita.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Yes, still Vita games coming out.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
See Alan's chat reminding us the contents of opinions of Alan Alchemy

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
are not those of vognetwork.com.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Well, that goes double for Loki, quite honestly.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
There it is.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
But they're probably right.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
All right.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Moving on.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Let's go to Japan and check out what's coming out there.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000
In Japan, Metal Gear Solid 5, the Phantom Pain, of course,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
making its way out there as well in Japan on September the 2nd.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
There's also a special headset coming out for that.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Just a cool little extra bundle thing if you want to check that out.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Metal Gear Solid 5 also released on the Xbox One

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
for ye few loyal Xbox One owners in Japan.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Nothing on the Wii U this week,

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
though we're creeping closer and closer to the Mario Maker release in Japan,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.000
just like we're getting here.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
On the PlayStation Vita on the 3rd of September,

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Infinite Stratos 2 Love and Purge comes out in Japan this week.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And lastly, on the 3DS this week,

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Lego Ninjago Shadow of Ronin is out this week in Japan.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Seems like a pretty slow week outside of...

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I think it's Ninjago is how they pronounce it.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000
Oh, Ninjago.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Pretty slow week in Japan this week outside of Metal Gear Solid,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
which I'm sure is just because that's such a huge release,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
there's not a lot standing in its way this week.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Going over to Europe, since Dark Sakura isn't here tonight,

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
I will try to catch up on what's happening in Europe.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Let's see, on the 4th of September,

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Broken Sword, The Serpent's Curse on Xbox One and PlayStation 4,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Nobunaga's Ambition, Spear of Influence on PC,

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
as well as PlayStation 3 and 4.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
And then on the 3rd of September,

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Company of Heroes 2, The British Forces making its way to the PC.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Alright, just another story here from Loki,

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Alright, so this is kind of cool.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I mean, I don't know, I thankfully have gotten myself out of the game on PC.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
But if you have a mobile device,

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
you'll be happy to know Clicker Heroes is coming to iOS and Android.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Yes, now it can take over your lives away from your computer as well.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
And I'm assuming it's also free to play.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
So go download it.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000
I'm a little worried about falling down the Clicker Heroes hole on iOS.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Like, my PC addiction is bad enough.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Did you know I actually bought rubies on PC?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
But there's good reason.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000
I felt that I played it enough that I really needed to support the developers.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
So I threw $10 at it.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
So there's that.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000
So I'm just worried about, do I really need to do that on the phone as well?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000
I don't know.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Alright.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Dark Sakura not here tonight, sadly.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
So that means, guess what, brace yourselves.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
I'm going to take the reins and cover the classic game of the week.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Every week, usually Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
and finds a game that she thinks,

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
hey, you brats should be playing this game this week.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.000
But since she's not here, mwahahaha,

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I am going to actually pick a game that I think you guys should consider playing this week.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
So the game that I have picked for the week this week

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.000
is one of those games that I'm kind of surprised we haven't done before

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.000
because it's been the subject of many an in-joke here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000
But it is one of my very favorite 80s arcade games.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000
This week I have picked Burger Time as the classic game of the week.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
That's right, Burger Time is the classic game of the week.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Some classic sounds there, all the little burger parts falling there all over the board.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Let's talk a little bit about Burger Time.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Burger Time was released by Data East in 1982

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.000
and it actually came out for the Deco cassette system.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
The original title of the game was Hamburger,

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:47.000
but the game name was changed in the US to Burger Time for whatever reason when the game came out.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Obviously what you do in Burger Time, you're running around this board

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
and the board changes depending on what stage you're on,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.000
and you're trying to make these different parts of a burger fall to the bottom of the screen.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
So you might have like a bun at the top and then like a lettuce and tomato and meat

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
and then a bottom bun thing, but you can cause these chain reactions.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.000
So if you drop the bun on the top, then it falls on the meat just below it,

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
the lettuce below that, and then it falls all the way to the bottom.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
That's how you can actually clear boards quickly.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000
But of course it's not just as simple as running over things and navigating the maze

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000
because you are being chased the entire time by baddies.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
There's of course a big egg that follows you that's Mr. Egg.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
You probably recognize that.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
There's also Mr. Hot Dog and Mr. Pickle.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000
I guess Mr. Hot Dog is very upset that you're choosing to eat hamburgers instead of hot dogs.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I don't know.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000
You may or may not know the main protagonist of the game is named Peter Pepper.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Peter Pepper is the guy that you actually control in the game,

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:53.000
and he can actually stun enemies by spraying, basically spraying them with pepper in the face.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Yes, early, early, early concept of pepper spray in 1982 to actually stun Mr. Hot Dog and Mr. Pickle.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
By the way, that's not the only way you can actually attack them.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000
If they're actually on a piece of the lettuce or bun or something as it's falling,

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
you can crush them that way as well.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
So that's kind of cool.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000
There's only six different mazes in the game.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:17.000
So if you actually beat all six, then obviously as happened in most 80s games,

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000
you go back to the beginning and everything gets a little bit harder and a little bit faster.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
And that's pretty much BurgerTime.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
I mean, it was from the 1980s, so it was a pretty simple concept.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:34.000
But it was really unique considering that this is, you know, 82 is still really early on.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:39.000
This is way before the NES is out, even though there was a version of this on the NES, by the way.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.000
And any of that stuff, it's still kind of a pretty complicated concept considering, you know,

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
things like Space Invaders and Pac-Man and so forth were really the big games of the time.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.000
So yeah, I liked BurgerTime because it was very different.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
And it was like, what the hell, this is a game where you're building burgers.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000
What the hell is this?

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So that's just kind of why I liked it.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And of course, you know I played this on the Commodore 64.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
You know I did.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
And I'm sure a lot of you guys played this on different places.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Not only was it on the Commodore 64, it was on the Apple II, TRY-2600, BBC Micro, ColecoVision.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
There's a DOS version of it.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:23.000
It was on Mattel's system, the MSX, the NES, and the TI-99-4A.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:27.000
There was also a deluxe version on the Nintendo Game Boy, which is BurgerTime Deluxe.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000
There's also a mobile phone version, and it's on Wii's Virtual Console.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I think it was one of those, you know how they released a few arcade games to Virtual Console?

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
I think BurgerTime was one of them.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Now there were some sequels and ports that came later.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
There was an arcade spinoff called Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I never played that one. I didn't realize it was a thing.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Also, Super BurgerTime, which I think I did play once.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
I think that showed up at California Extreme one year.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:57.000
Those are not wide releases, but Super BurgerTime has Peter Pepper Jr., and it's a two-player game.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
You can actually play two players at once.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.000
There was also a console sequel called Diner.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And that was when Intellivision was bought from Mattel by INTV Corp.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:16.000
And so they actually had a game called Diner where you kick balls of food so that they roll off platforms

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
and onto a large plate at the bottom of the screen.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Kind of neat.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000
By the way, this had nothing to do with the game Food Fight, which you might think is related, but it's not.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
I don't know if one inspired the other or what.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
You may have heard more recently of BurgerTime World Tour.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:37.000
BurgerTime World Tour was released for WiiWare as well as Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and Windows.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
That came out in 2011.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
That upgraded the concepts to 3D.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And so it came out on November 2nd on Xbox Live and November 15th on PlayStation Network.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000
And then WiiWare, I think, came the next year in 2012.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
However, this is interesting.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
It ended up getting delisted in 2014.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000
So it almost makes BurgerTime World Tour a classic as well because you can't get it anymore.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
I don't know if there was a license.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I don't know if MonkeyPaw Games lost the license or what have you.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000
They say that the Xbox Live version sold 8,000 units.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
That doesn't seem like a raving success.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000
It doesn't seem awful.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
But, hmm.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Anyhow, if you hope for a sequel to BurgerTime in the future, Data East went bankrupt in 2003.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:31.000
G-Mode bought most of Data East's intellectual properties, which include BurgerTime, Super BurgerTime, and Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.000
So if you want to see another BurgerTime game someday, you gotta hit up the folks over at G-Mode.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
There it is, your classic game of the week, BurgerTime!

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
Did you ever play BurgerTime, Loki?

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Yeah, all the time.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Yeah, that's a fun game, isn't it?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Yep.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000
Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
ActDef says, didn't the NES version of BurgerTime support the power pad?

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000
You're actually getting it confused with short order and egg-splode.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Short order, you built burgers as well, but it wasn't the puzzle element.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:14.000
It was more like Simon Says, where you would see the order and then you'd have to bounce around the pad to repeat the order, essentially.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.000
That was a little bit different.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000
It's kind of funny, though, that you thought that was similar.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.000
You don't get a lot of video games about building hamburgers.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Tigerclaw says, hamburger was the original name of the game, probably because it was such a common word that they couldn't trademark it.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000
And ActDef also expressing surprise that BurgerTime has never been a classic game of the week.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Well, it has now.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
There it is, your classic game of the week, BurgerTime.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:41.000
All right, with that, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.000
We've got plenty more show to come, including rapid fire news, your answers to the FUGL question of the week,

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:54.000
mailbag, which we actually have at least one email tonight, and, of course, your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000
Orange Lounge Radio, when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Live tonight, episode number 612 for August the 30th of 2015, already in progress.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:21.000
And as a reminder, we will not be here next week over Labor Day weekend, as I will be in Atlanta for DragonCon.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
And I hope to see many of you guys there.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:30.000
And for those that can't be there, you can still participate with the panels in the podcasting track that Bobby and I will be on through Alpha Geek Radio.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
So shout-out to them, and thanks for doing that.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:39.000
So many of our listeners who can't be there in person can actually tune in and hear some of those panels that Bobby and I will be participating on.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.000
And, you know, honestly, just all the great panels.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.000
We're going to be doing a lot of live shows this year. It seems like a lot of live podcasts.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000
I don't even know why we didn't think to bid to do it.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Well, probably the only one that could actually really do a show live is probably Bobby, because obviously you and Dark Soccer sadly aren't going to Atlanta.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000
But, yeah, maybe in a future year, we'll be able to make something like that happen.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Maybe not even if it's necessarily OLR live, just some type of maybe hodgepodge show between Bobby, OLR, pod culture or something, critical myth.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Orange Black Wolf culture myth.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:22.000
Orange Lounge is the new Black Wolf radio.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
Something like that. Maybe. Who knows?

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:32.000
All right. Well, while we brainstorm that over the next year, let's get back into some rapid-fire news. Low-key.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:39.000
So, hey, September is right around the corner, and with that, we've got some free games for you if you have Xbox Live Gold.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:48.000
So, for the month of September, you can look forward to, on Xbox One, the Dear God, and that's going to be available for the entire month of September.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Also, Tomb Raider Definitive Edition will be available from September 16th through October 15th, so that's not quite in September, but close enough.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Xbox 360, you'll be getting Battle Stations Pacific from the first half of September, and the second half, you'll be getting Crisis 3.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:14.000
So, yeah. And then also, How to Survive Storm Warning Edition is still available on Xbox One through the 15th, so go check it out.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
I tend to download all that stuff regardless.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
I always forget on Xbox. I'm pretty good about doing it on PlayStation, but I always forget about the Xbox Ones.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Yeah. Let's see. So, let's see here.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Then, of course, with that, PlayStation Plus.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:40.000
We'll be getting some new games, including which was chosen by the actual users of PlayStation Plus, which is Grow Home.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:46.000
They have the selection between three different titles in Grow Home 1, so that'll be coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:53.000
Also, for PlayStation 4, Super Time Force Ultra, Tesla Grad, and Xenodripper will be available.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000
Also, on PlayStation 3, Tesla Grad and Twisted Metal.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000
And then for the Vita, Xenodripper and La Mulana EX.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And because they weren't chosen to be free, Armello and Zombie Vikings will be 30% off for PlayStation Plus members for the first half of the month.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:19.000
And they're not doing that voting thing every month, they said. That's a lot of discounts, so they're not going to be doing that every month.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.000
That's too bad. I still think the free thing's kind of cool, though.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Yeah.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:30.000
And then, of course, a little bit more was shown off on Minecraft Story Mode.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000
And guess what? It's actually headed to Wii U. What? Minecraft on Wii U?

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000
But there's no actual Minecraft the game on Wii U.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
That's sad.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:44.000
You can get Minecraft knockoffs on Wii U, but no actual Minecraft the game.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Hey, if Minecraft Story Mode can run on Wii U, why can't Minecraft run?

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.000
That's a great question.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:56.000
If the Vita can run Minecraft, why can't the Wii U run Minecraft? I mean, come on.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Fantastic question.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I don't know. No idea what the answer to that is, it's just not worth it.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000
It's not worth it to develop for the amount of users on there.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:14.000
But yes, it'll be coming out on Wii U, and it's going to have unique control, of course, with the touchpad and everything.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.000
So, pretty cool.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:21.000
I'm not sure when that's going to be coming out, but hopefully later on you'll be able to check it out.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000
And then with that, Witcher 3 has sold a whole ton of copies.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:32.000
It's only been out for six weeks, but it's already sold six million copies, and that's without any DRM.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
So take note, everybody.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Nice. Wow, that's a great sales figure.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Yep, that's awesome.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
And that's even without factoring in, I guess.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:50.000
They were saying that the good old game's performance is up 68% over the same six month time period.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
And that's without even factoring in Witcher 3.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Interesting.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Pretty cool.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000
And last but not least...

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.000
I need to really sit down and spend more quality time with that game.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:05.000
It came out during a busy period, but now that I'm not sucked into Final Fantasy XIV as much as I used to,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
I've got some extra time to sit down and really play some of that, I think.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:17.000
And last but not least, Grand Theft Auto V's video editor is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One next month.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:22.000
Or I should say September. When in September? I'm not sure yet.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.000
But they're going to be adding that update, so you can check it out on there.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:34.000
I think it's also supposed to come out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 at some point, but that's a little later on.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:38.000
But pretty cool to see that the video mode's going to be coming out as well.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:43.000
I really need to go back and play more Grand Theft Auto V. I'm just so disappointed that they haven't released any story deals.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Me too.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Yes, absolutely. You need to do that.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
It's a great game, I don't understand why.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000
No, I know. There's lots of great games I miss out on because there's only 24 hours a day.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Anyhow, I've got some stories for you guys as well.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Not coming to the 360 and the PlayStation 3.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:06.000
I mean, you might be getting your Grand Theft Auto video editor, but you're not going to get Mortal Kombat X.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.000
That's right, Mortal Kombat X for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 has been officially cancelled by Warner Bros.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.000
In a statement they said, after months of development,

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:22.000
Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment has come to the regrettable conclusion that we cannot release Mortal Kombat X for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Please know our teams worked diligently to meet the quality standards set by the current-gen versions of the game.

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:32.000
We were not able to get the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions to the quality expected of a Mortal Kombat game,

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:36.000
and are very sorry for not being able to deliver the products as originally planned.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
You mean you're not going to release it like you did Batman?

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Maybe you joke about that, but maybe that sure taught them a lesson that it better be damn good.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:50.000
I honestly did. When they delayed it for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, I kind of figured it wasn't coming out.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Well, and my thought is, honestly, is that the adoption rate of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I think, has been a lot more than maybe we saw in the last generation of people adopting PlayStation 3 from PlayStation 2 and so forth.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:08.000
Maybe that's been a lot faster, that ratio, so maybe they don't really see the value input.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I mean, because let's be real, most people that were interested in that game just fucking bought a PlayStation 4 and bought it.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I'm sure there are some people that are upset that are still on the last-gen consoles, but the reality is those newer consoles are going to look more and more hopefully affordable.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:38.000
There hopefully will be a price drop coming again soon, and then you can pick up one of those consoles, and then the year-end edition of Mortal Kombat X will be out that includes all that DLC.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
That's the one I've been waiting for.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
You know which version of Mortal Kombat I've been waiting for?

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000
What's that?

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
PlayStation Plus Free Edition.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Well, didn't they give away Mortal Kombat 9?

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.000
No, they gave out Injustice, which I still haven't played.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
That's right. They did.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
So there it is. Tigerclaw saying the short answer to this, the 360 and the PS3 isn't powerful enough.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
It's interesting they didn't figure that out a lot sooner, though.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I think that, yeah, I just think that they focused on the next-gen version, or the current-gen versions, and just, I don't think that they were ever going to put it out on those platforms.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
And if they did, it would have looked like Mortal Kombat on the Game Boy.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:32.000
It shouldn't be a surprise. Look at all these other games that they had earmarked for, you know, current-gen, or last-gen that just didn't happen, like Mad Max, or Dying Light, or Mortal Kombat, or, I don't know, probably Just Cause 3 at one point.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000
You know, so it's, I'm kind of expecting it at this point.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:51.000
All right. Well, let's see. Moving on to another story here. This is interesting. There's a Mario Maker level that's out there, because, you know, Mario Maker is available for the press right now, and probably some early leaked copies as well.

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:58.000
And there's a Mario Maker level out there that is actually trolling people. This is the one that Jason was referencing in the intro of the show.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:08.000
It actually says on the level notes that it's an all-Amiibo costume level, basically, and it's even in the featured section of the user-created courses.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:14.000
But when you load up the level, Mario suddenly spawns on a conveyor belt, and the following thing happens.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:40.000
And the best part about that, though, is they have, like, a block at the end that's supposed to have a costume in there, but it spawns after you've already cleared the level, which I thought was funny.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:49.000
I thought that was funny as well. Yeah, I don't know. Some people are hearing a sound in the background that's, yeah, I don't know what that is. It's probably one of these other windows from one of these websites.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:57.000
I'm on making a sound in their ad or something, so I'll try to close these windows quickly. I don't know about that. Sorry, I'm hearing it too, but it's just a couple times.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.000
I thought it might have been the video for that level. We'll see.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Now, for these very naughty levels, Super Mario Maker is not going to have a filter, but there will be a report button in a statement by Nintendo.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:18.000
All players will be able to report any content they think is inappropriate by clicking a button in the game. The level will then be reviewed by Nintendo.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:31.000
So for all those of you that are getting ready to draw the giant penis and the giant boobs and butts in your Mario levels, watch out, because somebody's going to click the button and then Nintendo's going to shut you down.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:44.000
There it is. This is neat. Puzzle Quest. I kind of wondered what happened to that series. I knew they were doing stuff with Marvel, because they have the whole Marvel Puzzle Quest, but it's not going to end there.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:48.000
I guess they have Adventure Time. I didn't even know there was a Puzzle Quest Adventure Time.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:49.000
I remember hearing about that, yeah.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:56.000
D3Go is doing another Puzzle Quest game, and this one will be of great interest to at least one of our listeners.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I wonder if Ragenator's paying attention right now, because I think he's going to be into this, because in the next Puzzle Quest game, you will be doing Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:16.000
That's right. It's a Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest game. It's going to be free to play, and you can build up creatures, spells, and artifacts in the game, I imagine.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.000
It's probably going to play out a lot like the Marvel Puzzle Quest does, just with Magic the Gathering cards.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Another company that went from being a game publisher to mobile developer. Ironically enough, at the time when I was working at the game distributor, they actually were repped by...

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Well, the rep that was working for D3, he had actually worked for Konami at one time, too, so that was kind of funny. He repped for both.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000
It's a small industry.

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Small industry, yeah.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.000
You don't want to burn your bridges.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Except the credit for D3, they didn't act like complete assholes when they were exiting the market, whereas Konami, they're taking the extra step.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.000
All right, well, moving on to one more thing for me here, and this has to do with cover plates for the new 3DSs.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Sadly, it's not going to do us a lick of good here in the States, because we don't have the new 3DSs with interchangeable faceplates, because we only got the new 3DS XLs.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:22.000
But for those countries that have the tinier ones, namely Europe, there are some new cover plates coming out on November 27th.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:28.000
There is a cool little Yoshi one, with like a green and blue and yellow and pink Yoshi, you know, being all cute and Yoshi.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:34.000
But most importantly, a Hello Kitty faceplate coming out on November 27th.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:40.000
And this just makes me even more angry we don't have this here. No, I'm just kidding. I didn't even really want a new 3DS anyway.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.000
What's the reason for me to get a new 3DS? I still don't understand.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:44.000
It's new.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.000
Oh. Oh! Oh!

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Because it'll play those games that the 3DS-

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Wait, all two games? One game? Xenoblade, that's already on the Wii anyway.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:59.000
That's what they're going to name the system. It's going to be the new Wii U.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000
The new Wii U.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
It'll play all the Wii U games, but it's going to be more powerful.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.000
For a whole new Wii U.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:06.000
A whole new Wii U.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Yes, alright.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week. Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Yes, there's still people on Google Plus.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:24.000
So we go to Facebook and Google Plus, you slam them together and you get foogle!

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:39.000
You know, a lot of people this week talking about the Shovel Knight amiibo, and understandably so.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:50.000
It's pretty cool to see Nintendo embracing an indie game like that and putting it right alongside their flagship characters in a way, even if it's being handled a little bit differently.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:58.000
So this week we thought, you know, I don't want to ask about amiibo specifically, because I know some people are like, I'm not going to get any amiibo, screw those things.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Right, Logie?

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
But I did want to talk about collectibles in general.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:11.000
With the Shovel Knight thing coming out, you know, that's a pretty, I don't want to say obscure, but it's certainly not a video game collectible I don't think anyone was expecting to be able to get.

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:22.000
So I wanted to ask the listeners this week, what video game character that doesn't yet have a physical toy or collectible available, would you like to buy a collectible for?

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:33.000
So let's get to some of the answers. We'll actually start with Google Plus tonight, and we'll say Retertainment starting us off, saying Henry Rollins was in Def Jam Fight for New York.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:36.000
Where's my Henry Rollins action figure?

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:43.000
I would actually think Henry Rollins has a brand strong enough where he would have a doll or something, but maybe not.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.000
I could support that. I could support a Henry Rollins action figure.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:53.000
ActDeft in our chatroom says, well, I already have a Shovel Knight plush, and I'm definitely getting the amiibo, so I'm happy so far.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:00.000
But if there's a character I would like to have a collectible of, a character that hasn't gotten one yet, is TheWonderful101.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Seriously, figures or amiibo of those guys would be awesome.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:13.000
That was a really hyped Wii U game that, you know, I don't know if it met sales expectations or whatever because you haven't heard a lot about it since then, but I know there's a lot of hardcore fans of that game.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:20.000
That would make sense. That would make sense also as a character in Smash Brothers, but we'll see.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Brozime says, Sarah Bella from Skullgirls. Her design is too cool to not have an amiibo style figure.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Actually, on second thought, pretty much all of the Skullgirls need figures. That art is outstanding.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:38.000
That's a good thought there. So, the Skullgirls there.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Let's go over to Facebook where we have some different answers.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, where Fabrice A says, the car from Daytona USA is just so iconic to me.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I want one of those. Oh, and maybe Oppa Oppa. Those are some good answers, vehicles, as why not?

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
I bet Oppa Oppa probably has a figure.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.000
You would think there would be something. Sega really thrives on that nostalgia, but it's probably only in Japan.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
And Fabrice I know is in Belgium, so if he wants an Oppa Oppa, he's probably going to have to import it.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Silent Tom replied and said, I would love to have a wolf link in wolf form from the Twilight Princess amiibo.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000
And, of course, a Tingle amiibo.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
And there is an Oppa Oppa figure.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.000
Is there?

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Yep, it's on Playasia.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:24.000
There you go.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.000
You can't buy it anymore, though.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Anyway, Tom finishes here saying, that would make the world a better place.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.000
If I can't get Loki in a Tingle costume, this is the next best thing, a Tingle amiibo.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:40.000
There was some guy that dressed up as Tingle. I saw the pictures from PAX.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Oh good, and I don't have to do it.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Andy R. said, for the longest time I really wanted the Edelweiss tank from Valkyria Chronicles.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Someone finally made a model kit, so I guess I already got what I wanted.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
Now I just want the time to paint and assemble it.

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Degenerajani says, I'm afraid I must live up to my name and say that I would push a bitch down the stairs for the great mighty poo toy.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.000
What would make that toy better is if it would sing the great mighty poo song.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
William Murderface says, my joke answer is Isaac from the Binding of Isaac.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:22.000
I love that William Murderface answered after the guy that wants the great mighty poo and said this is my joke answer.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:23.000
No.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.000
My serious answer is Sora, Riku, and Kairi from Kingdom Hearts.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:42.000
I will say as far as figures go, the only time I ever saw something Kingdom Hearts related in Disneyland, I saw a statue of Sora in the off the page store.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
And I really regret to this day not buying it.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:52.000
But you know, I wasn't in, even though I was going to Disneyland a lot, I wasn't quite in the same financial place then as I am now.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.000
So I wish, really wish I would have picked that up, but I didn't.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:58.000
But I will say that there's at least like some statues and things like that.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:05.000
And I don't know if maybe Tokyo Sea or anything over in Japan might have a little more of a presence of those characters.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
But that's probably going to be your best luck.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:12.000
But I think, I bet you could find Kingdom Hearts stuff, just a lot of it's probably going to be imported from Japan.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:21.000
And lastly, Justin H says, Fallout 3 vault dweller in any power armor, though the Tesla armor would be the best.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:31.000
So some Fallout love there. I wonder if he's ordered the special Fallout 4 edition with the whole thing that you strap on your arm.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:35.000
You can put your phone in. That'll look crazy.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:41.000
What do they call that thing in Fallout I can't remember all of a sudden? The electronic device.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
It's like your second screen. That's it, the Pip-Boy limited edition thing.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Alright, that's it for our Frugal Question of the Week.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Alright, Act Def saying that there are figures for Sora and Riku. There are play arts figures.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Not sure about Kairi though. That's right, I forgot about the play arts figures. So check that out.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:18.000
I saw a fan made one, but I want a Lego set for the Metal Slug.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:28.000
And then I also want a figure for Sofia the Third and Bionic Commando. Not the shitty hot dog arms Bionic Commando.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.000
I'm talking about the old Bionic Commando.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:38.000
I want the Guardian from the Guardian Legend because maybe this would encourage there to be a new Guardian Legend game.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I think that would be the best thing ever.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:47.000
Outside of that I would want Sofia the vehicle from Blaster Master since somebody brought up vehicles earlier.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.000
That would be amazing. Or actually I want to say there might actually be Blaster Master stuff out there.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000
I actually think there was a Sofia something something like a long time ago.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:57.000
There is and I looked.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:58.000
Did you really?

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000
Yep.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000
And then lastly my third answer would be a number muncher.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000
I'm really throwing it old school. And some troggles while we're at it.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000
I want a number muncher and some troggles and then I can actually put them on a board with numbers on it.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
Come on. You don't want to see that.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:18.000
There it is our Fugu question of the week. Let's get back into some more gaming news.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:22.000
We will be opening up the Skype line later. 1877 Game OLR.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:26.000
I'm not sure you're aware, but they do have number munchers.

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:29.000
You can purchase that for on the iTunes store.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Wait wait wait wait. Number munchers on the iTunes store? What?

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Yeah the iOS store. Yep they have number munchers.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Oh like the classic game like reimagined or whatever?

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Yeah like the classic game. I'm just trying to see some screenshots.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.000
That's kind of rad actually.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:52.000
I actually am just looking up Amazon.com right now and they actually have number munchers for PC and Mac.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.000
But this looks old. This looks old.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
Yeah you're going to run on your PC.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Or it's going to run super speed where the troggles just fly around the board and fuck you up before you can figure out which of the numbers on the board are multiples of seven.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:13.000
It's the worst stage. Multiples of two, three. I can handle that. Multiples of seven? Fuck off.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.000
Yeah they have a picture of the new version. It's kind of, I don't know, different.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:27.000
I have to check that out. I'm really curious now. I had no idea. Of course though that's how they get us thirty-somethings.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.000
Hey guys remember when Math Blasters was awesome?

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.000
So yeah I got to look some of this stuff up. Meanwhile Logie's going to get into some news.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000
So other things you can spend your money on. It's DLC for certain games.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:47.000
In fact one game Galgun Double Piece which is out in Japan right now but not yet here.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Although they are supposed to be bringing it over here. You can actually get the DLC. It's the Pheromone Z DLC that allows you to zoom in and see through high school aged girls clothes for the low low price of ten thousand yen.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Which they say is about eighty-three dollars. Eighty-three dollars for DLC? That is a lot of money.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000
That is a lot of money for DLC. Way too much money for DLC.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:21.000
So Galgun is like an on rail shooter game. I played the one on Xbox 360 and it was just silly. I mean I don't know.

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:33.000
You have some gun that causes them to experience an ecstasy like state after seemingly orgasming. Thank you Japan.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:42.000
And then of course Galgun Double Piece is out in Japan right now on PlayStation 4 and Vita and is supposed to be coming out over here at some point.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:56.000
But yeah I don't know. That's weird. Also with that they're saying that that DLC not only does it allow you to see through their clothes but it makes all the girls flat chested or heavily endowed boob wise.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Lord. So that's special. But a hundred dollars? If Jamie were here and not at Weird Al I'm sure she would be saying something like this.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.000
That's not worth it for like that kind of money. That's just not worth it. That's too much money.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Maybe we'll get that included in the US. For that much money you could go see Real Boobs at a nearby juice bar. Right?

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Yeah.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:30.000
Alright. Moving on. I think this game is going to be a little more classy than this. Showing boobs and all that stuff.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.000
But no. This game looks like it's going to be pretty cool based on some of the previews we're seeing coming out of PAX.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:41.000
And it's Cliff Bleszinski's newest game. You know of course he was a big part of Unreal Tournament and Gears of War.

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:49.000
And you heard about Project Blue Streak previously. Well we finally figured out what that really is over the weekend.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:56.000
It is a game called Lawbreakers. It is what they are calling a futuristic first person arena shooter.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:03.000
And there's a couple trailers that came out of this. There was like a CGI trailer basically. And there was a gameplay trailer.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:13.000
And the reason why they call it Lawbreakers is because it sounds like there's this whole thing about mankind has been recovering from a gravity altering cataclysmic event.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:18.000
So what is the law you're breaking? The law of gravity. So interesting.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.000
So now there's two factions. A peacekeeping organization and a crime syndicate that are at war with each other.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.000
And I was watching a little bit of the gameplay videos. I'm sure many of you were. And it was definitely featuring a lot of different characters.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:35.000
And it did look really like fluid kind of combat. Like one of them was kind of like swinging, like grappling hook type of stuff.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:40.000
And another one would go into a mode where it was like you could kind of heat detect people that were nearby.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:46.000
So it seems really cool. I gotta say, I was reminded an awful lot of Overwatch.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Just with the whole different characterizations and like the super, the fact that everybody is very distinct.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Not that I'm saying the two games are the same because I think Overwatch definitely has a big Team Fortress feel to it with these characters.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Whereas this I think is probably going to be more of a melee kind of free for all sort of thing.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:05.000
But I'm very curious. I'm very curious to see where this goes. I don't play a lot of first person shooters.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:11.000
But I was interested in what I saw. So good luck to them as they continue development on Lawbreakers.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
I liked a lot of the characters I was seeing in that gameplay video. It looked pretty cool.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Alright. So this has been a while and I kind of forgot all about it.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:28.000
But apparently the whole Vita false advertisement settlement thing. They have a class action lawsuit.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:34.000
That is supposed to be paying out soon. And I guess they've been sending out emails.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:42.000
Now I remember it was, I guess they had a settlement site that went live in April and offered eligible Vita owners $25 in cash.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:48.000
$25 in Playstation store credit or three game bundles for Playstation 3 and the Vita.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:55.000
I think I picked the Playstation store credit. Although I haven't seen anything hit my email yet on that.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Oh yeah. Did I fill that out? Now I'm worried. Did I get in on that? I think I did.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Which begs the question, Red Bull. Where the fuck is my fucking vouchers for Red Bull?

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:13.000
That's right. You were all excited. Because it doesn't actually give you wings.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I'm not an idiot that thinks it's going to actually give me wings. But you promised me fucking $10 worth of Red Bull vouchers.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:26.000
And yes, I may have signed up myself and my other family members in my house even though they don't drink Red Bull.

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:32.000
So I expect at least one set of vouchers coming my way and I still haven't seen that. I'm very disappointed.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:41.000
I still can't believe they have to give away free product because they lied and the product does not actually give you wings.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I'm sorry. It's funny. People are dumb. People are super dumb.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Why am I not gifted the power of flight for $2.50? I don't understand.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Oh god. Alright.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Marijuana gets you high.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Well moving on. This is a very interesting contest coming out of Hasbro. It's called The Next Great Game.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:19.000
And even though this is a little more about board games, let's be real. A lot of board games and video games get tied together a lot.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000
A lot of great video games actually came from board games and a lot of great board games come from video game franchises.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Like I still kind of want that Mass Effect 3 risk set. Just saying.

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Anyway, so this is more about board games. But Hasbro, they put out a lot of huge, huge board games.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.000
So until September 30th, 2015, you can actually go to their website and submit an entry.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000
You know, what is The Next Great Board Game? It's nextgreatgamechallenge.com.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Now, they will announce five finalists on October 30th. But here's the kind of hilarious part.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:04.000
You don't get prize money if you're one of the five winners. You get to launch an Indiegogo campaign to raise funds for your concept.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:11.000
And I had the same reaction. I had the same reaction because I'm like, wait a minute.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Like, I would fucking need Hasbro to go launch my own Indiegogo concept. I mean, that's fucking stupid.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Here's the thing, and I had that same reaction at first, but then reading a little more into it, because I think Hasbro knew a lot of people would laugh at this.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Hasbro is promising to use its web presence to promote your project.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:39.000
So it's not, I mean, anybody can launch an Indiegogo, but to have Hasbro, a board game making company, actually promote that Indiegogo.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000
Okay, well that's something, I guess. It's a little more. It's more than nothing.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:49.000
But Hasbro and Indiegogo are apparently going to work with you to build the crowdfunding campaign page.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:55:00.000
It will end on December 1st, 2015, and then a team of Hasbro game developers will scrutinize all the finalists and announce one grand prize winner in late December.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:12.000
And if you get the top prize, then Hasbro gives you $10,000 in your pocket, flies you to Rhode Island sometime between December and January to actually turn your idea into a reality.

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:20.000
So it's kind of weird that the finalists all go to Indiegogo, and then Hasbro will kind of finally pick one and take it under its wings.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.000
But maybe they're trying to see how the public gauges the games. I don't know. Kind of weird.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:35.000
By the way, you may not know this, but Hasbro actually went to the public before. Everybody got to vote on a Monopoly board piece, right?

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
Or didn't we get to vote one off the island or something?

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
We were removing one.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:45.000
They removed one in favor of another. Was it the thimble that got the boot? I don't remember.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.000
The boot that got the boot?

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000
No, did the boot get the boot? I don't know. Somebody in the chat probably knows.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:57.000
And then there actually was a new word added to Scrabble's dictionary. I didn't even know about that.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:05.000
The contest website's terms of service says that you do retain your ownership of all the intellectual property rights in the submission, copyrights, trademarks, and patents.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:08.000
But we retain the rights to make a shitty movie sequel to it.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:15.000
That's right. Maybe that's what they get as a shitty movie sequel. I don't know.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Now I want to know what word they added to the Scrabble dictionary as a result of that.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Meatcrub.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000
I'm going to research that while you do the next story, Logie.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Alright. So unfortunately, even though they launched the sequel to Angry Birds, Rovio is still cutting jobs.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:50.000
And they had to cut their jobs by 260 employees. And they're saying now that that's the total layoffs now between, I guess now in October, it's about 40% of the staff that they had in October of last year.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:57.000
So, I don't know. That's kind of, that sucks, I guess.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:08.000
They're saying right now that they've laid off some people back in December. That was 110 employees.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:15.000
So far, I think grand total is just the 260 jobs total.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000
So, I don't know.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000
But I guess they're still not doing as great with Angry Birds 2.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:27.000
But aren't they supposed to be having a movie coming out soon or something like that? Like, I give a shit about that. I don't know.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:33.000
But I thought there was supposed to be an Angry Birds movie coming out soon. Within like a year or so.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Alright. To do the results of what I was looking at earlier, they did add a cat piece to Monopoly in 2013.

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:52.000
That was the one that was voted in. And what lost was the robot, the guitar, the helicopter, and the ring.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:58:00.000
Were the losing pieces. But it doesn't appear, oh no they did, they got rid of the iron. The iron got voted off the island in favor of a cat.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Yeah, the iron was kind of lame.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000
The iron was super lame.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.000
It was like an old school iron too. It's like, everyone's like, what the fuck is this?

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:15.000
However, I'm not able to find out what the word is that they added into Scrabble. Although, Cial says it was a bunch of texting shorthand.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
I thought it was just one word. I thought that was the deal. I don't know.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Nasongames is commenting on what you just talked about. Loki's saying, Rovio cutting jobs. I can't even say I feel bad about that.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Even King did layoffs.

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Yeah, actually they did add lots of words. Let's see here, this was actually earlier this year.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:50.000
So they added, let's see here, emoji, bezzy, wah.

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
That was a cool DDR song, wah.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:59.000
Well, it's W-H, W-A-H-H. Let's see here.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Alright, I'm over the Scrabble.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:04.000
I think that was something different because that was 6500 words.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:16.000
All of Scrabble is knowing those shitty little two letter words that you can just totally fuck somebody up by building one word off another word and then you make like two words out of it because you knew some two letter word and all that.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:22.000
That's all the strategy in Scrabble. If you don't know how to do that, you're not going to win against people who do.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Because that's how the points just start chaining.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:32.000
And then everybody likes to build an S on the end of your words and then again you get credit for two words.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.000
We're talking Scrabble strategy here on Orange Laundrio.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:42.000
ActDeft in chat says, wah. Warrior and Waluigi are on the Scrabble new words committee.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Wah.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
Ah, lord. Alright.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:53.000
Let's get to the mailbag. We invite emails from you guys every week to our mailbag.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Participate at Orangelaundrio.com is the place to send emails.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Let's go into the mailbag. We're going to dive in ahead first and pull out the emails that you guys have sent us this week.

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:13.000
Well, it's been pretty empty for the past couple of weeks, but thank god we're saved at this week with an email.

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:16.000
By the way, you've got to love the Dark Sakura last week.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Send us lots of emails. Send us tons of email. And then she doesn't come this week to read at all.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:28.000
But nobody listened to her anyway except one person. We didn't get one email this week, so thank you to Robert M. for sending this email.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:36.000
And I'm hoping that you guys will flood the mailbag over the next two weeks and make Dark Sakura work when she comes back in a couple weeks here on the show.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Alright, so anyway, here we go with Robert M.'s email tonight.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:44.000
It's been a very long time since Video Games Live performed here.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:55.000
And if one of my concerns was a lack of musical variety from the Legend of Zelda portion, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra will be performing the Symphony of the Goddesses concert around the weekend of Loki's birthday.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Did you know, by the way, Loki, Symphony of the Goddesses was in San Francisco last night?

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:00.000
No.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:03.000
No, I didn't know that either until I saw the pictures of my friends there on Facebook.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:04.000
I would have totally been able to go.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:05.000
I know!

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
I would have been able to totally go last night.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:08.000
I totally-

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
Because I have a family who I can't leave.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000
I would have been able to go, but I just had no idea that it was happening. Oh well.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
I missed out. What can I say?

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:21.000
Well, Robert M. continues on the Symphony of the Goddesses tour.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:28.000
I doubt I'll have the opportunity to see this one myself, but hopefully any other fans you have out here can report in.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000
Yeah, check those tour dates for Symphony of the Goddesses, because I just missed it in San Francisco.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:39.000
But that means it's probably- and if it's gonna be where Robert M. is around Loki's birthday, that's just in a couple weeks.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
So they must be touring right now, so check that out.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000
Robert M. continues with one more thing on the email.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:50.000
One thing I would like to check out, though, is the Mastermind Room Escape across from the Arch.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000
Have any of you tried out such puzzle rooms?

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000
And that is from Robert M.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Are you familiar, Loki, with the puzzle room thing?

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
This is some trend.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:04.000
I haven't heard of the puzzle room, but I've heard of Mastermind, or seen videos of it.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
I know what that is.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Isn't that the one where it's like trip lasers, basically, in a room, and you have to kind of step over them and stuff?

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.000
Well, I think depending on which one of these challenge rooms you go to, it's different.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Because I know they've done some in San Francisco.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
I have not been to one, but I've had friends that have gone, and from what I've-

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
I thought Mastermind was like- they had one in Santa Cruz.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:27.000
Maybe, I don't know. I mean, these could all be different things, too.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:34.000
But I think there's something- like, you get on a team of seven or eight people, and you're in a room, and you're essentially, quote-unquote, locked in the room.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Now, of course, if you-

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Live or die, make a choice.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:38.000
No, it's not that bad.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
It's like, aw, man, fell for this again.

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:48.000
If you can't figure it out in, like, 30 minutes, or whatever the time limit is, then they say, you lose, lol, and they unlock and let you out.

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:51.000
But I guess there's clues in the room on how to get out.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:54.000
So I don't know if there's, like, a combination. I don't know, because I haven't done one.

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.000
And most of my friends that have gone, they don't want to spoil it for other people.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:03.000
So they just post pictures with, like, t-shirts that say, we got out of the stupid room, or whatever it's called.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:08.000
So I don't- I have never done one myself, although I'm not opposed to doing it.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000
It's just that, you know, we don't really get them here in Sacramento.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
I'd have to go to San Francisco to do something like that.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000
And usually if I go to San Francisco, I'm not like, let me go get locked in a room today.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
There's usually other things I'm gonna do.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Trapped in the closet.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Anyway.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:26.000
Let's see.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.000
VidPower is suggesting in our chat room, for anyone going to a future Zelda concert, use the coupon code, HeyListen.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
Does that really work?

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:34.000
HeyListen, all one word in cats.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Who's getting the free kickbacks from that plug?

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.000
That's what I want to know. Are you getting the kickbacks, VidPower? I want to know.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.000
Alright.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Also, ActDeft reminding us that ActDeft actually wrote a review on our website a little while ago called the, I love that concert,

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
The Legend of Zelda Symphony of the Goddesses.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000
That's right, because they rolled through Mexico, and ActDeft actually went to that concert as well.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000
So that's cool.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:02.000
SSG100Matt mentions, I've done two of those Escape the Room games.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:05.000
It's a lot of fun depending on the group you're with.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
I imagine it's a lot like Benihana.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:08.000
You ever been to Benihana?

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000
I know you love Benihana.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.000
Oh yeah.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:11.000
Okay, right.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
And usually the experience-

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Ken, in one of those rooms, can I be locked in with a Benihana chef?

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:19.000
You know, where it's like, oh shit, I can't figure my way out, but at least I'm gonna enjoy some food.

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:23.000
I think there was one in Japantown in San Francisco next to Benihana.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.000
So you're getting close.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:25.000
That would motivate me.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
Oh man, that smells so good.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Gotta get out of this room.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Gotta claw your way out of the room.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Gotta get that karaoke.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Hulk smash.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:40.000
No, but I don't think they lock you in with Benihana, but they do lock you in.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
SSG100Matt says, they let you out.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
Oh, I was gonna say about the Benihana.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.000
That whole experience can be made or broken by who you're sitting with at the table.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Because sometimes you might get some pretty cool people.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Like one time grandpa and I went in Seattle and it was like a bunch of like younger, like 20-somethings.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
I think celebrating somebody just getting back from the military.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000
So they were all drinking and having fun.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.000
And you know, grandpa being grandpa was like, thank you for your service.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
And bought him a drink.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:06.000
And you know, all that stuff, right?

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
So we had a great time at that Benihana.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:14.000
But I've also been to Benihana when it's like, you got the family with their kids.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:18.000
And they're very like, just, you know, not that I have a problem with kids.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:24.000
But sometimes other people's kids, you know, can, you know, and they're just, it's out of control and that whole thing.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.000
And it's like, ugh, can I get any other table in the restaurant, right?

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
So I imagine the escape the room thing is a lot like that.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
It could really depend on who you're locked in that room with, right?

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Screaming baby in the room.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Yeah.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000
It's like, why?

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Why?

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.000
Why did you bring them in here?

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000
Why did you bring the baby to get locked in a room?

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
SSG100Matt says, they do let you out.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:44.000
Some of them stay in the room with you so you don't break anything.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Because people are dumb and try to break out the windows.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:52.000
People would be dumb, I can see that.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
NASA and games says there is one in SAC.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
I didn't know there was one in SAC.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Oh my God, wait, NASA and games.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Buddy, pal, Gabe, have you done the break out the room thing in SAC?

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Because if not, I'm thinking there's an OLR slash IGDA slash cool people trip in the works.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Doesn't that sound like fun?

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000
It's like silent hill the room minus the silent hill.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I like that idea.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Alright, NASA and games says sold now.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
I love that.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:28.000
Ragenator in chat says, can I be locked in one of those rooms with several hooters girls and playboy models please?

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:31.000
You pig.

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Alright, SSG100Matt further clarifying what the experience is like.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000
There are a bunch of clues and riddles that you have to follow too.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Some of the riddles involve finding a safe code with a black light on a certain page on a magazine that you find in another clue, etc.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:52.000
You can make an appointment with a group of friends, you don't always play with random people unless you want to.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Bonds006 says, to be locked in a room with Rob.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Okay, I'm not sure how to take that comment.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.000
I don't know if that was, I'm not sure how to take that.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.000
I'm not sure if I should be creeped out by that comment or if I should just say thank you.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I like to talk though, clearly.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:12.000
It's what I do for a living and it's what I do here on this podcast.

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:18.000
So you better be prepared for me to talk your ear off if you're going to get locked in one of these rooms with me.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Alright, there it is.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
That was our email there from Robert M.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
Thank you for sending that.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:28.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you'd like to send us an email for a future week.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:34.000
But in the meantime, it's time to get to the FUs of the week.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
We're going to get angsty here on the show.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Why?

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
Because it's tradition.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
It's tradition to get angry.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
Loki, since there's no Dark Soccer tonight, you can start us off.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:02.000
I guess a few to retail customer service maybe?

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:07.000
I mean, I don't know because like I've had an issue just today and it's really random.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Like I've had two accounts broken into by somebody.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:17.000
One in my Walmart.com account which I've used once and one on my GameStop account which I've never used online.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Except, you know, I have my power up rewards card or whatever.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:28.000
So I had some points stored there and I didn't even really know what those points are for.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Apparently they used some of them to purchase like a congregate card.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Something like that.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000
Probably to resell it and it's harder to trace.

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
It's just weird.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:44.000
You know, kind of looking into like that pwn.com or whatever like that.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Apparently my email's been associated with five websites that have been like, you know, had exploits done to them.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000
So I guess, I don't know.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:59.000
I don't remember what my passwords were on those sites but I changed them anyways.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
At least I changed the one on GameStop.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.000
But Walmart.com, they like fucking switched the email it's associated with.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
I mean, how is that even possible?

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.000
That's stupid.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
That is absolutely stupid that you can just say,

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.000
okay, this account right here is just going to be associated with another email called customer service.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:18.000
And they're like, well, I don't see it associated with this email.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
Like, yeah, no shit.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
And they're like, well, you can just create another one.

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
I'm like, well, what about billing information?

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Is that on there? Do you keep that stuff?

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:29.000
I don't know, maybe you should watch your bank account.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Thanks.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Call the bank for real.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Make sure, I mean, I'm sure you already have, but they're usually the ones that can fix all that stuff.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Well, nothing's been charged to my account.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Like I said, the only thing that the Walmart thing, I don't think I had any billing information there.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
We've only used it once to order something for my son last year.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:56.000
And then, you know, I have this stupid thing that you get points for or money for any price changes that happen.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
So, you know, that's tied to, I think, that account.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
So, I mean, they have like maybe 20 bucks.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.000
I don't even know how to redeem that shit, so good luck.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:09.000
But, yeah, the power of rewards thing, it's not like, oh shit, you know, it's more of like, this is annoying.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
I'm like, really? You bought this shit?

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.000
I mean, you could have bought like a gift card or something.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
At least if you're going to steal stuff, buy something nice.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
I hate stupid. It's like, whatever. Okay, cool.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I mean, you stole that.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:25.000
I mean, I'm not missing it, but it's just like, really?

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Well, I will give a related F.U.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:38.000
I'm going to give an F.U. to credit card thieves because I actually had my debit card was used at some random ass store in Indianapolis, I think, for like 70 cents.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.000
I think that was them just testing it to see if it would actually like take the money or not.

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:48.000
And then somebody at Chuck E. Cheese in Southern California ran up like 60, 70 bucks.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Thank God, I caught it like right away.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000
So I called the bank and they, you know, they did their thing, which is interesting.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
I've had the same bank since like college.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
So I've had a long time since my college.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.000
And by a long time, I mean three years.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
But, you know, I've had the same bank for a very long time.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
And this is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
So I was just kind of like surprised.

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:17.000
But thank God I've been checking my finance because everything I'm going through with the job switch and everything, I'm checking my finances pretty religiously.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
So I caught that early on.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000
So F.U. to credit card thieves.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
Yeah, and I'll be definitely watching my account.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.000
I mean, good luck.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.000
There's not any money in there, but I mean, sure.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:30.000
I mean, I don't think any credit card information, but it's like it was Adobe Boxy.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.000
Thank you, Boxy. Your thing's shit.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:39.000
And now that they've been exploited to Gawker, but Gawker didn't have anything.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I remember the other two.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:45.000
There's some other website I like forum that was on it, but they didn't have anything.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:51.000
And then I don't remember the last one, but I remember Adobe's on there, I think.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
I don't know.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
So I'm assuming that they just were testing.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
Maybe I use the same password on that site.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Who knows?

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:02.000
All right. Get your dialing fingers ready because we're going to open up the Skype line at one eight seven seven game oil.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio right after two more stories here.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000
And let's get to it.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Let's get to it, Loki.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.000
This is very exciting.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:16.000
So Lionsgate announced that they're going to be working on a Borderlands movie, and I totally can see that.

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.000
And I hope that actually comes out soon.

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:31.000
It's supposed to be, I guess, produced by Avi and Aria Arad, who did the Iron Man movies and Spider-Man and X-Men.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Oh, wow. Yeah, that's a lot.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:36.000
I mean, that should be pretty awesome.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:41.000
I don't know. There's been like, you know, Twitter has been like speculating on, you know, who could play some good roles.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:52.000
And one of the suggestions was, I can't remember his name, the guy from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia playing Handsome Jack.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Glenn Howerton, I think, playing Handsome Jack.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:59.000
And that would be awesome. I could totally see that.

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:06.000
I wonder, though, if it's going to be like an original story with like, original Vault Hunters, different Vault Hunters than the game and so forth.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Maybe. I mean, I think that'd be cool.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Either way, I'm totally down to see this.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, who should voice Claptrap?

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Just get the guy that does the voice for Claptrap right now.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Get the guy who does it now.

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
I think, yeah, why not?

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
It's iconic. You can't really change the voice.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:28.000
I mean, if you can't get the same person, Ellen McClain.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:32.000
No, that wouldn't work.

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
What can't she do?

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
I seriously think they should just get the same guy that does the voice of Claptrap.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.000
Yeah, I do.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:38.000
It's a robot.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
I think it should be the same person that it is today.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:51.000
I actually really hope they don't stunt cast that role, but you just, you can't help but have this sinking feeling that it'll be like Jack Black or something and you're just like, God damn it.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Stop it.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:57.000
No offense to Jack Black.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
No offense to Jack Black either.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Don't fucking voice Claptrap.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
He hasn't really been anything in a long time.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
He needs some work.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Alright.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Yeah, Tigerclaw is saying, the thing is, they would probably cast a name actor to voice Claptrap.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000
ActDef says, besides, Glados and Claptrap are romantically involved, it would be awkward.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Alright, fine.

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Alan Alchemy says, Gilbert Godfried as Claptrap.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:30.000
I could see that, but it's just not quite the same.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Oh my God. Alright.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:41.000
AP all day in our chatroom says, Howard Stern for Claptrap. I don't know about that.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:45.000
That doesn't strike me as the type of thing that Howard Stern would even do either.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000
He's not a silly robot.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:52.000
I was the judge on that NBC show. I never thought he'd do something like that, so who knows.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000
Who knows.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Brad from Pod Culture suggests, Peter Dinklage.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:00.000
Well, since they erased him from Destiny.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Boy, that was pretty cruel what they did to him there.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:05.000
Yeah, they pulled a total Kojima on him.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Didn't they? Boy, oh boy.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Or, how about our pals from last week?

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:17.000
How about Greg Berger or David Sobolove for the voice of Claptrap?

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Why not a shout out for those guys from last week?

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
I just think they should just have the voice that was in there.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.000
See, and that's the other thing, too.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
And here's the other thing, too, is like the new game for like, totally off topic here,

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:33.000
but the new game that they have coming out for Lego Avengers has different voices from the original.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.000
They're going to have the actual voices from the movie actors in there.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:40.000
I'm like, no. I like the voices in there.

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:44.000
They had fucking Troy Baker doing Loki. It was awesome.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
And I didn't even know it was him at first.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
And then, because we watched the movie that they have, too, the animated movie,

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
which I hope there is another animated movie that goes along with this one,

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:57.000
but they had him do the voice. I'm like, it was perfect.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Don't change anything. Leave it the same.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.000
All right, one more from our chat room where AP all day in our chat room says,

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:08.000
okay, okay, Morgan Freeman.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:11.000
Well, now, you know, as much as I want to tell you no,

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:15.000
Morgan Freeman really could just read the phone book, and I think I'd listen to that.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:21.000
So, you know, I'm going to be okay with that answer, Morgan Freeman, if not Betty White.

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:25.000
All right, one more story here about Castlevania.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:28.000
That's right. I got a story about something new in the Castlevania universe.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.000
I shudder to find out what this is.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:33.000
Yeah, sit down, because it's not a game.

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:36.000
But on the bright side, it's not a pachinko machine either.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:37.000
Oh, well, that's really...

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:45.000
And this is actually a team-up with Adi Shankar, who is behind Dread and Power Rangers.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:47.000
I did not realize he was the producer over there.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Announced on Facebook that he's going to make a super violent mini-series

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:58.000
based on Castlevania 3, Dracula's Curse, together with Fred Seibert and Kevin Klond.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Fred Seibert is already a big name in animated television, so that's pretty cool.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Shankar says it's going to be dark, satirical, and after a decade of propaganda,

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:10.000
will flip the vampire subgenre on its head.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.000
So I'm assuming that means F.U. Twilight, is what I'm reading into that?

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
When I hear a decade of propaganda and flipping...

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Well, everybody's been already saying F.U. Twilight, I mean, since Twilight came out.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Yeah, that's true.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:25.000
So, anyway, that's interesting.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000
That's going to be cool if they actually bring that to fruition.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.000
So, yeah, a Castlevania super violent mini-series.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
I'd be down with that. That's fine.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.000
It's not like Saturday morning cartoon material.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Like, I think, you know, back to, was it Captain Power?

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000
Well, yeah, there's a part of me that's like,

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
well, God, what TV network's going to want to air something like this?

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:52.000
But we live in a world now where you could shop this to Netflix, Hulu,

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
or some of those, like, what, Crunchyroll,

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:57.000
and some of those things that specialize in animated series.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Like, you know, that's the type of world we're in now,

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.000
where, you know, this series could find a home somewhere else

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
and be okay and make some money.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Yeah.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:08.000
So it doesn't even really necessarily have to be on TV.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:09.000
We'll see.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000
All right. We're going to open up the Skype line.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.000
It is time. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.000
OrangeLoungeRadio. That's all one word.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.000
Give us a call if you'd like to talk about anything we've talked about tonight

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
or perhaps something different.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Wow, it's lighting up already. Let's get to it.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.000
Geez, lots of people trying to get in.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000
Hey, this is Act Deaf.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Hey, buddy. Act Deaf. How you doing?

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.000
Pretty great since I got the first call.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:38.000
Congratulations. There's a lot of people trying to get in.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
You got lucky. What's up?

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Well, I could talk about a lot of things,

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:48.000
but you didn't talk about something, well, maybe not as big as other stories.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.000
But you remember the My Little Pony fighting game a few years back?

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000
Fighting is Magic.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:59.000
Yes, Fighting is Magic because they kind of got shut down,

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:02.000
but then they were going to get teamed up with somebody else.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000
It was kind of like an interesting resolution.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:08.000
It wasn't just a cease and desist. It was more one of those,

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.000
well, we've got to shut you down, but we'll work with you type of things, right?

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Yeah, basically they got shut down by Hasbro.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
They got a C&D.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:22.000
But eventually the creator of Friendship is Magic teamed up with them

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:27.000
to make a new game, at least a new sign and new characters and all that stuff.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:33.000
And after years of working on it and getting the schoolgirl's engine,

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:38.000
they're finally going to launch their fundraising campaign.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Oh, so they're still going to go to Kickstarter or one of those places

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.000
to actually fund, I'm assuming, the distribution for the game?

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Yeah, basically.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
Does the game have a name?

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Yeah, they announced the name and the Kickstarter campaign a few days back.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:58.000
The name is going to be Dem's Fighting Herds.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:06.000
I kind of love it. I want to sit here and go, that's so stupid.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.000
But I kind of love how awful it is. I kind of love it.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000
Especially when you consider the long, sordid story behind the game.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:19.000
It's kind of perfect. So kudos to whoever wrote that one on the board.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.000
Yeah, that was pretty fantastic when I first heard it.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.000
So I'm pretty excited about this.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:32.000
The campaign is going to launch on Indiegogo on September 21st.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Really? They're going to go to Indiegogo?

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Because that's where Hasbro goes for their stuff too,

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
which you might have heard earlier in the show.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:41.000
Yeah, that's a pretty big coincidence.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Yeah, at least they're going to now release the Kickstarter they were planning on since all this happened.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:55.000
So it's pretty great to finally see what's going to come for this game.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:01.000
They're going to be announcing new characters, stages, all that stuff.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:07.000
And even this following weeks before the Kickstarter launches.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:13.000
It's going to be great. I'm definitely going to help fund this one.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:18.000
And you know why they go to Indiegogo as well?

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Because it's different than Kickstarter where in Kickstarter if you don't make the goal,

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:27.000
which some things like what Red Ash damn near didn't and some of that other stuff,

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
you don't get any of the money.

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:34.000
But on a site like Indiegogo, you get to pocket at least whatever is made.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:41.000
So that at least seems to lend credit to the fact that this game will come out one way or another no matter what.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Yeah, I had back something on Indiegogo that was the Screwgirls PC port.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:59.000
So yeah, I'm pretty glad that they chose Indiegogo for this.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Because yeah, the game will come out in some way or another.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Hopefully they will raise, and they will raise the whole amount they will ask for.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:17.000
With the cult-like fandom behind My Little Pony, then I'm sure a lot of people moving on to this, it makes a lot of sense.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:20.000
You'd be surprised, sorry to interrupt you.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:26.000
You'd be surprised how many people are kind of against this despite of the fandom.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:32.000
It's a minority, but there are people mad at this.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Well, I'm of the school of thought. I'm not a brony or My Little Pony fan, but I'm all about, you know what, whatever dude.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:44.000
Whatever you like, as long as you ain't hurting nobody, who cares, right?

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:47.000
So if that's what you want to be into, awesome.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:56.000
So I love though the fact out of this that they kind of were able to rise up from getting shut down.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:59.000
And really kind of take some coal and turn it into, hopefully, a diamond.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:03.000
By, okay, yeah, they got shut down by Hasbro, but they didn't let that stop them.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:10.000
In fact, they were even able to team up with some of the influence there behind My Little Pony, create some new characters.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:15.000
And now, with a title like Them's Fightin' Herds, that might even put them in a better position.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Who knows? NASA Games in our chat says that's going to catch on because of how dumb it sounds.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Hashtag America. And who cares as long as they get to cash the check at the end of the day, right?

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Who cares the motivations for people buying it, right?

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:35.000
And yeah, I got to play the original game, the Finding This Magic One, and it had a really good potential.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:46.000
So now, with a really good engine, which is the Skullgirls 1, and all that resource put into this game, it looks like it's going to be fantastic.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:53.000
I really, really hope they do make the campaign, the work, and all that stuff.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:24:03.000
And I hope that not only the bronies and all the fandom, but fighting game people. It catches on.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:10.000
So, in other words, you're telling people, you know, put your feelings on My Little Pony aside and just check out the damn game for itself.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:18.000
And see if it has any merit and maybe bring some new stuff to the table and is importantly fun. And I can support that.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:24.000
And heck, if you don't like ponies, the game won't have ponies. It will have a cow. It will have an alpaca.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:30.000
That should be the tagline. Absolutely no ponies, but maybe a cow.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:36.000
All right. ActDeaf, my friend, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
Hey, thanks for coming. Take care.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:42.000
I still love that name more than anything, I've got to say.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:45.000
All right, let's get to the phones. We've got more calls coming in.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Hey, it's Sturlock.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
Hey, Sturlock, buddy. How you doing?

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Pretty good.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Good. Long time no hear. How you doing these days?

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Yeah, doing well.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.000
Good. What you doing?

02:24:55.000 --> 02:25:01.000
So I kind of wanted to gush about a game I've been playing for a couple months, actually.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Gush away?

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:11.000
It's my mobile addiction. It's Final Fantasy Record Keeper.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I knew it. I knew it. You know what?

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:14.000
Holy fuck.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:27.000
You and Alan both. I will sometimes, like, I'll kind of be trying to go to sleep or whatever, and Alan, I'll see his on his phone looking at something, and I kind of look over and sure enough, it's Final Fantasy Record Keeper.

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Oh, my God. I was so happy because I'm part of a forum called Audio Games, which is games that blind people can play, basically.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:55.000
And the game is playable with VoiceOver, which is the iPhone screen reader, basically.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:16.000
Really? So, yeah, and this is something that not everybody often considers when looking at games, but you've said on this show before, you're blind, and so some games aren't accessible to you for that reason, so it's really awesome when a game is more accessible to get more gamers to be able to enjoy them.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:22.000
So with Final Fantasy, it'll actually read to you and you can use your voice? That's cool.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Well, not your voice itself. The screen reader itself is called VoiceOver.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Oh. Got it.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:42.000
I could, if you want, I don't know how good of a radio this would make, but I could show you a little bit if you want.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:54.000
Actually, I think that's a fabulous idea. If the audio doesn't come through good enough, then I'll shut it down, but right now, we're in radio, so everybody's blind right now and can't see what's going on.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:27:07.000
So imagine you're trying to play Final Fantasy Record Keeper, and you can't necessarily see the screen, so what does it sound like?

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:20.000
You know what, it would probably help if I... just a sec. Sorry. Open settings. I'm going to turn down my speech rate so everybody can understand.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Yeah, I was going to say, dang. Is it true that if you aren't so strong in one sense, that your other senses get a lot stronger?

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:36.000
Not to the extent that everybody thinks.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Well, probably not like Superhero, but you can probably listen to things at that speed.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:28:01.000
I wouldn't say they're enhanced, but you tend to notice more things. Actually, it's kind of funny speaking of Record Keeper. Japan is getting Kefka in an event now, basically.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:13.000
But still no General Liro. I think you've placed us on hold, Sterlok. Hopefully, Sterlok accidentally placed us on hold, because this thing came up that says call on hold.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:21.000
And I don't know if it's because maybe he's calling us from the same device he's trying to play Record Keeper on, but unfortunately, I'm unable to...

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Okay, we're back.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000
I'm sorry about that.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:26.000
That's okay. I saw you placed us on hold on accident.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
Yeah, I had auto-answer on when I got a call.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Whoops! That's okay.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Alright, but yeah. Somebody posted a video of Kefka's soul break, and it has his infamous laugh in it.

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:55.000
And there was actually a second time that he laughs in the animation, but it was kind of covered up by the rest of the animation.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.000
Wow. And I can hear it as he's tapping through the menu. It's reading all the options you would expect.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:16.000
You know, some people will listen to this show at like 1.5 speed or 2 speed.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
That's crazy. I can't do that.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:22.000
I don't know how people do that, but I think that's kind of awesome.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:33.000
That's okay. I will just speak slower so that it sounds normal to you.

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:39.000
And you can focus on every word I'm saying.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Alright, how is this? Is that understandable?

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:46.000
That's fine. It's good enough to give us an example here for time's sake, so go ahead.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Alright.

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:04.000
Now it's not perfect. You do have to turn VoiceOver off, because it won't see everything.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:07.000
So there are some things you have to turn VoiceOver off for.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:15.000
Oh, I'm in a dungeon. I forgot about this.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
Let's get out of that.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
That's the bad thing about it.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:33.000
That's okay. You weren't expecting to have to do it live.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:38.000
That's alright. Alright, well I'll go into the party menu here.

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
If I can. Maybe I can't.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:50.000
There we go. I guess it's just going slow.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Alright. I'll show you what upgrading equipment is like.

02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Okay. Just a little bit more here, because we do want to move on to the next call.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:06.000
But this is interesting to me, and I notice a lot of people in chat are kind of like, you know, there's a lot of people.

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Some people are like, what the hell am I hearing right now?

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.000
But then other people are like, well, this is interesting.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:17.000
I would have never kind of thought, you know, this is what the game sounds like to some people.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Yeah.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
I'm going to upgrade something.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Now, the weird thing about this is a lot of the stuff is unlabeled, so I kind of have to go by memorization.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Luckily there's a lot of sorting options.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:54.000
So usually what I kind of tend to do is just sort by newest and do it that way.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:15.000
See Alan Chat says, just saying, I wish I had text speed settings as fast as his audio settings.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:19.000
Nice.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Well, that's, I don't know, this is very enlightening to hear kind of this whole thing.

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:33.000
So let me go back to what you originally talked about, just like why you love the game.

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
What's so addicting about the game to you?

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:39.000
Well, one, the fact that I can even play it.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:55.000
The interesting thing, too, is nothing shows with voiceover during battles, so it's all like memorizing where things are on the screen.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:33:02.000
I had everything described to me, like what the layout and stuff was.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:20.000
But anyway, why I really like the game is just, it's just a love letter to fans of 8 and 16 bit Final Fantasy fans.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:33.000
And visually, even with the new stuff, like Lightning actually just had her event pretty recently from Final Fantasy 13.

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:42.000
And what they do with the more modern games is they kind of touch up the sprites to make them look more like 16 bit, I guess.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:56.000
But I just like the fact that you can, it's kind of like, you know, a theater rhythm where you can just kind of mishmash a whole bunch of different characters that, you know, normally wouldn't.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:03.000
Like, you know, next week we're getting Tella and Goldbez from Final Fantasy 4.

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:07.000
But it's like you can have that dream party since Final Fantasy games are always independent of each other.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:11.000
It's like, what would happen if this character from this game and this character from this game actually went out of energy?

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Yeah, I thought that was kind of cool.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:21.000
I'm really, really, really looking forward to eventually having, like, Goldbez and Kefka and, like, Sephiroth, because, yeah, Sephiroth's in the game.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.000
Like, in the same party. Like, just, it's amazing.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
Yeah, you have an all-basket kind of party.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Guys, you don't chat over at live.vognetwork.com that says, is this a battle game?

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:36.000
It plays like old-school Final Fantasy fights. Like, you just do, like, a bunch of them in a row kind of thing, right?

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:39.000
It's all fights. You don't actually, like, move around dungeons and stuff.

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Yeah, no. It is a little different because it is a free-to-play game.

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:48.000
But, you know, they capture the essence of the Final Fantasy battles pretty darn good, all things considered.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:54.000
Yeah, they really do. Like, take all the bravest. Remember how crap that game was?

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.000
Yeah.

02:34:55.000 --> 02:35:00.000
Like, this is the complete opposite of all the bravest.

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:05.000
And the good thing about this, too, that I've noticed before is that the guys who made this

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:08.000
are the same people that are going to be working on the Nintendo free-to-play stuff,

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
because we heard about Nintendo going to mobile.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Oh, nice.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:12.000
Pretty cool.

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:17.000
Taijiro says, where can I download this? Or, whore can I download this?

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:20.000
I'm thinking AutoCorrect came into play there.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
App Store and Google Play.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:26.000
Yeah, it's on iOS and Android, so as long as you have one of those, too, just check out the store on the device.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:34.000
Also, if you're like me and you like playing two copies of the game,

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:40.000
the global and Japanese versions are obviously independent of one another.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:47.000
So, all you need is a Japanese iTunes account, at least if you're on iOS and you're good to go.

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Very cool.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.000
All right, well, Sturlock, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call.

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:54.000
But thanks for enlightening us on Final Fantasy Record Keeper.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
It looks like you got one person to download it there,

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:04.000
and showing us a little bit about what that voiceover stuff sounds like for folks that need the help in reading the screen there.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:05.000
All right?

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.000
All right.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.000
Take care, my friend.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Thanks.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.000
All right.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:10.000
Bye.

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:11.000
Bye-bye.

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:14.000
Sturlock there, everybody, calling in. He hasn't called in the show for a while. I appreciate hearing from you.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
We'll try to squeeze in one more call here.

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:22.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:26.000
Loki, do you want to, in last minute stories, you want to get out here?

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:27.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:31.000
So, Jackbox Games announced that Fibbage 2 is going to be part of the Party Pack 2.

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
Oh, a Party Pack 2? Wow.

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:36.000
Yeah, and that's going to, they said it's going to include some sort of streaming mode.

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:40.000
It's coming to PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this fall.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
That's pretty cool.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:47.000
And in an unrelated news, apparently, I guess the VMAs are going on right now.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Oh, God, yeah.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.000
And Kanye West announced he was running for president in 2020.

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000
Good luck. And stuff.

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
That'll be hilarious.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:03.000
Is it true that, I don't even understand why the VMAs are a thing, because when did MTV play music videos in the past few years?

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.000
I don't know.

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Late at night, I guess. Somebody correct me on that. I guess it's like in the wee morning hours, they actually do.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
Five minutes between 12?

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:11.000
Yeah, right.

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:18.000
But, what was I going to say? I heard she was supposed to be surrounded by RuPaul's Drag Race drag queens at one point.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Did that actually happen?

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000
I don't know.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Or no.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
And Wes Craven died from brain cancer.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:33.000
Yeah, I saw that come through on Twitter. I guess he was probably battling that and didn't tell anybody about that, as a lot of the celebrities often do, when they're battling those sorts of things.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
And Notch is depressed.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
Are you sick, Notch?

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
Let us know.

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:40.000
Alright.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Kaijuto in chat says, he said more than president. He made a lot of sense tonight. Great speech.

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:53.000
He didn't interrupt anybody to do it, did he? As long as he was given the time, or he won his award. He didn't interrupt anybody, though, to do it, right?

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Is his runny mate going to be Taylor Swift?

02:37:57.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Actually, that would be a good compliment, because she could speak to, you know, there were a lot of people in that whole debacle. Some were pro-Kanye, some not so much.

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:16.000
Maybe if they can come together to be on the same ticket, then anything is possible. They can fix the country together.

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:30.000
I think it would be ridiculous, but okay. I'll take ridiculous. I'll take ridiculous as ridiculous as California. Was it the impromptu election they had with fucking Gary Coleman, Arnold Schwarzenegger?

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:33.000
Yeah, the recall election. That stuff was crazy.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
I will take as ridiculous as that.

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Alright. Let's fit in one more call here on the line, and then we'll see if anybody else is going to call. What are we going to do?

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
So, hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:50.000
Hey, this is Ray Ginator.

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Hey, what's up?

02:38:52.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Not a whole lot. Two things to note. The first being a short story. For those that play games on Steam, if you go over to Humble Bundle's store page, they're giving end of summer sale.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Every day they change up what's up for sale.

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:20.000
On the Humble Bundle?

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
Yeah.

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:33.000
I feel like we had a story, too, and I think I had to cut it for time, but I feel like there was something about that Humble Bundle's expanded a lot of the charities you can actually donate to.

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
Yeah, 3,500 charities now?

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.000
That's pretty awesome. So that's cool.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
I still think, too, that's free right now.

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:44.000
Where you can feel good, at least, about where some of your money goes when you buy games.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:40:06.000
Yeah. And the nice thing is, I forget what the end date is for just one particular offer, but right at top of the store page, you'll see that they're giving away for free Stealth 2, which is the sequel to Stealth Bastard.

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:22.000
And it's normally a $15 game on Steam. I kind of played the original game a little bit on Steam. It seems like a decent game, so there's that.

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:46.000
And I did pick up a bundle of all the You Don't Know Jack stuff for $3. I think I really got on Steam this week because I've been dealing with all the stuff this week.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:41:06.000
So if you want a free game, if you go to the store, grab the free game, and while you're there, you can save money, get some stuff there, and while you're saving money, you're making donations and charity.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Well, I like free games, that's for sure.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:32.000
Anyway, now that that story is out of the way, now to get to the meat and potatoes of the call, I'm going to more or less repeat this for those that don't listen live, and me, we don't necessarily listen to Bobby's show.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:42.000
Not to sound like a knocking Bobby show, it's a great show, not necessarily everyone's heard of the show.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:56.000
But anyway, I'm usually not the one on VOD that gets into my own personal background and all that, just like You Don't and Jamie and all that.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:12.000
This sort of ties into video games very loosely. I'm the oldest of four siblings, and my youngest brother is 14 years but junior.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:39.000
And he lives way out in the suburbs of Buffalo, and every so often does come into town, and you know, case in point, a week and a week and a half ago, he came to town one day, and he, you know, whenever he comes into town and stops by my place, he always wants to play Grand Theft Auto.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Well, I just found out, I think it was Thursday, yeah it was Thursday the 27th, that apparently he got himself into a bit of trouble.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:43:04.000
So, if you'll excuse my phrasing, he's probably piss-poor phrasing, but he kind of did a little bit of real life Grand Theft Auto.

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:29.000
And granted, the media really hasn't made the connection just yet. I'm willing to bet that within the near future, you know, a whole shipstorm of attention between VOD violence and real life violence is going to hit the news.

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:45.000
Hold on, hold on, I gotta jump in here. I know this is an intensely personal story and so forth, and I'm sorry to hear that this is happening in your family right now, but you said he did a Grand Theft Auto type of thing, he didn't kill anybody though, right?

02:43:45.000 --> 02:44:00.000
I think Jamie shared with me what you talked about with her last night, and I saw that it was, if I'm not mistaken, it was that he had threatened a taxi driver with a weapon, correct?

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:07.000
But he didn't hurt anybody, but he threatened, and that's almost as bad, pretty much, in the eyes of the law.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Yeah, in effect, a little while before I called, I sent you a PM, a private message in chat with a direct link to the news story.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:30.000
You know, I'm just trying to shorten things down for, you know, due to time constraints on the air, but the drill just over...

02:44:49.000 --> 02:45:04.000
So believe it or not, I know some of what you're going through right now and what you're thinking and so forth, and it's interesting to me that you said that you worry that the media is going to jump on it and turn it into this video game type of situation and so forth,

02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:16.000
and you mentioned that he liked to play Grand Theft Auto with you, and then he does this thing where he holds a taxi driver at gunpoint and so forth, and maybe in your head you're thinking,

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:26.000
oh God, did I put the wrong idea in front of him by showing him Grand Theft Auto or something like that? Is it the video game's fault?

02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:39.000
You're asking the same question right now to yourself that I think a lot of people want to ask sometimes when tragedy happens, and not that this is even on the same level, Ragenator, but just for example's sake only.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:50.000
When the whole thing happened with Columbine and the tragedy that happened there, what did everybody want to know? It was about what was in those guys' heads? What made them do the things that they did?

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:56.000
Was it the Marilyn Manson? Was it the video games? What is it that happened and made these people do that they were going to do?

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:05.000
And honestly, as difficult as it is to hear in some of these situations, sometimes, Ragenator, it's none of it.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:19.000
It was something that was going to happen, and unfortunately, we tend to in these situations, I think, kind of blame ourselves, or what could I have done to stop this?

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:28.000
And especially considering that you have the relation that happened there and so forth, but Ragenator, it's not your fault, and that's very important.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:37.000
And I'm going to tell you something. Hold on, hold on. I'm going to tell you something, and I'm going to tell the listeners something that I have not talked about on the show in a very long time, and for good reason.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:47.000
My brother and I don't speak to each other, and there's a very good reason behind that, and part of it has to do with the situation that he put my family through many, many years ago.

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:54.000
It's not exactly the type of thing that you're talking about, but it's similar, and I'm going to leave it at that.

02:46:54.000 --> 02:47:02.000
And the types of questions you're asking yourself right now, these were things that my mom was asking herself. What could I have done differently?

02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:08.000
What, you know, this is my fault. Did I raise my kid wrong? What did I do?

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:18.000
And I'm telling you, she didn't do anything wrong, and neither did you. So I just want you to know that. It's not the video game's fault. It's not your fault.

02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:23.000
It sucks that it happened, but it's not your fault.

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Yeah, you know, logically speaking, I do acknowledge that. The one thing I also think at the same time is that, like I said, once this does hit the media,

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:57.000
both media and the public at large like to look for a scapegoat. This happens all the time. Hell, you brought up Columbine, so that's another example.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:04.000
Yeah, it's exactly what it is. It's a scapegoat. And I'm not like trying to yell at you and be like, you're wrong, you're wrong, but I'm just trying to tell you.

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:12.000
I'm telling you firmly and I'm reassuring you because my family's asked themselves a lot of these questions when placed in a similar scenario.

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:24.000
I'm just telling you from that experience, you will come to this conclusion someday as much as it's going to be painful to get there, I think, is that this was a situation that was probably going to happen anyway.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:38.000
And I know that might really sting to hear that in the moment, and I apologize, but unfortunately, when people sometimes need help, they lash out in ways that we would never expect to happen, Reginator.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:50.000
And that's just what happens, and it's really unfortunate. And if there was easier access to mental health care in this country and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I could go on and on and on, but you know where I'm going with it.

02:48:51.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Yeah, you know, the weird thing is, though, for the past, you know, roughly decade or so, he's been living in a group home.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:17.000
Well, a company that runs several group homes, he's kind of bounced between the various locations within that organization.

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:28.000
He was living in one in the lower West Side of Buffalo up until a couple years ago. He moved to another location down in O'Hann, you know, not too long ago.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:44.000
And I don't know if you're familiar with how group homes arrive, but they're supposed to be staffed 24-7 by mental health professionals and all that. They give out medications and all that.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:58.000
Reginator, I know you definitely want to talk this through and so forth for the sake of our listenership and so forth. I don't think they want to hear all of these details because this is an intensely private scenario.

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:12.000
But Reginator, like what you're telling me and what I'm hearing in this is that he was sick. He was sick. And sometimes when you're sick, you throw up and you do some things that are sometimes like beyond your control.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:27.000
You're sick, so you throw up. And you didn't want to throw up, but your body kind of made you throw up. I'm not saying it's necessarily like a cookie cutter type of situation, but you're telling me he's dealing with mental health issues. He threw up is what happened.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:37.000
And so, Reginator, I want you to try very hard. Try to take yourself out of the equation. This is not your fault. You can't change what happened, but now how are you going to move forward?

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:47.000
And what can you do to maybe be there for your brother in this scenario and so forth? Maybe you'll have a better outcome at the end of the day than maybe I did in my scenario.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:56.000
But I'm not going to get into all the rest. I've already said way too much about what I went through and so forth. So I hope for a better ending for you.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:51:05.000
And I'm glad at least, A, very important, nobody was hurt. That's the most important thing. People were certainly scared, but thank God nobody was hurt. That's the most important thing.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:16.000
And I will truly keep you guys in my thoughts and hope that your brother is able to get the help that he needs. But again, not the video game's fault. Not your fault.

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Alright, well thank you for taking my calls. Definitely appreciate it.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:23.000
You're welcome, my friend.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
Speak to you soon.

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Yeah, take care. Try to sleep well tonight. You know what? Play some games. Take your mind off it. Believe it or not, it helps.

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:32.000
Alright.

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:45.000
Yeah, I would play games and I try to say it physically helps as much. Even music really doesn't help that much.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Well, you know, it may be a matter of just finding that thing. Try going outside. Take a walk. Maybe do something you never thought of doing before.

02:51:54.000 --> 02:52:03.000
Maybe take up a game-inspired craft project. Maybe you've always been curious, like, I've never actually tried painting, but maybe now I have all these feelings, I want to get that out.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:11.000
Or maybe I've never tried crafting. Just take this opportunity to try to do something you've never done before. And your body will tell you what that is.

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:15.000
Alright, Ray Jeter, I'm sorry, I gotta let you go, okay?

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
Sure, no problem.

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:18.000
Take care, my friend.

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:19.000
Alright, have a good one.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Good luck, you too.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Alright, bye bye.

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Intensely personal scenarios here on Orange Lounge Radio, but, you know, I think, you know, even judging in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, a lot of people, you know, lending words of support and so forth.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:39.000
And, you know, people I think reinforcing the fact this is not something, you know, Ray Jeter caused by letting him play a video game or anything like that.

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:44.000
Certainly not an SSJ, 100 Matt lending the advice, go for a hike, it's what I do.

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Kaijuto says, you do it case by case, there's not one solution to rule them all.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Akuma JP says, I go to a pet cafe when I have problems.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:53:01.000
And I know Ray Jeter is a recent pet owner, so maybe, you know, give some extra hugs to the kitty tonight and so forth.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Anyway, I know that was a heavy call.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:10.000
Not exactly the note I wanted to end on, but since we are well past 9 o'clock, I do want to go ahead and shut down the Skype line.

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
Thank you guys so much though for the calls.

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:21.000
If you have some more thoughts you want to get out for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:25.000
And of course you can always tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
We're also on Facebook.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:37.000
As a reminder, we will not be here next week because of DragonCon, but I hope you guys all have a happy and safe Labor Day no matter what it is you're doing in the upcoming weeks.

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:42.000
Loki, I'm going to check in with you one more time to see if there's any last minute stories or anything we might have missed.

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
Nah, not really.

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
I think we're good to call it a night here.

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:49.000
I think we made the three hour mark tonight, or if we missed it, just barely.

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Maybe because of the break in the middle of the show.

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
So plenty of OLR to hold our listeners over.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:54:02.000
But if you desperately need something next week, you know, there's 600 plus episodes that maybe you haven't heard yet.

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:08.000
And a lot of them are still up. I think all the episodes through 2008 are still on the Orange Lounge radio servers.

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:11.000
So there's a ton of stuff to listen to there.

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:17.000
And also, I know there's an Orange Lounge radio archive, and Dark Tetsuya is always in our chat room.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Well, not always, but he's around and he's also on the VOG Network forums and can help you in tapping into the OLR archive.

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:27.000
It's not something we officially support, but it's kind of cool that it exists.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:35.000
And I love that it's a thing that people that wanted to hear old episodes kind of came together and built to distribute those old episodes.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Though I think old OLR is so different from the OLR of today, you know, we can't forget our roots and where we came from as a show.

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:50.000
Alright, well, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
Loki, I'll start with you.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
Seriously trying to get my game done.

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
It will be done hopefully soon.

02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:05.000
I've just been really tired and distracted, and so I haven't been able to get, you know, mentally I haven't been able to work on my game during breaks at work.

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:15.000
I just have like 15 minutes and it's just like, I just can't get into focus quick enough to be able to get anything done.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:21.000
So I'm trying though. Soon, hopefully.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:22.000
You're a busy guy.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:26.000
Really, I just, you know, it's really the few things I want to get done.

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:31.000
Leaderboards so that, you know, the demo's, you know, fun because it's basically competing for time.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:35.000
So, you know, I wanted that to be done.

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:41.000
And then aside from the leaderboards, really it's just menus and reskinning some of the stuff that's in there already.

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:44.000
Mainly just the menus and like kind of title sequence stuff and that's it.

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:50.000
As you get more seniority at work, then you'll get the better shifts when it comes time for the bidding.

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:58.000
Well, yeah, so I would have had a, okay, because it's based on performance for 90% of it and my performance is fucking awesome.

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:02.000
The problem is though is they're like, well, we're going to change the way we're going to do our shift bids.

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
And then they couldn't come into an agreement.

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:08.000
And they're like, eh, we're just going to, you can just stay on the same shift you were on before.

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:11.000
Except, you know, because we just got fully trained, I didn't get to pick a shift.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:15.000
I just got whatever shift was there and they were all the shitty shifts.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
That excuse they can't use next time.

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:22.000
And so now I have to shift until the beginning of the year. So whatever.

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:23.000
It'll get better. It'll get better.

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:27.000
All right. My final thought tonight. I'm going to echo what SSJ100 Matt said in our chat room.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
There needs to be a USL archive.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:33.000
I realize that most of the old Understation Live episodes aren't around anymore.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:39.000
I agree with that, especially with Travis and Jessica deciding to, you know, drop the curtain and call it a night here at the end of the year.

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:46.000
I think that would be a really great thing for people that maybe are just now realizing what they might have missed out on over the years.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:57.000
And that was a lot of fun and, you know, I wouldn't have learned a lot of the tricks that, you know, I'm using here on Orange Lounge Radio if it wasn't for my experience at Travis's house back in the good old days of Understation Live.

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
So I'm just, you know, sending them more well wishes.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:05.000
Although I will be giving him lots of shit next week at Dragon Con and I can't wait for that.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
So stay tuned for that.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:11.000
I'm so excited for Dragon Con this week. It's something I really need after this year.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:14.000
It's been a crazy year but things are getting better.

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:26.000
And Dragon Con is just going to hopefully be that nice little like, you know, kind of like palate cleanser before things even take off even more and things are better and more live streaming and hopefully more efforts at VOG Network.

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:30.000
Because I know I've been slacking a little bit the past few months. I apologize for that.

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:34.000
But things will be getting better as we get into the year and 2016 and beyond.

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:37.000
So thank you guys for being here tonight at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:40.000
Really appreciate you guys tuning in and participating with the show.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:45.000
As we always say, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:53.000
Help spread the word because it is the show where every gamer has a voice but we don't know if the voices are out there, you know, if you're not sharing them.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
So please tell a friend.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Also, you can always leave us a five star review on a nice place like iTunes or Stitcher or wherever you heard about this show.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
And I haven't seen a new review in a while.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
Granted, I haven't checked in the past couple of weeks.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
But I haven't seen a new one in a while.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
So I bet there's someone out there who hasn't written one yet.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:15.000
So I would really appreciate that because that all helps with the discoverability stuff and with, you know, thousands of gaming podcasts.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
Many of them that podfaded years ago.

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
Sometimes it's really hard to get discovered.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
So I really appreciate those of you that use the word of mouth.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:25.000
It's all the payment we need here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:30.000
That's gonna do it. We will be back in two weeks to do it again.

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:33.000
And I will see some of you guys at DragonCon.

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:38.000
Otherwise, we'll be back here in two weeks to talk about whatever gaming news should happen over the Labor Day weekend.

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
Have a great holiday here in the States, whatever it is you do.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
And overseas, have a great couple of weeks.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:06.000
See you next week.

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
We'll be back here in two weeks.
