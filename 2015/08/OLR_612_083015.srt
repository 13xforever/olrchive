Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This week, the first infamous shared Mario Maker level has emerged and it will never give you up and never let you down. But does it turn around and delight you? Maybe we need a time to Rick Roll Counter. This is just one of many stories we'll tell you about and they all start right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 612 for this, August the 30th of 2015.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And yes, I think Jason just Rick rolled us all in the intro. I do believe that is a thing that has just happened all these years later. Because Rick rolling is what, so 10 years ago? Maybe not, maybe not as we get into the news tonight and figure that out later. I'm just cracking up that he did that.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:09,000
My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California with my co-host here tonight. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hello.

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Welcome back.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I know you had a decent week off last week. I know you're taking care of other obligations, but welcome back.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You were complaining earlier about this abundance of Red Bull. Red Bull giveaways. First off, how do you drink so much Red Bull without having heart problems?

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't drink a ton of it. I drink one a day. Just one.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That seems like a lot.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's not. It's like a coffee. Do you drink a coffee a day?

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Fair enough.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's basically what it is. It's not like it's a ton of caffeine. And really, it's what I need to stay awake. Because, like, I seriously, earlier, before coming over, I was just, like, working on the computer and I was, like, passing out from being so tired. So, it's how I stay awake.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All right. So, that's fine. I guess, you know, especially when you consider that, you know, you got the kids and everything. I'm sure they keep up late.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And I stay up way too late. And, yeah.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm literally drinking coffee as he's talking about his Red Bull thing. So, I guess I can't complain too much.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's not like I'm drinking, like, four or five of them a day or something like that. No. One a day and that's it.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Shotgunning them where you did the whole bottom?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't. I can shotgun them. But, yeah. I drink one usually in the morning. Right when I get to work. I kind of just. Because, like, I literally am dragging myself in the work and it just kind of keeps me awake.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Okay.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And then, like, on Sunday, you know, I drink one in the evening because I've been with the kids all day. And it's just, you know, you got to stay awake.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But, because of this, now, you know, of course, we've talked about this weeks ago on the show. But, the whole fact that they are giving away crap in Destiny, the video game. They're giving it away with this Red Bull stuff.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You're just plucking all these tabs.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, yeah. I've got, like, six of them at my desk at work.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Like, what was that old urban legend about? Because my dad was super into that. You pluck the tabs off of soda cans and it's what they use for dialysis treatment or something like that. Like, the money for recycling them. I swear to God.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No, no, no. I know what you're talking about because they have one of those collection things at work. It's for something. Yeah.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yeah.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Where you can turn them in.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Right?

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So, like, you've got this going in your house except it's Destiny codes.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Destiny codes. Which is funny because I still haven't played Destiny. I have it sitting there since day one that I bought my PlayStation 4. Haven't touched it. That and Watch Dogs.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Both just sitting there completely unused.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So, what are you going to do with all these codes?

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Probably give them away because I can't do anything with them. I mean, I can only give away one.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Give away. Awesome.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't know what it says. It's like 4A. Let's see here. It says, become legend with flame sword at redbullquest.com.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just read the code. Read the code on that tab right now.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
On this tab?

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's make somebody a winner right now.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Alright. So, we've got X4FFW47X. You redeem that at redbullquest.com.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright. Now you can safely throw that can away.

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can safely throw this can away and I've got three more in the bag for the rest of the week that have these codes on them plus all the ones on my desk.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So, I still don't know what the hell it does, but there you go.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a flame sword. I think.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Cool. I guess. I've played Destiny since the beta, so I don't know.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Alright. Not joining us tonight, unfortunately, is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
She has the night off. You might have heard her mention last week. She is off celebrating her anniversary this weekend.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's actually her ten year anniversary with DanTheMan. They are seeing Weird Al tonight in Folsom.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Damn it. That's awesome.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I know. Right? I was like, wait a minute.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In Folsom?

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I know. Right? I was like, where?

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Weird Al's in Folsom. That was the first question I asked. Like, where is there a concert venue in Folsom? It's at the college.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, yeah.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah. So, uh.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Oh, man. That's awesome.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I know. Why are we doing a show right now?

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Exactly. We should have gone and saw Weird Al.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I had no idea that that was a thing until Jamie was like, yeah.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, man. Next time.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Dan and I have meet and greet tickets and then we're going to Reno because I'm special.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Aww. And they get to meet him too?

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, that sucks.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, if you know the story about Dan and Jamie. I almost said Jamie and Jan. If you know their story, they got engaged over the movie UHF.

73
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So, Weird Al is of a particular significance to this.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's awesome.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So, the fact that he's touring right now and is here in the town is pretty awesome. So, it all worked out great for them.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But we do have you guys. You guys are here in our chat room. Live.vognetwork.com.

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And, let's see, Nascent Games. Our buddy Gabe with Nascent Games is listening live tonight and in the chat.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He was on the show a few weeks ago saying, whoa, Weird Al is in Folsom? What the fuck?

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And I'm listening to this show. Hashtag nerd priorities.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Exactly.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We have a guest who hasn't changed her name in chat, vog267, who says, you're better than Weird Al.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Aw, that's a very nice thing to say. I don't know. I wouldn't go that far. Weird Al is pretty awesome.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Especially, he did a great job with his last album. The mandatory fun and all that.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yeah, it was pretty good.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You know, actually, another local connection. I understand that, you know, because he did like every song on that album he did a video for, right?

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And he put them all out like all at once, right?

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, the one for word crimes, which like to make that song good, like that's what Weird Al does.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He takes those annoying songs and makes them like good.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So he did the word crimes. You know how it was like an art type video, like a word art video, lyrics video.

90
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Apparently the guy who did it was here in Sacramento.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Huh.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Huh. Who knew? Who knew? So we have all this art and stuff coming out of Sacramento.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And ActDeft was the one that got the code.

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
There it is. Oh, there you go. Congrats. ActDeft in our chat room. Does ActDeft even own Destiny?

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Who cares?

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I thought he was a Wii U guy. Oh, well, that's all right.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Okay. He says he does. There it is. That's fine.

98
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Someday I'll play it again. Or for the first time, I guess.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Salty is in our chat room. SaltyVog says, ew, Sacktown, so bad. Hey, you know what?

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
First off, this isn't Hoard House. Sorry, you're on the wrong show.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And second off, it's not so bad. You get used to Sacktown.

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I think most people have bad memories of Sacktown because they took a pit stop here on the way to Oregon or something from LA.

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Like you stopped through here on the way to San Francisco or something.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We're outside of Sacramento. I mean, it's just like we're not in the middle of Sacramento.

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We're in suburbia. It's not that much different.

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Suburbia here is not that much different from suburbia in LA, except you can actually afford a home here.

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Kinda. Kinda.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And I agree. I mean, I don't like driving down in Sacramento either. I mean, it's just whatever.

109
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
All right. Going to another comment brought up in our chat here.

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Dark Tetsuya starting us off tonight actually talking about some games here.

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Dark Tetsuya says, why the hell can't I join a winning team for Splatfest?

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
How many of y'all are playing Splatoon out there?

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This weekend was the big, I don't know if it's sponsored or licensed or what, but there was a commercial tie-in.

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This Splatfest because instead of cats and dogs or, what was it, water slides and roller coasters and all that stuff.

115
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This time it was Autobots and Decepticons.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It was a Transformers theme. And a lot of my friends signed up for the Autobots.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So what did I do, Loki?

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Decepticons.

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's right. I signed up for Team Decepticon. And sure enough, we won!

120
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yay! I finally, my second only Splatfest because I was lazy and missed all but the first one.

121
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And I'm on the winning team for a change. So that was pretty exciting.

122
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I actually did, I guess we'll get into my gaming week a little bit.

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I actually did spend a little bit of time in Splatoon.

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I leveled up enough to get, like there's the base level, you get 10 points, the second level, you get 25 points, that next level.

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
So I, you know, it wasn't a lot. I'm sure some of you guys leveled all the way up to whatever the maximum thing was for Splatfest.

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But still, I put a little more into it than I usually do on Splatoon.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But I was having quite a bit of fun.

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You know, Splatoon is just a fun little waste of five minutes.

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I mean that when I say waste, I mean that in the best possible way.

130
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Like just, you know, jump in and do a little head-to-head battle and there's not a lot of shit talking because, you know, you can't.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And that's that.

132
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But the Splatfest thing is kind of cool because they mix it up with some custom music and they make the lobby all different.

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And, you know, with the Miiverse posts, everybody gets really into it no matter how stupid the debate is.

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
So you saw all this stuff for Team Autobot and Team Decepticon and all this stuff.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
And, yeah, that was fun. I was happy to take part in that.

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So I had a good time in the game there.

137
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Going into our chatroom again at live.vognetwork.com, Dartitsuya says,

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I was gonna miss it, but I borrowed my stepmom's account to play and tried to get Team Autobot some wins.

139
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, you needed to get him a few more wins, my friend.

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let's see, also, Act F says, I got to Autobot's king rank.

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You know, I thought that there was going to be a big victory for Decepticons in the popularity.

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Because I noticed in one of the matches I got, it was Decepticons versus Decepticons.

143
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And I was like, oh, dang.

144
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Whoever wins, we win.

145
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right. And I was kind of like, oh, there must not be enough Autobots in the pool because now it's matching up Decepticons and Decepticons.

146
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But I guess Shane was telling me the same thing was happening on the Autobot side.

147
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I was like, oh, okay. Well, I guess it was just the fluke.

148
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So I guess it's just somebody just kind of messed up that network code there a little bit.

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, no, I'm pretty sure that's what they're doing to push people into a match if nobody else is available,

150
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
is they just match you up with somebody on the same team.

151
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And it's kind of a win no matter what.

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't know how that math all works. I don't think they've really said a lot about that.

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So what they should do then is they should just lie.

154
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And so, you know, if you're Autobots and the other team's Autobots, you just say they're Decepticons.

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And then on their side, they see that you're Decepticons.

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And that way, it seems like there's competition.

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Going to our chat room for some more comments over at live.voggenetwork.com.

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
ActDef says, Sky, in Europe, it was singing versus dancing.

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And the top dancing rink was Dancing Queen.

160
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
LOL. That's amazing.

161
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's amazing. I hope it actually played the ABBA song.

162
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Although that licensing was probably a little bit too much for that. I don't know.

163
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That is interesting. I forget they do the different SplatFests in different countries.

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So it's not the same thing everywhere.

165
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Like Europe gets one and Japan gets a different one. I wonder what Japan had.

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sure somebody in chat knows.

167
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Team singing versus team dancing. I don't know what I'd pick.

168
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Team stand in the corner awkwardly with my drink.

169
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Is that one of the teams I can do?

170
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Team Super Sentai versus Team Kaiju.

171
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
ActDef says, Japan's SplatFest was Ants versus Grasshoppers.

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And Grasshoppers won.

173
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Ew. Bugs.

174
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Grasshoppers should've won. Because ants are stupid.

175
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, Grasshoppers are pretty cool.

176
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Isn't that the one where the female bites the head off the male when they're mating?

177
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I think you're thinking of pre-mantises.

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This is why I got a D in biology, people.

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Alright.

180
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I didn't have a lot of kickoff topics for tonight.

181
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We have a lot of gaming news, so we'll get into that in just a minute.

182
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But obviously there's a lot of convention stuff going on.

183
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I didn't even realize that PAX Prime was this weekend until I started seeing the tweets about it.

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Because, you know, if you're not on there getting the tickets in the ten minutes they're available, then you're not going.

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's the way those things work.

186
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So I just kind of didn't pay attention to it because I just assumed that PAX was going to be Labor Day weekend again.

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Because it's still a four-day con, if I'm not mistaken.

188
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So I just assumed it was going to be Labor Day weekend again.

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And, you know, in the past few years I've chosen to go to DragonCon.

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I've had a fantastic time at DragonCon.

191
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I think as we've expanded into all realms of geek here at vognetwork.com, I think DragonCon's a better fit.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And I can read from friends and news sites what's going on at PAX.

193
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
And I've talked about some of my own grievances with PAX East on the show previously.

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm not going to get into it again.

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But anyway, I just assumed I wouldn't have been able to go to PAX Prime because it would be at the same time as DragonCon.

196
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But not this year. It's actually going on right now.

197
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And a lot of the news we're going to get into tonight, a lot of it is stuff that's actually coming out of PAX.

198
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Loki, it's been a while since you've gone to a con at all, right?

199
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Was PAX 08 like the last thing you ever did as far as cons go?

200
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't remember. Maybe? I think? Maybe?

201
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yeah, that might have been the last one.

202
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I can't remember if we did E3 after that or not.

203
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't consider E3 a con, because E3 technically is a trade show where cons are usually more fan-run.

204
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Which PAX kind of isn't, so I don't know.

205
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yeah, PAX 08 was probably the last one.

206
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Alright.

207
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So, but anyway.

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's been seven years. Wow.

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, I know. I know.

210
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well, you should go to the SacAnime here locally this weekend if you can stop by there.

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, this weekend?

212
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, it's this weekend. They do that all the way.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah, I don't have the money.

214
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yeah.

215
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
BlackWolf making the distinction a little bit in our chat room.

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Trade shows are for industry. Conventions are for the public.

217
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Whatever. They treat me like public when I go to the trade shows anyway, so.

218
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Well, you know, interesting too is that E3, there's always those rumblings that it's going to go public,

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
or they're going to make one day public, like Tokyo Game Show or what have you.

220
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh, could he?

221
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Well, a lot of that started to pick up steam this year with the whole vendor badges.

222
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I was like, damn. Those Nintendo lines are only five hours long. It's so short.

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If only we could have more people here.

224
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I mean, there's just not enough people. I can actually move and breathe.

225
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes, please. Let's make it public. That'd be awesome.

226
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Nasan Games in chat says, too many effing cons.

227
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And then says, but I will be attending Geek Girl Con in Seattle to show off our games, which I'm super hyped about.

228
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's another con in Seattle, even.

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Geek Girl Con?

230
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah, I had not heard of that one, but I bet that's a lot of fun.

231
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Geek Girl Con.

232
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What's that?

233
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I said you'd probably get behind that.

234
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There's that. There's PAX. There's the Sakura Con, which I know is more anime, but you know video games creep into that.

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So, they're pretty bustling up there in the Northwest. It's pretty cool.

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Bonds006 says, I've been to trade shows and cons here in New York at Jacob Javits Center. There is a difference.

237
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I detest cons, but mostly work at trade shows. Very interesting.

238
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Alright, those are some comments from our chat room on conventions.

239
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Of course, Dragon Con. I will be there this next week in Atlanta.

240
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So, check that out.

241
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
VOGG making a few appearances. Unfortunately, I am not on the up and up on any panels that our TV folks are on.

242
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I missed if they mentioned if they're going to be on any panels.

243
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But I know Brian from British Invaders is at the con again this year, which he usually only goes every other year.

244
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
So, there must be something bringing him back this year.

245
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Our pal from British Invaders, he's going to be there at the show.

246
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I know John from Critical Myth, at least, will be there. Gary's always there.

247
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So, they're going to be at the show. I don't know if John's on any panels this year.

248
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Stay tuned to our website. I'm going to make everybody round that up in the forums.

249
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So, if you're going to Atlanta, you want to meet and greet people, you can go check that out.

250
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I can say, though, that I will be on a panel Sunday at 1 o'clock about the podcasting past, present, and future.

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
And that's Hilton. I think the room is 203. It's where the podcasting track is.

252
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So, check that out. I will be on that panel.

253
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
If you can't be there in Atlanta, you can listen online.

254
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Alpha Geek Radio, kind enough to...

255
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You know what's so funny? I see the same guy from that network at so many cons that I go to, live streaming stuff.

256
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
They're working hard over there to bring these cons out there to the universe.

257
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Because I saw them at BlizzCon, too, during the World of Podcasting last year.

258
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So, I thought that was really funny. I was like, I know you. I see you at DragonCon.

259
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So, there's that. So, you can listen there at Alpha Geek Radio.

260
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And then, Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern, Bobby is going to be on a panel about community.

261
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And, obviously, we love community and getting people's input and so forth here at VoG.

262
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So, that's a great fit for Bobby to be talking on that panel Monday at 10 a.m.

263
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I will also be in the parade. I'm going to be marching with Travis Donovan from Understation Live.

264
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And we are part of the N7 Elite. If you've been following the past few weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio,

265
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I have been getting a costume made. And I am going to DragonCon this year as Joker.

266
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And I do plan to dress up the day of the parade, which I think is Saturday, question mark?

267
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm probably going to wear my costume Saturday, no matter what.

268
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If the parade is Sunday, then I'll just wear it Sunday morning as well. I don't even care.

269
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But, yeah. Oh, you didn't even see it when you came in, did you, Loki?

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No.

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh, hold on. Hold on. Hold on, guys. I've got to show Loki. Here's the thing.

272
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm not showing it to anybody until DragonCon. But since I know Loki's not going to be there, hold on.

273
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm going to show him. So, entertain our listeners here. Live radio, folks.

274
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And if you want to participate with us, live.vognetwork.com.

275
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The best part about this is he's going to show me a costume for a character I have no reference for.

276
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So, I'm just going to assume that, you know, this is an impressive costume.

277
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Because I have no idea, since I don't play Mass Effect at all, who the hell Joker is, aside from, you know...

278
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Here it is!

279
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Okay. Cool.

280
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There's another part to it.

281
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
All right. I'll take your word for it. I don't have any idea whatsoever, you know.

282
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It looks good. Sorry. I don't know.

283
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, there it is, you guys. My costume is a screaming success. There it is. Loki.

284
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll just have to look at my picture of Joker and to kind of get the...

285
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, my God. Awesome. All right. There it is. Oh, Bobby says I missed the panel posting. My bad.

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I guess I missed that over on our forum. So, wow. The Critical Myth is doing a ton of panels this year.

287
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
John is going to be on an Arrow panel Friday from 10 to 11 over at the Marriott.

288
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Game of Thrones, The Dark Time, he's going to be on that panel as well, Friday from 2.30 to 3.30.

289
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And then Gary is going to be talking about Binge Watching, which I know is a habit for so many people.

290
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
How Binge Watching makes us all TV geeks. That's Saturday at 2.30.

291
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And then also a panel on The Flash, What Kind of Hero Are You, going to be on that panel as well.

292
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay. I guess that sort of looks like the character. I see it now.

293
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh, did you pull it up? There's another top piece I didn't show you that makes that armor piece on top of the shoulders.

294
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So, yeah. All right. Cool. Anyway. All right. Anyhow, so there you go.

295
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's Dragon Con coming up. We're going to have a great time there. So I hope to see you guys in Atlanta.

296
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,000
We don't have like a formal VOG meetup because usually we don't know enough people that are going to justify something like that.

297
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But maybe in the future. I don't know. Maybe next year.

298
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So I'm really going to try to get Grandpa from a Horde house to go to Dragon Con next year.

299
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Because I'm not going to have – Travis swears up and down it's his last year.

300
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I really wish it wouldn't be. But, you know, I understand with some of his personal obligations and so forth.

301
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
He may mean it this time. I'm secretly hoping it'll be like a year or two break and then he'll be back.

302
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But anyway, so since I'm going to be absent of Travis, I need to figure out something.

303
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So I'm going to really try to get Grandpa to go to Dragon Con next year.

304
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Because I know he wants to do it. Because I was telling him, I'm like, Grandpa, Garrett Wong goes like every year.

305
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You can meet him at the Walk of Fame. They have a whole track dedicated to Star Trek.

306
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You could nerd the fuck out on this thing the whole weekend.

307
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
And the Mythbusters go. So I would love to see them.

308
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Exactly. So that's my goal. My 2016 goal is Grandpa from a Horde house or whatever project may be in the near future to get him at Dragon Con.

309
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So, and I'm sad that I won't have Travis in 2016. We're going to make the best of 2015.

310
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So, there you go. Alright, so there you go. Conventions, conventions.

311
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
We're going to get into our gaming week. But, you know, go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

312
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I notice they are talking about something else now. It kind of got derailed a little bit, but for good reason.

313
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Apparently, coming from Twitter, and it's a verified Twitter account, Wes Craven has passed away.

314
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The horror movie director. That's very sad to hear that.

315
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
All those scary, he's going to come back some evil, I know it.

316
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the first one to make a tasteless joke. Right here, everybody. Right here.

317
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Thank you for that, Loki. I appreciate that.

318
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But no, I mean, I know he was an older guy, but I didn't know he was battling health issues or anything like that.

319
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, we never know.

320
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah, well that's sad. Sorry to hear about that. Anyway.

321
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
NASA Games in chat says, LOL, he went there. Yeah, he tends to do that. Jerk.

322
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about what types of video games we have been playing this week.

323
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And then we will get into the gaming news right after that. So, Loki.

324
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Mostly I've been working on my game. The beginning portion of the week was just designing a logo, which I didn't like too much.

325
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So I showed it to Cody and he kind of took it and did something better with it and sent it back to me.

326
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
So I now have a logo for my, quote, company.

327
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You know, I haven't registered anything or anything like that, but you know, you can't just say, I made the game.

328
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And then I was working on setting up leaderboards as well, online leaderboards.

329
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
So I'm just doing the PHP stuff right now for that.

330
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Mainly I was trying to figure out what exactly I wanted to have on the leaderboards if I was going to do some sort of scoring system too along with the times.

331
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So I just kind of built that all in there and stuff. And I'm going to have Twitter support as well.

332
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So, not necessarily linking to Twitter, but you can put your Twitter name on there and then it will just have a hyperlink to your Twitter account or something like that if you want to.

333
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And then, now actual games I played, I didn't play a whole ton. A lot of just older stuff.

334
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
My son keeps playing Lego Marvel Super Heroes, so I play a little bit of that.

335
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Mainly just glitching out the game now because there's a super easy way to get under the map, so I've just been messing with that.

336
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And, I don't know. I'm kind of getting bored with it now after 200 hours of the game.

337
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What else? Plains of Steam backlog stuff.

338
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So I tried, I had purchased that Namco bundle from Humble Bundle because it's like, ooh, Ridge Racer.

339
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I wanted to play that Ridge Racer Unbounded game or something like that. It looked pretty cool. It was done by Bugbear.

340
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
That game runs like shit on my computer. I loaded it up, I'm like, nope, delete.

341
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Right away, it just ran terribly. And I'm surprised. I can run Titanfall okay?

342
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Why can't it run this game that's much older and much shittier? I don't understand.

343
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But for whatever reason, it just didn't run very well.

344
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Also, I think I mentioned I played Bionic Commando. I don't really remember when that was.

345
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And I'm talking about not re-armed, the good one. I played the 3D Bionic Commando.

346
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
For some reason I remember enjoying it a lot more than I did this time around.

347
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
But it was terrible. It's just such a terrible game.

348
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
And it's not like a terrible game just in general. It's just the controls were shitty.

349
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
So I don't know what was wrong with that.

350
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Then, for some stupid reason, on the streak of really fucking terrible games I decided to play,

351
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I decided, hey, you know what? I played Fuel one time. Let's load that up again from Codemasters,

352
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
their big open world sort of racing game. God, that game is so boring.

353
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I don't remember how boring that game was, but man, I went back there to play that.

354
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I remember not thinking it was horrible, but I do remember it was really open.

355
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's really open, but it's just really boring. There's like nothing there.

356
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And so I played it for like, I don't know, maybe 30 minutes or so, and I was just like, I can't.

357
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I can't play this anymore. It's just so terrible.

358
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
So what else did I play?

359
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I think a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 5 because my son wanted to see me do some BMX stuff in there.

360
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:56,000
So I did that, and then I think I played that Sakura Clicker game a little bit just for the hell of it.

361
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's just basically, you know, was it Clicker Heroes with anime chicks in it.

362
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And then what else?

363
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I think that was just about it. Maybe a little bit of Minecraft.

364
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But nothing has really caught my attention. I mean, I don't know.

365
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I just realized, you know, Mad Max is coming out this week.

366
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I kind of wanted to try that out because, you know, I'm a pretty big fan of the company that made the game.

367
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But I don't know. I just don't have the money.

368
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
That's a problem. There's all these games that come out and not enough money to play them all.

369
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I understand. I understand how it goes.

370
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,000
All right. Let's see. Some feedback on your gaming week in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

371
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Nascent Games, our buddy Gabe, is asking,

372
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Loki, when the shit are you bringing your game to our demo feedback night and or our next game jam?

373
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I would love to. No, seriously, I was looking at your progressive game jam stuff,

374
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
and I like the idea that's over the course of nine months.

375
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
But here's the thing. It's like I can't get away from my house.

376
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Like the time. The timing, unfortunately, is not working for me.

377
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Just my new schedule and everything. Like I work until seven fifteen at night.

378
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
And then that's it. I come home and I can't really leave the house because my wife's like,

379
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
well, I've been watching the kids all evening and you can't go anywhere.

380
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So it's kids and we're lucky to have you here.

381
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, if the family wasn't there, then yeah, sure. I'd love to come out to, you know,

382
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
the gaming night and do all that stuff and also to the progressive game jam.

383
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I'm really interested in that, but I just can't go to that.

384
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And it's disappointing because I think it'd be a lot of fun,

385
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
but I just can't go because I am trapped in my house and at my work.

386
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So that's about it.

387
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
All right. Well, let's talk about my gaming week.

388
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Let's see. What have I been up to this week in games? Actually quite a bit.

389
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I've been getting back into doing some live streams.

390
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I did a few live streams of Fantasy 14.

391
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I did some Rocket League. I think I did Diablo the other night.

392
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Just, you know, the typical type of stuff I might play in a week.

393
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I was giving a little bit of testing to the YouTube games because, you know,

394
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
that just launched this week.

395
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
So I just wanted to see kind of like what were the differences?

396
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
What were some of the pros and cons?

397
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I don't know why people had such trouble finding gaming-related videos on YouTube.

398
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I've never had that problem before.

399
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Yeah, I've never had that problem either.

400
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It was like, we've solved the problem you never had.

401
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Yeah. I think they just want to compete with Twitch, which I understand.

402
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
I've been saying for forever on the show, Twitch needs a viable competitor.

403
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And I just think anybody that's really tried to compete against them is usually just type a lie.

404
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I know there's been hit boxes and other things, but nothing's really,

405
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
really kind of stepped up with that volume the way that, you know, now YouTube has.

406
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I am liking the fact that they totally are incorporating the live content ID system.

407
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I mean, that's awesome that it just fucks up your shit live.

408
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Well, but I haven't had any problem with it yet.

409
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I mean, I don't know, you know, again, I haven't tried to play a Nintendo game,

410
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
but it seems fine so far.

411
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Nothing's happened incorrectly yet.

412
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And, you know, there's a lot of games being run by a lot of these other streams

413
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
that don't seem to be having issues.

414
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
So, you know, we'll see.

415
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I don't know.

416
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
But, yeah, I think that whole content ID on the go or a live thing is a little bit like,

417
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I don't know about that.

418
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I don't know how that would work.

419
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I mean, is it just going to be looking for music or something?

420
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I mean, I'm assuming it's looking for music, which to be fair, Twitch has their own.

421
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I mean, they don't do it live, but, you know, they mute the whole on demand things

422
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
if there's the copyrighted music in there, which, you know, can screw up

423
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
if you're playing a game that just happens to have some licensed music in the background.

424
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
So that can sometimes be unfortunate.

425
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But I don't know.

426
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I feel like I got some really good quality out of the YouTube streams

427
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
because I know YouTube will do up to 60 frames a second.

428
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And I feel like the Rocket League one especially that I did over there looked really, really good.

429
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
So I was getting some good quality.

430
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But Twitch, I think Twitch also right now has some better discoverability.

431
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Like, I think their friends list is really robust

432
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and they have a tendency to be able to kind of feature things.

433
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I feel like on YouTube right now they're featuring all the same people

434
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and it's all the same channels.

435
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's all the ones that already have millions and billions of subscribers.

436
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But on Twitch you're more likely to find a channel you haven't heard of yet.

437
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
And so I think that's why right now I kind of prefer Twitch a little bit

438
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
is for the discoverability portion of it.

439
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But YouTube's getting their big toe in the water.

440
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
It'll be interesting to see how that all stabilizes.

441
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
And I don't know. I still haven't decided do I want to really invest in, you know,

442
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
because I need to pick one or the other if I want to try and grow a subscriber base or whatever.

443
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I really need to pick. Do I want to go Twitch or do I want to go YouTube?

444
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
So we'll kind of see. I don't know.

445
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I know Twitch has a big convention coming out

446
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and they're probably going to really tease a lot of features

447
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
that are going to want to really try to keep a lot of their people team Twitch

448
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
and not defecting over to YouTube.

449
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
So we'll see.

450
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But this competition element is really interesting as far as I'm concerned.

451
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Stream to both simultaneously.

452
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Well I know a lot of people stream to Twitch and then put their archive on YouTube

453
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and that's probably the way to do it.

454
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I don't know.

455
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Nasan Games in our chat says,

456
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Don't play Super Mario Maker on YouTube.

457
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Nintendo is already claiming ownership on all of it.

458
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
See, yeah, that's kind of shady to me.

459
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I don't know if I can get down with that.

460
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And it's sad because really that, like I got to be honest,

461
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
that is, seeing the videos out there of people making stuff on Mario Maker

462
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
is actually getting me interested in it.

463
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So it's advertising for your game.

464
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You're being very ungrateful about it.

465
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I mean, I have not seen any advertisement from Nintendo for Mario Maker.

466
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So it's kind of bold of you to not spend much money on advertising this

467
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
yet claiming ownership on these videos that are advertising for you.

468
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Let's see.

469
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
And then also looking at more comments in chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

470
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Some people complaining about Twitch Con.

471
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Ugh, another con, which I kind of can see that.

472
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It's getting a little con heavy and I don't know.

473
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Let's see.

474
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And then Murderface says as a side note, fuck Nintendo for claiming like that.

475
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Technically the game isn't out.

476
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So I can see where maybe they're a little bit frustrated.

477
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But at the same time, when the game is out on September 11th,

478
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I would hope that they back off on that.

479
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I was kind of surprised that there was all these people playing it already.

480
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
But I guess it shouldn't be.

481
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's all the press copies, I'm sure.

482
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And then, let's see, also, bonds006 suggests for the next Splatoon,

483
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Team Twitch versus Team YouTube.

484
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Hey, that might be a fun one to get into.

485
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,000
We'll see.

486
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
But anyway, so I've been streaming games on some of those sites.

487
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
And then one that I did on Twitch the other day,

488
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
because Twitch is still built into the PlayStation 4,

489
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
which is awfully convenient, I must say.

490
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'm sure PlayStation 4 will get the YouTube support and a firmware update.

491
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
But for right now, you can only really do the Twitch or Ustream,

492
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
which we don't even know.

493
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Gaming on Ustream is not really a thing.

494
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
There's too many ads on Ustream for me.

495
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And I know it's what Travis uses to do his show,

496
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
but he's also not a gaming show, and it's a little different.

497
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Anyway, so as far as Twitch goes, I was streaming Until Dawn,

498
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
which Shane picked up, and he's a big fan of the scary games.

499
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
And he's been playing it, I think, with Flaco Jones and Mrs. Flaco Jones.

500
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
They've been playing Until Dawn very late at night.

501
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And so Shane was like, you have to play.

502
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You have to play.

503
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And you know how insistent he can be sometimes,

504
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
and especially because you all know how I feel about scary games,

505
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
and I usually flip out and all that stuff.

506
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
So he got me to play some Until Dawn.

507
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
The good news is it was just like the first little chapter,

508
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
so it wasn't too scary, but there were some super cheap jumpscares.

509
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And just some early impressions on the game.

510
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I think it looks really good.

511
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The game element itself seems very simple

512
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
because you're basically choosing do you want to go this way or that way or do nothing.

513
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And then, of course, there's a lot of that.

514
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
But then there's also, okay, you're in a scene,

515
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and can you find the hidden objects in the scene to investigate?

516
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And then there was some little action-oriented things.

517
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
There's a lot of quick-time events, a lot of quick-time events.

518
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And you've got to aim the gun and shoot this thing as fast as you can,

519
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
which I'm sure later in the game you're trying to shoot a killer

520
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
or something like that to try and get away from him for a few extra moments.

521
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
But I did notice, I was like, okay, the story in some parts seems to be very heavy-handed.

522
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
There's the butterfly effect in the game,

523
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
and there's so much butterfly effect stuff.

524
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
It's like shoving it down your throat.

525
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You see a sign that's like,

526
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,000
did you know the Native Americans considered signs of butterflies to indicate duh-duh-duh-duh?

527
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And then it's like this whole system is like, okay, yes, I understand, developers.

528
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
The choices I make will have an impact later in the game.

529
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Yes, you made that very clear. I understand.

530
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Not very subtle.

531
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Not very subtle, no. Not in that regard.

532
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
But that's really one of the only complaints I can muster.

533
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Now what's going to happen is...

534
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I think it's going to be fun for a lot of people.

535
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
So what's going to happen is you think that it's just,

536
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
they're just trying to hint to you that it's all these,

537
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
you know, what you do is going to have effect at the end of the game,

538
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
but really it's because at the end of the game you fight a giant butterfly.

539
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
It's like Mothra, but it's a giant butterfly is the villain.

540
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
It's like, see, we told you it was foreshadowing.

541
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Dungeonbuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

542
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
thanks for not shooting the squirrel.

543
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Yes, there was a scene where I could shoot either like a bag of sand or a squirrel.

544
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
And I was like, I'm sorry, I'm not having dead animals in this game.

545
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Dead Hayden Petiniere or whatever, it's fine.

546
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Dead squirrel, no thank you.

547
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
If it's like most of the squirrels that I encounter where you're trying to avoid them,

548
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
the squirrel will just run in front of the bag as you shot it.

549
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's like, you are dumb. You are a dumb animal.

550
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
This didn't happen in the game, sadly.

551
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Let's see, more comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

552
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Dungeonbuster says, it's not super scary.

553
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
It's more about trying to keep everyone alive.

554
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Everyone could live depending on what you decide or everyone could die horribly.

555
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Not everyone lived in my first playthrough

556
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,000
and one character that I really didn't like survived, darn it.

557
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Yeah, that's what I'm hearing from a lot of people

558
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
is that nobody seems to be able to keep everybody alive on their first playthrough.

559
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
That, you know, some of the kids get messed up.

560
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So, I don't know.

561
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And then there's things about the game.

562
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
You know I don't like Saw, the Saw movies. I don't like that.

563
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
And I'm hearing about some of the controversial stuff in the game

564
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
and it sounds like a thing straight out of a Saw movie.

565
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And I'm just like, gross, no thanks, not really interested.

566
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
But that's me.

567
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I know there's a lot of you out there that really love that type of stuff

568
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
and I think you'll have a good time with it.

569
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It is very interesting to me how it kind of feels like Sony wrote this game off in a way

570
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and maybe it's because of how the order was received or what have you.

571
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But it seems like even though Sony kind of wrote this game off,

572
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
just because you're not seeing a lot of press for it,

573
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
it didn't get a lot of hype.

574
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
We saw a lot about it at E3 last year, but then it just kind of suddenly came out.

575
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Does it still have the move support?

576
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Because it was supposed to be a move game at one time.

577
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Actually, there are, I guess I could say this,

578
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
there are some scenes where it will suddenly come up and it says, don't move.

579
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
And it shows the light on your controller.

580
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And the assumption is that if you move your controller,

581
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
then you're going to screw up the scene.

582
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So yes, there are some things to do.

583
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
And you can actually play with motion controls, but I turned that off.

584
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So I guess so, yeah.

585
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Because you have the move controllers.

586
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Well, not on the PS4 though.

587
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
No, it works with the PS4.

588
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Does it?

589
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I didn't even try to hook that up and do that.

590
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
No, but I know it does have some of that motion control stuff built into it.

591
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So there's that.

592
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
So yeah, I know a lot of people are getting a kick out of that.

593
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So the word of mouth for that game has been really good.

594
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And I think it's going to end up doing more successfully than people thought it would.

595
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So I'm sure there will be an Until Dawn 2 at some point. We'll see.

596
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
As far as other games I played this week,

597
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
the new stuff that came out, I played VVVVV, which came out on PlayStation 4,

598
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
which is like the third time I've bought that game.

599
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But I really like that game.

600
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
It just takes me back to my Commodore 64 days and the soundtrack is so good.

601
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I was like, whatever, I'll pick it up on PlayStation 4.

602
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And the Mega Man collection was this week as well.

603
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And I had to pick that up.

604
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yes, I know people have their issues with the whole fact that 7 and 8 aren't there,

605
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
but I was like, you know what, I want to give this game a fair shot, check it out.

606
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And I got to say, they did a good job of porting the games to the PlayStation 4,

607
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the platform I picked it up on.

608
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
They run just like they would on the Nintendo, which, you know,

609
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
obviously you would hope that a console that's 30 years older than the games that it's running on,

610
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
or the games that are running on it, would run it flawlessly.

611
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And it does run really well.

612
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
And there's some filters you can put on the screen if you're into that sort of thing.

613
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And there's borders that are representative of the different games as well.

614
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
So that's cool.

615
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But what I also like is that they did do some stuff that was also outside just straight emulating the games.

616
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And, yeah, they have the museum and artwork, which I think is very customary for these disc collections.

617
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
But there's a challenge mode as well.

618
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I thought these modes were put together pretty well where, like, let's say, for example,

619
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
one of the challenges you do early on is a Mega Man boss rush.

620
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So you fight every boss in Mega Man 1 back to back to back.

621
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
And it's not anything super fancy.

622
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I think they're using a collection of ROM save states strung together to kind of do this.

623
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But it works really well.

624
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I was doing one challenge where you had to do the beams in Quick Man's stage without having the time stopper.

625
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
So, I mean, that sucks.

626
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But when you get to the end, there'll be like a little hole that you see on the screen that has the little galaxy effect behind it.

627
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And you fall in the hole and it goes flash, flash, flash.

628
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And then your character moves, flash, flash, flash.

629
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And then you're in another scene suddenly.

630
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,000
So you might go from that to suddenly the scene in Dr. Wily's castle where you're dodging the spike balls as you're falling.

631
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
So I thought that was kind of cool.

632
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
That was something a little different that wasn't necessarily in the older collection.

633
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And to put that whole very modern social gaming aspect on it, you know, they have the leaderboards, right?

634
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
But then you can also push a button and watch someone's video of them doing it.

635
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Like it saves the videos of the top 100 players or whatever actually accomplishing that feat so you can watch those on demand.

636
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And I thought that was really cool that they had that.

637
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
That is a feature that I remember was in Game Room on the Xbox 360.

638
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Not to keep bringing up how amazing Game Room was, but deal with it.

639
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Between this game and Game Room on the 360, it's like everything I wish Virtual Console actually was on the NES.

640
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
So yeah, I do think there's a little more to it than just on Virtual Console.

641
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:36,000
But if you already own all the Mega Man games on Virtual Console, will it be worth another $15 to get this?

642
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Do they really sell them to you?

643
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Not this collection, but all the games are on Virtual Console.

644
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But do you want to play $30 for nothing but emulation?

645
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Or do you want $15 for at least a couple little bells and whistles in this?

646
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Just a little bit of polish.

647
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Yeah, I think this is a better deal. That's how I feel.

648
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So let's see, over at live.vog, network.com, William Murderface reminding us that Diablo 3 Season 4 started Friday.

649
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
More grinding for all of us addicts. Yep, I just hit level 60 today on my Season 4 character.

650
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I might have had some power level help.

651
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Let's see, Real Raginator says $5 says that Mega Man 7 and Mega Man 8 will be DLC.

652
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You know, that would make a lot of sense.

653
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
That maybe they're going to add that on a little later. I don't know. We'll see how that works.

654
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,000
S.J.O. and Hunter Matt says really miss Game Room and Dungeon Buster saying Game Room really was a great concept.

655
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Bonds006 says I'll say this again, watching others play games is eh to me.

656
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I paid to play, not so much watch TV. Net & Life already have that job.

657
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I will say though, it is pretty cool because now you can see how they're getting these good times in Mega Man.

658
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And sometimes you learn something from it like, oh shit, I've been using the wrong weapon.

659
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Or, oh, you can cheese the shit out of this.

660
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Like, I didn't even realize, although it makes sense now that I'm watching it again, it's the same trick from Blaster Master.

661
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
But like when fighting the Yellow Devil from Mega Man 1, which is that giant stone thing with the red eye.

662
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:16,000
You can just, you use the elect beam and then you just pause, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause as the elect beam is going through the eye and kill him in one hit.

663
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And that's how everybody's getting like these 19 second times on the leaderboard.

664
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I was like, oh, so you can just cheese it.

665
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:35,000
So, that would be one, I guess one minor bitch complaint suggestion I might make is that on the challenge mode, turn pause off and make people actually earn it.

666
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But I guess you still see some other like speed running techniques that aren't, like it's not really cheesing and it's just the same thing people do in speed runs.

667
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Kind of glitching in some of this stuff. People doing that in some of the Mega Man 2 and other games.

668
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So, it's kind of neat. Anyway.

669
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
There you go. Phew. A lot of games to talk about this week for my gaming week.

670
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,000
But it's nice to be, nice to have a little time to play some games.

671
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Because this week, probably not so much with me going to Dragon Con.

672
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Although, hopefully I'll get to play some Vita or some 3DS on the plane. That's some hopes.

673
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And who knows? I know Dragon Con isn't a huge video gaming presence, but you never know.

674
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Sometimes there's some interesting stuff there and there might be some panels.

675
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
I think they're introducing Firefly online at Dragon Con.

676
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So, I'm sure that'll be insanely popular, but I might want to check that out.

677
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Anyway, that leads me into housekeeping for tonight.

678
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Of course, as I always say, Twitter.com slash OLR. We're also on Facebook.

679
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio. We appreciate all of those follows and likes and all that good stuff.

680
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
We will not be here next week with Dragon Con going on in the three-day weekend here in the States.

681
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,000
We will not be having a show on Sunday.

682
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Bobby Blackwolf, who's before us every Sunday night, will not be live either.

683
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So, it's a night off for the network.

684
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,000
But, you know, with the three-day weekend, even if you're not going to Dragon Con, a lot of people go to different places this weekend.

685
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I highly doubt there's going to be too many people around on Sunday night.

686
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
So, we'll be back in two weeks with an all-new Orange Launch Radio after tonight.

687
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Anyway, we still got plenty of this episode to get through, so let's get into some gaming news for the week, starting with Loki.

688
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
So, Yacht Club Games has announced that they're going to be releasing an Amiibo for Shovel Knight.

689
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And what's unique about this is unlike most of the Amiibos that are manufactured by Nintendo, they're actually doing the manufacturing themselves.

690
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Now, what's going to happen with this is you'll be able to use this with the Wii U and 3DS versions of Shovel Knight.

691
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And when you do that, it unlocks an exclusive co-op mode, which allows two players to play through the entire game cooperatively.

692
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And also with that, you can also customize your character and transfer that back and forth between the Wii U and 3DS versions by, of course, using the Amiibo.

693
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So, I was kind of disappointed. I thought originally when I heard about this that, you know, Shovel Knight was going to be added to, like, Smash Brothers or something like that.

694
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And I was like, ooh, that's pretty cool. But, I don't know.

695
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Maybe though, because they're doing the manufacturing and not Nintendo, that these won't be so hard to find.

696
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Although, they're still saying that they're going to be available in limited quantities.

697
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm hoping it's just under promising and over delivering, right?

698
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Well, we can hope. We can hope.

699
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:20,000
But, yeah. I am excited. I think it's great that Shovel Knight is getting an Amiibo. I'm very excited about that.

700
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But, yeah. I'm just hoping it's not going to be subject to all this same kind of crap we've been seeing with a lot of the other Amiibo.

701
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,000
And it better fucking not be retailer exclusive. Although, I don't think they would do that with all this song and dance for this particular Amiibo.

702
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I really don't think it's going to be retailer exclusive.

703
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
So, I think it'll be a little easier to find in that regard.

704
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
The only other thing I don't like about it is that they're locking co-op mode behind it in Shovel Knight.

705
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,000
And that seems... I don't know. I understand the whole pay for DLC. So, maybe if co-op mode were to be DLC, I kind of get it.

706
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,000
And so, maybe paying for the Amiibo is just how you pay for DLC.

707
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
But, I think there's that inherent worry that I'm not going to be able to find the fucking thing.

708
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Here's my thing, though. I understand with the Amiibos, I thought the whole point was to add additional functionality to it.

709
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,000
And I'm not talking about basically this being a key to unlock a mode or something in the game.

710
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm talking about, like, I thought it was supposed to be like in Smash Brothers where you train the character and you can take it and battle against other people and stuff like that.

711
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
You know, a little bit more expanded usage for this stuff.

712
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But, I don't know. They're just kind of like these, you know, okay, you can buy it for this game and it unlocks some shit.

713
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
That's it. That's it. It's just DLC with a figure.

714
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:44,000
At least some of the figures are really cute because I will confess, and some of you might have seen this on my Twitter and I know Loki went, ugh, when he saw it walking in the door.

715
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I bought two more Amiibo, which, you know, whatever. I got the silver Mario and the Zelda.

716
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
But, I got a little display thing for it that's actually, I think it's really cute.

717
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
It looks like the end of a Mario stage with the blocks going up and then a big flag.

718
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,000
And you can actually, the way it's constructed, there's actually little circular cutouts in the blocks so your Amiibo fit perfectly inside.

719
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And so they kind of display like they're standing on the blocks. It looks really cool.

720
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So, I bought that this week and so now I have this whole little display set up, which is cute, I think.

721
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,000
But, I like them mostly for the figures. I've barely been using the unlocks, to be honest.

722
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I don't really, I mean I leveled a couple of the characters in Smash Brothers, but not all of them.

723
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:38,000
And I've been doing that Amiibo tap thing, where you tap the Amiibo and you get the three minutes from different scenes and different NES games.

724
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
But it's like, it's kind of one of those, oh I play it once, oh neat, cool, and then that's it. I haven't really gone back to visit it.

725
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
So, that's it.

726
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah, I don't know. It's a cool figure, I guess.

727
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Act F does point out the Shovel Knight figure will work in any other game that supports it though, so it isn't locked to just one game.

728
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
So, who knows, maybe Shovel Knight will show up in Mario Maker or something, you never know.

729
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,000
I mean, that's cool if it does that, but it's just, I don't know, I just don't get the, I don't see the point.

730
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And it's been like a year since, almost a year since these have been out, and there hasn't been really anything that's been like, oh my goodness, I can't imagine playing games without this functionality.

731
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And that's kind of like how they were talking about it at first, it's like, you know, this is going to be like so amazing, it's going to just revolutionize everything.

732
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:46,000
No, it hasn't. It hasn't done anything. All it is is just, they knew, they got in on a fad because they knew people would collect this crap, just like they collect, you know, Skylanders or fucking Disney Infinity shit.

733
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
They want to get in on that.

734
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Okay, but to be fair, to be fair, even you want the Tron Disney Infinity figures.

735
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I want it, doesn't even mean I'm going to buy it. Yeah, that's a big thing, because like, I was all gung-ho about LEGO Dimensions, I'm like, yeah, okay, this is the game I'm going to get in on.

736
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:06,000
But you know what, I'm realistic. It's a fucking $100 game for the base game, and all the expansions are $40. Nope, I don't want it that much.

737
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You know, the same with the Tron stuff. Yeah, those figures look cool. Am I going to drop the money for it? Eh, I don't know, probably not.

738
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I mean, they look cool, and I might want one, doesn't mean I'm going to pay for it.

739
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:25,000
So, I just don't see the point aside, I mean, that's cool if you want to collect figures, fine, but like, people are just going fucking crazy over this shit.

740
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And I don't understand it, because there's really a side, you know what, Nintendo fine, if you want to put out a line of figures, hey, by all means do that.

741
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
But like, to say that this is some big breakthrough in gaming, it's not, it's just fucking ridiculous.

742
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,000
It's just a fad. It is, it's just a fad, it's just like the fucking Wii Balance Board, oh, this is going to revolutionize shit.

743
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It didn't fucking do anything, or like, you know, these, the Move controller, or the Kinect, it's going to revolutionize, it did not fucking do anything, it's just a fucking fad.

744
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I would agree that probably ten years from now, we're not going to have this Amiibo, Skylanders, Infinity Figures, Lego, we're probably not going to have this in ten years.

745
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
It'll probably be something worse.

746
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,000
No, yeah, I'm getting, oh, you, just.

747
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I think the figure thing is not, I think it's dated.

748
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Just wait, all it's going to take is a fucking Pokemon game.

749
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,000
There's going to be a fucking Pokemon game, and they're going to have an Amiibo for every goddamn Pokemon out there.

750
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
To the point where some people are like, fuck you.

751
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Nope, nope, people are not going to be all, fuck you, they're going to be like, I gotta buy them all!

752
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
But they're exclusive to Target, and Walmart, and Gamestop, and Nintendo, and I don't know.

753
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yeah, no, I'm not, I'm not.

754
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Denny's.

755
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I'm not here for that. Denny's.

756
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
299 Breakfast Slam.

757
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Super Meat Boy Amiibo is going to be exclusive to Denny's.

758
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
No, it would be, it would be like the really crappy Pokemon that nobody wants.

759
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
It would be Magikarp. Magikarp with the fish and chips played at Denny's.

760
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Magikarp, yeah.

761
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
And then it's a $20, why am I paying $20 for fish and chips at Denny's?

762
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Let's see, Dungeon Buster says Gamestop recently reported their fiscal quarter and collectibles helped their bottom line.

763
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Oh, I'm sure it did.

764
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Well, they gotta love this stuff because you can't just buy it online.

765
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And they have the exclusives and all that stuff.

766
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Anyway, speaking of what Nintendo's future could look like, we talked about a controversial patent,

767
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I don't remember if it was last week or two weeks ago on the show, the whole-

768
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It was last week.

769
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Last week, the whole, did you listen to last week's show?

770
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Nope, I just know the news.

771
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Well, surely, I guess some of our listeners are happy you weren't here to commentate on it.

772
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Some are sad you weren't here to commentate on it.

773
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I wanted to be here just because of the voice actors. I thought that would have been cool.

774
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That was a lot of fun. We appreciate those guys being on the show.

775
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
If you didn't hear the interview last week, go back and listen.

776
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I do need to go back and listen to the show.

777
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:01,000
But, so we had the patent thing last week about the fact that Nintendo may be taking the disk drive out of their next console.

778
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And we see how fabulously those digital-only ideas worked for Microsoft.

779
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,000
But, Nintendo is able to get away with some things that Microsoft cannot.

780
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Nintendo has more fanboys than Microsoft when it comes to gaming.

781
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I believe that to be true.

782
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
I know some will staunchly disagree with me on that.

783
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
But I believe there are more passionate Nintendo fanboys than there are Microsoft fanboys for the simple reason,

784
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
nobody that is 30 plus grew up playing Xbox.

785
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Microsoft was a late bloomer into the scene.

786
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Nintendo was around in the 80s.

787
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Microsoft wasn't in the gaming scene in the 80s.

788
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Big difference.

789
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
You would be surprised how much clout that has.

790
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Anyway, but that's not what I wanted to talk about again this week.

791
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I want to talk about some new patents that showed up.

792
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But again, remember, take it with a huge grain of salt.

793
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
This stuff can sometimes just be full of crap.

794
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
This is about achievement sharing.

795
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Some type of patent they have filed for achievement sharing.

796
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
It lets you record moments before you receive an achievement,

797
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
and then share the footage with other users,

798
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
and attach a message like Miiverse.

799
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Now, so far on the Wii U, there's no achievement system,

800
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
but of course on the 360, the Xbox One, PS3, or PS4, you do have that.

801
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I thought Xbox One had this already.

802
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It records in certain circumstances, and you can share achievements, but it doesn't...

803
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
I thought that was one of the whole things with the screenshot thing.

804
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I thought that was...

805
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
PlayStation 4 does that now.

806
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
In a firmware update, it takes a screenshot when you get the trophy.

807
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
But it's kind of what Nintendo might be doing with this patent,

808
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
is it's taking an idea that people are already doing.

809
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
And that is, when I get an achievement, I'm likely to hit the share button,

810
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,000
clip the video of me getting that moment, and then uploading the video.

811
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And how can you patent that if it's an idea someone has already had and done?

812
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Because if it's all streamlined, that's the difference.

813
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
That's lame.

814
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Well, but patent law in this country in general is a goddamn mess.

815
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
It is lame, yes.

816
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And we've talked about that way too many times on this show.

817
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
That's not the...

818
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So it looks like some type of achievement system very likely for the next Nintendo.

819
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It'd be cool if it's like Mario Kart 8 stuff,

820
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
where you have the little highlight video or something like that.

821
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
That'd be kind of neat.

822
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Yeah.

823
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Nasin Games in chat says,

824
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Xbox One can record certain good moments, but not all achievement-earning moments.

825
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Let's see.

826
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Also, Nintendo has filed some other patents.

827
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
And yeah, this is where I don't understand,

828
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
because some of the other consoles do have this,

829
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
but I'm just going to say what we're reading out there on the internet.

830
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
And, you know, as oftentimes goes with this legal stuff,

831
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
most people, like us, don't know what they're talking about with a lot of this legal stuff.

832
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,000
But it's still interesting and gives us clues as to what could be in the next Nintendo console.

833
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
So I guess there's going to be some type of in-game chat.

834
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
A monitor for displaying a game image or a television program,

835
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and a terminal device having a camera, a microphone, and a loudspeaker.

836
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
When a user's playing a game or viewing a television program by using the monitor,

837
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,000
another user can have chat by using the terminal device.

838
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
So that kind of makes me sound like,

839
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
that's what I said should have been in Virtual Console a long time ago.

840
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
When you're playing Virtual Console on the TV,

841
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
what if you're playing two-player mode with,

842
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
let's say I'm going to play Mario Brothers.

843
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I'm going to be Mario, and my buddy Ranma in New York City is going to be Luigi, as he often is.

844
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
So we're going to play Super Mario Brothers.

845
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Well, we'll play Super Mario Brothers on the TV,

846
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
but then we can chat with each other on the gamepad.

847
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I don't understand why that's not a thing in Virtual Console today.

848
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
I'm assuming the system isn't powerful enough.

849
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
That won't be an excuse the time the next console comes around.

850
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,000
So maybe, I'm certainly jumping to conclusions, tinfoil-hatting a little bit,

851
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,000
but maybe finally that thing I thought would have been inherent to the Wii U

852
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
that's going to be a part of Nintendo's successor console.

853
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It's not powerful enough to handle chat? Really?

854
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Video chat while you're doing a 30-year-old game? Apparently not.

855
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Well, I don't know about video chat, but like, I don't know, audio?

856
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
You would think. You would think.

857
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:10,000
And then also, let's see, multiple operating modes depending on the amount of power the user wants to use.

858
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
A full power mode, an eco-friendly mode, and a very low power mode that disables network features.

859
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
It communicates with an external apparatus via a network.

860
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
The information processing system is capable of operating in three operation modes.

861
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
A first mode, a second mode, which consumes less power,

862
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
and a third mode, which consumes less power than the second mode,

863
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
and where the communication via the network is not performed.

864
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Hmm. Very interesting.

865
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I don't know. That seems like, once again, it's...

866
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Whatever. I mean, that's fine.

867
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:43,000
I understand that people still dog Nintendo about, like, being, having their consoles be green stuff,

868
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
but that's like, I don't think that anybody out there is just like,

869
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
yeah, I can't really buy, you know, Wii U because it's just not green enough for me.

870
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I mean, is there seriously some hipster out there that actually does that?

871
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I mean, I just don't understand why invest in this.

872
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Go to our chat room for some more comments at live.vognetwork.com.

873
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Kaijudo says, wait, they showed the new Nintendo? I gots to see this.

874
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,000
No, no, no, no. These are just some patents that are out,

875
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:17,000
and a lot of people on the internet this week, including us, reading into these probably a little too much, however.

876
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
You know, because sometimes patents are filed just to protect ideas and protect patent trolls,

877
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:25,000
but sometimes you get things in here that come to reality.

878
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
How about just figure out a way to get third-party support for your system

879
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
and making sure that it can stay competitive with your competition out there?

880
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
How about concentrating that instead of fucking a low-power mode in a lower-power mode?

881
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I mean, that doesn't... You're spending the resources on the wrong thing.

882
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Well, I don't necessarily think that's true. But anyway, because you don't know what it's doing in those modes.

883
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:55,000
You know, the department that figures that out is completely different from the department that massages third-party companies and gets them on board.

884
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Yeah, but you know what gets them on board is having similar specs to the competition,

885
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
when they're like, eh, fuck it, we can have specs from last generation, and it's fine.

886
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Hold on. Let me read this other comment here.

887
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:13,000
NASA Games and Chat says, I think it might be a concern about Nintendo being such a family-friendly system, but that's just me.

888
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Fine. Don't video chat with strangers.

889
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Don't allow the video chat thing for people that aren't on your friends list where you have added them and they have added you.

890
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:30,000
But if, you know, if I have a friend and we consensually agree we're going to wave our dicks around on video chat while we play Duck Hunt, then whatever.

891
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
You could do that playing with Skype today. I mean, the technology's out there if people want to be perverts.

892
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Here's the sex gets into everything. Everything.

893
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Here is the problem with the family-friendly system thing.

894
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:51,000
You're assuming that parents listen to the companies that are making these devices and informing them on this stuff.

895
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
True.

896
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Who did they listen to when the device gets purchased?

897
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Who gets listened to?

898
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
The kid.

899
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It's bitching about not having Grand Theft Auto 5.

900
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I'm going to die if I don't have one.

901
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
They're going to buy the system that has fucking Grand Theft Auto 5 or the next Call of Duty because that's what little Johnny wants.

902
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
It's not because it's family-friendly bullshit.

903
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
They're going to be like, I don't know what system to buy, but he wants Call of Duty.

904
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Does this play Call of Duty?

905
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
No, but it plays Mario.

906
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Well, he wants Call of Duty, so I'm going to pick up that one.

907
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
The PlayStation 4, the Xbox One.

908
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I'm going to pick up that one.

909
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
That is what sells the fucking systems.

910
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Catering the family-friendly, I understand there's some families out there that want to spend their money on this type of thing.

911
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
It's not working for you.

912
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
You need to get out of that.

913
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
That was the whole problem with the GameCube and the Wii.

914
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,000
It's like it was pegged as family-friendly so it couldn't break into that part of the market.

915
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Get over that.

916
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Make your system friendly for everyone.

917
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I think that there's enough stuff out there, enough measures where people can make it family-friendly for their kids, but they're not going to do it anyway.

918
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
So who cares?

919
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Alright, let's move on.

920
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
We've got plenty of other gaming news.

921
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,000
See, you think when there's only two of us here it's going to be a short show and then look at it.

922
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
We're an hour and fifteen minutes in.

923
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
It's not because of Nintendo, it's because they're stupid and some of their ideals.

924
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I just don't get it.

925
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Admit it, you want the Wii U Mario Maker console.

926
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
I saw you tweet about it.

927
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I can't afford it, but I would love to play Mario Maker because that looks like fun.

928
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
But I'm not going to buy it because it's Nintendo or it's family-friendly.

929
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
I'm buying it because Mario Maker looks fun.

930
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
If Mario Maker was on Steam, I'd buy it on Steam.

931
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Simple as that.

932
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Moving on.

933
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Alright, so Mighty No. 9.

934
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Of course, remember, it's not coming out this year.

935
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It was supposed to be coming out next month, but eh, delays.

936
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So with that though, they're going to be putting out an exclusive trial that's going to run from September 15th for a full month on PC.

937
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:57,000
You'll have access to four levels, one of which hasn't been playable before, and six challenge modes.

938
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Yeah, so they're basically saying that all relevant cutscenes are included since the single player is basically done.

939
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And yeah, so you'll get to check it out.

940
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
And then also of course, backers will get Mighty Gunvolt on Steam as well.

941
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Well good. I know a lot of people were very upset with the whole delays and the fact that people are playing Mighty No. 9, but not them.

942
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Because there was no trial or anything like that out there, so I'm glad that they decided to put out whatever demo they're taking to trade shows and put it out there for their backers.

943
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,000
That's nice.

944
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,000
That's good.

945
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I'd like to play the game at some point and check it out.

946
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
I did not back the game, so I have to wait, but I'm excited to give it a try.

947
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I will say this, maybe this was an unintended perk of the Mega Man Legacy Collection, but it's making me more excited for these types of games again.

948
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
And I want to check out Mighty No. 9.

949
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Yeah, so I don't know. It looks pretty cool.

950
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Yeah.

951
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Alright, well moving on. This is kind of interesting with impacts and so forth.

952
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Shenmue 3, apparently, having an impact on the sales of a particular gaming console, but it's not the PlayStation 4.

953
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,000
You think people would be excited about Shenmue 3 and maybe making the plunge and getting a PlayStation 4, but the actual effect it's having?

954
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Dreamcast sales are going up.

955
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Alright, now hold on. At least that's the headline that's running around the internet right now.

956
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
But there are some, like, way hold on.

957
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Double their sales! Two consoles have been sold!

958
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yeah, two consoles have been sold instead of one.

959
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
It's according to one indie game shop.

960
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:47,000
So, even though you're seeing this headline everywhere on the internet right now, it's based off of one retailer in an interview with MVC that they were able to move 20 Dreamcast units in one week, and that's because of the success of Shenmue 3's Kickstarter.

961
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Now let me ask you this, Loki.

962
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Were there any new Dreamcast exploits discovered this week?

963
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Like, are people getting things running on it now that weren't running on it before?

964
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Or is it really Shenmue hype? Or is there something people don't know about that's really moving these units?

965
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:11,000
I don't know. Maybe they just realized how awesome a Dreamcast is, but I don't think it's necessarily Shenmue.

966
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I mean, if you're hyped about Shenmue 3 right now, then you've probably played the other two.

967
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Like, I've never played the other two. I'm not hyped about Shenmue 3.

968
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I'm certainly not going to go buy a Dreamcast to play those.

969
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I own a Dreamcast, and I'm certainly not going to go try to find Shenmue 1 and 2.

970
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Did they even make Shenmue 2 on the Dreamcast, or is that just on Xbox?

971
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Um, oh god, it's been forever. I had only seen it on Xbox, so I don't remember.

972
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Whatever. It doesn't matter, so...

973
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
SG100Matt says Xbox only.

974
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Okay, so I doubt that's the case. And why is this guy sitting on 20 Dreamcasts anyways?

975
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
He's probably glad to get that shit off the shelf.

976
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And why is that news? That is not fucking news.

977
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
That's because gaming journalism, copy-paste, headline-headline,

978
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Shenmue moves Dreamcast consoles in one shop.

979
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
20 of them.

980
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Uh, let's see. You know what? Let's get, like, all five of our listeners to go buy Atari 2600s this week.

981
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:22,000
And we'll run a headline that says Atari 2600 sales have spiked because of OLR.

982
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Naming it the console of the millennia. I don't know what it is.

983
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But we'll sell five more, and then it's going to be a headline on Kotaku tomorrow.

984
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
How about we just tell our listeners not to buy Metal Gear Solid 5,

985
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:40,000
and just say because of Konami sucking, Metal Gear Solid 5 is going to tank. I don't know.

986
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Act F says, Sky, but I already have an Atari 2600. Buy another one.

987
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Buy two.

988
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:51,000
The one you have will break soon enough. Dungeon Buster says Sears would be proud.

989
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Yes, we felt bad for Sears this week, so we're encouraging sales of the Atari 2600.

990
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I did want to kind of get a Nintendo, but I don't know, like,

991
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I think I'd probably have to get those, like, knockoff Nintendo systems that actually have HDMI out and stuff like that,

992
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
because it's just going to be too hard to get it to run on my TV.

993
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Akuma JP in our chat saying, over in Japan, where he's at,

994
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I must say the Dreamcast is selling in second-hand shops here. Price is 200% now.

995
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
So maybe this is an international phenomenon.

996
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
I don't know.

997
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
But see, in Japan, they all said they have Hello Kitty Dreamcasts in Japan.

998
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
So, I mean, I want to get one of those.

999
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It just doesn't, just because you interview one shop doesn't make it a thing.

1000
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It's just...

1001
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Hmm. You know what they say. But, yeah, whatever.

1002
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
All right, let's move on with another story, Logie.

1003
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase search.

1004
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,000
So I don't know if this is good news or bad news, but Mega64 is going to be developing games now.

1005
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:02,000
You may remember them from, you know, acting like asses on YouTube and doing silly videos,

1006
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
but, yes, now they're going to be making video games.

1007
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I don't know if this means that they're going to actually make, like, a Mega64 game,

1008
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,000
if this is going to be kind of similar to, like, the Penny Arcade games.

1009
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Don't know. But, yay, someone else making games.

1010
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,000
This just in, though, anybody can really make games, and the tools out there are free to get.

1011
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
So, yeah.

1012
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
But, hey, Mega64.

1013
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Um, congrats on them doing, you know, going from, you know, indie production stuff to some of this really, really big stuff.

1014
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I think that's really cool.

1015
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
I mean, I don't know. I hope their game's good.

1016
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
We'll see.

1017
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
We'll see.

1018
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
All right. I'm just looking at some of the comments in chat.

1019
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
sj100matt says, do they still do their silly video shtick? I haven't watched them in years.

1020
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Yeah, they still do their silly video shtick.

1021
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I don't even know if I should tell this story. I'm going to get myself in trouble, but whatever.

1022
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Nobody listens to this show. It won't be a problem.

1023
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
So, I am not familiar with these guys' things at all.

1024
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Save that one Nintendo thing that they did.

1025
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,000
They did, like, a Nintendo announcement video a couple years ago.

1026
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Yeah, the Reggie one, where he was, like, a robot.

1027
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Okay. So, I was with a friend at E3, and I think this was the major year, like, the 2006 year.

1028
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
The Paris Hilton year and the Wii year and all that stuff.

1029
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
And my friend, like, totally recognized these guys and was, like, fanboying out a little bit.

1030
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Was like, hey, and introduced himself.

1031
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:31,000
And then, you know, the guys were like, oh, hey.

1032
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And then I was like, hi there. I'm Rob.

1033
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
And, you know, and I didn't know who they were.

1034
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,000
And I was kind of like, and you are?

1035
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
And, like, dude was, like, super offended that I didn't know who they were.

1036
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
And I was kind of like, oh, sorry.

1037
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Oh, you're an asshole.

1038
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I didn't know if you're in the big leagues.

1039
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And, you know, to be fair, E3 is a very stressful time.

1040
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
There's a lot of stuff going on.

1041
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
You don't know if I caught the guy on a bad day, whatever.

1042
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
But I just was kind of like, oh, not everybody has humility in this industry.

1043
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I didn't notice your panties bunched up over there.

1044
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,000
So, that was, now, just unfortunately, now it's just everything I associate.

1045
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
When I hear about them, I'm like, oh, yeah, that's the guy that was super offended.

1046
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
I didn't know who he was.

1047
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Yeah, I know who you are. I just don't give a shit.

1048
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Oh, I'm sorry. Was I supposed to be...

1049
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
You know, again, I'm not trying...

1050
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Yeah, let me get down on one knee for you.

1051
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I'm not trying to, look, I'm not trying to start shit.

1052
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,000
It might have just been a bad time.

1053
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Maybe I misinterpreted something. I don't know. Whatever.

1054
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Shit happens.

1055
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
No, I'm not going to offend the female gender now.

1056
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I'm going to just stop.

1057
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I'll leave that internal thought there.

1058
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
All right, please don't offend people.

1059
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
All right, let's move on.

1060
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Let's talk about something that's super not offensive.

1061
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
How could you possibly be offended by free things?

1062
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Wait, Yaris was pretty offensive, actually.

1063
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Well, this is a lot better than Yaris, believe me.

1064
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
The announcement came out of PAX this week.

1065
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,000
You know, ArenaNet always seems to show up at PAX and do some different panels and so forth.

1066
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
And they actually announced today, or I'm sorry, yesterday, Saturday,

1067
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,000
that Guild Wars 2 is now free to download.

1068
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Guild Wars 2...

1069
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
See, usually when an MMO goes what they call free to play,

1070
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
it's because that MMO is charging a monthly fee,

1071
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
and now they are no longer charging such fee.

1072
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
But Guild Wars' model has always been,

1073
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
oh, you buy the box game, and then you get to play online.

1074
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
There's no monthly fee to play.

1075
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
That's the way it should be.

1076
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Yeah, well, but here's the thing now.

1077
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
With the original Guild Wars 2, you don't even have to buy the box.

1078
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
You can just go download it and play for free.

1079
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Why on earth would they do this?

1080
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Well, President Mike O'Brien said in the press release,

1081
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,000
in making Guild Wars 2 free,

1082
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
we're not switching business models to a traditional free to play game,

1083
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
and we're not aggressively monetizing free players through microtransactions.

1084
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
We're making the base game free because we're confident

1085
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
that anyone who loves Guild Wars 2 will consider buying Heart of Thorns,

1086
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
continuing their experience into the expansion and beyond

1087
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
with Living World and our newly announced raids.

1088
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
We believe that if people love Guild Wars 2,

1089
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
they're going to buy the expansion pack.

1090
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
There you go.

1091
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Very interesting.

1092
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
So they're giving away the base game to try and drive sales of the expansion pack.

1093
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
That's pretty cool.

1094
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Now, it should be said, Guild Wars 2 does have microtransactions in it,

1095
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
which has always been a little bit controversial

1096
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
because you are buying the box game and so forth,

1097
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
and my understanding is the people that bought the boxed game

1098
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
are going to get these different level perks,

1099
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
and I don't know all the specifics.

1100
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I haven't played Guild Wars 2 in a long time myself.

1101
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
But I did buy it a long time ago when it first came out.

1102
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
The boxed players that did pay the money for it are going to get some perks

1103
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
that the free players aren't going to have.

1104
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
So the free players are still going to have some restrictions,

1105
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
but they're going to be able to level all the way to the cap in the first game

1106
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
and pretty much do everything that you could do in the first game.

1107
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
It's just they might be limited on some of the cosmetic stuff and all that.

1108
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
So kind of neat.

1109
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I think there will be a lot of people that are going to take advantage of that

1110
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
and checking out Guild Wars.

1111
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Bonds006 says,

1112
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
LOL, I guess because Microsoft gave it to me for free.

1113
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So maybe Guild Wars was already free in some bundles and so forth.

1114
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
ActDef says,

1115
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
It's basically like when Team Fortress 2 went free.

1116
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Yeah, it sounds like it might be very similar.

1117
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
There you go.

1118
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I think there will be a lot of people wanting to check out Guild Wars 2.

1119
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
It's certainly not a bad MMO by any means.

1120
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I think this is pretty awesome.

1121
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I think there will be a lot of people checking this out.

1122
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Your move.

1123
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Funny because I was referencing Hoard House earlier in the show,

1124
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
but I said that one thing they ought to do in World of Warcraft

1125
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
is just make vanilla Warcraft free.

1126
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
They've got like five expansions to make money on to sell things out of the box.

1127
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Make basic Warcraft free.

1128
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
How do you make the first or second expansion free too?

1129
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Yeah, why not?

1130
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I don't understand why Warcraft doesn't go free under the same idea,

1131
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
but who knows?

1132
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Because they've got that sweet movie cash coming.

1133
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Yeah, I guess that's true too.

1134
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
By the way, it's not on our show roll tonight,

1135
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
but did you see the whole leaked footage out of Russia?

1136
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I tried to watch the leaked footage.

1137
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
It was crap-tastic quality.

1138
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
It looks like they changed the trailer dramatically from what we saw at BlizzCon a year ago.

1139
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Because remember, I don't understand what's been taking so fucking long

1140
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
for them to put out some footage for public consumption

1141
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
because we saw a trailer for the movie in November of last year at BlizzCon.

1142
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
It looked fine to me. It looked better than fine. It looked great.

1143
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I guess maybe some of the effects might have been rough around the edges,

1144
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,000
so they say. I didn't notice in the trailer.

1145
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Maybe they figure if they put it on YouTube, you're going to have people going frame by frame

1146
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
that are very, very analytical or so forth,

1147
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
but I think it's been far too long for them to not put something more hype out there.

1148
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
So it'll be interesting to see if this trailer leak forces their hand,

1149
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:00,000
kind of like that Suicide Squad thing that came out of Comic-Con.

1150
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Remember Warner Brothers got all pissed?

1151
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Somebody brought a camera out.

1152
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:08,000
You got your criminals for watching.

1153
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Oh my god, fucking babies.

1154
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
It's a fucking movie trailer. It got me hyped about your stupid movie.

1155
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
When it leaked out.

1156
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,000
You know what? People fucking leaked that shit out on purpose all the fucking time.

1157
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:29,000
But you know what? Some movie studios don't act like little whiny bitches when that happens.

1158
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Honest to god, when I saw the Suicide Squad trailer, I was like,

1159
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
this doesn't look as crappy as I was expecting.

1160
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And I think that's the way a lot of people reacted to it.

1161
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Will Smith is Will Smith. That's fine.

1162
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
This doesn't look as crappy as I thought it would.

1163
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
I just don't understand why they were little whiny bitches about it.

1164
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Like fucking Ryan Reynolds and Fox and shit releasing the Deadpool stuff.

1165
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
They're like, hey, just understand it's going to take us some time to release the full thing.

1166
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Glad you like the leaked trailer.

1167
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
But they weren't bitches about it.

1168
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I just don't understand. Warner Brothers, they have like some serious issues.

1169
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:04,000
SSG100Matt in our chatroom at live.voggenailware.com says,

1170
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Loki is making up for lost rants from last week. Love it.

1171
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
You know, Alan was sitting on the couch last week because he actually had the night off.

1172
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
He actually had a couple rants in him about some other things.

1173
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:16,000
But Loki, making up for lost time.

1174
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I'm sorry. It's just like, I just don't get it.

1175
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
It was like even, I'm not alone in this opinion.

1176
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I mean, everybody seemed to be just like, what the fuck is your big deal?

1177
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Like, who cares? A trailer leaked.

1178
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Ooh, it's not like a big secret. It's not like the movie leaked, okay?

1179
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
It's a fucking trailer.

1180
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
It's like, calm down.

1181
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

1182
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
and check out some things that will be coming soon to a gaming console near you.

1183
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
A lot sooner than the Warcraft movie, that's for sure.

1184
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Hello, it's the fourth quarter because fourth quarter always starts early.

1185
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
It's November to, or September to November.

1186
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
So, starting the fourth quarter off,

1187
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4,

1188
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Xbox 360, and Xbox One and PC.

1189
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
Nobunaga's Ambitions, Sphere of Influence on PlayStation 4.

1190
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Also, getting a physical release, Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons on PlayStation 4.

1191
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Mad Max coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and on PC.

1192
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
It looks like also Brothers is going to be coming out on Xbox One as well.

1193
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Let's see here.

1194
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
And Company of Heroes, The British Forces,

1195
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
looks like an expansion will be coming out on PC.

1196
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
All right.

1197
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Looking in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,

1198
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Alan, and Loki, since I know you didn't have a chance to listen to last week's show,

1199
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Alan is giving you a taste of what you missed last week.

1200
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Alan says,

1201
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I may have said BioWare got lost up its own ass

1202
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
and referred to Konami as toilet clowns.

1203
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Oh, and I was going to mention also,

1204
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Danganronpa, another episode, Ultra Despair Girls,

1205
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,000
is going to be coming out on the Vita.

1206
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Yes, still Vita games coming out.

1207
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
See Alan's chat reminding us the contents of opinions of Alan Alchemy

1208
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
are not those of vognetwork.com.

1209
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Well, that goes double for Loki, quite honestly.

1210
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
There it is.

1211
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
But they're probably right.

1212
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
All right.

1213
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Moving on.

1214
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Let's go to Japan and check out what's coming out there.

1215
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,000
In Japan, Metal Gear Solid 5, the Phantom Pain, of course,

1216
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
making its way out there as well in Japan on September the 2nd.

1217
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,000
There's also a special headset coming out for that.

1218
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Just a cool little extra bundle thing if you want to check that out.

1219
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Metal Gear Solid 5 also released on the Xbox One

1220
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
for ye few loyal Xbox One owners in Japan.

1221
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Nothing on the Wii U this week,

1222
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,000
though we're creeping closer and closer to the Mario Maker release in Japan,

1223
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
just like we're getting here.

1224
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
On the PlayStation Vita on the 3rd of September,

1225
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Infinite Stratos 2 Love and Purge comes out in Japan this week.

1226
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And lastly, on the 3DS this week,

1227
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Lego Ninjago Shadow of Ronin is out this week in Japan.

1228
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Seems like a pretty slow week outside of...

1229
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
I think it's Ninjago is how they pronounce it.

1230
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Oh, Ninjago.

1231
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Pretty slow week in Japan this week outside of Metal Gear Solid,

1232
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
which I'm sure is just because that's such a huge release,

1233
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
there's not a lot standing in its way this week.

1234
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Going over to Europe, since Dark Sakura isn't here tonight,

1235
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I will try to catch up on what's happening in Europe.

1236
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Let's see, on the 4th of September,

1237
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Broken Sword, The Serpent's Curse on Xbox One and PlayStation 4,

1238
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Nobunaga's Ambition, Spear of Influence on PC,

1239
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
as well as PlayStation 3 and 4.

1240
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And then on the 3rd of September,

1241
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Company of Heroes 2, The British Forces making its way to the PC.

1242
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Alright, just another story here from Loki,

1243
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.

1244
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Alright, so this is kind of cool.

1245
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I mean, I don't know, I thankfully have gotten myself out of the game on PC.

1246
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
But if you have a mobile device,

1247
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
you'll be happy to know Clicker Heroes is coming to iOS and Android.

1248
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Yes, now it can take over your lives away from your computer as well.

1249
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
And I'm assuming it's also free to play.

1250
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
So go download it.

1251
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I'm a little worried about falling down the Clicker Heroes hole on iOS.

1252
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Like, my PC addiction is bad enough.

1253
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Did you know I actually bought rubies on PC?

1254
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
But there's good reason.

1255
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I felt that I played it enough that I really needed to support the developers.

1256
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
So I threw $10 at it.

1257
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
So there's that.

1258
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
So I'm just worried about, do I really need to do that on the phone as well?

1259
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I don't know.

1260
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Alright.

1261
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Dark Sakura not here tonight, sadly.

1262
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
So that means, guess what, brace yourselves.

1263
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
I'm going to take the reins and cover the classic game of the week.

1264
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Every week, usually Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault

1265
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
and finds a game that she thinks,

1266
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
hey, you brats should be playing this game this week.

1267
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:54,000
But since she's not here, mwahahaha,

1268
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I am going to actually pick a game that I think you guys should consider playing this week.

1269
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,000
So the game that I have picked for the week this week

1270
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
is one of those games that I'm kind of surprised we haven't done before

1271
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
because it's been the subject of many an in-joke here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1272
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
But it is one of my very favorite 80s arcade games.

1273
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:19,000
This week I have picked Burger Time as the classic game of the week.

1274
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
That's right, Burger Time is the classic game of the week.

1275
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Some classic sounds there, all the little burger parts falling there all over the board.

1276
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Let's talk a little bit about Burger Time.

1277
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Burger Time was released by Data East in 1982

1278
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,000
and it actually came out for the Deco cassette system.

1279
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
The original title of the game was Hamburger,

1280
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:47,000
but the game name was changed in the US to Burger Time for whatever reason when the game came out.

1281
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Obviously what you do in Burger Time, you're running around this board

1282
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
and the board changes depending on what stage you're on,

1283
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
and you're trying to make these different parts of a burger fall to the bottom of the screen.

1284
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,000
So you might have like a bun at the top and then like a lettuce and tomato and meat

1285
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
and then a bottom bun thing, but you can cause these chain reactions.

1286
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
So if you drop the bun on the top, then it falls on the meat just below it,

1287
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
the lettuce below that, and then it falls all the way to the bottom.

1288
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
That's how you can actually clear boards quickly.

1289
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,000
But of course it's not just as simple as running over things and navigating the maze

1290
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
because you are being chased the entire time by baddies.

1291
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
There's of course a big egg that follows you that's Mr. Egg.

1292
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
You probably recognize that.

1293
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
There's also Mr. Hot Dog and Mr. Pickle.

1294
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:35,000
I guess Mr. Hot Dog is very upset that you're choosing to eat hamburgers instead of hot dogs.

1295
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
I don't know.

1296
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:43,000
You may or may not know the main protagonist of the game is named Peter Pepper.

1297
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Peter Pepper is the guy that you actually control in the game,

1298
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:53,000
and he can actually stun enemies by spraying, basically spraying them with pepper in the face.

1299
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Yes, early, early, early concept of pepper spray in 1982 to actually stun Mr. Hot Dog and Mr. Pickle.

1300
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:02,000
By the way, that's not the only way you can actually attack them.

1301
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
If they're actually on a piece of the lettuce or bun or something as it's falling,

1302
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
you can crush them that way as well.

1303
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
So that's kind of cool.

1304
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,000
There's only six different mazes in the game.

1305
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
So if you actually beat all six, then obviously as happened in most 80s games,

1306
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,000
you go back to the beginning and everything gets a little bit harder and a little bit faster.

1307
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And that's pretty much BurgerTime.

1308
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
I mean, it was from the 1980s, so it was a pretty simple concept.

1309
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:34,000
But it was really unique considering that this is, you know, 82 is still really early on.

1310
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
This is way before the NES is out, even though there was a version of this on the NES, by the way.

1311
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:46,000
And any of that stuff, it's still kind of a pretty complicated concept considering, you know,

1312
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
things like Space Invaders and Pac-Man and so forth were really the big games of the time.

1313
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:54,000
So yeah, I liked BurgerTime because it was very different.

1314
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,000
And it was like, what the hell, this is a game where you're building burgers.

1315
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
What the hell is this?

1316
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So that's just kind of why I liked it.

1317
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
And of course, you know I played this on the Commodore 64.

1318
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
You know I did.

1319
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And I'm sure a lot of you guys played this on different places.

1320
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Not only was it on the Commodore 64, it was on the Apple II, TRY-2600, BBC Micro, ColecoVision.

1321
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
There's a DOS version of it.

1322
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:23,000
It was on Mattel's system, the MSX, the NES, and the TI-99-4A.

1323
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,000
There was also a deluxe version on the Nintendo Game Boy, which is BurgerTime Deluxe.

1324
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
There's also a mobile phone version, and it's on Wii's Virtual Console.

1325
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
I think it was one of those, you know how they released a few arcade games to Virtual Console?

1326
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I think BurgerTime was one of them.

1327
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Now there were some sequels and ports that came later.

1328
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
There was an arcade spinoff called Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory.

1329
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I never played that one. I didn't realize it was a thing.

1330
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Also, Super BurgerTime, which I think I did play once.

1331
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I think that showed up at California Extreme one year.

1332
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Those are not wide releases, but Super BurgerTime has Peter Pepper Jr., and it's a two-player game.

1333
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,000
You can actually play two players at once.

1334
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
So that's pretty cool.

1335
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
There was also a console sequel called Diner.

1336
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:09,000
And that was when Intellivision was bought from Mattel by INTV Corp.

1337
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:16,000
And so they actually had a game called Diner where you kick balls of food so that they roll off platforms

1338
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
and onto a large plate at the bottom of the screen.

1339
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Kind of neat.

1340
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:24,000
By the way, this had nothing to do with the game Food Fight, which you might think is related, but it's not.

1341
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
I don't know if one inspired the other or what.

1342
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
You may have heard more recently of BurgerTime World Tour.

1343
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,000
BurgerTime World Tour was released for WiiWare as well as Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and Windows.

1344
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
That came out in 2011.

1345
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
That upgraded the concepts to 3D.

1346
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And so it came out on November 2nd on Xbox Live and November 15th on PlayStation Network.

1347
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
And then WiiWare, I think, came the next year in 2012.

1348
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
However, this is interesting.

1349
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
It ended up getting delisted in 2014.

1350
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
So it almost makes BurgerTime World Tour a classic as well because you can't get it anymore.

1351
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I don't know if there was a license.

1352
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I don't know if MonkeyPaw Games lost the license or what have you.

1353
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
They say that the Xbox Live version sold 8,000 units.

1354
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
That doesn't seem like a raving success.

1355
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
It doesn't seem awful.

1356
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
But, hmm.

1357
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Anyhow, if you hope for a sequel to BurgerTime in the future, Data East went bankrupt in 2003.

1358
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:31,000
G-Mode bought most of Data East's intellectual properties, which include BurgerTime, Super BurgerTime, and Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory.

1359
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
So if you want to see another BurgerTime game someday, you gotta hit up the folks over at G-Mode.

1360
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
There it is, your classic game of the week, BurgerTime!

1361
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Did you ever play BurgerTime, Loki?

1362
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Yeah, all the time.

1363
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Yeah, that's a fun game, isn't it?

1364
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Yep.

1365
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1366
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
ActDef says, didn't the NES version of BurgerTime support the power pad?

1367
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:02,000
You're actually getting it confused with short order and egg-splode.

1368
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Short order, you built burgers as well, but it wasn't the puzzle element.

1369
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It was more like Simon Says, where you would see the order and then you'd have to bounce around the pad to repeat the order, essentially.

1370
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,000
That was a little bit different.

1371
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
It's kind of funny, though, that you thought that was similar.

1372
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
You don't get a lot of video games about building hamburgers.

1373
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Tigerclaw says, hamburger was the original name of the game, probably because it was such a common word that they couldn't trademark it.

1374
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
And ActDef also expressing surprise that BurgerTime has never been a classic game of the week.

1375
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Well, it has now.

1376
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
There it is, your classic game of the week, BurgerTime.

1377
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
All right, with that, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.

1378
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:46,000
We've got plenty more show to come, including rapid fire news, your answers to the FUGL question of the week,

1379
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:54,000
mailbag, which we actually have at least one email tonight, and, of course, your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype,

1380
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Orange Lounge Radio, when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1381
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1382
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Live tonight, episode number 612 for August the 30th of 2015, already in progress.

1383
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:21,000
And as a reminder, we will not be here next week over Labor Day weekend, as I will be in Atlanta for DragonCon.

1384
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,000
And I hope to see many of you guys there.

1385
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And for those that can't be there, you can still participate with the panels in the podcasting track that Bobby and I will be on through Alpha Geek Radio.

1386
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
So shout-out to them, and thanks for doing that.

1387
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:39,000
So many of our listeners who can't be there in person can actually tune in and hear some of those panels that Bobby and I will be participating on.

1388
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And, you know, honestly, just all the great panels.

1389
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
We're going to be doing a lot of live shows this year. It seems like a lot of live podcasts.

1390
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I don't even know why we didn't think to bid to do it.

1391
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Well, probably the only one that could actually really do a show live is probably Bobby, because obviously you and Dark Soccer sadly aren't going to Atlanta.

1392
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,000
But, yeah, maybe in a future year, we'll be able to make something like that happen.

1393
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Maybe not even if it's necessarily OLR live, just some type of maybe hodgepodge show between Bobby, OLR, pod culture or something, critical myth.

1394
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Orange Black Wolf culture myth.

1395
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Orange Lounge is the new Black Wolf radio.

1396
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Something like that. Maybe. Who knows?

1397
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:32,000
All right. Well, while we brainstorm that over the next year, let's get back into some rapid-fire news. Low-key.

1398
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:39,000
So, hey, September is right around the corner, and with that, we've got some free games for you if you have Xbox Live Gold.

1399
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:48,000
So, for the month of September, you can look forward to, on Xbox One, the Dear God, and that's going to be available for the entire month of September.

1400
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Also, Tomb Raider Definitive Edition will be available from September 16th through October 15th, so that's not quite in September, but close enough.

1401
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Xbox 360, you'll be getting Battle Stations Pacific from the first half of September, and the second half, you'll be getting Crisis 3.

1402
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:14,000
So, yeah. And then also, How to Survive Storm Warning Edition is still available on Xbox One through the 15th, so go check it out.

1403
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,000
I tend to download all that stuff regardless.

1404
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I always forget on Xbox. I'm pretty good about doing it on PlayStation, but I always forget about the Xbox Ones.

1405
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Yeah. Let's see. So, let's see here.

1406
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Then, of course, with that, PlayStation Plus.

1407
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:40,000
We'll be getting some new games, including which was chosen by the actual users of PlayStation Plus, which is Grow Home.

1408
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:46,000
They have the selection between three different titles in Grow Home 1, so that'll be coming out on PlayStation 4.

1409
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:53,000
Also, for PlayStation 4, Super Time Force Ultra, Tesla Grad, and Xenodripper will be available.

1410
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Also, on PlayStation 3, Tesla Grad and Twisted Metal.

1411
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:02,000
And then for the Vita, Xenodripper and La Mulana EX.

1412
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:13,000
And because they weren't chosen to be free, Armello and Zombie Vikings will be 30% off for PlayStation Plus members for the first half of the month.

1413
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:19,000
And they're not doing that voting thing every month, they said. That's a lot of discounts, so they're not going to be doing that every month.

1414
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,000
That's too bad. I still think the free thing's kind of cool, though.

1415
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Yeah.

1416
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And then, of course, a little bit more was shown off on Minecraft Story Mode.

1417
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,000
And guess what? It's actually headed to Wii U. What? Minecraft on Wii U?

1418
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
But there's no actual Minecraft the game on Wii U.

1419
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,000
That's sad.

1420
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:44,000
You can get Minecraft knockoffs on Wii U, but no actual Minecraft the game.

1421
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Hey, if Minecraft Story Mode can run on Wii U, why can't Minecraft run?

1422
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
That's a great question.

1423
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:56,000
If the Vita can run Minecraft, why can't the Wii U run Minecraft? I mean, come on.

1424
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Fantastic question.

1425
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I don't know. No idea what the answer to that is, it's just not worth it.

1426
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
It's not worth it to develop for the amount of users on there.

1427
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:14,000
But yes, it'll be coming out on Wii U, and it's going to have unique control, of course, with the touchpad and everything.

1428
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
So, pretty cool.

1429
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:21,000
I'm not sure when that's going to be coming out, but hopefully later on you'll be able to check it out.

1430
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:26,000
And then with that, Witcher 3 has sold a whole ton of copies.

1431
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:32,000
It's only been out for six weeks, but it's already sold six million copies, and that's without any DRM.

1432
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
So take note, everybody.

1433
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Nice. Wow, that's a great sales figure.

1434
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Yep, that's awesome.

1435
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
And that's even without factoring in, I guess.

1436
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:50,000
They were saying that the good old game's performance is up 68% over the same six month time period.

1437
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
And that's without even factoring in Witcher 3.

1438
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Interesting.

1439
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Pretty cool.

1440
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:55,000
And last but not least...

1441
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
I need to really sit down and spend more quality time with that game.

1442
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:05,000
It came out during a busy period, but now that I'm not sucked into Final Fantasy XIV as much as I used to,

1443
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:08,000
I've got some extra time to sit down and really play some of that, I think.

1444
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:17,000
And last but not least, Grand Theft Auto V's video editor is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One next month.

1445
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Or I should say September. When in September? I'm not sure yet.

1446
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,000
But they're going to be adding that update, so you can check it out on there.

1447
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I think it's also supposed to come out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 at some point, but that's a little later on.

1448
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
But pretty cool to see that the video mode's going to be coming out as well.

1449
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I really need to go back and play more Grand Theft Auto V. I'm just so disappointed that they haven't released any story deals.

1450
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Me too.

1451
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Yes, absolutely. You need to do that.

1452
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
It's a great game, I don't understand why.

1453
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
No, I know. There's lots of great games I miss out on because there's only 24 hours a day.

1454
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Anyhow, I've got some stories for you guys as well.

1455
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Not coming to the 360 and the PlayStation 3.

1456
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I mean, you might be getting your Grand Theft Auto video editor, but you're not going to get Mortal Kombat X.

1457
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:12,000
That's right, Mortal Kombat X for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 has been officially cancelled by Warner Bros.

1458
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
In a statement they said, after months of development,

1459
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment has come to the regrettable conclusion that we cannot release Mortal Kombat X for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1460
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Please know our teams worked diligently to meet the quality standards set by the current-gen versions of the game.

1461
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:32,000
We were not able to get the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions to the quality expected of a Mortal Kombat game,

1462
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
and are very sorry for not being able to deliver the products as originally planned.

1463
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
You mean you're not going to release it like you did Batman?

1464
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Maybe you joke about that, but maybe that sure taught them a lesson that it better be damn good.

1465
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:50,000
I honestly did. When they delayed it for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, I kind of figured it wasn't coming out.

1466
01:32:50,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Well, and my thought is, honestly, is that the adoption rate of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I think, has been a lot more than maybe we saw in the last generation of people adopting PlayStation 3 from PlayStation 2 and so forth.

1467
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Maybe that's been a lot faster, that ratio, so maybe they don't really see the value input.

1468
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:15,000
I mean, because let's be real, most people that were interested in that game just fucking bought a PlayStation 4 and bought it.

1469
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I'm sure there are some people that are upset that are still on the last-gen consoles, but the reality is those newer consoles are going to look more and more hopefully affordable.

1470
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:38,000
There hopefully will be a price drop coming again soon, and then you can pick up one of those consoles, and then the year-end edition of Mortal Kombat X will be out that includes all that DLC.

1471
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
That's the one I've been waiting for.

1472
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
You know which version of Mortal Kombat I've been waiting for?

1473
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
What's that?

1474
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
PlayStation Plus Free Edition.

1475
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Well, didn't they give away Mortal Kombat 9?

1476
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,000
No, they gave out Injustice, which I still haven't played.

1477
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
That's right. They did.

1478
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:00,000
So there it is. Tigerclaw saying the short answer to this, the 360 and the PS3 isn't powerful enough.

1479
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
It's interesting they didn't figure that out a lot sooner, though.

1480
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I think that, yeah, I just think that they focused on the next-gen version, or the current-gen versions, and just, I don't think that they were ever going to put it out on those platforms.

1481
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
And if they did, it would have looked like Mortal Kombat on the Game Boy.

1482
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:32,000
It shouldn't be a surprise. Look at all these other games that they had earmarked for, you know, current-gen, or last-gen that just didn't happen, like Mad Max, or Dying Light, or Mortal Kombat, or, I don't know, probably Just Cause 3 at one point.

1483
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
You know, so it's, I'm kind of expecting it at this point.

1484
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:51,000
All right. Well, let's see. Moving on to another story here. This is interesting. There's a Mario Maker level that's out there, because, you know, Mario Maker is available for the press right now, and probably some early leaked copies as well.

1485
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:58,000
And there's a Mario Maker level out there that is actually trolling people. This is the one that Jason was referencing in the intro of the show.

1486
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:08,000
It actually says on the level notes that it's an all-Amiibo costume level, basically, and it's even in the featured section of the user-created courses.

1487
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:14,000
But when you load up the level, Mario suddenly spawns on a conveyor belt, and the following thing happens.

1488
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:40,000
And the best part about that, though, is they have, like, a block at the end that's supposed to have a costume in there, but it spawns after you've already cleared the level, which I thought was funny.

1489
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I thought that was funny as well. Yeah, I don't know. Some people are hearing a sound in the background that's, yeah, I don't know what that is. It's probably one of these other windows from one of these websites.

1490
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:57,000
I'm on making a sound in their ad or something, so I'll try to close these windows quickly. I don't know about that. Sorry, I'm hearing it too, but it's just a couple times.

1491
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
I thought it might have been the video for that level. We'll see.

1492
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Now, for these very naughty levels, Super Mario Maker is not going to have a filter, but there will be a report button in a statement by Nintendo.

1493
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:18,000
All players will be able to report any content they think is inappropriate by clicking a button in the game. The level will then be reviewed by Nintendo.

1494
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:31,000
So for all those of you that are getting ready to draw the giant penis and the giant boobs and butts in your Mario levels, watch out, because somebody's going to click the button and then Nintendo's going to shut you down.

1495
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:44,000
There it is. This is neat. Puzzle Quest. I kind of wondered what happened to that series. I knew they were doing stuff with Marvel, because they have the whole Marvel Puzzle Quest, but it's not going to end there.

1496
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
I guess they have Adventure Time. I didn't even know there was a Puzzle Quest Adventure Time.

1497
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,000
I remember hearing about that, yeah.

1498
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:56,000
D3Go is doing another Puzzle Quest game, and this one will be of great interest to at least one of our listeners.

1499
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I wonder if Ragenator's paying attention right now, because I think he's going to be into this, because in the next Puzzle Quest game, you will be doing Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest.

1500
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:16,000
That's right. It's a Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest game. It's going to be free to play, and you can build up creatures, spells, and artifacts in the game, I imagine.

1501
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,000
It's probably going to play out a lot like the Marvel Puzzle Quest does, just with Magic the Gathering cards.

1502
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Another company that went from being a game publisher to mobile developer. Ironically enough, at the time when I was working at the game distributor, they actually were repped by...

1503
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Well, the rep that was working for D3, he had actually worked for Konami at one time, too, so that was kind of funny. He repped for both.

1504
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:45,000
It's a small industry.

1505
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Small industry, yeah.

1506
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
You don't want to burn your bridges.

1507
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Except the credit for D3, they didn't act like complete assholes when they were exiting the market, whereas Konami, they're taking the extra step.

1508
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:05,000
All right, well, moving on to one more thing for me here, and this has to do with cover plates for the new 3DSs.

1509
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Sadly, it's not going to do us a lick of good here in the States, because we don't have the new 3DSs with interchangeable faceplates, because we only got the new 3DS XLs.

1510
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:22,000
But for those countries that have the tinier ones, namely Europe, there are some new cover plates coming out on November 27th.

1511
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:28,000
There is a cool little Yoshi one, with like a green and blue and yellow and pink Yoshi, you know, being all cute and Yoshi.

1512
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:34,000
But most importantly, a Hello Kitty faceplate coming out on November 27th.

1513
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:40,000
And this just makes me even more angry we don't have this here. No, I'm just kidding. I didn't even really want a new 3DS anyway.

1514
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
What's the reason for me to get a new 3DS? I still don't understand.

1515
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
It's new.

1516
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Oh. Oh! Oh!

1517
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Because it'll play those games that the 3DS-

1518
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Wait, all two games? One game? Xenoblade, that's already on the Wii anyway.

1519
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,000
That's what they're going to name the system. It's going to be the new Wii U.

1520
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
The new Wii U.

1521
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
It'll play all the Wii U games, but it's going to be more powerful.

1522
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,000
For a whole new Wii U.

1523
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
A whole new Wii U.

1524
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Yes, alright.

1525
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Let's get to the foogle question of the week. Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

1526
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Yes, there's still people on Google Plus.

1527
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,000
So we go to Facebook and Google Plus, you slam them together and you get foogle!

1528
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:39,000
You know, a lot of people this week talking about the Shovel Knight amiibo, and understandably so.

1529
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:50,000
It's pretty cool to see Nintendo embracing an indie game like that and putting it right alongside their flagship characters in a way, even if it's being handled a little bit differently.

1530
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:58,000
So this week we thought, you know, I don't want to ask about amiibo specifically, because I know some people are like, I'm not going to get any amiibo, screw those things.

1531
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Right, Logie?

1532
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
But I did want to talk about collectibles in general.

1533
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:11,000
With the Shovel Knight thing coming out, you know, that's a pretty, I don't want to say obscure, but it's certainly not a video game collectible I don't think anyone was expecting to be able to get.

1534
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:22,000
So I wanted to ask the listeners this week, what video game character that doesn't yet have a physical toy or collectible available, would you like to buy a collectible for?

1535
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:33,000
So let's get to some of the answers. We'll actually start with Google Plus tonight, and we'll say Retertainment starting us off, saying Henry Rollins was in Def Jam Fight for New York.

1536
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
Where's my Henry Rollins action figure?

1537
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I would actually think Henry Rollins has a brand strong enough where he would have a doll or something, but maybe not.

1538
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I could support that. I could support a Henry Rollins action figure.

1539
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:53,000
ActDeft in our chatroom says, well, I already have a Shovel Knight plush, and I'm definitely getting the amiibo, so I'm happy so far.

1540
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:00,000
But if there's a character I would like to have a collectible of, a character that hasn't gotten one yet, is TheWonderful101.

1541
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Seriously, figures or amiibo of those guys would be awesome.

1542
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:13,000
That was a really hyped Wii U game that, you know, I don't know if it met sales expectations or whatever because you haven't heard a lot about it since then, but I know there's a lot of hardcore fans of that game.

1543
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:20,000
That would make sense. That would make sense also as a character in Smash Brothers, but we'll see.

1544
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Brozime says, Sarah Bella from Skullgirls. Her design is too cool to not have an amiibo style figure.

1545
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Actually, on second thought, pretty much all of the Skullgirls need figures. That art is outstanding.

1546
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:38,000
That's a good thought there. So, the Skullgirls there.

1547
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Let's go over to Facebook where we have some different answers.

1548
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, where Fabrice A says, the car from Daytona USA is just so iconic to me.

1549
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I want one of those. Oh, and maybe Oppa Oppa. Those are some good answers, vehicles, as why not?

1550
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I bet Oppa Oppa probably has a figure.

1551
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:04,000
You would think there would be something. Sega really thrives on that nostalgia, but it's probably only in Japan.

1552
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
And Fabrice I know is in Belgium, so if he wants an Oppa Oppa, he's probably going to have to import it.

1553
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Silent Tom replied and said, I would love to have a wolf link in wolf form from the Twilight Princess amiibo.

1554
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
And, of course, a Tingle amiibo.

1555
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
And there is an Oppa Oppa figure.

1556
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Is there?

1557
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Yep, it's on Playasia.

1558
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,000
There you go.

1559
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,000
You can't buy it anymore, though.

1560
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Anyway, Tom finishes here saying, that would make the world a better place.

1561
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:36,000
If I can't get Loki in a Tingle costume, this is the next best thing, a Tingle amiibo.

1562
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
There was some guy that dressed up as Tingle. I saw the pictures from PAX.

1563
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Oh good, and I don't have to do it.

1564
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Andy R. said, for the longest time I really wanted the Edelweiss tank from Valkyria Chronicles.

1565
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Someone finally made a model kit, so I guess I already got what I wanted.

1566
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Now I just want the time to paint and assemble it.

1567
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Degenerajani says, I'm afraid I must live up to my name and say that I would push a bitch down the stairs for the great mighty poo toy.

1568
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:09,000
What would make that toy better is if it would sing the great mighty poo song.

1569
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
William Murderface says, my joke answer is Isaac from the Binding of Isaac.

1570
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:22,000
I love that William Murderface answered after the guy that wants the great mighty poo and said this is my joke answer.

1571
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
No.

1572
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:28,000
My serious answer is Sora, Riku, and Kairi from Kingdom Hearts.

1573
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I will say as far as figures go, the only time I ever saw something Kingdom Hearts related in Disneyland, I saw a statue of Sora in the off the page store.

1574
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
And I really regret to this day not buying it.

1575
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:52,000
But you know, I wasn't in, even though I was going to Disneyland a lot, I wasn't quite in the same financial place then as I am now.

1576
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
So I wish, really wish I would have picked that up, but I didn't.

1577
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,000
But I will say that there's at least like some statues and things like that.

1578
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:05,000
And I don't know if maybe Tokyo Sea or anything over in Japan might have a little more of a presence of those characters.

1579
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
But that's probably going to be your best luck.

1580
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:12,000
But I think, I bet you could find Kingdom Hearts stuff, just a lot of it's probably going to be imported from Japan.

1581
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:21,000
And lastly, Justin H says, Fallout 3 vault dweller in any power armor, though the Tesla armor would be the best.

1582
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:31,000
So some Fallout love there. I wonder if he's ordered the special Fallout 4 edition with the whole thing that you strap on your arm.

1583
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:35,000
You can put your phone in. That'll look crazy.

1584
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:41,000
What do they call that thing in Fallout I can't remember all of a sudden? The electronic device.

1585
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,000
It's like your second screen. That's it, the Pip-Boy limited edition thing.

1586
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Alright, that's it for our Frugal Question of the Week.

1587
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

1588
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Alright, Act Def saying that there are figures for Sora and Riku. There are play arts figures.

1589
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Not sure about Kairi though. That's right, I forgot about the play arts figures. So check that out.

1590
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:18,000
I saw a fan made one, but I want a Lego set for the Metal Slug.

1591
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:28,000
And then I also want a figure for Sofia the Third and Bionic Commando. Not the shitty hot dog arms Bionic Commando.

1592
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I'm talking about the old Bionic Commando.

1593
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I want the Guardian from the Guardian Legend because maybe this would encourage there to be a new Guardian Legend game.

1594
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
I think that would be the best thing ever.

1595
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:47,000
Outside of that I would want Sofia the vehicle from Blaster Master since somebody brought up vehicles earlier.

1596
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,000
That would be amazing. Or actually I want to say there might actually be Blaster Master stuff out there.

1597
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I actually think there was a Sofia something something like a long time ago.

1598
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
There is and I looked.

1599
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:58,000
Did you really?

1600
01:45:58,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Yep.

1601
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
And then lastly my third answer would be a number muncher.

1602
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I'm really throwing it old school. And some troggles while we're at it.

1603
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:11,000
I want a number muncher and some troggles and then I can actually put them on a board with numbers on it.

1604
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Come on. You don't want to see that.

1605
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:18,000
There it is our Fugu question of the week. Let's get back into some more gaming news.

1606
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
We will be opening up the Skype line later. 1877 Game OLR.

1607
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:26,000
I'm not sure you're aware, but they do have number munchers.

1608
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
You can purchase that for on the iTunes store.

1609
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Wait wait wait wait. Number munchers on the iTunes store? What?

1610
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Yeah the iOS store. Yep they have number munchers.

1611
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Oh like the classic game like reimagined or whatever?

1612
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Yeah like the classic game. I'm just trying to see some screenshots.

1613
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,000
That's kind of rad actually.

1614
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:52,000
I actually am just looking up Amazon.com right now and they actually have number munchers for PC and Mac.

1615
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
But this looks old. This looks old.

1616
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Yeah you're going to run on your PC.

1617
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Or it's going to run super speed where the troggles just fly around the board and fuck you up before you can figure out which of the numbers on the board are multiples of seven.

1618
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:13,000
It's the worst stage. Multiples of two, three. I can handle that. Multiples of seven? Fuck off.

1619
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Yeah they have a picture of the new version. It's kind of, I don't know, different.

1620
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:27,000
I have to check that out. I'm really curious now. I had no idea. Of course though that's how they get us thirty-somethings.

1621
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Hey guys remember when Math Blasters was awesome?

1622
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,000
So yeah I got to look some of this stuff up. Meanwhile Logie's going to get into some news.

1623
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:40,000
So other things you can spend your money on. It's DLC for certain games.

1624
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:47,000
In fact one game Galgun Double Piece which is out in Japan right now but not yet here.

1625
01:47:47,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Although they are supposed to be bringing it over here. You can actually get the DLC. It's the Pheromone Z DLC that allows you to zoom in and see through high school aged girls clothes for the low low price of ten thousand yen.

1626
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Which they say is about eighty-three dollars. Eighty-three dollars for DLC? That is a lot of money.

1627
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:12,000
That is a lot of money for DLC. Way too much money for DLC.

1628
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:21,000
So Galgun is like an on rail shooter game. I played the one on Xbox 360 and it was just silly. I mean I don't know.

1629
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:33,000
You have some gun that causes them to experience an ecstasy like state after seemingly orgasming. Thank you Japan.

1630
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:42,000
And then of course Galgun Double Piece is out in Japan right now on PlayStation 4 and Vita and is supposed to be coming out over here at some point.

1631
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:56,000
But yeah I don't know. That's weird. Also with that they're saying that that DLC not only does it allow you to see through their clothes but it makes all the girls flat chested or heavily endowed boob wise.

1632
01:48:56,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Lord. So that's special. But a hundred dollars? If Jamie were here and not at Weird Al I'm sure she would be saying something like this.

1633
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,000
That's not worth it for like that kind of money. That's just not worth it. That's too much money.

1634
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Maybe we'll get that included in the US. For that much money you could go see Real Boobs at a nearby juice bar. Right?

1635
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Yeah.

1636
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Alright. Moving on. I think this game is going to be a little more classy than this. Showing boobs and all that stuff.

1637
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,000
But no. This game looks like it's going to be pretty cool based on some of the previews we're seeing coming out of PAX.

1638
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:41,000
And it's Cliff Bleszinski's newest game. You know of course he was a big part of Unreal Tournament and Gears of War.

1639
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:49,000
And you heard about Project Blue Streak previously. Well we finally figured out what that really is over the weekend.

1640
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:56,000
It is a game called Lawbreakers. It is what they are calling a futuristic first person arena shooter.

1641
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:03,000
And there's a couple trailers that came out of this. There was like a CGI trailer basically. And there was a gameplay trailer.

1642
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:13,000
And the reason why they call it Lawbreakers is because it sounds like there's this whole thing about mankind has been recovering from a gravity altering cataclysmic event.

1643
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:18,000
So what is the law you're breaking? The law of gravity. So interesting.

1644
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:22,000
So now there's two factions. A peacekeeping organization and a crime syndicate that are at war with each other.

1645
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:28,000
And I was watching a little bit of the gameplay videos. I'm sure many of you were. And it was definitely featuring a lot of different characters.

1646
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:35,000
And it did look really like fluid kind of combat. Like one of them was kind of like swinging, like grappling hook type of stuff.

1647
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:40,000
And another one would go into a mode where it was like you could kind of heat detect people that were nearby.

1648
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:46,000
So it seems really cool. I gotta say, I was reminded an awful lot of Overwatch.

1649
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:51,000
Just with the whole different characterizations and like the super, the fact that everybody is very distinct.

1650
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Not that I'm saying the two games are the same because I think Overwatch definitely has a big Team Fortress feel to it with these characters.

1651
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Whereas this I think is probably going to be more of a melee kind of free for all sort of thing.

1652
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,000
But I'm very curious. I'm very curious to see where this goes. I don't play a lot of first person shooters.

1653
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:11,000
But I was interested in what I saw. So good luck to them as they continue development on Lawbreakers.

1654
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I liked a lot of the characters I was seeing in that gameplay video. It looked pretty cool.

1655
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Alright. So this has been a while and I kind of forgot all about it.

1656
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:28,000
But apparently the whole Vita false advertisement settlement thing. They have a class action lawsuit.

1657
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:34,000
That is supposed to be paying out soon. And I guess they've been sending out emails.

1658
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Now I remember it was, I guess they had a settlement site that went live in April and offered eligible Vita owners $25 in cash.

1659
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:48,000
$25 in Playstation store credit or three game bundles for Playstation 3 and the Vita.

1660
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:55,000
I think I picked the Playstation store credit. Although I haven't seen anything hit my email yet on that.

1661
01:51:55,000 --> 01:52:00,000
Oh yeah. Did I fill that out? Now I'm worried. Did I get in on that? I think I did.

1662
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Which begs the question, Red Bull. Where the fuck is my fucking vouchers for Red Bull?

1663
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:13,000
That's right. You were all excited. Because it doesn't actually give you wings.

1664
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:21,000
I'm not an idiot that thinks it's going to actually give me wings. But you promised me fucking $10 worth of Red Bull vouchers.

1665
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:26,000
And yes, I may have signed up myself and my other family members in my house even though they don't drink Red Bull.

1666
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:32,000
So I expect at least one set of vouchers coming my way and I still haven't seen that. I'm very disappointed.

1667
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:41,000
I still can't believe they have to give away free product because they lied and the product does not actually give you wings.

1668
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I'm sorry. It's funny. People are dumb. People are super dumb.

1669
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Why am I not gifted the power of flight for $2.50? I don't understand.

1670
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Oh god. Alright.

1671
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Marijuana gets you high.

1672
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Well moving on. This is a very interesting contest coming out of Hasbro. It's called The Next Great Game.

1673
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:19,000
And even though this is a little more about board games, let's be real. A lot of board games and video games get tied together a lot.

1674
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:24,000
A lot of great video games actually came from board games and a lot of great board games come from video game franchises.

1675
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Like I still kind of want that Mass Effect 3 risk set. Just saying.

1676
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Anyway, so this is more about board games. But Hasbro, they put out a lot of huge, huge board games.

1677
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:44,000
So until September 30th, 2015, you can actually go to their website and submit an entry.

1678
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
You know, what is The Next Great Board Game? It's nextgreatgamechallenge.com.

1679
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Now, they will announce five finalists on October 30th. But here's the kind of hilarious part.

1680
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:04,000
You don't get prize money if you're one of the five winners. You get to launch an Indiegogo campaign to raise funds for your concept.

1681
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
And I had the same reaction. I had the same reaction because I'm like, wait a minute.

1682
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Like, I would fucking need Hasbro to go launch my own Indiegogo concept. I mean, that's fucking stupid.

1683
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Here's the thing, and I had that same reaction at first, but then reading a little more into it, because I think Hasbro knew a lot of people would laugh at this.

1684
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Hasbro is promising to use its web presence to promote your project.

1685
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:39,000
So it's not, I mean, anybody can launch an Indiegogo, but to have Hasbro, a board game making company, actually promote that Indiegogo.

1686
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Okay, well that's something, I guess. It's a little more. It's more than nothing.

1687
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:49,000
But Hasbro and Indiegogo are apparently going to work with you to build the crowdfunding campaign page.

1688
01:54:49,000 --> 01:55:00,000
It will end on December 1st, 2015, and then a team of Hasbro game developers will scrutinize all the finalists and announce one grand prize winner in late December.

1689
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:12,000
And if you get the top prize, then Hasbro gives you $10,000 in your pocket, flies you to Rhode Island sometime between December and January to actually turn your idea into a reality.

1690
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:20,000
So it's kind of weird that the finalists all go to Indiegogo, and then Hasbro will kind of finally pick one and take it under its wings.

1691
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,000
But maybe they're trying to see how the public gauges the games. I don't know. Kind of weird.

1692
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:35,000
By the way, you may not know this, but Hasbro actually went to the public before. Everybody got to vote on a Monopoly board piece, right?

1693
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Or didn't we get to vote one off the island or something?

1694
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
We were removing one.

1695
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:45,000
They removed one in favor of another. Was it the thimble that got the boot? I don't remember.

1696
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:46,000
The boot that got the boot?

1697
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:50,000
No, did the boot get the boot? I don't know. Somebody in the chat probably knows.

1698
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:57,000
And then there actually was a new word added to Scrabble's dictionary. I didn't even know about that.

1699
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:05,000
The contest website's terms of service says that you do retain your ownership of all the intellectual property rights in the submission, copyrights, trademarks, and patents.

1700
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
But we retain the rights to make a shitty movie sequel to it.

1701
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:15,000
That's right. Maybe that's what they get as a shitty movie sequel. I don't know.

1702
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Now I want to know what word they added to the Scrabble dictionary as a result of that.

1703
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Meatcrub.

1704
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I'm going to research that while you do the next story, Logie.

1705
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Alright. So unfortunately, even though they launched the sequel to Angry Birds, Rovio is still cutting jobs.

1706
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:50,000
And they had to cut their jobs by 260 employees. And they're saying now that that's the total layoffs now between, I guess now in October, it's about 40% of the staff that they had in October of last year.

1707
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:57,000
So, I don't know. That's kind of, that sucks, I guess.

1708
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:08,000
They're saying right now that they've laid off some people back in December. That was 110 employees.

1709
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:15,000
So far, I think grand total is just the 260 jobs total.

1710
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:18,000
So, I don't know.

1711
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:22,000
But I guess they're still not doing as great with Angry Birds 2.

1712
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:27,000
But aren't they supposed to be having a movie coming out soon or something like that? Like, I give a shit about that. I don't know.

1713
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:33,000
But I thought there was supposed to be an Angry Birds movie coming out soon. Within like a year or so.

1714
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Alright. To do the results of what I was looking at earlier, they did add a cat piece to Monopoly in 2013.

1715
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:52,000
That was the one that was voted in. And what lost was the robot, the guitar, the helicopter, and the ring.

1716
01:57:52,000 --> 01:58:00,000
Were the losing pieces. But it doesn't appear, oh no they did, they got rid of the iron. The iron got voted off the island in favor of a cat.

1717
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Yeah, the iron was kind of lame.

1718
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
The iron was super lame.

1719
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:08,000
It was like an old school iron too. It's like, everyone's like, what the fuck is this?

1720
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:15,000
However, I'm not able to find out what the word is that they added into Scrabble. Although, Cial says it was a bunch of texting shorthand.

1721
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:18,000
I thought it was just one word. I thought that was the deal. I don't know.

1722
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1723
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Nasongames is commenting on what you just talked about. Loki's saying, Rovio cutting jobs. I can't even say I feel bad about that.

1724
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Even King did layoffs.

1725
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Yeah, actually they did add lots of words. Let's see here, this was actually earlier this year.

1726
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:50,000
So they added, let's see here, emoji, bezzy, wah.

1727
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
That was a cool DDR song, wah.

1728
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Well, it's W-H, W-A-H-H. Let's see here.

1729
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Alright, I'm over the Scrabble.

1730
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
I think that was something different because that was 6500 words.

1731
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:16,000
All of Scrabble is knowing those shitty little two letter words that you can just totally fuck somebody up by building one word off another word and then you make like two words out of it because you knew some two letter word and all that.

1732
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:22,000
That's all the strategy in Scrabble. If you don't know how to do that, you're not going to win against people who do.

1733
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Because that's how the points just start chaining.

1734
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:32,000
And then everybody likes to build an S on the end of your words and then again you get credit for two words.

1735
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:36,000
We're talking Scrabble strategy here on Orange Laundrio.

1736
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:42,000
ActDeft in chat says, wah. Warrior and Waluigi are on the Scrabble new words committee.

1737
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Wah.

1738
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Ah, lord. Alright.

1739
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Let's get to the mailbag. We invite emails from you guys every week to our mailbag.

1740
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Participate at Orangelaundrio.com is the place to send emails.

1741
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Let's go into the mailbag. We're going to dive in ahead first and pull out the emails that you guys have sent us this week.

1742
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Well, it's been pretty empty for the past couple of weeks, but thank god we're saved at this week with an email.

1743
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,000
By the way, you've got to love the Dark Sakura last week.

1744
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:21,000
Send us lots of emails. Send us tons of email. And then she doesn't come this week to read at all.

1745
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:28,000
But nobody listened to her anyway except one person. We didn't get one email this week, so thank you to Robert M. for sending this email.

1746
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:36,000
And I'm hoping that you guys will flood the mailbag over the next two weeks and make Dark Sakura work when she comes back in a couple weeks here on the show.

1747
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Alright, so anyway, here we go with Robert M.'s email tonight.

1748
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,000
It's been a very long time since Video Games Live performed here.

1749
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:55,000
And if one of my concerns was a lack of musical variety from the Legend of Zelda portion, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra will be performing the Symphony of the Goddesses concert around the weekend of Loki's birthday.

1750
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Did you know, by the way, Loki, Symphony of the Goddesses was in San Francisco last night?

1751
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
No.

1752
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,000
No, I didn't know that either until I saw the pictures of my friends there on Facebook.

1753
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I would have totally been able to go.

1754
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I know!

1755
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
I would have been able to totally go last night.

1756
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I totally-

1757
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Because I have a family who I can't leave.

1758
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:16,000
I would have been able to go, but I just had no idea that it was happening. Oh well.

1759
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
I missed out. What can I say?

1760
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Well, Robert M. continues on the Symphony of the Goddesses tour.

1761
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:28,000
I doubt I'll have the opportunity to see this one myself, but hopefully any other fans you have out here can report in.

1762
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Yeah, check those tour dates for Symphony of the Goddesses, because I just missed it in San Francisco.

1763
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:39,000
But that means it's probably- and if it's gonna be where Robert M. is around Loki's birthday, that's just in a couple weeks.

1764
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
So they must be touring right now, so check that out.

1765
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Robert M. continues with one more thing on the email.

1766
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:50,000
One thing I would like to check out, though, is the Mastermind Room Escape across from the Arch.

1767
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Have any of you tried out such puzzle rooms?

1768
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
And that is from Robert M.

1769
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Are you familiar, Loki, with the puzzle room thing?

1770
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
This is some trend.

1771
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I haven't heard of the puzzle room, but I've heard of Mastermind, or seen videos of it.

1772
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,000
I know what that is.

1773
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Isn't that the one where it's like trip lasers, basically, in a room, and you have to kind of step over them and stuff?

1774
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Well, I think depending on which one of these challenge rooms you go to, it's different.

1775
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:19,000
Because I know they've done some in San Francisco.

1776
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:22,000
I have not been to one, but I've had friends that have gone, and from what I've-

1777
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
I thought Mastermind was like- they had one in Santa Cruz.

1778
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Maybe, I don't know. I mean, these could all be different things, too.

1779
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:34,000
But I think there's something- like, you get on a team of seven or eight people, and you're in a room, and you're essentially, quote-unquote, locked in the room.

1780
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Now, of course, if you-

1781
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Live or die, make a choice.

1782
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:38,000
No, it's not that bad.

1783
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
It's like, aw, man, fell for this again.

1784
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:48,000
If you can't figure it out in, like, 30 minutes, or whatever the time limit is, then they say, you lose, lol, and they unlock and let you out.

1785
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:51,000
But I guess there's clues in the room on how to get out.

1786
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:54,000
So I don't know if there's, like, a combination. I don't know, because I haven't done one.

1787
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,000
And most of my friends that have gone, they don't want to spoil it for other people.

1788
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:03,000
So they just post pictures with, like, t-shirts that say, we got out of the stupid room, or whatever it's called.

1789
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:08,000
So I don't- I have never done one myself, although I'm not opposed to doing it.

1790
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,000
It's just that, you know, we don't really get them here in Sacramento.

1791
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
I'd have to go to San Francisco to do something like that.

1792
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
And usually if I go to San Francisco, I'm not like, let me go get locked in a room today.

1793
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
There's usually other things I'm gonna do.

1794
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Trapped in the closet.

1795
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Anyway.

1796
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Let's see.

1797
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,000
VidPower is suggesting in our chat room, for anyone going to a future Zelda concert, use the coupon code, HeyListen.

1798
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Does that really work?

1799
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:34,000
HeyListen, all one word in cats.

1800
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Who's getting the free kickbacks from that plug?

1801
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,000
That's what I want to know. Are you getting the kickbacks, VidPower? I want to know.

1802
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:40,000
Alright.

1803
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Also, ActDeft reminding us that ActDeft actually wrote a review on our website a little while ago called the, I love that concert,

1804
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
The Legend of Zelda Symphony of the Goddesses.

1805
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:55,000
That's right, because they rolled through Mexico, and ActDeft actually went to that concert as well.

1806
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:56,000
So that's cool.

1807
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:02,000
SSG100Matt mentions, I've done two of those Escape the Room games.

1808
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,000
It's a lot of fun depending on the group you're with.

1809
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
I imagine it's a lot like Benihana.

1810
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,000
You ever been to Benihana?

1811
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
I know you love Benihana.

1812
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Oh yeah.

1813
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Okay, right.

1814
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,000
And usually the experience-

1815
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Ken, in one of those rooms, can I be locked in with a Benihana chef?

1816
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:19,000
You know, where it's like, oh shit, I can't figure my way out, but at least I'm gonna enjoy some food.

1817
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:23,000
I think there was one in Japantown in San Francisco next to Benihana.

1818
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:24,000
So you're getting close.

1819
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:25,000
That would motivate me.

1820
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Oh man, that smells so good.

1821
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Gotta get out of this room.

1822
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Gotta claw your way out of the room.

1823
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
Gotta get that karaoke.

1824
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Hulk smash.

1825
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:40,000
No, but I don't think they lock you in with Benihana, but they do lock you in.

1826
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
SSG100Matt says, they let you out.

1827
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Oh, I was gonna say about the Benihana.

1828
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:49,000
That whole experience can be made or broken by who you're sitting with at the table.

1829
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Because sometimes you might get some pretty cool people.

1830
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Like one time grandpa and I went in Seattle and it was like a bunch of like younger, like 20-somethings.

1831
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
I think celebrating somebody just getting back from the military.

1832
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:00,000
So they were all drinking and having fun.

1833
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:04,000
And you know, grandpa being grandpa was like, thank you for your service.

1834
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
And bought him a drink.

1835
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
And you know, all that stuff, right?

1836
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
So we had a great time at that Benihana.

1837
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:14,000
But I've also been to Benihana when it's like, you got the family with their kids.

1838
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:18,000
And they're very like, just, you know, not that I have a problem with kids.

1839
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:24,000
But sometimes other people's kids, you know, can, you know, and they're just, it's out of control and that whole thing.

1840
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
And it's like, ugh, can I get any other table in the restaurant, right?

1841
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
So I imagine the escape the room thing is a lot like that.

1842
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
It could really depend on who you're locked in that room with, right?

1843
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Screaming baby in the room.

1844
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Yeah.

1845
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
It's like, why?

1846
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Why?

1847
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,000
Why did you bring them in here?

1848
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Why did you bring the baby to get locked in a room?

1849
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
SSG100Matt says, they do let you out.

1850
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:44,000
Some of them stay in the room with you so you don't break anything.

1851
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
Because people are dumb and try to break out the windows.

1852
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:52,000
People would be dumb, I can see that.

1853
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
NASA and games says there is one in SAC.

1854
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
I didn't know there was one in SAC.

1855
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Oh my God, wait, NASA and games.

1856
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Buddy, pal, Gabe, have you done the break out the room thing in SAC?

1857
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Because if not, I'm thinking there's an OLR slash IGDA slash cool people trip in the works.

1858
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Doesn't that sound like fun?

1859
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,000
It's like silent hill the room minus the silent hill.

1860
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I like that idea.

1861
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Alright, NASA and games says sold now.

1862
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
I love that.

1863
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Ragenator in chat says, can I be locked in one of those rooms with several hooters girls and playboy models please?

1864
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,000
You pig.

1865
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Alright, SSG100Matt further clarifying what the experience is like.

1866
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:41,000
There are a bunch of clues and riddles that you have to follow too.

1867
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Some of the riddles involve finding a safe code with a black light on a certain page on a magazine that you find in another clue, etc.

1868
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:52,000
You can make an appointment with a group of friends, you don't always play with random people unless you want to.

1869
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Bonds006 says, to be locked in a room with Rob.

1870
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Okay, I'm not sure how to take that comment.

1871
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I don't know if that was, I'm not sure how to take that.

1872
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I'm not sure if I should be creeped out by that comment or if I should just say thank you.

1873
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:09,000
I like to talk though, clearly.

1874
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,000
It's what I do for a living and it's what I do here on this podcast.

1875
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:18,000
So you better be prepared for me to talk your ear off if you're going to get locked in one of these rooms with me.

1876
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Alright, there it is.

1877
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
That was our email there from Robert M.

1878
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Thank you for sending that.

1879
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you'd like to send us an email for a future week.

1880
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:34,000
But in the meantime, it's time to get to the FUs of the week.

1881
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
We're going to get angsty here on the show.

1882
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Why?

1883
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Because it's tradition.

1884
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
It's tradition to get angry.

1885
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Loki, since there's no Dark Soccer tonight, you can start us off.

1886
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:02,000
I guess a few to retail customer service maybe?

1887
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I mean, I don't know because like I've had an issue just today and it's really random.

1888
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Like I've had two accounts broken into by somebody.

1889
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:17,000
One in my Walmart.com account which I've used once and one on my GameStop account which I've never used online.

1890
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Except, you know, I have my power up rewards card or whatever.

1891
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:28,000
So I had some points stored there and I didn't even really know what those points are for.

1892
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Apparently they used some of them to purchase like a congregate card.

1893
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Something like that.

1894
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:38,000
Probably to resell it and it's harder to trace.

1895
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
It's just weird.

1896
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,000
You know, kind of looking into like that pwn.com or whatever like that.

1897
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Apparently my email's been associated with five websites that have been like, you know, had exploits done to them.

1898
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:56,000
So I guess, I don't know.

1899
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I don't remember what my passwords were on those sites but I changed them anyways.

1900
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
At least I changed the one on GameStop.

1901
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,000
But Walmart.com, they like fucking switched the email it's associated with.

1902
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I mean, how is that even possible?

1903
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
That's stupid.

1904
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
That is absolutely stupid that you can just say,

1905
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:14,000
okay, this account right here is just going to be associated with another email called customer service.

1906
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:18,000
And they're like, well, I don't see it associated with this email.

1907
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Like, yeah, no shit.

1908
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
And they're like, well, you can just create another one.

1909
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
I'm like, well, what about billing information?

1910
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Is that on there? Do you keep that stuff?

1911
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:29,000
I don't know, maybe you should watch your bank account.

1912
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Thanks.

1913
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Call the bank for real.

1914
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Make sure, I mean, I'm sure you already have, but they're usually the ones that can fix all that stuff.

1915
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Well, nothing's been charged to my account.

1916
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Like I said, the only thing that the Walmart thing, I don't think I had any billing information there.

1917
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
We've only used it once to order something for my son last year.

1918
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:56,000
And then, you know, I have this stupid thing that you get points for or money for any price changes that happen.

1919
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
So, you know, that's tied to, I think, that account.

1920
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
So, I mean, they have like maybe 20 bucks.

1921
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,000
I don't even know how to redeem that shit, so good luck.

1922
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:09,000
But, yeah, the power of rewards thing, it's not like, oh shit, you know, it's more of like, this is annoying.

1923
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
I'm like, really? You bought this shit?

1924
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I mean, you could have bought like a gift card or something.

1925
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
At least if you're going to steal stuff, buy something nice.

1926
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I hate stupid. It's like, whatever. Okay, cool.

1927
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I mean, you stole that.

1928
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:25,000
I mean, I'm not missing it, but it's just like, really?

1929
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Well, I will give a related F.U.

1930
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:38,000
I'm going to give an F.U. to credit card thieves because I actually had my debit card was used at some random ass store in Indianapolis, I think, for like 70 cents.

1931
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,000
I think that was them just testing it to see if it would actually like take the money or not.

1932
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:48,000
And then somebody at Chuck E. Cheese in Southern California ran up like 60, 70 bucks.

1933
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Thank God, I caught it like right away.

1934
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,000
So I called the bank and they, you know, they did their thing, which is interesting.

1935
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I've had the same bank since like college.

1936
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
So I've had a long time since my college.

1937
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,000
And by a long time, I mean three years.

1938
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,000
But, you know, I've had the same bank for a very long time.

1939
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
And this is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me.

1940
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
So I was just kind of like surprised.

1941
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:17,000
But thank God I've been checking my finance because everything I'm going through with the job switch and everything, I'm checking my finances pretty religiously.

1942
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
So I caught that early on.

1943
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,000
So F.U. to credit card thieves.

1944
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Yeah, and I'll be definitely watching my account.

1945
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I mean, good luck.

1946
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:26,000
There's not any money in there, but I mean, sure.

1947
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:30,000
I mean, I don't think any credit card information, but it's like it was Adobe Boxy.

1948
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Thank you, Boxy. Your thing's shit.

1949
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:39,000
And now that they've been exploited to Gawker, but Gawker didn't have anything.

1950
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,000
I remember the other two.

1951
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:45,000
There's some other website I like forum that was on it, but they didn't have anything.

1952
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:51,000
And then I don't remember the last one, but I remember Adobe's on there, I think.

1953
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
I don't know.

1954
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
So I'm assuming that they just were testing.

1955
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Maybe I use the same password on that site.

1956
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Who knows?

1957
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:02,000
All right. Get your dialing fingers ready because we're going to open up the Skype line at one eight seven seven game oil.

1958
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio right after two more stories here.

1959
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
And let's get to it.

1960
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Let's get to it, Loki.

1961
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
This is very exciting.

1962
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:16,000
So Lionsgate announced that they're going to be working on a Borderlands movie, and I totally can see that.

1963
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:20,000
And I hope that actually comes out soon.

1964
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:31,000
It's supposed to be, I guess, produced by Avi and Aria Arad, who did the Iron Man movies and Spider-Man and X-Men.

1965
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Oh, wow. Yeah, that's a lot.

1966
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I mean, that should be pretty awesome.

1967
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I don't know. There's been like, you know, Twitter has been like speculating on, you know, who could play some good roles.

1968
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:52,000
And one of the suggestions was, I can't remember his name, the guy from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia playing Handsome Jack.

1969
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Glenn Howerton, I think, playing Handsome Jack.

1970
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:59,000
And that would be awesome. I could totally see that.

1971
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:06,000
I wonder, though, if it's going to be like an original story with like, original Vault Hunters, different Vault Hunters than the game and so forth.

1972
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Maybe. I mean, I think that'd be cool.

1973
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Either way, I'm totally down to see this.

1974
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, who should voice Claptrap?

1975
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Just get the guy that does the voice for Claptrap right now.

1976
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Get the guy who does it now.

1977
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
I think, yeah, why not?

1978
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
It's iconic. You can't really change the voice.

1979
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I mean, if you can't get the same person, Ellen McClain.

1980
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
No, that wouldn't work.

1981
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
What can't she do?

1982
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
I seriously think they should just get the same guy that does the voice of Claptrap.

1983
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:37,000
Yeah, I do.

1984
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,000
It's a robot.

1985
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I think it should be the same person that it is today.

1986
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:51,000
I actually really hope they don't stunt cast that role, but you just, you can't help but have this sinking feeling that it'll be like Jack Black or something and you're just like, God damn it.

1987
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Stop it.

1988
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:57,000
No offense to Jack Black.

1989
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
No offense to Jack Black either.

1990
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Don't fucking voice Claptrap.

1991
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
He hasn't really been anything in a long time.

1992
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
He needs some work.

1993
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Alright.

1994
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Yeah, Tigerclaw is saying, the thing is, they would probably cast a name actor to voice Claptrap.

1995
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:16,000
ActDef says, besides, Glados and Claptrap are romantically involved, it would be awkward.

1996
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Alright, fine.

1997
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Alan Alchemy says, Gilbert Godfried as Claptrap.

1998
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I could see that, but it's just not quite the same.

1999
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Oh my God. Alright.

2000
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:41,000
AP all day in our chatroom says, Howard Stern for Claptrap. I don't know about that.

2001
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:45,000
That doesn't strike me as the type of thing that Howard Stern would even do either.

2002
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,000
He's not a silly robot.

2003
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:52,000
I was the judge on that NBC show. I never thought he'd do something like that, so who knows.

2004
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Who knows.

2005
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Brad from Pod Culture suggests, Peter Dinklage.

2006
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Well, since they erased him from Destiny.

2007
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Boy, that was pretty cruel what they did to him there.

2008
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Yeah, they pulled a total Kojima on him.

2009
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Didn't they? Boy, oh boy.

2010
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Or, how about our pals from last week?

2011
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:17,000
How about Greg Berger or David Sobolove for the voice of Claptrap?

2012
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Why not a shout out for those guys from last week?

2013
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:21,000
I just think they should just have the voice that was in there.

2014
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
See, and that's the other thing, too.

2015
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:27,000
And here's the other thing, too, is like the new game for like, totally off topic here,

2016
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:33,000
but the new game that they have coming out for Lego Avengers has different voices from the original.

2017
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:36,000
They're going to have the actual voices from the movie actors in there.

2018
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,000
I'm like, no. I like the voices in there.

2019
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:44,000
They had fucking Troy Baker doing Loki. It was awesome.

2020
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
And I didn't even know it was him at first.

2021
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,000
And then, because we watched the movie that they have, too, the animated movie,

2022
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,000
which I hope there is another animated movie that goes along with this one,

2023
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:57,000
but they had him do the voice. I'm like, it was perfect.

2024
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Don't change anything. Leave it the same.

2025
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:05,000
All right, one more from our chat room where AP all day in our chat room says,

2026
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:08,000
okay, okay, Morgan Freeman.

2027
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Well, now, you know, as much as I want to tell you no,

2028
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Morgan Freeman really could just read the phone book, and I think I'd listen to that.

2029
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:21,000
So, you know, I'm going to be okay with that answer, Morgan Freeman, if not Betty White.

2030
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,000
All right, one more story here about Castlevania.

2031
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
That's right. I got a story about something new in the Castlevania universe.

2032
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,000
I shudder to find out what this is.

2033
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Yeah, sit down, because it's not a game.

2034
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:36,000
But on the bright side, it's not a pachinko machine either.

2035
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Oh, well, that's really...

2036
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:45,000
And this is actually a team-up with Adi Shankar, who is behind Dread and Power Rangers.

2037
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:47,000
I did not realize he was the producer over there.

2038
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Announced on Facebook that he's going to make a super violent mini-series

2039
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:58,000
based on Castlevania 3, Dracula's Curse, together with Fred Seibert and Kevin Klond.

2040
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:03,000
Fred Seibert is already a big name in animated television, so that's pretty cool.

2041
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Shankar says it's going to be dark, satirical, and after a decade of propaganda,

2042
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,000
will flip the vampire subgenre on its head.

2043
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:14,000
So I'm assuming that means F.U. Twilight, is what I'm reading into that?

2044
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
When I hear a decade of propaganda and flipping...

2045
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Well, everybody's been already saying F.U. Twilight, I mean, since Twilight came out.

2046
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Yeah, that's true.

2047
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:25,000
So, anyway, that's interesting.

2048
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:28,000
That's going to be cool if they actually bring that to fruition.

2049
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:32,000
So, yeah, a Castlevania super violent mini-series.

2050
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
I'd be down with that. That's fine.

2051
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:38,000
It's not like Saturday morning cartoon material.

2052
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Like, I think, you know, back to, was it Captain Power?

2053
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,000
Well, yeah, there's a part of me that's like,

2054
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
well, God, what TV network's going to want to air something like this?

2055
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:52,000
But we live in a world now where you could shop this to Netflix, Hulu,

2056
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
or some of those, like, what, Crunchyroll,

2057
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:57,000
and some of those things that specialize in animated series.

2058
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Like, you know, that's the type of world we're in now,

2059
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,000
where, you know, this series could find a home somewhere else

2060
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
and be okay and make some money.

2061
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:05,000
Yeah.

2062
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:08,000
So it doesn't even really necessarily have to be on TV.

2063
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,000
We'll see.

2064
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:11,000
All right. We're going to open up the Skype line.

2065
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:16,000
It is time. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,

2066
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:19,000
OrangeLoungeRadio. That's all one word.

2067
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Give us a call if you'd like to talk about anything we've talked about tonight

2068
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
or perhaps something different.

2069
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Wow, it's lighting up already. Let's get to it.

2070
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Geez, lots of people trying to get in.

2071
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2072
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Hey, this is Act Deaf.

2073
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Hey, buddy. Act Deaf. How you doing?

2074
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Pretty great since I got the first call.

2075
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:38,000
Congratulations. There's a lot of people trying to get in.

2076
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
You got lucky. What's up?

2077
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Well, I could talk about a lot of things,

2078
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:48,000
but you didn't talk about something, well, maybe not as big as other stories.

2079
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:53,000
But you remember the My Little Pony fighting game a few years back?

2080
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:55,000
Fighting is Magic.

2081
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Yes, Fighting is Magic because they kind of got shut down,

2082
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,000
but then they were going to get teamed up with somebody else.

2083
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:05,000
It was kind of like an interesting resolution.

2084
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:08,000
It wasn't just a cease and desist. It was more one of those,

2085
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
well, we've got to shut you down, but we'll work with you type of things, right?

2086
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Yeah, basically they got shut down by Hasbro.

2087
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
They got a C&D.

2088
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:22,000
But eventually the creator of Friendship is Magic teamed up with them

2089
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:27,000
to make a new game, at least a new sign and new characters and all that stuff.

2090
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:33,000
And after years of working on it and getting the schoolgirl's engine,

2091
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:38,000
they're finally going to launch their fundraising campaign.

2092
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Oh, so they're still going to go to Kickstarter or one of those places

2093
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:44,000
to actually fund, I'm assuming, the distribution for the game?

2094
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Yeah, basically.

2095
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Does the game have a name?

2096
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Yeah, they announced the name and the Kickstarter campaign a few days back.

2097
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:58,000
The name is going to be Dem's Fighting Herds.

2098
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:06,000
I kind of love it. I want to sit here and go, that's so stupid.

2099
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,000
But I kind of love how awful it is. I kind of love it.

2100
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:15,000
Especially when you consider the long, sordid story behind the game.

2101
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:19,000
It's kind of perfect. So kudos to whoever wrote that one on the board.

2102
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Yeah, that was pretty fantastic when I first heard it.

2103
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,000
So I'm pretty excited about this.

2104
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:32,000
The campaign is going to launch on Indiegogo on September 21st.

2105
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Really? They're going to go to Indiegogo?

2106
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Because that's where Hasbro goes for their stuff too,

2107
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
which you might have heard earlier in the show.

2108
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:41,000
Yeah, that's a pretty big coincidence.

2109
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Yeah, at least they're going to now release the Kickstarter they were planning on since all this happened.

2110
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:55,000
So it's pretty great to finally see what's going to come for this game.

2111
02:20:55,000 --> 02:21:01,000
They're going to be announcing new characters, stages, all that stuff.

2112
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:07,000
And even this following weeks before the Kickstarter launches.

2113
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:13,000
It's going to be great. I'm definitely going to help fund this one.

2114
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:18,000
And you know why they go to Indiegogo as well?

2115
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Because it's different than Kickstarter where in Kickstarter if you don't make the goal,

2116
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:27,000
which some things like what Red Ash damn near didn't and some of that other stuff,

2117
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
you don't get any of the money.

2118
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:34,000
But on a site like Indiegogo, you get to pocket at least whatever is made.

2119
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:41,000
So that at least seems to lend credit to the fact that this game will come out one way or another no matter what.

2120
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
So that's pretty cool.

2121
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Yeah, I had back something on Indiegogo that was the Screwgirls PC port.

2122
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:59,000
So yeah, I'm pretty glad that they chose Indiegogo for this.

2123
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Because yeah, the game will come out in some way or another.

2124
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Hopefully they will raise, and they will raise the whole amount they will ask for.

2125
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:17,000
With the cult-like fandom behind My Little Pony, then I'm sure a lot of people moving on to this, it makes a lot of sense.

2126
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:20,000
You'd be surprised, sorry to interrupt you.

2127
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:26,000
You'd be surprised how many people are kind of against this despite of the fandom.

2128
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:32,000
It's a minority, but there are people mad at this.

2129
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Well, I'm of the school of thought. I'm not a brony or My Little Pony fan, but I'm all about, you know what, whatever dude.

2130
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Whatever you like, as long as you ain't hurting nobody, who cares, right?

2131
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,000
So if that's what you want to be into, awesome.

2132
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:56,000
So I love though the fact out of this that they kind of were able to rise up from getting shut down.

2133
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:59,000
And really kind of take some coal and turn it into, hopefully, a diamond.

2134
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:03,000
By, okay, yeah, they got shut down by Hasbro, but they didn't let that stop them.

2135
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:10,000
In fact, they were even able to team up with some of the influence there behind My Little Pony, create some new characters.

2136
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:15,000
And now, with a title like Them's Fightin' Herds, that might even put them in a better position.

2137
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Who knows? NASA Games in our chat says that's going to catch on because of how dumb it sounds.

2138
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Hashtag America. And who cares as long as they get to cash the check at the end of the day, right?

2139
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Who cares the motivations for people buying it, right?

2140
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:35,000
And yeah, I got to play the original game, the Finding This Magic One, and it had a really good potential.

2141
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:46,000
So now, with a really good engine, which is the Skullgirls 1, and all that resource put into this game, it looks like it's going to be fantastic.

2142
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I really, really hope they do make the campaign, the work, and all that stuff.

2143
02:23:53,000 --> 02:24:03,000
And I hope that not only the bronies and all the fandom, but fighting game people. It catches on.

2144
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:10,000
So, in other words, you're telling people, you know, put your feelings on My Little Pony aside and just check out the damn game for itself.

2145
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:18,000
And see if it has any merit and maybe bring some new stuff to the table and is importantly fun. And I can support that.

2146
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:24,000
And heck, if you don't like ponies, the game won't have ponies. It will have a cow. It will have an alpaca.

2147
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:30,000
That should be the tagline. Absolutely no ponies, but maybe a cow.

2148
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:36,000
All right. ActDeaf, my friend, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much.

2149
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Hey, thanks for coming. Take care.

2150
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:42,000
I still love that name more than anything, I've got to say.

2151
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:45,000
All right, let's get to the phones. We've got more calls coming in.

2152
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2153
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Hey, it's Sturlock.

2154
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Hey, Sturlock, buddy. How you doing?

2155
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Pretty good.

2156
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Good. Long time no hear. How you doing these days?

2157
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Yeah, doing well.

2158
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Good. What you doing?

2159
02:24:55,000 --> 02:25:01,000
So I kind of wanted to gush about a game I've been playing for a couple months, actually.

2160
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Gush away?

2161
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:11,000
It's my mobile addiction. It's Final Fantasy Record Keeper.

2162
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I knew it. I knew it. You know what?

2163
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Holy fuck.

2164
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:27,000
You and Alan both. I will sometimes, like, I'll kind of be trying to go to sleep or whatever, and Alan, I'll see his on his phone looking at something, and I kind of look over and sure enough, it's Final Fantasy Record Keeper.

2165
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Oh, my God. I was so happy because I'm part of a forum called Audio Games, which is games that blind people can play, basically.

2166
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:55,000
And the game is playable with VoiceOver, which is the iPhone screen reader, basically.

2167
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Really? So, yeah, and this is something that not everybody often considers when looking at games, but you've said on this show before, you're blind, and so some games aren't accessible to you for that reason, so it's really awesome when a game is more accessible to get more gamers to be able to enjoy them.

2168
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:22,000
So with Final Fantasy, it'll actually read to you and you can use your voice? That's cool.

2169
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Well, not your voice itself. The screen reader itself is called VoiceOver.

2170
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Oh. Got it.

2171
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:42,000
I could, if you want, I don't know how good of a radio this would make, but I could show you a little bit if you want.

2172
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:54,000
Actually, I think that's a fabulous idea. If the audio doesn't come through good enough, then I'll shut it down, but right now, we're in radio, so everybody's blind right now and can't see what's going on.

2173
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:07,000
So imagine you're trying to play Final Fantasy Record Keeper, and you can't necessarily see the screen, so what does it sound like?

2174
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:20,000
You know what, it would probably help if I... just a sec. Sorry. Open settings. I'm going to turn down my speech rate so everybody can understand.

2175
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Yeah, I was going to say, dang. Is it true that if you aren't so strong in one sense, that your other senses get a lot stronger?

2176
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:36,000
Not to the extent that everybody thinks.

2177
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Well, probably not like Superhero, but you can probably listen to things at that speed.

2178
02:27:41,000 --> 02:28:01,000
I wouldn't say they're enhanced, but you tend to notice more things. Actually, it's kind of funny speaking of Record Keeper. Japan is getting Kefka in an event now, basically.

2179
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:13,000
But still no General Liro. I think you've placed us on hold, Sterlok. Hopefully, Sterlok accidentally placed us on hold, because this thing came up that says call on hold.

2180
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:21,000
And I don't know if it's because maybe he's calling us from the same device he's trying to play Record Keeper on, but unfortunately, I'm unable to...

2181
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Okay, we're back.

2182
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
I'm sorry about that.

2183
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:26,000
That's okay. I saw you placed us on hold on accident.

2184
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Yeah, I had auto-answer on when I got a call.

2185
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Whoops! That's okay.

2186
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Alright, but yeah. Somebody posted a video of Kefka's soul break, and it has his infamous laugh in it.

2187
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:55,000
And there was actually a second time that he laughs in the animation, but it was kind of covered up by the rest of the animation.

2188
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:06,000
Wow. And I can hear it as he's tapping through the menu. It's reading all the options you would expect.

2189
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:16,000
You know, some people will listen to this show at like 1.5 speed or 2 speed.

2190
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
That's crazy. I can't do that.

2191
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:22,000
I don't know how people do that, but I think that's kind of awesome.

2192
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:33,000
That's okay. I will just speak slower so that it sounds normal to you.

2193
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:39,000
And you can focus on every word I'm saying.

2194
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Alright, how is this? Is that understandable?

2195
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,000
That's fine. It's good enough to give us an example here for time's sake, so go ahead.

2196
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Alright.

2197
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:04,000
Now it's not perfect. You do have to turn VoiceOver off, because it won't see everything.

2198
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:07,000
So there are some things you have to turn VoiceOver off for.

2199
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Oh, I'm in a dungeon. I forgot about this.

2200
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
Let's get out of that.

2201
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
That's the bad thing about it.

2202
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:33,000
That's okay. You weren't expecting to have to do it live.

2203
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:38,000
That's alright. Alright, well I'll go into the party menu here.

2204
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
If I can. Maybe I can't.

2205
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:50,000
There we go. I guess it's just going slow.

2206
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Alright. I'll show you what upgrading equipment is like.

2207
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Okay. Just a little bit more here, because we do want to move on to the next call.

2208
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:06,000
But this is interesting to me, and I notice a lot of people in chat are kind of like, you know, there's a lot of people.

2209
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Some people are like, what the hell am I hearing right now?

2210
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,000
But then other people are like, well, this is interesting.

2211
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:17,000
I would have never kind of thought, you know, this is what the game sounds like to some people.

2212
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Yeah.

2213
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
I'm going to upgrade something.

2214
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Now, the weird thing about this is a lot of the stuff is unlabeled, so I kind of have to go by memorization.

2215
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Luckily there's a lot of sorting options.

2216
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:54,000
So usually what I kind of tend to do is just sort by newest and do it that way.

2217
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:15,000
See Alan Chat says, just saying, I wish I had text speed settings as fast as his audio settings.

2218
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Nice.

2219
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Well, that's, I don't know, this is very enlightening to hear kind of this whole thing.

2220
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:33,000
So let me go back to what you originally talked about, just like why you love the game.

2221
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
What's so addicting about the game to you?

2222
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Well, one, the fact that I can even play it.

2223
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:55,000
The interesting thing, too, is nothing shows with voiceover during battles, so it's all like memorizing where things are on the screen.

2224
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I had everything described to me, like what the layout and stuff was.

2225
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:20,000
But anyway, why I really like the game is just, it's just a love letter to fans of 8 and 16 bit Final Fantasy fans.

2226
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:33,000
And visually, even with the new stuff, like Lightning actually just had her event pretty recently from Final Fantasy 13.

2227
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:42,000
And what they do with the more modern games is they kind of touch up the sprites to make them look more like 16 bit, I guess.

2228
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:56,000
But I just like the fact that you can, it's kind of like, you know, a theater rhythm where you can just kind of mishmash a whole bunch of different characters that, you know, normally wouldn't.

2229
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:03,000
Like, you know, next week we're getting Tella and Goldbez from Final Fantasy 4.

2230
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:07,000
But it's like you can have that dream party since Final Fantasy games are always independent of each other.

2231
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:11,000
It's like, what would happen if this character from this game and this character from this game actually went out of energy?

2232
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Yeah, I thought that was kind of cool.

2233
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:21,000
I'm really, really, really looking forward to eventually having, like, Goldbez and Kefka and, like, Sephiroth, because, yeah, Sephiroth's in the game.

2234
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Like, in the same party. Like, just, it's amazing.

2235
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
Yeah, you have an all-basket kind of party.

2236
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Guys, you don't chat over at live.vognetwork.com that says, is this a battle game?

2237
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:36,000
It plays like old-school Final Fantasy fights. Like, you just do, like, a bunch of them in a row kind of thing, right?

2238
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,000
It's all fights. You don't actually, like, move around dungeons and stuff.

2239
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Yeah, no. It is a little different because it is a free-to-play game.

2240
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:48,000
But, you know, they capture the essence of the Final Fantasy battles pretty darn good, all things considered.

2241
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Yeah, they really do. Like, take all the bravest. Remember how crap that game was?

2242
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Yeah.

2243
02:34:55,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Like, this is the complete opposite of all the bravest.

2244
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:05,000
And the good thing about this, too, that I've noticed before is that the guys who made this

2245
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:08,000
are the same people that are going to be working on the Nintendo free-to-play stuff,

2246
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
because we heard about Nintendo going to mobile.

2247
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Oh, nice.

2248
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Pretty cool.

2249
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Taijiro says, where can I download this? Or, whore can I download this?

2250
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:20,000
I'm thinking AutoCorrect came into play there.

2251
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
App Store and Google Play.

2252
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Yeah, it's on iOS and Android, so as long as you have one of those, too, just check out the store on the device.

2253
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:34,000
Also, if you're like me and you like playing two copies of the game,

2254
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:40,000
the global and Japanese versions are obviously independent of one another.

2255
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:47,000
So, all you need is a Japanese iTunes account, at least if you're on iOS and you're good to go.

2256
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Very cool.

2257
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:51,000
All right, well, Sturlock, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call.

2258
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:54,000
But thanks for enlightening us on Final Fantasy Record Keeper.

2259
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
It looks like you got one person to download it there,

2260
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:04,000
and showing us a little bit about what that voiceover stuff sounds like for folks that need the help in reading the screen there.

2261
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:05,000
All right?

2262
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:06,000
All right.

2263
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:07,000
Take care, my friend.

2264
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Thanks.

2265
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
All right.

2266
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Bye.

2267
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Bye-bye.

2268
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Sturlock there, everybody, calling in. He hasn't called in the show for a while. I appreciate hearing from you.

2269
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
We'll try to squeeze in one more call here.

2270
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:22,000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.

2271
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:26,000
Loki, do you want to, in last minute stories, you want to get out here?

2272
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:27,000
Yeah, yeah.

2273
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:31,000
So, Jackbox Games announced that Fibbage 2 is going to be part of the Party Pack 2.

2274
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Oh, a Party Pack 2? Wow.

2275
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:36,000
Yeah, and that's going to, they said it's going to include some sort of streaming mode.

2276
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:40,000
It's coming to PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this fall.

2277
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
That's pretty cool.

2278
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:47,000
And in an unrelated news, apparently, I guess the VMAs are going on right now.

2279
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Oh, God, yeah.

2280
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:51,000
And Kanye West announced he was running for president in 2020.

2281
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Good luck. And stuff.

2282
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
That'll be hilarious.

2283
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:03,000
Is it true that, I don't even understand why the VMAs are a thing, because when did MTV play music videos in the past few years?

2284
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:04,000
I don't know.

2285
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Late at night, I guess. Somebody correct me on that. I guess it's like in the wee morning hours, they actually do.

2286
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
Five minutes between 12?

2287
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:11,000
Yeah, right.

2288
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:18,000
But, what was I going to say? I heard she was supposed to be surrounded by RuPaul's Drag Race drag queens at one point.

2289
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Did that actually happen?

2290
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,000
I don't know.

2291
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Or no.

2292
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
And Wes Craven died from brain cancer.

2293
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:33,000
Yeah, I saw that come through on Twitter. I guess he was probably battling that and didn't tell anybody about that, as a lot of the celebrities often do, when they're battling those sorts of things.

2294
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
And Notch is depressed.

2295
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Are you sick, Notch?

2296
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
Let us know.

2297
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:40,000
Alright.

2298
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Kaijuto in chat says, he said more than president. He made a lot of sense tonight. Great speech.

2299
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:53,000
He didn't interrupt anybody to do it, did he? As long as he was given the time, or he won his award. He didn't interrupt anybody, though, to do it, right?

2300
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Is his runny mate going to be Taylor Swift?

2301
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Actually, that would be a good compliment, because she could speak to, you know, there were a lot of people in that whole debacle. Some were pro-Kanye, some not so much.

2302
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Maybe if they can come together to be on the same ticket, then anything is possible. They can fix the country together.

2303
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:30,000
I think it would be ridiculous, but okay. I'll take ridiculous. I'll take ridiculous as ridiculous as California. Was it the impromptu election they had with fucking Gary Coleman, Arnold Schwarzenegger?

2304
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:33,000
Yeah, the recall election. That stuff was crazy.

2305
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
I will take as ridiculous as that.

2306
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Alright. Let's fit in one more call here on the line, and then we'll see if anybody else is going to call. What are we going to do?

2307
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
So, hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?

2308
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Hey, this is Ray Ginator.

2309
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Hey, what's up?

2310
02:38:52,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Not a whole lot. Two things to note. The first being a short story. For those that play games on Steam, if you go over to Humble Bundle's store page, they're giving end of summer sale.

2311
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Every day they change up what's up for sale.

2312
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:20,000
On the Humble Bundle?

2313
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Yeah.

2314
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:33,000
I feel like we had a story, too, and I think I had to cut it for time, but I feel like there was something about that Humble Bundle's expanded a lot of the charities you can actually donate to.

2315
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Yeah, 3,500 charities now?

2316
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:38,000
That's pretty awesome. So that's cool.

2317
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
I still think, too, that's free right now.

2318
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:44,000
Where you can feel good, at least, about where some of your money goes when you buy games.

2319
02:39:44,000 --> 02:40:06,000
Yeah. And the nice thing is, I forget what the end date is for just one particular offer, but right at top of the store page, you'll see that they're giving away for free Stealth 2, which is the sequel to Stealth Bastard.

2320
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:22,000
And it's normally a $15 game on Steam. I kind of played the original game a little bit on Steam. It seems like a decent game, so there's that.

2321
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:46,000
And I did pick up a bundle of all the You Don't Know Jack stuff for $3. I think I really got on Steam this week because I've been dealing with all the stuff this week.

2322
02:40:46,000 --> 02:41:06,000
So if you want a free game, if you go to the store, grab the free game, and while you're there, you can save money, get some stuff there, and while you're saving money, you're making donations and charity.

2323
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Well, I like free games, that's for sure.

2324
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Anyway, now that that story is out of the way, now to get to the meat and potatoes of the call, I'm going to more or less repeat this for those that don't listen live, and me, we don't necessarily listen to Bobby's show.

2325
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Not to sound like a knocking Bobby show, it's a great show, not necessarily everyone's heard of the show.

2326
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:56,000
But anyway, I'm usually not the one on VOD that gets into my own personal background and all that, just like You Don't and Jamie and all that.

2327
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:12,000
This sort of ties into video games very loosely. I'm the oldest of four siblings, and my youngest brother is 14 years but junior.

2328
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:39,000
And he lives way out in the suburbs of Buffalo, and every so often does come into town, and you know, case in point, a week and a week and a half ago, he came to town one day, and he, you know, whenever he comes into town and stops by my place, he always wants to play Grand Theft Auto.

2329
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Well, I just found out, I think it was Thursday, yeah it was Thursday the 27th, that apparently he got himself into a bit of trouble.

2330
02:42:54,000 --> 02:43:04,000
So, if you'll excuse my phrasing, he's probably piss-poor phrasing, but he kind of did a little bit of real life Grand Theft Auto.

2331
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:29,000
And granted, the media really hasn't made the connection just yet. I'm willing to bet that within the near future, you know, a whole shipstorm of attention between VOD violence and real life violence is going to hit the news.

2332
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:45,000
Hold on, hold on, I gotta jump in here. I know this is an intensely personal story and so forth, and I'm sorry to hear that this is happening in your family right now, but you said he did a Grand Theft Auto type of thing, he didn't kill anybody though, right?

2333
02:43:45,000 --> 02:44:00,000
I think Jamie shared with me what you talked about with her last night, and I saw that it was, if I'm not mistaken, it was that he had threatened a taxi driver with a weapon, correct?

2334
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:07,000
But he didn't hurt anybody, but he threatened, and that's almost as bad, pretty much, in the eyes of the law.

2335
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Yeah, in effect, a little while before I called, I sent you a PM, a private message in chat with a direct link to the news story.

2336
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:30,000
You know, I'm just trying to shorten things down for, you know, due to time constraints on the air, but the drill just over...

2337
02:44:49,000 --> 02:45:04,000
So believe it or not, I know some of what you're going through right now and what you're thinking and so forth, and it's interesting to me that you said that you worry that the media is going to jump on it and turn it into this video game type of situation and so forth,

2338
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:16,000
and you mentioned that he liked to play Grand Theft Auto with you, and then he does this thing where he holds a taxi driver at gunpoint and so forth, and maybe in your head you're thinking,

2339
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:26,000
oh God, did I put the wrong idea in front of him by showing him Grand Theft Auto or something like that? Is it the video game's fault?

2340
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:39,000
You're asking the same question right now to yourself that I think a lot of people want to ask sometimes when tragedy happens, and not that this is even on the same level, Ragenator, but just for example's sake only.

2341
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:50,000
When the whole thing happened with Columbine and the tragedy that happened there, what did everybody want to know? It was about what was in those guys' heads? What made them do the things that they did?

2342
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Was it the Marilyn Manson? Was it the video games? What is it that happened and made these people do that they were going to do?

2343
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:05,000
And honestly, as difficult as it is to hear in some of these situations, sometimes, Ragenator, it's none of it.

2344
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:19,000
It was something that was going to happen, and unfortunately, we tend to in these situations, I think, kind of blame ourselves, or what could I have done to stop this?

2345
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:28,000
And especially considering that you have the relation that happened there and so forth, but Ragenator, it's not your fault, and that's very important.

2346
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:37,000
And I'm going to tell you something. Hold on, hold on. I'm going to tell you something, and I'm going to tell the listeners something that I have not talked about on the show in a very long time, and for good reason.

2347
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:47,000
My brother and I don't speak to each other, and there's a very good reason behind that, and part of it has to do with the situation that he put my family through many, many years ago.

2348
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:54,000
It's not exactly the type of thing that you're talking about, but it's similar, and I'm going to leave it at that.

2349
02:46:54,000 --> 02:47:02,000
And the types of questions you're asking yourself right now, these were things that my mom was asking herself. What could I have done differently?

2350
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:08,000
What, you know, this is my fault. Did I raise my kid wrong? What did I do?

2351
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:18,000
And I'm telling you, she didn't do anything wrong, and neither did you. So I just want you to know that. It's not the video game's fault. It's not your fault.

2352
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:23,000
It sucks that it happened, but it's not your fault.

2353
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Yeah, you know, logically speaking, I do acknowledge that. The one thing I also think at the same time is that, like I said, once this does hit the media,

2354
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:57,000
both media and the public at large like to look for a scapegoat. This happens all the time. Hell, you brought up Columbine, so that's another example.

2355
02:47:57,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Yeah, it's exactly what it is. It's a scapegoat. And I'm not like trying to yell at you and be like, you're wrong, you're wrong, but I'm just trying to tell you.

2356
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:12,000
I'm telling you firmly and I'm reassuring you because my family's asked themselves a lot of these questions when placed in a similar scenario.

2357
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:24,000
I'm just telling you from that experience, you will come to this conclusion someday as much as it's going to be painful to get there, I think, is that this was a situation that was probably going to happen anyway.

2358
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:38,000
And I know that might really sting to hear that in the moment, and I apologize, but unfortunately, when people sometimes need help, they lash out in ways that we would never expect to happen, Reginator.

2359
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:50,000
And that's just what happens, and it's really unfortunate. And if there was easier access to mental health care in this country and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I could go on and on and on, but you know where I'm going with it.

2360
02:48:51,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Yeah, you know, the weird thing is, though, for the past, you know, roughly decade or so, he's been living in a group home.

2361
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Well, a company that runs several group homes, he's kind of bounced between the various locations within that organization.

2362
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:28,000
He was living in one in the lower West Side of Buffalo up until a couple years ago. He moved to another location down in O'Hann, you know, not too long ago.

2363
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:44,000
And I don't know if you're familiar with how group homes arrive, but they're supposed to be staffed 24-7 by mental health professionals and all that. They give out medications and all that.

2364
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:58,000
Reginator, I know you definitely want to talk this through and so forth for the sake of our listenership and so forth. I don't think they want to hear all of these details because this is an intensely private scenario.

2365
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:12,000
But Reginator, like what you're telling me and what I'm hearing in this is that he was sick. He was sick. And sometimes when you're sick, you throw up and you do some things that are sometimes like beyond your control.

2366
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:27,000
You're sick, so you throw up. And you didn't want to throw up, but your body kind of made you throw up. I'm not saying it's necessarily like a cookie cutter type of situation, but you're telling me he's dealing with mental health issues. He threw up is what happened.

2367
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:37,000
And so, Reginator, I want you to try very hard. Try to take yourself out of the equation. This is not your fault. You can't change what happened, but now how are you going to move forward?

2368
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:47,000
And what can you do to maybe be there for your brother in this scenario and so forth? Maybe you'll have a better outcome at the end of the day than maybe I did in my scenario.

2369
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:56,000
But I'm not going to get into all the rest. I've already said way too much about what I went through and so forth. So I hope for a better ending for you.

2370
02:50:56,000 --> 02:51:05,000
And I'm glad at least, A, very important, nobody was hurt. That's the most important thing. People were certainly scared, but thank God nobody was hurt. That's the most important thing.

2371
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:16,000
And I will truly keep you guys in my thoughts and hope that your brother is able to get the help that he needs. But again, not the video game's fault. Not your fault.

2372
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Alright, well thank you for taking my calls. Definitely appreciate it.

2373
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:23,000
You're welcome, my friend.

2374
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Speak to you soon.

2375
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Yeah, take care. Try to sleep well tonight. You know what? Play some games. Take your mind off it. Believe it or not, it helps.

2376
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:32,000
Alright.

2377
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Yeah, I would play games and I try to say it physically helps as much. Even music really doesn't help that much.

2378
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Well, you know, it may be a matter of just finding that thing. Try going outside. Take a walk. Maybe do something you never thought of doing before.

2379
02:51:54,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Maybe take up a game-inspired craft project. Maybe you've always been curious, like, I've never actually tried painting, but maybe now I have all these feelings, I want to get that out.

2380
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:11,000
Or maybe I've never tried crafting. Just take this opportunity to try to do something you've never done before. And your body will tell you what that is.

2381
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Alright, Ray Jeter, I'm sorry, I gotta let you go, okay?

2382
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Sure, no problem.

2383
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:18,000
Take care, my friend.

2384
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Alright, have a good one.

2385
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Good luck, you too.

2386
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Alright, bye bye.

2387
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Intensely personal scenarios here on Orange Lounge Radio, but, you know, I think, you know, even judging in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, a lot of people, you know, lending words of support and so forth.

2388
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:39,000
And, you know, people I think reinforcing the fact this is not something, you know, Ray Jeter caused by letting him play a video game or anything like that.

2389
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:44,000
Certainly not an SSJ, 100 Matt lending the advice, go for a hike, it's what I do.

2390
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Kaijuto says, you do it case by case, there's not one solution to rule them all.

2391
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Akuma JP says, I go to a pet cafe when I have problems.

2392
02:52:52,000 --> 02:53:01,000
And I know Ray Jeter is a recent pet owner, so maybe, you know, give some extra hugs to the kitty tonight and so forth.

2393
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Anyway, I know that was a heavy call.

2394
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:10,000
Not exactly the note I wanted to end on, but since we are well past 9 o'clock, I do want to go ahead and shut down the Skype line.

2395
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
Thank you guys so much though for the calls.

2396
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:21,000
If you have some more thoughts you want to get out for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.

2397
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:25,000
And of course you can always tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r.

2398
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
We're also on Facebook.

2399
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:37,000
As a reminder, we will not be here next week because of DragonCon, but I hope you guys all have a happy and safe Labor Day no matter what it is you're doing in the upcoming weeks.

2400
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Loki, I'm going to check in with you one more time to see if there's any last minute stories or anything we might have missed.

2401
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
Nah, not really.

2402
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
I think we're good to call it a night here.

2403
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:49,000
I think we made the three hour mark tonight, or if we missed it, just barely.

2404
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Maybe because of the break in the middle of the show.

2405
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
So plenty of OLR to hold our listeners over.

2406
02:53:54,000 --> 02:54:02,000
But if you desperately need something next week, you know, there's 600 plus episodes that maybe you haven't heard yet.

2407
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:08,000
And a lot of them are still up. I think all the episodes through 2008 are still on the Orange Lounge radio servers.

2408
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:11,000
So there's a ton of stuff to listen to there.

2409
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:17,000
And also, I know there's an Orange Lounge radio archive, and Dark Tetsuya is always in our chat room.

2410
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Well, not always, but he's around and he's also on the VOG Network forums and can help you in tapping into the OLR archive.

2411
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:27,000
It's not something we officially support, but it's kind of cool that it exists.

2412
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:35,000
And I love that it's a thing that people that wanted to hear old episodes kind of came together and built to distribute those old episodes.

2413
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Though I think old OLR is so different from the OLR of today, you know, we can't forget our roots and where we came from as a show.

2414
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:50,000
Alright, well, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2415
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
Loki, I'll start with you.

2416
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
Seriously trying to get my game done.

2417
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
It will be done hopefully soon.

2418
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:05,000
I've just been really tired and distracted, and so I haven't been able to get, you know, mentally I haven't been able to work on my game during breaks at work.

2419
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:15,000
I just have like 15 minutes and it's just like, I just can't get into focus quick enough to be able to get anything done.

2420
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:21,000
So I'm trying though. Soon, hopefully.

2421
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:22,000
You're a busy guy.

2422
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Really, I just, you know, it's really the few things I want to get done.

2423
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Leaderboards so that, you know, the demo's, you know, fun because it's basically competing for time.

2424
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:35,000
So, you know, I wanted that to be done.

2425
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:41,000
And then aside from the leaderboards, really it's just menus and reskinning some of the stuff that's in there already.

2426
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Mainly just the menus and like kind of title sequence stuff and that's it.

2427
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.

2428
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:50,000
As you get more seniority at work, then you'll get the better shifts when it comes time for the bidding.

2429
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Well, yeah, so I would have had a, okay, because it's based on performance for 90% of it and my performance is fucking awesome.

2430
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:02,000
The problem is though is they're like, well, we're going to change the way we're going to do our shift bids.

2431
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
And then they couldn't come into an agreement.

2432
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:08,000
And they're like, eh, we're just going to, you can just stay on the same shift you were on before.

2433
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:11,000
Except, you know, because we just got fully trained, I didn't get to pick a shift.

2434
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:15,000
I just got whatever shift was there and they were all the shitty shifts.

2435
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
That excuse they can't use next time.

2436
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:22,000
And so now I have to shift until the beginning of the year. So whatever.

2437
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:23,000
It'll get better. It'll get better.

2438
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:27,000
All right. My final thought tonight. I'm going to echo what SSJ100 Matt said in our chat room.

2439
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
There needs to be a USL archive.

2440
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:33,000
I realize that most of the old Understation Live episodes aren't around anymore.

2441
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:39,000
I agree with that, especially with Travis and Jessica deciding to, you know, drop the curtain and call it a night here at the end of the year.

2442
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:46,000
I think that would be a really great thing for people that maybe are just now realizing what they might have missed out on over the years.

2443
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:57,000
And that was a lot of fun and, you know, I wouldn't have learned a lot of the tricks that, you know, I'm using here on Orange Lounge Radio if it wasn't for my experience at Travis's house back in the good old days of Understation Live.

2444
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
So I'm just, you know, sending them more well wishes.

2445
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:05,000
Although I will be giving him lots of shit next week at Dragon Con and I can't wait for that.

2446
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
So stay tuned for that.

2447
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:11,000
I'm so excited for Dragon Con this week. It's something I really need after this year.

2448
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:14,000
It's been a crazy year but things are getting better.

2449
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:26,000
And Dragon Con is just going to hopefully be that nice little like, you know, kind of like palate cleanser before things even take off even more and things are better and more live streaming and hopefully more efforts at VOG Network.

2450
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:30,000
Because I know I've been slacking a little bit the past few months. I apologize for that.

2451
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:34,000
But things will be getting better as we get into the year and 2016 and beyond.

2452
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:37,000
So thank you guys for being here tonight at Orange Lounge Radio.

2453
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Really appreciate you guys tuning in and participating with the show.

2454
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:45,000
As we always say, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2455
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:53,000
Help spread the word because it is the show where every gamer has a voice but we don't know if the voices are out there, you know, if you're not sharing them.

2456
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
So please tell a friend.

2457
02:57:55,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Also, you can always leave us a five star review on a nice place like iTunes or Stitcher or wherever you heard about this show.

2458
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
And I haven't seen a new review in a while.

2459
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Granted, I haven't checked in the past couple of weeks.

2460
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
But I haven't seen a new one in a while.

2461
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
So I bet there's someone out there who hasn't written one yet.

2462
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:15,000
So I would really appreciate that because that all helps with the discoverability stuff and with, you know, thousands of gaming podcasts.

2463
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Many of them that podfaded years ago.

2464
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
Sometimes it's really hard to get discovered.

2465
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
So I really appreciate those of you that use the word of mouth.

2466
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:25,000
It's all the payment we need here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2467
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:30,000
That's gonna do it. We will be back in two weeks to do it again.

2468
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:33,000
And I will see some of you guys at DragonCon.

2469
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:38,000
Otherwise, we'll be back here in two weeks to talk about whatever gaming news should happen over the Labor Day weekend.

2470
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
Have a great holiday here in the States, whatever it is you do.

2471
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
And overseas, have a great couple of weeks.

2472
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.

2473
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:06,000
See you next week.

2474
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
We'll be back here in two weeks.
