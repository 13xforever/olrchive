7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	This week, the first infamous shared Mario Maker level has emerged and it will never give you up and never let you down. But does it turn around and delight you? Maybe we need a time to Rick Roll Counter. This is just one of many stories we'll tell you about and they all start right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 612 for this, August the 30th of 2015.
44000	60000	And yes, I think Jason just Rick rolled us all in the intro. I do believe that is a thing that has just happened all these years later. Because Rick rolling is what, so 10 years ago? Maybe not, maybe not as we get into the news tonight and figure that out later. I'm just cracking up that he did that.
60000	69000	My name is Rob Roberts, joining you here in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California with my co-host here tonight. Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
69000	70000	Hello.
70000	71000	Welcome back.
71000	72000	Yes.
72000	76000	I know you had a decent week off last week. I know you're taking care of other obligations, but welcome back.
76000	77000	Yeah.
77000	89000	You were complaining earlier about this abundance of Red Bull. Red Bull giveaways. First off, how do you drink so much Red Bull without having heart problems?
89000	92000	I don't drink a ton of it. I drink one a day. Just one.
92000	93000	That seems like a lot.
93000	97000	It's not. It's like a coffee. Do you drink a coffee a day?
97000	98000	Fair enough.
99000	117000	It's basically what it is. It's not like it's a ton of caffeine. And really, it's what I need to stay awake. Because, like, I seriously, earlier, before coming over, I was just, like, working on the computer and I was, like, passing out from being so tired. So, it's how I stay awake.
117000	123000	All right. So, that's fine. I guess, you know, especially when you consider that, you know, you got the kids and everything. I'm sure they keep up late.
123000	125000	And I stay up way too late. And, yeah.
125000	130000	I'm literally drinking coffee as he's talking about his Red Bull thing. So, I guess I can't complain too much.
130000	135000	It's not like I'm drinking, like, four or five of them a day or something like that. No. One a day and that's it.
135000	137000	Shotgunning them where you did the whole bottom?
137000	148000	I don't. I can shotgun them. But, yeah. I drink one usually in the morning. Right when I get to work. I kind of just. Because, like, I literally am dragging myself in the work and it just kind of keeps me awake.
148000	149000	Okay.
149000	154000	And then, like, on Sunday, you know, I drink one in the evening because I've been with the kids all day. And it's just, you know, you got to stay awake.
154000	165000	But, because of this, now, you know, of course, we've talked about this weeks ago on the show. But, the whole fact that they are giving away crap in Destiny, the video game. They're giving it away with this Red Bull stuff.
165000	166000	Yeah.
166000	167000	You're just plucking all these tabs.
167000	169000	Oh, yeah. I've got, like, six of them at my desk at work.
169000	179000	Like, what was that old urban legend about? Because my dad was super into that. You pluck the tabs off of soda cans and it's what they use for dialysis treatment or something like that. Like, the money for recycling them. I swear to God.
179000	184000	No, no, no. I know what you're talking about because they have one of those collection things at work. It's for something. Yeah.
184000	185000	Yeah.
185000	186000	Where you can turn them in.
186000	187000	Right?
187000	188000	I don't know.
188000	191000	So, like, you've got this going in your house except it's Destiny codes.
191000	202000	Destiny codes. Which is funny because I still haven't played Destiny. I have it sitting there since day one that I bought my PlayStation 4. Haven't touched it. That and Watch Dogs.
202000	205000	Both just sitting there completely unused.
205000	207000	So, what are you going to do with all these codes?
208000	211000	Probably give them away because I can't do anything with them. I mean, I can only give away one.
211000	212000	Give away. Awesome.
212000	221000	I don't know what it says. It's like 4A. Let's see here. It says, become legend with flame sword at redbullquest.com.
221000	225000	Just read the code. Read the code on that tab right now.
225000	226000	On this tab?
226000	228000	Let's make somebody a winner right now.
228000	240000	Alright. So, we've got X4FFW47X. You redeem that at redbullquest.com.
240000	243000	Alright. Now you can safely throw that can away.
243000	249000	I can safely throw this can away and I've got three more in the bag for the rest of the week that have these codes on them plus all the ones on my desk.
249000	253000	So, I still don't know what the hell it does, but there you go.
253000	255000	It's a flame sword. I think.
255000	259000	Cool. I guess. I've played Destiny since the beta, so I don't know.
259000	265000	Alright. Not joining us tonight, unfortunately, is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
265000	271000	She has the night off. You might have heard her mention last week. She is off celebrating her anniversary this weekend.
271000	276000	It's actually her ten year anniversary with DanTheMan. They are seeing Weird Al tonight in Folsom.
276000	277000	Damn it. That's awesome.
277000	279000	I know. Right? I was like, wait a minute.
279000	280000	In Folsom?
280000	281000	I know. Right? I was like, where?
281000	286000	Weird Al's in Folsom. That was the first question I asked. Like, where is there a concert venue in Folsom? It's at the college.
286000	287000	Oh, yeah.
287000	288000	Yeah. So, uh.
288000	289000	Oh, man. That's awesome.
289000	291000	I know. Why are we doing a show right now?
291000	293000	Exactly. We should have gone and saw Weird Al.
293000	296000	I had no idea that that was a thing until Jamie was like, yeah.
296000	297000	Oh, man. Next time.
297000	300000	Dan and I have meet and greet tickets and then we're going to Reno because I'm special.
300000	301000	Aww. And they get to meet him too?
301000	302000	Yeah.
302000	303000	Oh, that sucks.
303000	313000	Well, if you know the story about Dan and Jamie. I almost said Jamie and Jan. If you know their story, they got engaged over the movie UHF.
313000	315000	So, Weird Al is of a particular significance to this.
315000	316000	That's awesome.
316000	323000	So, the fact that he's touring right now and is here in the town is pretty awesome. So, it all worked out great for them.
324000	329000	But we do have you guys. You guys are here in our chat room. Live.vognetwork.com.
329000	334000	And, let's see, Nascent Games. Our buddy Gabe with Nascent Games is listening live tonight and in the chat.
334000	338000	He was on the show a few weeks ago saying, whoa, Weird Al is in Folsom? What the fuck?
338000	342000	And I'm listening to this show. Hashtag nerd priorities.
342000	343000	Exactly.
343000	349000	We have a guest who hasn't changed her name in chat, vog267, who says, you're better than Weird Al.
349000	354000	Aw, that's a very nice thing to say. I don't know. I wouldn't go that far. Weird Al is pretty awesome.
354000	359000	Especially, he did a great job with his last album. The mandatory fun and all that.
359000	360000	Yeah, it was pretty good.
360000	367000	You know, actually, another local connection. I understand that, you know, because he did like every song on that album he did a video for, right?
367000	369000	And he put them all out like all at once, right?
369000	375000	Well, the one for word crimes, which like to make that song good, like that's what Weird Al does.
375000	378000	He takes those annoying songs and makes them like good.
378000	383000	So he did the word crimes. You know how it was like an art type video, like a word art video, lyrics video.
383000	385000	Apparently the guy who did it was here in Sacramento.
385000	386000	Huh.
386000	392000	Huh. Who knew? Who knew? So we have all this art and stuff coming out of Sacramento.
392000	395000	And ActDeft was the one that got the code.
395000	401000	There it is. Oh, there you go. Congrats. ActDeft in our chat room. Does ActDeft even own Destiny?
401000	402000	Who cares?
402000	406000	I thought he was a Wii U guy. Oh, well, that's all right.
406000	409000	Okay. He says he does. There it is. That's fine.
411000	414000	Someday I'll play it again. Or for the first time, I guess.
415000	421000	Salty is in our chat room. SaltyVog says, ew, Sacktown, so bad. Hey, you know what?
421000	425000	First off, this isn't Hoard House. Sorry, you're on the wrong show.
425000	429000	And second off, it's not so bad. You get used to Sacktown.
429000	435000	I think most people have bad memories of Sacktown because they took a pit stop here on the way to Oregon or something from LA.
435000	438000	Like you stopped through here on the way to San Francisco or something.
438000	442000	We're outside of Sacramento. I mean, it's just like we're not in the middle of Sacramento.
442000	444000	We're in suburbia. It's not that much different.
444000	449000	Suburbia here is not that much different from suburbia in LA, except you can actually afford a home here.
449000	451000	Kinda. Kinda.
453000	457000	And I agree. I mean, I don't like driving down in Sacramento either. I mean, it's just whatever.
457000	461000	All right. Going to another comment brought up in our chat here.
461000	465000	Dark Tetsuya starting us off tonight actually talking about some games here.
465000	470000	Dark Tetsuya says, why the hell can't I join a winning team for Splatfest?
470000	473000	How many of y'all are playing Splatoon out there?
473000	480000	This weekend was the big, I don't know if it's sponsored or licensed or what, but there was a commercial tie-in.
480000	486000	This Splatfest because instead of cats and dogs or, what was it, water slides and roller coasters and all that stuff.
486000	489000	This time it was Autobots and Decepticons.
489000	495000	It was a Transformers theme. And a lot of my friends signed up for the Autobots.
495000	497000	So what did I do, Loki?
497000	498000	Decepticons.
498000	503000	That's right. I signed up for Team Decepticon. And sure enough, we won!
503000	510000	Yay! I finally, my second only Splatfest because I was lazy and missed all but the first one.
510000	513000	And I'm on the winning team for a change. So that was pretty exciting.
513000	517000	And I actually did, I guess we'll get into my gaming week a little bit.
517000	520000	I actually did spend a little bit of time in Splatoon.
520000	526000	I leveled up enough to get, like there's the base level, you get 10 points, the second level, you get 25 points, that next level.
526000	533000	So I, you know, it wasn't a lot. I'm sure some of you guys leveled all the way up to whatever the maximum thing was for Splatfest.
533000	536000	But still, I put a little more into it than I usually do on Splatoon.
536000	538000	But I was having quite a bit of fun.
538000	544000	You know, Splatoon is just a fun little waste of five minutes.
544000	547000	And I mean that when I say waste, I mean that in the best possible way.
547000	553000	Like just, you know, jump in and do a little head-to-head battle and there's not a lot of shit talking because, you know, you can't.
553000	555000	And that's that.
555000	561000	But the Splatfest thing is kind of cool because they mix it up with some custom music and they make the lobby all different.
561000	566000	And, you know, with the Miiverse posts, everybody gets really into it no matter how stupid the debate is.
566000	571000	So you saw all this stuff for Team Autobot and Team Decepticon and all this stuff.
571000	575000	And, yeah, that was fun. I was happy to take part in that.
575000	578000	So I had a good time in the game there.
578000	583000	Going into our chatroom again at live.vognetwork.com, Dartitsuya says,
583000	589000	I was gonna miss it, but I borrowed my stepmom's account to play and tried to get Team Autobot some wins.
589000	593000	Well, you needed to get him a few more wins, my friend.
593000	598000	Let's see, also, Act F says, I got to Autobot's king rank.
598000	608000	You know, I thought that there was going to be a big victory for Decepticons in the popularity.
608000	614000	Because I noticed in one of the matches I got, it was Decepticons versus Decepticons.
614000	616000	And I was like, oh, dang.
616000	619000	Whoever wins, we win.
619000	627000	That's right. And I was kind of like, oh, there must not be enough Autobots in the pool because now it's matching up Decepticons and Decepticons.
627000	631000	But I guess Shane was telling me the same thing was happening on the Autobot side.
631000	633000	I was like, oh, okay. Well, I guess it was just the fluke.
633000	637000	So I guess it's just somebody just kind of messed up that network code there a little bit.
637000	643000	Well, no, I'm pretty sure that's what they're doing to push people into a match if nobody else is available,
643000	645000	is they just match you up with somebody on the same team.
645000	647000	And it's kind of a win no matter what.
647000	650000	I don't know how that math all works. I don't think they've really said a lot about that.
650000	653000	So what they should do then is they should just lie.
653000	658000	And so, you know, if you're Autobots and the other team's Autobots, you just say they're Decepticons.
658000	661000	And then on their side, they see that you're Decepticons.
661000	663000	And that way, it seems like there's competition.
663000	667000	Going to our chat room for some more comments over at live.voggenetwork.com.
667000	671000	ActDef says, Sky, in Europe, it was singing versus dancing.
671000	674000	And the top dancing rink was Dancing Queen.
674000	676000	LOL. That's amazing.
676000	679000	That's amazing. I hope it actually played the ABBA song.
679000	683000	Although that licensing was probably a little bit too much for that. I don't know.
683000	688000	That is interesting. I forget they do the different SplatFests in different countries.
688000	690000	So it's not the same thing everywhere.
690000	693000	Like Europe gets one and Japan gets a different one. I wonder what Japan had.
693000	694000	I'm sure somebody in chat knows.
694000	697000	Team singing versus team dancing. I don't know what I'd pick.
697000	700000	Team stand in the corner awkwardly with my drink.
700000	703000	Is that one of the teams I can do?
703000	706000	Team Super Sentai versus Team Kaiju.
707000	714000	ActDef says, Japan's SplatFest was Ants versus Grasshoppers.
714000	716000	And Grasshoppers won.
716000	718000	Ew. Bugs.
720000	722000	Grasshoppers should've won. Because ants are stupid.
722000	724000	Well, Grasshoppers are pretty cool.
724000	728000	Isn't that the one where the female bites the head off the male when they're mating?
728000	731000	I think you're thinking of pre-mantises.
731000	734000	This is why I got a D in biology, people.
734000	736000	Alright.
739000	741000	I didn't have a lot of kickoff topics for tonight.
741000	744000	We have a lot of gaming news, so we'll get into that in just a minute.
744000	747000	But obviously there's a lot of convention stuff going on.
747000	752000	I didn't even realize that PAX Prime was this weekend until I started seeing the tweets about it.
752000	759000	Because, you know, if you're not on there getting the tickets in the ten minutes they're available, then you're not going.
759000	760000	That's the way those things work.
760000	767000	So I just kind of didn't pay attention to it because I just assumed that PAX was going to be Labor Day weekend again.
767000	769000	Because it's still a four-day con, if I'm not mistaken.
769000	772000	So I just assumed it was going to be Labor Day weekend again.
772000	775000	And, you know, in the past few years I've chosen to go to DragonCon.
775000	777000	I've had a fantastic time at DragonCon.
777000	783000	I think as we've expanded into all realms of geek here at vognetwork.com, I think DragonCon's a better fit.
783000	787000	And I can read from friends and news sites what's going on at PAX.
787000	793000	And I've talked about some of my own grievances with PAX East on the show previously.
793000	794000	I'm not going to get into it again.
794000	802000	But anyway, I just assumed I wouldn't have been able to go to PAX Prime because it would be at the same time as DragonCon.
802000	804000	But not this year. It's actually going on right now.
804000	809000	And a lot of the news we're going to get into tonight, a lot of it is stuff that's actually coming out of PAX.
809000	812000	Loki, it's been a while since you've gone to a con at all, right?
812000	816000	Was PAX 08 like the last thing you ever did as far as cons go?
817000	822000	I don't remember. Maybe? I think? Maybe?
824000	826000	Yeah, that might have been the last one.
826000	829000	I can't remember if we did E3 after that or not.
829000	837000	I don't consider E3 a con, because E3 technically is a trade show where cons are usually more fan-run.
837000	840000	Which PAX kind of isn't, so I don't know.
840000	842000	Yeah, PAX 08 was probably the last one.
842000	843000	Alright.
843000	844000	So, but anyway.
844000	845000	It's been seven years. Wow.
845000	846000	Yeah, I know. I know.
846000	851000	Well, you should go to the SacAnime here locally this weekend if you can stop by there.
851000	852000	Oh, this weekend?
852000	853000	Yeah, it's this weekend. They do that all the way.
853000	854000	Yeah, I don't have the money.
854000	855000	Yeah.
856000	859000	BlackWolf making the distinction a little bit in our chat room.
859000	864000	Trade shows are for industry. Conventions are for the public.
864000	868000	Whatever. They treat me like public when I go to the trade shows anyway, so.
869000	875000	Well, you know, interesting too is that E3, there's always those rumblings that it's going to go public,
875000	878000	or they're going to make one day public, like Tokyo Game Show or what have you.
878000	879000	Oh, could he?
879000	884000	Well, a lot of that started to pick up steam this year with the whole vendor badges.
884000	888000	I was like, damn. Those Nintendo lines are only five hours long. It's so short.
888000	890000	If only we could have more people here.
890000	894000	I mean, there's just not enough people. I can actually move and breathe.
895000	898000	Yes, please. Let's make it public. That'd be awesome.
899000	903000	Nasan Games in chat says, too many effing cons.
903000	908000	And then says, but I will be attending Geek Girl Con in Seattle to show off our games, which I'm super hyped about.
908000	912000	That's another con in Seattle, even.
912000	913000	Geek Girl Con?
913000	916000	Yeah, I had not heard of that one, but I bet that's a lot of fun.
916000	917000	Geek Girl Con.
917000	918000	What's that?
918000	920000	I said you'd probably get behind that.
920000	927000	There's that. There's PAX. There's the Sakura Con, which I know is more anime, but you know video games creep into that.
927000	931000	So, they're pretty bustling up there in the Northwest. It's pretty cool.
931000	939000	Bonds006 says, I've been to trade shows and cons here in New York at Jacob Javits Center. There is a difference.
939000	943000	I detest cons, but mostly work at trade shows. Very interesting.
945000	947000	Alright, those are some comments from our chat room on conventions.
947000	952000	Of course, Dragon Con. I will be there this next week in Atlanta.
952000	954000	So, check that out.
954000	961000	VOGG making a few appearances. Unfortunately, I am not on the up and up on any panels that our TV folks are on.
961000	964000	I missed if they mentioned if they're going to be on any panels.
964000	969000	But I know Brian from British Invaders is at the con again this year, which he usually only goes every other year.
969000	972000	So, there must be something bringing him back this year.
972000	974000	Our pal from British Invaders, he's going to be there at the show.
974000	977000	I know John from Critical Myth, at least, will be there. Gary's always there.
977000	981000	So, they're going to be at the show. I don't know if John's on any panels this year.
981000	985000	Stay tuned to our website. I'm going to make everybody round that up in the forums.
985000	989000	So, if you're going to Atlanta, you want to meet and greet people, you can go check that out.
989000	997000	I can say, though, that I will be on a panel Sunday at 1 o'clock about the podcasting past, present, and future.
997000	1001000	And that's Hilton. I think the room is 203. It's where the podcasting track is.
1001000	1004000	So, check that out. I will be on that panel.
1004000	1007000	If you can't be there in Atlanta, you can listen online.
1007000	1010000	Alpha Geek Radio, kind enough to...
1010000	1016000	You know what's so funny? I see the same guy from that network at so many cons that I go to, live streaming stuff.
1016000	1020000	They're working hard over there to bring these cons out there to the universe.
1020000	1024000	Because I saw them at BlizzCon, too, during the World of Podcasting last year.
1024000	1027000	So, I thought that was really funny. I was like, I know you. I see you at DragonCon.
1028000	1032000	So, there's that. So, you can listen there at Alpha Geek Radio.
1032000	1040000	And then, Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern, Bobby is going to be on a panel about community.
1040000	1045000	And, obviously, we love community and getting people's input and so forth here at VoG.
1045000	1050000	So, that's a great fit for Bobby to be talking on that panel Monday at 10 a.m.
1050000	1056000	I will also be in the parade. I'm going to be marching with Travis Donovan from Understation Live.
1056000	1063000	And we are part of the N7 Elite. If you've been following the past few weeks here on Orange Lounge Radio,
1063000	1069000	I have been getting a costume made. And I am going to DragonCon this year as Joker.
1069000	1074000	And I do plan to dress up the day of the parade, which I think is Saturday, question mark?
1074000	1077000	I'm probably going to wear my costume Saturday, no matter what.
1077000	1080000	If the parade is Sunday, then I'll just wear it Sunday morning as well. I don't even care.
1080000	1084000	But, yeah. Oh, you didn't even see it when you came in, did you, Loki?
1084000	1085000	No.
1085000	1088000	Oh, hold on. Hold on. Hold on, guys. I've got to show Loki. Here's the thing.
1088000	1092000	I'm not showing it to anybody until DragonCon. But since I know Loki's not going to be there, hold on.
1092000	1096000	I'm going to show him. So, entertain our listeners here. Live radio, folks.
1096000	1099000	And if you want to participate with us, live.vognetwork.com.
1099000	1105000	The best part about this is he's going to show me a costume for a character I have no reference for.
1105000	1110000	So, I'm just going to assume that, you know, this is an impressive costume.
1110000	1117000	Because I have no idea, since I don't play Mass Effect at all, who the hell Joker is, aside from, you know...
1117000	1118000	Here it is!
1118000	1123000	Okay. Cool.
1123000	1125000	There's another part to it.
1125000	1131000	All right. I'll take your word for it. I don't have any idea whatsoever, you know.
1133000	1138000	It looks good. Sorry. I don't know.
1138000	1143000	Well, there it is, you guys. My costume is a screaming success. There it is. Loki.
1143000	1147000	I'll just have to look at my picture of Joker and to kind of get the...
1147000	1154000	Oh, my God. Awesome. All right. There it is. Oh, Bobby says I missed the panel posting. My bad.
1154000	1159000	I guess I missed that over on our forum. So, wow. The Critical Myth is doing a ton of panels this year.
1159000	1165000	John is going to be on an Arrow panel Friday from 10 to 11 over at the Marriott.
1165000	1170000	Game of Thrones, The Dark Time, he's going to be on that panel as well, Friday from 2.30 to 3.30.
1170000	1175000	And then Gary is going to be talking about Binge Watching, which I know is a habit for so many people.
1175000	1179000	How Binge Watching makes us all TV geeks. That's Saturday at 2.30.
1179000	1185000	And then also a panel on The Flash, What Kind of Hero Are You, going to be on that panel as well.
1185000	1190000	Okay. I guess that sort of looks like the character. I see it now.
1190000	1196000	Oh, did you pull it up? There's another top piece I didn't show you that makes that armor piece on top of the shoulders.
1196000	1205000	So, yeah. All right. Cool. Anyway. All right. Anyhow, so there you go.
1205000	1209000	That's Dragon Con coming up. We're going to have a great time there. So I hope to see you guys in Atlanta.
1209000	1217000	We don't have like a formal VOG meetup because usually we don't know enough people that are going to justify something like that.
1217000	1221000	But maybe in the future. I don't know. Maybe next year.
1221000	1227000	So I'm really going to try to get Grandpa from a Horde house to go to Dragon Con next year.
1227000	1230000	Because I'm not going to have – Travis swears up and down it's his last year.
1230000	1235000	I really wish it wouldn't be. But, you know, I understand with some of his personal obligations and so forth.
1235000	1241000	He may mean it this time. I'm secretly hoping it'll be like a year or two break and then he'll be back.
1241000	1246000	But anyway, so since I'm going to be absent of Travis, I need to figure out something.
1246000	1250000	So I'm going to really try to get Grandpa to go to Dragon Con next year.
1250000	1255000	Because I know he wants to do it. Because I was telling him, I'm like, Grandpa, Garrett Wong goes like every year.
1255000	1261000	You can meet him at the Walk of Fame. They have a whole track dedicated to Star Trek.
1261000	1264000	You could nerd the fuck out on this thing the whole weekend.
1264000	1268000	And the Mythbusters go. So I would love to see them.
1268000	1279000	Exactly. So that's my goal. My 2016 goal is Grandpa from a Horde house or whatever project may be in the near future to get him at Dragon Con.
1279000	1286000	So, and I'm sad that I won't have Travis in 2016. We're going to make the best of 2015.
1286000	1290000	So, there you go. Alright, so there you go. Conventions, conventions.
1290000	1295000	We're going to get into our gaming week. But, you know, go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1296000	1301000	I notice they are talking about something else now. It kind of got derailed a little bit, but for good reason.
1301000	1309000	Apparently, coming from Twitter, and it's a verified Twitter account, Wes Craven has passed away.
1309000	1314000	The horror movie director. That's very sad to hear that.
1314000	1317000	All those scary, he's going to come back some evil, I know it.
1317000	1323000	Ladies and gentlemen, the first one to make a tasteless joke. Right here, everybody. Right here.
1323000	1326000	Thank you for that, Loki. I appreciate that.
1326000	1332000	But no, I mean, I know he was an older guy, but I didn't know he was battling health issues or anything like that.
1332000	1333000	Yeah, we never know.
1333000	1337000	Yeah, well that's sad. Sorry to hear about that. Anyway.
1337000	1343000	NASA Games in chat says, LOL, he went there. Yeah, he tends to do that. Jerk.
1343000	1349000	Alright, let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about what types of video games we have been playing this week.
1349000	1354000	And then we will get into the gaming news right after that. So, Loki.
1354000	1363000	Mostly I've been working on my game. The beginning portion of the week was just designing a logo, which I didn't like too much.
1363000	1369000	So I showed it to Cody and he kind of took it and did something better with it and sent it back to me.
1369000	1373000	So I now have a logo for my, quote, company.
1374000	1379000	You know, I haven't registered anything or anything like that, but you know, you can't just say, I made the game.
1379000	1385000	And then I was working on setting up leaderboards as well, online leaderboards.
1385000	1388000	So I'm just doing the PHP stuff right now for that.
1388000	1396000	Mainly I was trying to figure out what exactly I wanted to have on the leaderboards if I was going to do some sort of scoring system too along with the times.
1396000	1401000	So I just kind of built that all in there and stuff. And I'm going to have Twitter support as well.
1401000	1411000	So, not necessarily linking to Twitter, but you can put your Twitter name on there and then it will just have a hyperlink to your Twitter account or something like that if you want to.
1411000	1418000	And then, now actual games I played, I didn't play a whole ton. A lot of just older stuff.
1418000	1421000	My son keeps playing Lego Marvel Super Heroes, so I play a little bit of that.
1421000	1428000	Mainly just glitching out the game now because there's a super easy way to get under the map, so I've just been messing with that.
1428000	1435000	And, I don't know. I'm kind of getting bored with it now after 200 hours of the game.
1435000	1439000	What else? Plains of Steam backlog stuff.
1439000	1446000	So I tried, I had purchased that Namco bundle from Humble Bundle because it's like, ooh, Ridge Racer.
1447000	1452000	I wanted to play that Ridge Racer Unbounded game or something like that. It looked pretty cool. It was done by Bugbear.
1452000	1457000	That game runs like shit on my computer. I loaded it up, I'm like, nope, delete.
1457000	1465000	Right away, it just ran terribly. And I'm surprised. I can run Titanfall okay?
1465000	1471000	Why can't it run this game that's much older and much shittier? I don't understand.
1471000	1473000	But for whatever reason, it just didn't run very well.
1473000	1478000	Also, I think I mentioned I played Bionic Commando. I don't really remember when that was.
1478000	1484000	And I'm talking about not re-armed, the good one. I played the 3D Bionic Commando.
1484000	1489000	For some reason I remember enjoying it a lot more than I did this time around.
1489000	1491000	But it was terrible. It's just such a terrible game.
1491000	1496000	And it's not like a terrible game just in general. It's just the controls were shitty.
1496000	1498000	So I don't know what was wrong with that.
1499000	1503000	Then, for some stupid reason, on the streak of really fucking terrible games I decided to play,
1503000	1509000	I decided, hey, you know what? I played Fuel one time. Let's load that up again from Codemasters,
1509000	1515000	their big open world sort of racing game. God, that game is so boring.
1515000	1520000	I don't remember how boring that game was, but man, I went back there to play that.
1520000	1525000	I remember not thinking it was horrible, but I do remember it was really open.
1525000	1530000	It's really open, but it's just really boring. There's like nothing there.
1530000	1534000	And so I played it for like, I don't know, maybe 30 minutes or so, and I was just like, I can't.
1534000	1537000	I can't play this anymore. It's just so terrible.
1538000	1540000	So what else did I play?
1543000	1548000	I think a little bit of Grand Theft Auto 5 because my son wanted to see me do some BMX stuff in there.
1548000	1556000	So I did that, and then I think I played that Sakura Clicker game a little bit just for the hell of it.
1556000	1564000	It's just basically, you know, was it Clicker Heroes with anime chicks in it.
1564000	1566000	And then what else?
1567000	1571000	I think that was just about it. Maybe a little bit of Minecraft.
1571000	1575000	But nothing has really caught my attention. I mean, I don't know.
1575000	1578000	I just realized, you know, Mad Max is coming out this week.
1578000	1584000	I kind of wanted to try that out because, you know, I'm a pretty big fan of the company that made the game.
1584000	1587000	But I don't know. I just don't have the money.
1588000	1593000	That's a problem. There's all these games that come out and not enough money to play them all.
1593000	1596000	I understand. I understand how it goes.
1596000	1602000	All right. Let's see. Some feedback on your gaming week in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
1602000	1604000	Nascent Games, our buddy Gabe, is asking,
1604000	1608000	Loki, when the shit are you bringing your game to our demo feedback night and or our next game jam?
1608000	1612000	I would love to. No, seriously, I was looking at your progressive game jam stuff,
1612000	1615000	and I like the idea that's over the course of nine months.
1615000	1618000	But here's the thing. It's like I can't get away from my house.
1618000	1621000	Like the time. The timing, unfortunately, is not working for me.
1621000	1626000	Just my new schedule and everything. Like I work until seven fifteen at night.
1626000	1631000	And then that's it. I come home and I can't really leave the house because my wife's like,
1631000	1635000	well, I've been watching the kids all evening and you can't go anywhere.
1635000	1638000	So it's kids and we're lucky to have you here.
1638000	1642000	Yeah, if the family wasn't there, then yeah, sure. I'd love to come out to, you know,
1642000	1646000	the gaming night and do all that stuff and also to the progressive game jam.
1646000	1650000	I'm really interested in that, but I just can't go to that.
1650000	1654000	And it's disappointing because I think it'd be a lot of fun,
1654000	1659000	but I just can't go because I am trapped in my house and at my work.
1662000	1663000	So that's about it.
1663000	1666000	All right. Well, let's talk about my gaming week.
1666000	1669000	Let's see. What have I been up to this week in games? Actually quite a bit.
1669000	1672000	I've been getting back into doing some live streams.
1672000	1675000	I did a few live streams of Fantasy 14.
1675000	1677000	I did some Rocket League. I think I did Diablo the other night.
1677000	1680000	Just, you know, the typical type of stuff I might play in a week.
1680000	1684000	I was giving a little bit of testing to the YouTube games because, you know,
1684000	1685000	that just launched this week.
1685000	1688000	So I just wanted to see kind of like what were the differences?
1688000	1689000	What were some of the pros and cons?
1689000	1693000	I don't know why people had such trouble finding gaming-related videos on YouTube.
1693000	1694000	I've never had that problem before.
1694000	1695000	Yeah, I've never had that problem either.
1695000	1698000	It was like, we've solved the problem you never had.
1698000	1701000	Yeah. I think they just want to compete with Twitch, which I understand.
1701000	1704000	I've been saying for forever on the show, Twitch needs a viable competitor.
1704000	1709000	And I just think anybody that's really tried to compete against them is usually just type a lie.
1709000	1712000	I know there's been hit boxes and other things, but nothing's really,
1712000	1717000	really kind of stepped up with that volume the way that, you know, now YouTube has.
1717000	1723000	I am liking the fact that they totally are incorporating the live content ID system.
1723000	1727000	I mean, that's awesome that it just fucks up your shit live.
1727000	1729000	Well, but I haven't had any problem with it yet.
1729000	1732000	I mean, I don't know, you know, again, I haven't tried to play a Nintendo game,
1732000	1734000	but it seems fine so far.
1734000	1737000	Nothing's happened incorrectly yet.
1737000	1740000	And, you know, there's a lot of games being run by a lot of these other streams
1740000	1742000	that don't seem to be having issues.
1742000	1743000	So, you know, we'll see.
1743000	1744000	I don't know.
1744000	1749000	But, yeah, I think that whole content ID on the go or a live thing is a little bit like,
1749000	1750000	I don't know about that.
1750000	1752000	I don't know how that would work.
1752000	1754000	I mean, is it just going to be looking for music or something?
1754000	1758000	I mean, I'm assuming it's looking for music, which to be fair, Twitch has their own.
1758000	1762000	I mean, they don't do it live, but, you know, they mute the whole on demand things
1762000	1766000	if there's the copyrighted music in there, which, you know, can screw up
1766000	1770000	if you're playing a game that just happens to have some licensed music in the background.
1770000	1772000	So that can sometimes be unfortunate.
1772000	1773000	But I don't know.
1773000	1776000	I feel like I got some really good quality out of the YouTube streams
1776000	1779000	because I know YouTube will do up to 60 frames a second.
1779000	1782000	And I feel like the Rocket League one especially that I did over there looked really, really good.
1782000	1784000	So I was getting some good quality.
1784000	1788000	But Twitch, I think Twitch also right now has some better discoverability.
1788000	1791000	Like, I think their friends list is really robust
1791000	1795000	and they have a tendency to be able to kind of feature things.
1795000	1800000	I feel like on YouTube right now they're featuring all the same people
1800000	1802000	and it's all the same channels.
1802000	1805000	It's all the ones that already have millions and billions of subscribers.
1805000	1808000	But on Twitch you're more likely to find a channel you haven't heard of yet.
1808000	1812000	And so I think that's why right now I kind of prefer Twitch a little bit
1812000	1814000	is for the discoverability portion of it.
1814000	1816000	But YouTube's getting their big toe in the water.
1816000	1818000	It'll be interesting to see how that all stabilizes.
1818000	1822000	And I don't know. I still haven't decided do I want to really invest in, you know,
1822000	1825000	because I need to pick one or the other if I want to try and grow a subscriber base or whatever.
1825000	1828000	I really need to pick. Do I want to go Twitch or do I want to go YouTube?
1828000	1830000	So we'll kind of see. I don't know.
1830000	1832000	I know Twitch has a big convention coming out
1832000	1834000	and they're probably going to really tease a lot of features
1834000	1837000	that are going to want to really try to keep a lot of their people team Twitch
1837000	1839000	and not defecting over to YouTube.
1839000	1840000	So we'll see.
1840000	1843000	But this competition element is really interesting as far as I'm concerned.
1843000	1846000	Stream to both simultaneously.
1846000	1850000	Well I know a lot of people stream to Twitch and then put their archive on YouTube
1850000	1852000	and that's probably the way to do it.
1852000	1854000	I don't know.
1854000	1855000	Nasan Games in our chat says,
1855000	1857000	Don't play Super Mario Maker on YouTube.
1857000	1859000	Nintendo is already claiming ownership on all of it.
1859000	1861000	See, yeah, that's kind of shady to me.
1861000	1864000	I don't know if I can get down with that.
1864000	1868000	And it's sad because really that, like I got to be honest,
1868000	1872000	that is, seeing the videos out there of people making stuff on Mario Maker
1872000	1874000	is actually getting me interested in it.
1874000	1877000	So it's advertising for your game.
1877000	1880000	You're being very ungrateful about it.
1880000	1884000	I mean, I have not seen any advertisement from Nintendo for Mario Maker.
1885000	1891000	So it's kind of bold of you to not spend much money on advertising this
1891000	1896000	yet claiming ownership on these videos that are advertising for you.
1896000	1897000	Let's see.
1897000	1902000	And then also looking at more comments in chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
1902000	1904000	Some people complaining about Twitch Con.
1904000	1908000	Ugh, another con, which I kind of can see that.
1908000	1911000	It's getting a little con heavy and I don't know.
1911000	1912000	Let's see.
1912000	1916000	And then Murderface says as a side note, fuck Nintendo for claiming like that.
1916000	1918000	Technically the game isn't out.
1918000	1920000	So I can see where maybe they're a little bit frustrated.
1920000	1923000	But at the same time, when the game is out on September 11th,
1923000	1926000	I would hope that they back off on that.
1926000	1929000	I was kind of surprised that there was all these people playing it already.
1929000	1930000	But I guess it shouldn't be.
1930000	1932000	It's all the press copies, I'm sure.
1932000	1937000	And then, let's see, also, bonds006 suggests for the next Splatoon,
1937000	1939000	Team Twitch versus Team YouTube.
1939000	1941000	Hey, that might be a fun one to get into.
1941000	1942000	We'll see.
1942000	1946000	But anyway, so I've been streaming games on some of those sites.
1946000	1949000	And then one that I did on Twitch the other day,
1949000	1951000	because Twitch is still built into the PlayStation 4,
1951000	1953000	which is awfully convenient, I must say.
1953000	1956000	I'm sure PlayStation 4 will get the YouTube support and a firmware update.
1956000	1958000	But for right now, you can only really do the Twitch or Ustream,
1958000	1961000	which we don't even know.
1961000	1963000	Gaming on Ustream is not really a thing.
1963000	1965000	There's too many ads on Ustream for me.
1965000	1967000	And I know it's what Travis uses to do his show,
1967000	1970000	but he's also not a gaming show, and it's a little different.
1970000	1976000	Anyway, so as far as Twitch goes, I was streaming Until Dawn,
1976000	1981000	which Shane picked up, and he's a big fan of the scary games.
1981000	1985000	And he's been playing it, I think, with Flaco Jones and Mrs. Flaco Jones.
1985000	1988000	They've been playing Until Dawn very late at night.
1988000	1990000	And so Shane was like, you have to play.
1990000	1991000	You have to play.
1991000	1994000	And you know how insistent he can be sometimes,
1994000	1997000	and especially because you all know how I feel about scary games,
1997000	1999000	and I usually flip out and all that stuff.
1999000	2001000	So he got me to play some Until Dawn.
2001000	2004000	The good news is it was just like the first little chapter,
2004000	2008000	so it wasn't too scary, but there were some super cheap jumpscares.
2008000	2010000	And just some early impressions on the game.
2010000	2013000	I think it looks really good.
2013000	2016000	The game element itself seems very simple
2016000	2022000	because you're basically choosing do you want to go this way or that way or do nothing.
2022000	2023000	And then, of course, there's a lot of that.
2023000	2025000	But then there's also, okay, you're in a scene,
2025000	2029000	and can you find the hidden objects in the scene to investigate?
2029000	2032000	And then there was some little action-oriented things.
2032000	2035000	There's a lot of quick-time events, a lot of quick-time events.
2035000	2039000	And you've got to aim the gun and shoot this thing as fast as you can,
2039000	2042000	which I'm sure later in the game you're trying to shoot a killer
2042000	2046000	or something like that to try and get away from him for a few extra moments.
2046000	2051000	But I did notice, I was like, okay, the story in some parts seems to be very heavy-handed.
2051000	2054000	There's the butterfly effect in the game,
2054000	2057000	and there's so much butterfly effect stuff.
2057000	2059000	It's like shoving it down your throat.
2059000	2061000	You see a sign that's like,
2061000	2065000	did you know the Native Americans considered signs of butterflies to indicate duh-duh-duh-duh?
2065000	2069000	And then it's like this whole system is like, okay, yes, I understand, developers.
2069000	2071000	The choices I make will have an impact later in the game.
2071000	2075000	Yes, you made that very clear. I understand.
2075000	2076000	Not very subtle.
2076000	2078000	Not very subtle, no. Not in that regard.
2078000	2081000	But that's really one of the only complaints I can muster.
2081000	2083000	Now what's going to happen is...
2083000	2085000	I think it's going to be fun for a lot of people.
2085000	2087000	So what's going to happen is you think that it's just,
2087000	2089000	they're just trying to hint to you that it's all these,
2089000	2092000	you know, what you do is going to have effect at the end of the game,
2092000	2095000	but really it's because at the end of the game you fight a giant butterfly.
2095000	2099000	It's like Mothra, but it's a giant butterfly is the villain.
2099000	2102000	It's like, see, we told you it was foreshadowing.
2102000	2106000	Dungeonbuster in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2106000	2108000	thanks for not shooting the squirrel.
2108000	2111000	Yes, there was a scene where I could shoot either like a bag of sand or a squirrel.
2111000	2115000	And I was like, I'm sorry, I'm not having dead animals in this game.
2115000	2118000	Dead Hayden Petiniere or whatever, it's fine.
2118000	2120000	Dead squirrel, no thank you.
2120000	2123000	If it's like most of the squirrels that I encounter where you're trying to avoid them,
2123000	2126000	the squirrel will just run in front of the bag as you shot it.
2126000	2131000	It's like, you are dumb. You are a dumb animal.
2131000	2133000	This didn't happen in the game, sadly.
2133000	2137000	Let's see, more comments from our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
2137000	2139000	Dungeonbuster says, it's not super scary.
2139000	2142000	It's more about trying to keep everyone alive.
2142000	2146000	Everyone could live depending on what you decide or everyone could die horribly.
2146000	2148000	Not everyone lived in my first playthrough
2148000	2151000	and one character that I really didn't like survived, darn it.
2151000	2153000	Yeah, that's what I'm hearing from a lot of people
2153000	2156000	is that nobody seems to be able to keep everybody alive on their first playthrough.
2156000	2161000	That, you know, some of the kids get messed up.
2161000	2162000	So, I don't know.
2162000	2164000	And then there's things about the game.
2164000	2168000	You know I don't like Saw, the Saw movies. I don't like that.
2168000	2171000	And I'm hearing about some of the controversial stuff in the game
2171000	2173000	and it sounds like a thing straight out of a Saw movie.
2173000	2178000	And I'm just like, gross, no thanks, not really interested.
2178000	2179000	But that's me.
2179000	2182000	I know there's a lot of you out there that really love that type of stuff
2182000	2183000	and I think you'll have a good time with it.
2183000	2188000	It is very interesting to me how it kind of feels like Sony wrote this game off in a way
2188000	2191000	and maybe it's because of how the order was received or what have you.
2191000	2194000	But it seems like even though Sony kind of wrote this game off,
2194000	2196000	just because you're not seeing a lot of press for it,
2196000	2198000	it didn't get a lot of hype.
2198000	2203000	We saw a lot about it at E3 last year, but then it just kind of suddenly came out.
2203000	2205000	Does it still have the move support?
2205000	2207000	Because it was supposed to be a move game at one time.
2207000	2210000	Actually, there are, I guess I could say this,
2210000	2213000	there are some scenes where it will suddenly come up and it says, don't move.
2213000	2215000	And it shows the light on your controller.
2215000	2218000	And the assumption is that if you move your controller,
2218000	2220000	then you're going to screw up the scene.
2220000	2222000	So yes, there are some things to do.
2222000	2225000	And you can actually play with motion controls, but I turned that off.
2225000	2227000	So I guess so, yeah.
2227000	2229000	Because you have the move controllers.
2229000	2231000	Well, not on the PS4 though.
2231000	2232000	No, it works with the PS4.
2232000	2233000	Does it?
2233000	2235000	I didn't even try to hook that up and do that.
2235000	2238000	No, but I know it does have some of that motion control stuff built into it.
2238000	2240000	So there's that.
2240000	2244000	So yeah, I know a lot of people are getting a kick out of that.
2244000	2246000	So the word of mouth for that game has been really good.
2246000	2249000	And I think it's going to end up doing more successfully than people thought it would.
2249000	2252000	So I'm sure there will be an Until Dawn 2 at some point. We'll see.
2252000	2255000	As far as other games I played this week,
2255000	2260000	the new stuff that came out, I played VVVVV, which came out on PlayStation 4,
2260000	2263000	which is like the third time I've bought that game.
2263000	2265000	But I really like that game.
2265000	2268000	It just takes me back to my Commodore 64 days and the soundtrack is so good.
2268000	2271000	I was like, whatever, I'll pick it up on PlayStation 4.
2271000	2274000	And the Mega Man collection was this week as well.
2274000	2276000	And I had to pick that up.
2276000	2279000	Yes, I know people have their issues with the whole fact that 7 and 8 aren't there,
2279000	2282000	but I was like, you know what, I want to give this game a fair shot, check it out.
2282000	2288000	And I got to say, they did a good job of porting the games to the PlayStation 4,
2288000	2290000	the platform I picked it up on.
2290000	2293000	They run just like they would on the Nintendo, which, you know,
2293000	2299000	obviously you would hope that a console that's 30 years older than the games that it's running on,
2299000	2302000	or the games that are running on it, would run it flawlessly.
2302000	2304000	And it does run really well.
2304000	2307000	And there's some filters you can put on the screen if you're into that sort of thing.
2307000	2310000	And there's borders that are representative of the different games as well.
2310000	2311000	So that's cool.
2311000	2318000	But what I also like is that they did do some stuff that was also outside just straight emulating the games.
2318000	2323000	And, yeah, they have the museum and artwork, which I think is very customary for these disc collections.
2323000	2325000	But there's a challenge mode as well.
2325000	2330000	I thought these modes were put together pretty well where, like, let's say, for example,
2330000	2335000	one of the challenges you do early on is a Mega Man boss rush.
2335000	2338000	So you fight every boss in Mega Man 1 back to back to back.
2338000	2342000	And it's not anything super fancy.
2342000	2348000	I think they're using a collection of ROM save states strung together to kind of do this.
2348000	2351000	But it works really well.
2352000	2359000	I was doing one challenge where you had to do the beams in Quick Man's stage without having the time stopper.
2359000	2361000	So, I mean, that sucks.
2361000	2366000	But when you get to the end, there'll be like a little hole that you see on the screen that has the little galaxy effect behind it.
2366000	2368000	And you fall in the hole and it goes flash, flash, flash.
2368000	2370000	And then your character moves, flash, flash, flash.
2370000	2372000	And then you're in another scene suddenly.
2372000	2378000	So you might go from that to suddenly the scene in Dr. Wily's castle where you're dodging the spike balls as you're falling.
2378000	2380000	So I thought that was kind of cool.
2380000	2384000	That was something a little different that wasn't necessarily in the older collection.
2384000	2391000	And to put that whole very modern social gaming aspect on it, you know, they have the leaderboards, right?
2391000	2396000	But then you can also push a button and watch someone's video of them doing it.
2396000	2402000	Like it saves the videos of the top 100 players or whatever actually accomplishing that feat so you can watch those on demand.
2402000	2405000	And I thought that was really cool that they had that.
2405000	2409000	That is a feature that I remember was in Game Room on the Xbox 360.
2409000	2414000	Not to keep bringing up how amazing Game Room was, but deal with it.
2414000	2424000	Between this game and Game Room on the 360, it's like everything I wish Virtual Console actually was on the NES.
2424000	2428000	So yeah, I do think there's a little more to it than just on Virtual Console.
2428000	2436000	But if you already own all the Mega Man games on Virtual Console, will it be worth another $15 to get this?
2436000	2438000	Do they really sell them to you?
2438000	2442000	Not this collection, but all the games are on Virtual Console.
2442000	2446000	But do you want to play $30 for nothing but emulation?
2446000	2451000	Or do you want $15 for at least a couple little bells and whistles in this?
2451000	2454000	Just a little bit of polish.
2454000	2459000	Yeah, I think this is a better deal. That's how I feel.
2459000	2467000	So let's see, over at live.vog, network.com, William Murderface reminding us that Diablo 3 Season 4 started Friday.
2467000	2472000	More grinding for all of us addicts. Yep, I just hit level 60 today on my Season 4 character.
2472000	2475000	I might have had some power level help.
2475000	2481000	Let's see, Real Raginator says $5 says that Mega Man 7 and Mega Man 8 will be DLC.
2481000	2483000	You know, that would make a lot of sense.
2483000	2487000	That maybe they're going to add that on a little later. I don't know. We'll see how that works.
2487000	2493000	S.J.O. and Hunter Matt says really miss Game Room and Dungeon Buster saying Game Room really was a great concept.
2493000	2497000	Bonds006 says I'll say this again, watching others play games is eh to me.
2497000	2501000	I paid to play, not so much watch TV. Net & Life already have that job.
2501000	2508000	I will say though, it is pretty cool because now you can see how they're getting these good times in Mega Man.
2508000	2512000	And sometimes you learn something from it like, oh shit, I've been using the wrong weapon.
2512000	2515000	Or, oh, you can cheese the shit out of this.
2515000	2521000	Like, I didn't even realize, although it makes sense now that I'm watching it again, it's the same trick from Blaster Master.
2521000	2528000	But like when fighting the Yellow Devil from Mega Man 1, which is that giant stone thing with the red eye.
2528000	2536000	You can just, you use the elect beam and then you just pause, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause, pause as the elect beam is going through the eye and kill him in one hit.
2536000	2541000	And that's how everybody's getting like these 19 second times on the leaderboard.
2541000	2544000	I was like, oh, so you can just cheese it.
2544000	2555000	So, that would be one, I guess one minor bitch complaint suggestion I might make is that on the challenge mode, turn pause off and make people actually earn it.
2555000	2563000	But I guess you still see some other like speed running techniques that aren't, like it's not really cheesing and it's just the same thing people do in speed runs.
2563000	2568000	Kind of glitching in some of this stuff. People doing that in some of the Mega Man 2 and other games.
2568000	2570000	So, it's kind of neat. Anyway.
2570000	2574000	There you go. Phew. A lot of games to talk about this week for my gaming week.
2574000	2578000	But it's nice to be, nice to have a little time to play some games.
2578000	2581000	Because this week, probably not so much with me going to Dragon Con.
2581000	2586000	Although, hopefully I'll get to play some Vita or some 3DS on the plane. That's some hopes.
2586000	2590000	And who knows? I know Dragon Con isn't a huge video gaming presence, but you never know.
2590000	2594000	Sometimes there's some interesting stuff there and there might be some panels.
2594000	2597000	I think they're introducing Firefly online at Dragon Con.
2597000	2601000	So, I'm sure that'll be insanely popular, but I might want to check that out.
2601000	2603000	Anyway, that leads me into housekeeping for tonight.
2603000	2608000	Of course, as I always say, Twitter.com slash OLR. We're also on Facebook.
2608000	2614000	Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio. We appreciate all of those follows and likes and all that good stuff.
2615000	2620000	We will not be here next week with Dragon Con going on in the three-day weekend here in the States.
2620000	2623000	We will not be having a show on Sunday.
2623000	2627000	Bobby Blackwolf, who's before us every Sunday night, will not be live either.
2627000	2629000	So, it's a night off for the network.
2629000	2635000	But, you know, with the three-day weekend, even if you're not going to Dragon Con, a lot of people go to different places this weekend.
2635000	2638000	I highly doubt there's going to be too many people around on Sunday night.
2638000	2643000	So, we'll be back in two weeks with an all-new Orange Launch Radio after tonight.
2643000	2649000	Anyway, we still got plenty of this episode to get through, so let's get into some gaming news for the week, starting with Loki.
2649000	2655000	So, Yacht Club Games has announced that they're going to be releasing an Amiibo for Shovel Knight.
2655000	2663000	And what's unique about this is unlike most of the Amiibos that are manufactured by Nintendo, they're actually doing the manufacturing themselves.
2663000	2669000	Now, what's going to happen with this is you'll be able to use this with the Wii U and 3DS versions of Shovel Knight.
2669000	2677000	And when you do that, it unlocks an exclusive co-op mode, which allows two players to play through the entire game cooperatively.
2677000	2686000	And also with that, you can also customize your character and transfer that back and forth between the Wii U and 3DS versions by, of course, using the Amiibo.
2686000	2693000	So, I was kind of disappointed. I thought originally when I heard about this that, you know, Shovel Knight was going to be added to, like, Smash Brothers or something like that.
2693000	2696000	And I was like, ooh, that's pretty cool. But, I don't know.
2696000	2702000	Maybe though, because they're doing the manufacturing and not Nintendo, that these won't be so hard to find.
2702000	2706000	Although, they're still saying that they're going to be available in limited quantities.
2706000	2710000	I'm hoping it's just under promising and over delivering, right?
2710000	2712000	Well, we can hope. We can hope.
2712000	2720000	But, yeah. I am excited. I think it's great that Shovel Knight is getting an Amiibo. I'm very excited about that.
2720000	2727000	But, yeah. I'm just hoping it's not going to be subject to all this same kind of crap we've been seeing with a lot of the other Amiibo.
2727000	2733000	And it better fucking not be retailer exclusive. Although, I don't think they would do that with all this song and dance for this particular Amiibo.
2733000	2735000	I really don't think it's going to be retailer exclusive.
2735000	2738000	So, I think it'll be a little easier to find in that regard.
2738000	2744000	The only other thing I don't like about it is that they're locking co-op mode behind it in Shovel Knight.
2744000	2751000	And that seems... I don't know. I understand the whole pay for DLC. So, maybe if co-op mode were to be DLC, I kind of get it.
2751000	2754000	And so, maybe paying for the Amiibo is just how you pay for DLC.
2754000	2759000	But, I think there's that inherent worry that I'm not going to be able to find the fucking thing.
2759000	2766000	Here's my thing, though. I understand with the Amiibos, I thought the whole point was to add additional functionality to it.
2766000	2772000	And I'm not talking about basically this being a key to unlock a mode or something in the game.
2772000	2780000	I'm talking about, like, I thought it was supposed to be like in Smash Brothers where you train the character and you can take it and battle against other people and stuff like that.
2780000	2783000	You know, a little bit more expanded usage for this stuff.
2783000	2790000	But, I don't know. They're just kind of like these, you know, okay, you can buy it for this game and it unlocks some shit.
2790000	2794000	That's it. That's it. It's just DLC with a figure.
2795000	2804000	At least some of the figures are really cute because I will confess, and some of you might have seen this on my Twitter and I know Loki went, ugh, when he saw it walking in the door.
2804000	2809000	I bought two more Amiibo, which, you know, whatever. I got the silver Mario and the Zelda.
2809000	2814000	But, I got a little display thing for it that's actually, I think it's really cute.
2814000	2819000	It looks like the end of a Mario stage with the blocks going up and then a big flag.
2819000	2826000	And you can actually, the way it's constructed, there's actually little circular cutouts in the blocks so your Amiibo fit perfectly inside.
2826000	2830000	And so they kind of display like they're standing on the blocks. It looks really cool.
2830000	2836000	So, I bought that this week and so now I have this whole little display set up, which is cute, I think.
2836000	2843000	But, I like them mostly for the figures. I've barely been using the unlocks, to be honest.
2844000	2849000	I don't really, I mean I leveled a couple of the characters in Smash Brothers, but not all of them.
2849000	2858000	And I've been doing that Amiibo tap thing, where you tap the Amiibo and you get the three minutes from different scenes and different NES games.
2858000	2865000	But it's like, it's kind of one of those, oh I play it once, oh neat, cool, and then that's it. I haven't really gone back to visit it.
2865000	2867000	So, that's it.
2867000	2874000	Yeah, I don't know. It's a cool figure, I guess.
2874000	2882000	Act F does point out the Shovel Knight figure will work in any other game that supports it though, so it isn't locked to just one game.
2882000	2887000	So, who knows, maybe Shovel Knight will show up in Mario Maker or something, you never know.
2887000	2893000	I mean, that's cool if it does that, but it's just, I don't know, I just don't get the, I don't see the point.
2894000	2906000	And it's been like a year since, almost a year since these have been out, and there hasn't been really anything that's been like, oh my goodness, I can't imagine playing games without this functionality.
2906000	2914000	And that's kind of like how they were talking about it at first, it's like, you know, this is going to be like so amazing, it's going to just revolutionize everything.
2914000	2926000	No, it hasn't. It hasn't done anything. All it is is just, they knew, they got in on a fad because they knew people would collect this crap, just like they collect, you know, Skylanders or fucking Disney Infinity shit.
2926000	2927000	They want to get in on that.
2927000	2930000	Okay, but to be fair, to be fair, even you want the Tron Disney Infinity figures.
2930000	2938000	I want it, doesn't even mean I'm going to buy it. Yeah, that's a big thing, because like, I was all gung-ho about LEGO Dimensions, I'm like, yeah, okay, this is the game I'm going to get in on.
2938000	2946000	But you know what, I'm realistic. It's a fucking $100 game for the base game, and all the expansions are $40. Nope, I don't want it that much.
2946000	2953000	You know, the same with the Tron stuff. Yeah, those figures look cool. Am I going to drop the money for it? Eh, I don't know, probably not.
2953000	2957000	I mean, they look cool, and I might want one, doesn't mean I'm going to pay for it.
2957000	2965000	So, I just don't see the point aside, I mean, that's cool if you want to collect figures, fine, but like, people are just going fucking crazy over this shit.
2965000	2972000	And I don't understand it, because there's really a side, you know what, Nintendo fine, if you want to put out a line of figures, hey, by all means do that.
2972000	2977000	But like, to say that this is some big breakthrough in gaming, it's not, it's just fucking ridiculous.
2977000	2984000	It's just a fad. It is, it's just a fad, it's just like the fucking Wii Balance Board, oh, this is going to revolutionize shit.
2984000	2992000	It didn't fucking do anything, or like, you know, these, the Move controller, or the Kinect, it's going to revolutionize, it did not fucking do anything, it's just a fucking fad.
2992000	3002000	I would agree that probably ten years from now, we're not going to have this Amiibo, Skylanders, Infinity Figures, Lego, we're probably not going to have this in ten years.
3002000	3004000	It'll probably be something worse.
3004000	3007000	No, yeah, I'm getting, oh, you, just.
3007000	3010000	I think the figure thing is not, I think it's dated.
3010000	3014000	Just wait, all it's going to take is a fucking Pokemon game.
3014000	3020000	There's going to be a fucking Pokemon game, and they're going to have an Amiibo for every goddamn Pokemon out there.
3020000	3022000	To the point where some people are like, fuck you.
3022000	3027000	Nope, nope, people are not going to be all, fuck you, they're going to be like, I gotta buy them all!
3027000	3032000	But they're exclusive to Target, and Walmart, and Gamestop, and Nintendo, and I don't know.
3032000	3034000	Yeah, no, I'm not, I'm not.
3034000	3035000	Denny's.
3035000	3037000	I'm not here for that. Denny's.
3037000	3039000	299 Breakfast Slam.
3039000	3044000	Super Meat Boy Amiibo is going to be exclusive to Denny's.
3045000	3050000	No, it would be, it would be like the really crappy Pokemon that nobody wants.
3050000	3055000	It would be Magikarp. Magikarp with the fish and chips played at Denny's.
3055000	3057000	Magikarp, yeah.
3060000	3065000	And then it's a $20, why am I paying $20 for fish and chips at Denny's?
3065000	3075000	Let's see, Dungeon Buster says Gamestop recently reported their fiscal quarter and collectibles helped their bottom line.
3075000	3076000	Oh, I'm sure it did.
3076000	3079000	Well, they gotta love this stuff because you can't just buy it online.
3079000	3082000	And they have the exclusives and all that stuff.
3082000	3089000	Anyway, speaking of what Nintendo's future could look like, we talked about a controversial patent,
3089000	3092000	I don't remember if it was last week or two weeks ago on the show, the whole-
3092000	3093000	It was last week.
3093000	3095000	Last week, the whole, did you listen to last week's show?
3095000	3097000	Nope, I just know the news.
3097000	3101000	Well, surely, I guess some of our listeners are happy you weren't here to commentate on it.
3101000	3103000	Some are sad you weren't here to commentate on it.
3103000	3107000	I wanted to be here just because of the voice actors. I thought that would have been cool.
3107000	3110000	That was a lot of fun. We appreciate those guys being on the show.
3110000	3112000	If you didn't hear the interview last week, go back and listen.
3112000	3114000	I do need to go back and listen to the show.
3114000	3121000	But, so we had the patent thing last week about the fact that Nintendo may be taking the disk drive out of their next console.
3121000	3126000	And we see how fabulously those digital-only ideas worked for Microsoft.
3126000	3130000	But, Nintendo is able to get away with some things that Microsoft cannot.
3130000	3133000	Nintendo has more fanboys than Microsoft when it comes to gaming.
3133000	3135000	I believe that to be true.
3135000	3137000	I know some will staunchly disagree with me on that.
3137000	3143000	But I believe there are more passionate Nintendo fanboys than there are Microsoft fanboys for the simple reason,
3143000	3149000	nobody that is 30 plus grew up playing Xbox.
3149000	3151000	Microsoft was a late bloomer into the scene.
3151000	3153000	Nintendo was around in the 80s.
3153000	3156000	Microsoft wasn't in the gaming scene in the 80s.
3156000	3158000	Big difference.
3158000	3160000	You would be surprised how much clout that has.
3160000	3164000	Anyway, but that's not what I wanted to talk about again this week.
3164000	3165000	I want to talk about some new patents that showed up.
3165000	3168000	But again, remember, take it with a huge grain of salt.
3168000	3171000	This stuff can sometimes just be full of crap.
3171000	3175000	This is about achievement sharing.
3175000	3178000	Some type of patent they have filed for achievement sharing.
3178000	3183000	It lets you record moments before you receive an achievement,
3183000	3185000	and then share the footage with other users,
3185000	3188000	and attach a message like Miiverse.
3188000	3191000	Now, so far on the Wii U, there's no achievement system,
3191000	3195000	but of course on the 360, the Xbox One, PS3, or PS4, you do have that.
3195000	3197000	I thought Xbox One had this already.
3197000	3203000	It records in certain circumstances, and you can share achievements, but it doesn't...
3203000	3206000	I thought that was one of the whole things with the screenshot thing.
3206000	3207000	I thought that was...
3207000	3209000	PlayStation 4 does that now.
3209000	3212000	In a firmware update, it takes a screenshot when you get the trophy.
3212000	3216000	But it's kind of what Nintendo might be doing with this patent,
3216000	3219000	is it's taking an idea that people are already doing.
3219000	3224000	And that is, when I get an achievement, I'm likely to hit the share button,
3224000	3227000	clip the video of me getting that moment, and then uploading the video.
3227000	3232000	And how can you patent that if it's an idea someone has already had and done?
3232000	3236000	Because if it's all streamlined, that's the difference.
3236000	3237000	That's lame.
3237000	3241000	Well, but patent law in this country in general is a goddamn mess.
3241000	3242000	It is lame, yes.
3242000	3244000	And we've talked about that way too many times on this show.
3244000	3245000	That's not the...
3245000	3249000	So it looks like some type of achievement system very likely for the next Nintendo.
3249000	3253000	It'd be cool if it's like Mario Kart 8 stuff,
3253000	3256000	where you have the little highlight video or something like that.
3256000	3257000	That'd be kind of neat.
3257000	3258000	Yeah.
3258000	3260000	Nasin Games in chat says,
3260000	3265000	Xbox One can record certain good moments, but not all achievement-earning moments.
3266000	3267000	Let's see.
3268000	3270000	Also, Nintendo has filed some other patents.
3270000	3272000	And yeah, this is where I don't understand,
3272000	3274000	because some of the other consoles do have this,
3274000	3277000	but I'm just going to say what we're reading out there on the internet.
3277000	3281000	And, you know, as oftentimes goes with this legal stuff,
3281000	3285000	most people, like us, don't know what they're talking about with a lot of this legal stuff.
3285000	3290000	But it's still interesting and gives us clues as to what could be in the next Nintendo console.
3290000	3294000	So I guess there's going to be some type of in-game chat.
3294000	3297000	A monitor for displaying a game image or a television program,
3297000	3300000	and a terminal device having a camera, a microphone, and a loudspeaker.
3300000	3304000	When a user's playing a game or viewing a television program by using the monitor,
3304000	3307000	another user can have chat by using the terminal device.
3307000	3309000	So that kind of makes me sound like,
3309000	3313000	that's what I said should have been in Virtual Console a long time ago.
3313000	3316000	When you're playing Virtual Console on the TV,
3316000	3318000	what if you're playing two-player mode with,
3318000	3322000	let's say I'm going to play Mario Brothers.
3322000	3327000	I'm going to be Mario, and my buddy Ranma in New York City is going to be Luigi, as he often is.
3327000	3329000	So we're going to play Super Mario Brothers.
3329000	3331000	Well, we'll play Super Mario Brothers on the TV,
3331000	3334000	but then we can chat with each other on the gamepad.
3334000	3338000	I don't understand why that's not a thing in Virtual Console today.
3338000	3340000	I'm assuming the system isn't powerful enough.
3340000	3342000	That won't be an excuse the time the next console comes around.
3342000	3346000	So maybe, I'm certainly jumping to conclusions, tinfoil-hatting a little bit,
3346000	3350000	but maybe finally that thing I thought would have been inherent to the Wii U
3350000	3352000	that's going to be a part of Nintendo's successor console.
3352000	3354000	It's not powerful enough to handle chat? Really?
3354000	3357000	Video chat while you're doing a 30-year-old game? Apparently not.
3357000	3360000	Well, I don't know about video chat, but like, I don't know, audio?
3360000	3363000	You would think. You would think.
3363000	3370000	And then also, let's see, multiple operating modes depending on the amount of power the user wants to use.
3370000	3375000	A full power mode, an eco-friendly mode, and a very low power mode that disables network features.
3375000	3378000	It communicates with an external apparatus via a network.
3378000	3381000	The information processing system is capable of operating in three operation modes.
3381000	3384000	A first mode, a second mode, which consumes less power,
3384000	3387000	and a third mode, which consumes less power than the second mode,
3387000	3390000	and where the communication via the network is not performed.
3390000	3392000	Hmm. Very interesting.
3392000	3394000	I don't know. That seems like, once again, it's...
3395000	3397000	Whatever. I mean, that's fine.
3397000	3403000	I understand that people still dog Nintendo about, like, being, having their consoles be green stuff,
3403000	3406000	but that's like, I don't think that anybody out there is just like,
3406000	3411000	yeah, I can't really buy, you know, Wii U because it's just not green enough for me.
3411000	3416000	I mean, is there seriously some hipster out there that actually does that?
3416000	3421000	I mean, I just don't understand why invest in this.
3422000	3425000	Go to our chat room for some more comments at live.vognetwork.com.
3425000	3428000	Kaijudo says, wait, they showed the new Nintendo? I gots to see this.
3428000	3431000	No, no, no, no. These are just some patents that are out,
3431000	3437000	and a lot of people on the internet this week, including us, reading into these probably a little too much, however.
3437000	3441000	You know, because sometimes patents are filed just to protect ideas and protect patent trolls,
3441000	3445000	but sometimes you get things in here that come to reality.
3445000	3448000	How about just figure out a way to get third-party support for your system
3448000	3452000	and making sure that it can stay competitive with your competition out there?
3452000	3456000	How about concentrating that instead of fucking a low-power mode in a lower-power mode?
3456000	3460000	I mean, that doesn't... You're spending the resources on the wrong thing.
3460000	3466000	Well, I don't necessarily think that's true. But anyway, because you don't know what it's doing in those modes.
3466000	3475000	You know, the department that figures that out is completely different from the department that massages third-party companies and gets them on board.
3475000	3478000	Yeah, but you know what gets them on board is having similar specs to the competition,
3478000	3483000	when they're like, eh, fuck it, we can have specs from last generation, and it's fine.
3483000	3485000	Hold on. Let me read this other comment here.
3485000	3493000	NASA Games and Chat says, I think it might be a concern about Nintendo being such a family-friendly system, but that's just me.
3493000	3495000	Fine. Don't video chat with strangers.
3495000	3501000	Don't allow the video chat thing for people that aren't on your friends list where you have added them and they have added you.
3501000	3510000	But if, you know, if I have a friend and we consensually agree we're going to wave our dicks around on video chat while we play Duck Hunt, then whatever.
3510000	3516000	You could do that playing with Skype today. I mean, the technology's out there if people want to be perverts.
3516000	3520000	Here's the sex gets into everything. Everything.
3520000	3523000	Here is the problem with the family-friendly system thing.
3523000	3531000	You're assuming that parents listen to the companies that are making these devices and informing them on this stuff.
3531000	3532000	True.
3532000	3536000	Who did they listen to when the device gets purchased?
3536000	3538000	Who gets listened to?
3538000	3539000	The kid.
3539000	3541000	It's bitching about not having Grand Theft Auto 5.
3541000	3543000	I'm going to die if I don't have one.
3543000	3548000	They're going to buy the system that has fucking Grand Theft Auto 5 or the next Call of Duty because that's what little Johnny wants.
3548000	3551000	It's not because it's family-friendly bullshit.
3551000	3554000	They're going to be like, I don't know what system to buy, but he wants Call of Duty.
3554000	3556000	Does this play Call of Duty?
3556000	3558000	No, but it plays Mario.
3558000	3560000	Well, he wants Call of Duty, so I'm going to pick up that one.
3560000	3562000	The PlayStation 4, the Xbox One.
3562000	3563000	I'm going to pick up that one.
3563000	3565000	That is what sells the fucking systems.
3566000	3570000	Catering the family-friendly, I understand there's some families out there that want to spend their money on this type of thing.
3570000	3572000	It's not working for you.
3572000	3574000	You need to get out of that.
3574000	3576000	That was the whole problem with the GameCube and the Wii.
3576000	3581000	It's like it was pegged as family-friendly so it couldn't break into that part of the market.
3581000	3583000	Get over that.
3583000	3586000	Make your system friendly for everyone.
3586000	3594000	I think that there's enough stuff out there, enough measures where people can make it family-friendly for their kids, but they're not going to do it anyway.
3594000	3596000	So who cares?
3596000	3599000	Alright, let's move on.
3599000	3601000	We've got plenty of other gaming news.
3601000	3605000	See, you think when there's only two of us here it's going to be a short show and then look at it.
3605000	3607000	We're an hour and fifteen minutes in.
3607000	3612000	It's not because of Nintendo, it's because they're stupid and some of their ideals.
3612000	3614000	I just don't get it.
3614000	3617000	Admit it, you want the Wii U Mario Maker console.
3617000	3619000	I saw you tweet about it.
3619000	3623000	I can't afford it, but I would love to play Mario Maker because that looks like fun.
3623000	3627000	But I'm not going to buy it because it's Nintendo or it's family-friendly.
3627000	3629000	I'm buying it because Mario Maker looks fun.
3629000	3632000	If Mario Maker was on Steam, I'd buy it on Steam.
3632000	3634000	Simple as that.
3634000	3635000	Moving on.
3635000	3637000	Alright, so Mighty No. 9.
3637000	3639000	Of course, remember, it's not coming out this year.
3639000	3642000	It was supposed to be coming out next month, but eh, delays.
3642000	3651000	So with that though, they're going to be putting out an exclusive trial that's going to run from September 15th for a full month on PC.
3651000	3657000	You'll have access to four levels, one of which hasn't been playable before, and six challenge modes.
3657000	3666000	Yeah, so they're basically saying that all relevant cutscenes are included since the single player is basically done.
3666000	3670000	And yeah, so you'll get to check it out.
3670000	3673000	And then also of course, backers will get Mighty Gunvolt on Steam as well.
3674000	3682000	Well good. I know a lot of people were very upset with the whole delays and the fact that people are playing Mighty No. 9, but not them.
3682000	3690000	Because there was no trial or anything like that out there, so I'm glad that they decided to put out whatever demo they're taking to trade shows and put it out there for their backers.
3690000	3691000	That's nice.
3691000	3692000	That's good.
3692000	3694000	I'd like to play the game at some point and check it out.
3694000	3699000	I did not back the game, so I have to wait, but I'm excited to give it a try.
3700000	3707000	I will say this, maybe this was an unintended perk of the Mega Man Legacy Collection, but it's making me more excited for these types of games again.
3707000	3709000	And I want to check out Mighty No. 9.
3709000	3713000	Yeah, so I don't know. It looks pretty cool.
3713000	3714000	Yeah.
3714000	3719000	Alright, well moving on. This is kind of interesting with impacts and so forth.
3719000	3726000	Shenmue 3, apparently, having an impact on the sales of a particular gaming console, but it's not the PlayStation 4.
3727000	3733000	You think people would be excited about Shenmue 3 and maybe making the plunge and getting a PlayStation 4, but the actual effect it's having?
3733000	3737000	Dreamcast sales are going up.
3737000	3741000	Alright, now hold on. At least that's the headline that's running around the internet right now.
3741000	3743000	But there are some, like, way hold on.
3743000	3745000	Double their sales! Two consoles have been sold!
3745000	3747000	Yeah, two consoles have been sold instead of one.
3747000	3751000	It's according to one indie game shop.
3752000	3767000	So, even though you're seeing this headline everywhere on the internet right now, it's based off of one retailer in an interview with MVC that they were able to move 20 Dreamcast units in one week, and that's because of the success of Shenmue 3's Kickstarter.
3767000	3770000	Now let me ask you this, Loki.
3770000	3774000	Were there any new Dreamcast exploits discovered this week?
3774000	3778000	Like, are people getting things running on it now that weren't running on it before?
3778000	3784000	Or is it really Shenmue hype? Or is there something people don't know about that's really moving these units?
3784000	3791000	I don't know. Maybe they just realized how awesome a Dreamcast is, but I don't think it's necessarily Shenmue.
3791000	3798000	I mean, if you're hyped about Shenmue 3 right now, then you've probably played the other two.
3798000	3803000	Like, I've never played the other two. I'm not hyped about Shenmue 3.
3803000	3806000	I'm certainly not going to go buy a Dreamcast to play those.
3806000	3810000	I own a Dreamcast, and I'm certainly not going to go try to find Shenmue 1 and 2.
3810000	3814000	Did they even make Shenmue 2 on the Dreamcast, or is that just on Xbox?
3814000	3821000	Um, oh god, it's been forever. I had only seen it on Xbox, so I don't remember.
3821000	3822000	Whatever. It doesn't matter, so...
3822000	3824000	SG100Matt says Xbox only.
3824000	3831000	Okay, so I doubt that's the case. And why is this guy sitting on 20 Dreamcasts anyways?
3831000	3834000	He's probably glad to get that shit off the shelf.
3834000	3837000	And why is that news? That is not fucking news.
3837000	3840000	That's because gaming journalism, copy-paste, headline-headline,
3840000	3843000	Shenmue moves Dreamcast consoles in one shop.
3843000	3845000	20 of them.
3845000	3854000	Uh, let's see. You know what? Let's get, like, all five of our listeners to go buy Atari 2600s this week.
3854000	3862000	And we'll run a headline that says Atari 2600 sales have spiked because of OLR.
3862000	3865000	Naming it the console of the millennia. I don't know what it is.
3865000	3870000	But we'll sell five more, and then it's going to be a headline on Kotaku tomorrow.
3870000	3874000	How about we just tell our listeners not to buy Metal Gear Solid 5,
3874000	3880000	and just say because of Konami sucking, Metal Gear Solid 5 is going to tank. I don't know.
3881000	3886000	Act F says, Sky, but I already have an Atari 2600. Buy another one.
3886000	3887000	Buy two.
3887000	3891000	The one you have will break soon enough. Dungeon Buster says Sears would be proud.
3891000	3899000	Yes, we felt bad for Sears this week, so we're encouraging sales of the Atari 2600.
3899000	3903000	I did want to kind of get a Nintendo, but I don't know, like,
3903000	3908000	I think I'd probably have to get those, like, knockoff Nintendo systems that actually have HDMI out and stuff like that,
3908000	3910000	because it's just going to be too hard to get it to run on my TV.
3910000	3914000	Akuma JP in our chat saying, over in Japan, where he's at,
3914000	3919000	I must say the Dreamcast is selling in second-hand shops here. Price is 200% now.
3919000	3922000	So maybe this is an international phenomenon.
3922000	3923000	I don't know.
3923000	3927000	But see, in Japan, they all said they have Hello Kitty Dreamcasts in Japan.
3927000	3929000	So, I mean, I want to get one of those.
3929000	3933000	It just doesn't, just because you interview one shop doesn't make it a thing.
3933000	3934000	It's just...
3935000	3938000	Hmm. You know what they say. But, yeah, whatever.
3939000	3941000	All right, let's move on with another story, Logie.
3943000	3949000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange on Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase search.
3949000	3955000	So I don't know if this is good news or bad news, but Mega64 is going to be developing games now.
3955000	3962000	You may remember them from, you know, acting like asses on YouTube and doing silly videos,
3962000	3965000	but, yes, now they're going to be making video games.
3965000	3968000	I don't know if this means that they're going to actually make, like, a Mega64 game,
3968000	3971000	if this is going to be kind of similar to, like, the Penny Arcade games.
3972000	3977000	Don't know. But, yay, someone else making games.
3977000	3982000	This just in, though, anybody can really make games, and the tools out there are free to get.
3982000	3984000	So, yeah.
3987000	3988000	But, hey, Mega64.
3989000	3996000	Um, congrats on them doing, you know, going from, you know, indie production stuff to some of this really, really big stuff.
3996000	3997000	I think that's really cool.
3997000	4000000	I mean, I don't know. I hope their game's good.
4001000	4002000	We'll see.
4002000	4003000	We'll see.
4004000	4008000	All right. I'm just looking at some of the comments in chat.
4008000	4011000	sj100matt says, do they still do their silly video shtick? I haven't watched them in years.
4011000	4014000	Yeah, they still do their silly video shtick.
4014000	4019000	I don't even know if I should tell this story. I'm going to get myself in trouble, but whatever.
4019000	4021000	Nobody listens to this show. It won't be a problem.
4021000	4025000	So, I am not familiar with these guys' things at all.
4025000	4028000	Save that one Nintendo thing that they did.
4028000	4032000	They did, like, a Nintendo announcement video a couple years ago.
4032000	4034000	Yeah, the Reggie one, where he was, like, a robot.
4034000	4040000	Okay. So, I was with a friend at E3, and I think this was the major year, like, the 2006 year.
4040000	4043000	The Paris Hilton year and the Wii year and all that stuff.
4043000	4047000	And my friend, like, totally recognized these guys and was, like, fanboying out a little bit.
4047000	4049000	Was like, hey, and introduced himself.
4049000	4051000	And then, you know, the guys were like, oh, hey.
4051000	4055000	And then I was like, hi there. I'm Rob.
4055000	4059000	And, you know, and I didn't know who they were.
4059000	4061000	And I was kind of like, and you are?
4061000	4065000	And, like, dude was, like, super offended that I didn't know who they were.
4065000	4067000	And I was kind of like, oh, sorry.
4067000	4068000	Oh, you're an asshole.
4068000	4070000	I didn't know if you're in the big leagues.
4070000	4074000	And, you know, to be fair, E3 is a very stressful time.
4074000	4076000	There's a lot of stuff going on.
4076000	4078000	You don't know if I caught the guy on a bad day, whatever.
4078000	4083000	But I just was kind of like, oh, not everybody has humility in this industry.
4083000	4086000	I didn't notice your panties bunched up over there.
4086000	4091000	So, that was, now, just unfortunately, now it's just everything I associate.
4091000	4094000	When I hear about them, I'm like, oh, yeah, that's the guy that was super offended.
4094000	4095000	I didn't know who he was.
4095000	4097000	Yeah, I know who you are. I just don't give a shit.
4098000	4100000	Oh, I'm sorry. Was I supposed to be...
4100000	4101000	You know, again, I'm not trying...
4101000	4103000	Yeah, let me get down on one knee for you.
4103000	4105000	I'm not trying to, look, I'm not trying to start shit.
4105000	4107000	It might have just been a bad time.
4107000	4110000	Maybe I misinterpreted something. I don't know. Whatever.
4110000	4111000	Shit happens.
4111000	4114000	No, I'm not going to offend the female gender now.
4114000	4116000	I'm going to just stop.
4116000	4118000	I'll leave that internal thought there.
4118000	4121000	All right, please don't offend people.
4121000	4122000	All right, let's move on.
4122000	4125000	Let's talk about something that's super not offensive.
4125000	4129000	How could you possibly be offended by free things?
4129000	4132000	Wait, Yaris was pretty offensive, actually.
4132000	4135000	Well, this is a lot better than Yaris, believe me.
4135000	4138000	The announcement came out of PAX this week.
4138000	4142000	You know, ArenaNet always seems to show up at PAX and do some different panels and so forth.
4142000	4146000	And they actually announced today, or I'm sorry, yesterday, Saturday,
4146000	4151000	that Guild Wars 2 is now free to download.
4151000	4152000	Guild Wars 2...
4152000	4155000	See, usually when an MMO goes what they call free to play,
4155000	4158000	it's because that MMO is charging a monthly fee,
4158000	4161000	and now they are no longer charging such fee.
4161000	4164000	But Guild Wars' model has always been,
4164000	4167000	oh, you buy the box game, and then you get to play online.
4167000	4168000	There's no monthly fee to play.
4168000	4169000	That's the way it should be.
4169000	4171000	Yeah, well, but here's the thing now.
4171000	4174000	With the original Guild Wars 2, you don't even have to buy the box.
4174000	4177000	You can just go download it and play for free.
4177000	4179000	Why on earth would they do this?
4179000	4181000	Well, President Mike O'Brien said in the press release,
4181000	4183000	in making Guild Wars 2 free,
4183000	4186000	we're not switching business models to a traditional free to play game,
4186000	4190000	and we're not aggressively monetizing free players through microtransactions.
4190000	4194000	We're making the base game free because we're confident
4194000	4198000	that anyone who loves Guild Wars 2 will consider buying Heart of Thorns,
4198000	4202000	continuing their experience into the expansion and beyond
4202000	4205000	with Living World and our newly announced raids.
4205000	4208000	We believe that if people love Guild Wars 2,
4208000	4210000	they're going to buy the expansion pack.
4210000	4211000	There you go.
4211000	4212000	Very interesting.
4212000	4216000	So they're giving away the base game to try and drive sales of the expansion pack.
4216000	4217000	That's pretty cool.
4217000	4224000	Now, it should be said, Guild Wars 2 does have microtransactions in it,
4224000	4227000	which has always been a little bit controversial
4227000	4230000	because you are buying the box game and so forth,
4230000	4234000	and my understanding is the people that bought the boxed game
4234000	4237000	are going to get these different level perks,
4237000	4238000	and I don't know all the specifics.
4238000	4239000	I haven't played Guild Wars 2 in a long time myself.
4239000	4242000	But I did buy it a long time ago when it first came out.
4242000	4246000	The boxed players that did pay the money for it are going to get some perks
4246000	4248000	that the free players aren't going to have.
4248000	4252000	So the free players are still going to have some restrictions,
4252000	4257000	but they're going to be able to level all the way to the cap in the first game
4257000	4259000	and pretty much do everything that you could do in the first game.
4259000	4263000	It's just they might be limited on some of the cosmetic stuff and all that.
4263000	4265000	So kind of neat.
4265000	4267000	I think there will be a lot of people that are going to take advantage of that
4267000	4269000	and checking out Guild Wars.
4269000	4272000	Bonds006 says,
4272000	4276000	LOL, I guess because Microsoft gave it to me for free.
4276000	4280000	So maybe Guild Wars was already free in some bundles and so forth.
4280000	4281000	ActDef says,
4281000	4284000	It's basically like when Team Fortress 2 went free.
4284000	4286000	Yeah, it sounds like it might be very similar.
4286000	4289000	There you go.
4289000	4291000	I think there will be a lot of people wanting to check out Guild Wars 2.
4291000	4293000	It's certainly not a bad MMO by any means.
4293000	4296000	I think this is pretty awesome.
4296000	4298000	I think there will be a lot of people checking this out.
4298000	4300000	Your move.
4300000	4303000	Funny because I was referencing Hoard House earlier in the show,
4303000	4306000	but I said that one thing they ought to do in World of Warcraft
4306000	4310000	is just make vanilla Warcraft free.
4310000	4314000	They've got like five expansions to make money on to sell things out of the box.
4314000	4317000	Make basic Warcraft free.
4317000	4319000	How do you make the first or second expansion free too?
4319000	4321000	Yeah, why not?
4321000	4323000	I don't understand why Warcraft doesn't go free under the same idea,
4323000	4325000	but who knows?
4325000	4327000	Because they've got that sweet movie cash coming.
4327000	4329000	Yeah, I guess that's true too.
4329000	4331000	By the way, it's not on our show roll tonight,
4331000	4333000	but did you see the whole leaked footage out of Russia?
4333000	4335000	I tried to watch the leaked footage.
4335000	4338000	It was crap-tastic quality.
4338000	4342000	It looks like they changed the trailer dramatically from what we saw at BlizzCon a year ago.
4342000	4346000	Because remember, I don't understand what's been taking so fucking long
4346000	4349000	for them to put out some footage for public consumption
4349000	4353000	because we saw a trailer for the movie in November of last year at BlizzCon.
4353000	4356000	It looked fine to me. It looked better than fine. It looked great.
4356000	4359000	I guess maybe some of the effects might have been rough around the edges,
4359000	4362000	so they say. I didn't notice in the trailer.
4362000	4365000	Maybe they figure if they put it on YouTube, you're going to have people going frame by frame
4365000	4368000	that are very, very analytical or so forth,
4368000	4373000	but I think it's been far too long for them to not put something more hype out there.
4373000	4377000	So it'll be interesting to see if this trailer leak forces their hand,
4377000	4380000	kind of like that Suicide Squad thing that came out of Comic-Con.
4380000	4382000	Remember Warner Brothers got all pissed?
4383000	4385000	Somebody brought a camera out.
4385000	4388000	You got your criminals for watching.
4388000	4391000	Oh my god, fucking babies.
4393000	4398000	It's a fucking movie trailer. It got me hyped about your stupid movie.
4398000	4400000	When it leaked out.
4400000	4404000	You know what? People fucking leaked that shit out on purpose all the fucking time.
4404000	4409000	But you know what? Some movie studios don't act like little whiny bitches when that happens.
4409000	4412000	Honest to god, when I saw the Suicide Squad trailer, I was like,
4412000	4414000	this doesn't look as crappy as I was expecting.
4414000	4417000	And I think that's the way a lot of people reacted to it.
4417000	4420000	Will Smith is Will Smith. That's fine.
4420000	4422000	This doesn't look as crappy as I thought it would.
4422000	4424000	I just don't understand why they were little whiny bitches about it.
4424000	4428000	Like fucking Ryan Reynolds and Fox and shit releasing the Deadpool stuff.
4428000	4433000	They're like, hey, just understand it's going to take us some time to release the full thing.
4433000	4435000	Glad you like the leaked trailer.
4435000	4437000	But they weren't bitches about it.
4437000	4441000	I just don't understand. Warner Brothers, they have like some serious issues.
4441000	4444000	SSG100Matt in our chatroom at live.voggenailware.com says,
4444000	4447000	Loki is making up for lost rants from last week. Love it.
4447000	4450000	You know, Alan was sitting on the couch last week because he actually had the night off.
4450000	4453000	He actually had a couple rants in him about some other things.
4453000	4456000	But Loki, making up for lost time.
4457000	4460000	I'm sorry. It's just like, I just don't get it.
4460000	4463000	It was like even, I'm not alone in this opinion.
4463000	4467000	I mean, everybody seemed to be just like, what the fuck is your big deal?
4467000	4469000	Like, who cares? A trailer leaked.
4469000	4472000	Ooh, it's not like a big secret. It's not like the movie leaked, okay?
4472000	4473000	It's a fucking trailer.
4473000	4475000	It's like, calm down.
4475000	4477000	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates
4477000	4481000	and check out some things that will be coming soon to a gaming console near you.
4481000	4484000	A lot sooner than the Warcraft movie, that's for sure.
4484000	4487000	Hello, it's the fourth quarter because fourth quarter always starts early.
4487000	4490000	It's November to, or September to November.
4490000	4492000	So, starting the fourth quarter off,
4492000	4496000	Metal Gear Solid 5, The Phantom Pain on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4,
4496000	4500000	Xbox 360, and Xbox One and PC.
4500000	4505000	Nobunaga's Ambitions, Sphere of Influence on PlayStation 4.
4505000	4510000	Also, getting a physical release, Brothers, A Tale of Two Sons on PlayStation 4.
4510000	4515000	Mad Max coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and on PC.
4515000	4518000	It looks like also Brothers is going to be coming out on Xbox One as well.
4522000	4523000	Let's see here.
4523000	4526000	And Company of Heroes, The British Forces,
4526000	4529000	looks like an expansion will be coming out on PC.
4530000	4531000	All right.
4531000	4534000	Looking in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com,
4534000	4537000	Alan, and Loki, since I know you didn't have a chance to listen to last week's show,
4537000	4539000	Alan is giving you a taste of what you missed last week.
4539000	4540000	Alan says,
4540000	4543000	I may have said BioWare got lost up its own ass
4543000	4545000	and referred to Konami as toilet clowns.
4545000	4547000	Oh, and I was going to mention also,
4547000	4551000	Danganronpa, another episode, Ultra Despair Girls,
4551000	4552000	is going to be coming out on the Vita.
4552000	4554000	Yes, still Vita games coming out.
4554000	4558000	See Alan's chat reminding us the contents of opinions of Alan Alchemy
4558000	4560000	are not those of vognetwork.com.
4560000	4562000	Well, that goes double for Loki, quite honestly.
4562000	4563000	There it is.
4564000	4565000	But they're probably right.
4565000	4566000	All right.
4566000	4567000	Moving on.
4567000	4570000	Let's go to Japan and check out what's coming out there.
4570000	4574000	In Japan, Metal Gear Solid 5, the Phantom Pain, of course,
4574000	4577000	making its way out there as well in Japan on September the 2nd.
4577000	4580000	There's also a special headset coming out for that.
4580000	4583000	Just a cool little extra bundle thing if you want to check that out.
4583000	4587000	Metal Gear Solid 5 also released on the Xbox One
4587000	4590000	for ye few loyal Xbox One owners in Japan.
4590000	4592000	Nothing on the Wii U this week,
4592000	4597000	though we're creeping closer and closer to the Mario Maker release in Japan,
4597000	4598000	just like we're getting here.
4598000	4601000	On the PlayStation Vita on the 3rd of September,
4601000	4606000	Infinite Stratos 2 Love and Purge comes out in Japan this week.
4606000	4608000	And lastly, on the 3DS this week,
4608000	4612000	Lego Ninjago Shadow of Ronin is out this week in Japan.
4612000	4614000	Seems like a pretty slow week outside of...
4614000	4616000	I think it's Ninjago is how they pronounce it.
4616000	4617000	Oh, Ninjago.
4617000	4620000	Pretty slow week in Japan this week outside of Metal Gear Solid,
4620000	4622000	which I'm sure is just because that's such a huge release,
4622000	4624000	there's not a lot standing in its way this week.
4626000	4630000	Going over to Europe, since Dark Sakura isn't here tonight,
4630000	4634000	I will try to catch up on what's happening in Europe.
4634000	4637000	Let's see, on the 4th of September,
4637000	4640000	Broken Sword, The Serpent's Curse on Xbox One and PlayStation 4,
4640000	4644000	Nobunaga's Ambition, Spear of Influence on PC,
4644000	4646000	as well as PlayStation 3 and 4.
4646000	4648000	And then on the 3rd of September,
4648000	4653000	Company of Heroes 2, The British Forces making its way to the PC.
4653000	4655000	Alright, just another story here from Loki,
4655000	4657000	and then we'll get to the classic game of the week.
4658000	4661000	Alright, so this is kind of cool.
4661000	4667000	I mean, I don't know, I thankfully have gotten myself out of the game on PC.
4667000	4670000	But if you have a mobile device,
4670000	4674000	you'll be happy to know Clicker Heroes is coming to iOS and Android.
4674000	4678000	Yes, now it can take over your lives away from your computer as well.
4678000	4680000	And I'm assuming it's also free to play.
4682000	4683000	So go download it.
4685000	4690000	I'm a little worried about falling down the Clicker Heroes hole on iOS.
4690000	4692000	Like, my PC addiction is bad enough.
4692000	4695000	Did you know I actually bought rubies on PC?
4696000	4697000	But there's good reason.
4697000	4701000	I felt that I played it enough that I really needed to support the developers.
4701000	4703000	So I threw $10 at it.
4704000	4705000	So there's that.
4705000	4708000	So I'm just worried about, do I really need to do that on the phone as well?
4708000	4709000	I don't know.
4710000	4711000	Alright.
4712000	4714000	Dark Sakura not here tonight, sadly.
4714000	4716000	So that means, guess what, brace yourselves.
4716000	4719000	I'm going to take the reins and cover the classic game of the week.
4723000	4726000	Every week, usually Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault
4726000	4728000	and finds a game that she thinks,
4728000	4731000	hey, you brats should be playing this game this week.
4731000	4734000	But since she's not here, mwahahaha,
4734000	4738000	I am going to actually pick a game that I think you guys should consider playing this week.
4738000	4742000	So the game that I have picked for the week this week
4742000	4746000	is one of those games that I'm kind of surprised we haven't done before
4746000	4750000	because it's been the subject of many an in-joke here at Orange Lounge Radio.
4750000	4753000	But it is one of my very favorite 80s arcade games.
4753000	4759000	This week I have picked Burger Time as the classic game of the week.
4759000	4762000	That's right, Burger Time is the classic game of the week.
4764000	4768000	Some classic sounds there, all the little burger parts falling there all over the board.
4768000	4770000	Let's talk a little bit about Burger Time.
4770000	4775000	Burger Time was released by Data East in 1982
4775000	4778000	and it actually came out for the Deco cassette system.
4778000	4781000	The original title of the game was Hamburger,
4781000	4787000	but the game name was changed in the US to Burger Time for whatever reason when the game came out.
4787000	4790000	Obviously what you do in Burger Time, you're running around this board
4790000	4792000	and the board changes depending on what stage you're on,
4792000	4796000	and you're trying to make these different parts of a burger fall to the bottom of the screen.
4796000	4801000	So you might have like a bun at the top and then like a lettuce and tomato and meat
4801000	4805000	and then a bottom bun thing, but you can cause these chain reactions.
4805000	4809000	So if you drop the bun on the top, then it falls on the meat just below it,
4809000	4812000	the lettuce below that, and then it falls all the way to the bottom.
4812000	4814000	That's how you can actually clear boards quickly.
4814000	4818000	But of course it's not just as simple as running over things and navigating the maze
4818000	4823000	because you are being chased the entire time by baddies.
4823000	4827000	There's of course a big egg that follows you that's Mr. Egg.
4827000	4828000	You probably recognize that.
4828000	4831000	There's also Mr. Hot Dog and Mr. Pickle.
4831000	4835000	I guess Mr. Hot Dog is very upset that you're choosing to eat hamburgers instead of hot dogs.
4835000	4837000	I don't know.
4837000	4843000	You may or may not know the main protagonist of the game is named Peter Pepper.
4843000	4847000	Peter Pepper is the guy that you actually control in the game,
4847000	4853000	and he can actually stun enemies by spraying, basically spraying them with pepper in the face.
4853000	4859000	Yes, early, early, early concept of pepper spray in 1982 to actually stun Mr. Hot Dog and Mr. Pickle.
4859000	4862000	By the way, that's not the only way you can actually attack them.
4862000	4867000	If they're actually on a piece of the lettuce or bun or something as it's falling,
4867000	4869000	you can crush them that way as well.
4869000	4870000	So that's kind of cool.
4870000	4873000	There's only six different mazes in the game.
4873000	4877000	So if you actually beat all six, then obviously as happened in most 80s games,
4877000	4882000	you go back to the beginning and everything gets a little bit harder and a little bit faster.
4882000	4883000	And that's pretty much BurgerTime.
4883000	4887000	I mean, it was from the 1980s, so it was a pretty simple concept.
4887000	4894000	But it was really unique considering that this is, you know, 82 is still really early on.
4894000	4899000	This is way before the NES is out, even though there was a version of this on the NES, by the way.
4899000	4906000	And any of that stuff, it's still kind of a pretty complicated concept considering, you know,
4906000	4909000	things like Space Invaders and Pac-Man and so forth were really the big games of the time.
4909000	4914000	So yeah, I liked BurgerTime because it was very different.
4914000	4918000	And it was like, what the hell, this is a game where you're building burgers.
4918000	4919000	What the hell is this?
4919000	4920000	So that's just kind of why I liked it.
4920000	4924000	And of course, you know I played this on the Commodore 64.
4924000	4925000	You know I did.
4925000	4928000	And I'm sure a lot of you guys played this on different places.
4928000	4934000	Not only was it on the Commodore 64, it was on the Apple II, TRY-2600, BBC Micro, ColecoVision.
4934000	4936000	There's a DOS version of it.
4936000	4943000	It was on Mattel's system, the MSX, the NES, and the TI-99-4A.
4943000	4947000	There was also a deluxe version on the Nintendo Game Boy, which is BurgerTime Deluxe.
4947000	4951000	There's also a mobile phone version, and it's on Wii's Virtual Console.
4951000	4955000	I think it was one of those, you know how they released a few arcade games to Virtual Console?
4955000	4957000	I think BurgerTime was one of them.
4957000	4960000	Now there were some sequels and ports that came later.
4960000	4963000	There was an arcade spinoff called Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory.
4963000	4965000	I never played that one. I didn't realize it was a thing.
4965000	4968000	Also, Super BurgerTime, which I think I did play once.
4968000	4970000	I think that showed up at California Extreme one year.
4970000	4977000	Those are not wide releases, but Super BurgerTime has Peter Pepper Jr., and it's a two-player game.
4977000	4979000	You can actually play two players at once.
4979000	4980000	So that's pretty cool.
4980000	4983000	There was also a console sequel called Diner.
4983000	4989000	And that was when Intellivision was bought from Mattel by INTV Corp.
4989000	4996000	And so they actually had a game called Diner where you kick balls of food so that they roll off platforms
4996000	4998000	and onto a large plate at the bottom of the screen.
4998000	4999000	Kind of neat.
4999000	5004000	By the way, this had nothing to do with the game Food Fight, which you might think is related, but it's not.
5004000	5007000	I don't know if one inspired the other or what.
5007000	5011000	You may have heard more recently of BurgerTime World Tour.
5011000	5017000	BurgerTime World Tour was released for WiiWare as well as Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network and Windows.
5017000	5019000	That came out in 2011.
5019000	5022000	That upgraded the concepts to 3D.
5022000	5027000	And so it came out on November 2nd on Xbox Live and November 15th on PlayStation Network.
5027000	5030000	And then WiiWare, I think, came the next year in 2012.
5030000	5032000	However, this is interesting.
5032000	5035000	It ended up getting delisted in 2014.
5035000	5039000	So it almost makes BurgerTime World Tour a classic as well because you can't get it anymore.
5039000	5041000	I don't know if there was a license.
5041000	5044000	I don't know if MonkeyPaw Games lost the license or what have you.
5044000	5048000	They say that the Xbox Live version sold 8,000 units.
5048000	5051000	That doesn't seem like a raving success.
5051000	5054000	It doesn't seem awful.
5054000	5056000	But, hmm.
5056000	5061000	Anyhow, if you hope for a sequel to BurgerTime in the future, Data East went bankrupt in 2003.
5062000	5071000	G-Mode bought most of Data East's intellectual properties, which include BurgerTime, Super BurgerTime, and Peter Pepper's Ice Cream Factory.
5071000	5078000	So if you want to see another BurgerTime game someday, you gotta hit up the folks over at G-Mode.
5079000	5082000	There it is, your classic game of the week, BurgerTime!
5084000	5086000	Did you ever play BurgerTime, Loki?
5086000	5088000	Yeah, all the time.
5088000	5089000	Yeah, that's a fun game, isn't it?
5089000	5090000	Yep.
5090000	5093000	Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
5093000	5097000	ActDef says, didn't the NES version of BurgerTime support the power pad?
5097000	5102000	You're actually getting it confused with short order and egg-splode.
5102000	5107000	Short order, you built burgers as well, but it wasn't the puzzle element.
5107000	5114000	It was more like Simon Says, where you would see the order and then you'd have to bounce around the pad to repeat the order, essentially.
5114000	5115000	That was a little bit different.
5115000	5118000	It's kind of funny, though, that you thought that was similar.
5118000	5122000	You don't get a lot of video games about building hamburgers.
5122000	5129000	Tigerclaw says, hamburger was the original name of the game, probably because it was such a common word that they couldn't trademark it.
5129000	5133000	And ActDef also expressing surprise that BurgerTime has never been a classic game of the week.
5133000	5135000	Well, it has now.
5135000	5138000	There it is, your classic game of the week, BurgerTime.
5138000	5141000	All right, with that, we're going to take a quick break, but don't go anywhere, guys.
5141000	5146000	We've got plenty more show to come, including rapid fire news, your answers to the FUGL question of the week,
5146000	5154000	mailbag, which we actually have at least one email tonight, and, of course, your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype,
5154000	5159000	Orange Lounge Radio, when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
5165000	5168000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5168000	5175000	Live tonight, episode number 612 for August the 30th of 2015, already in progress.
5175000	5181000	And as a reminder, we will not be here next week over Labor Day weekend, as I will be in Atlanta for DragonCon.
5181000	5183000	And I hope to see many of you guys there.
5183000	5190000	And for those that can't be there, you can still participate with the panels in the podcasting track that Bobby and I will be on through Alpha Geek Radio.
5190000	5192000	So shout-out to them, and thanks for doing that.
5192000	5199000	So many of our listeners who can't be there in person can actually tune in and hear some of those panels that Bobby and I will be participating on.
5199000	5202000	And, you know, honestly, just all the great panels.
5202000	5206000	We're going to be doing a lot of live shows this year. It seems like a lot of live podcasts.
5206000	5209000	I don't even know why we didn't think to bid to do it.
5209000	5216000	Well, probably the only one that could actually really do a show live is probably Bobby, because obviously you and Dark Soccer sadly aren't going to Atlanta.
5216000	5221000	But, yeah, maybe in a future year, we'll be able to make something like that happen.
5221000	5231000	Maybe not even if it's necessarily OLR live, just some type of maybe hodgepodge show between Bobby, OLR, pod culture or something, critical myth.
5231000	5238000	Orange Black Wolf culture myth.
5238000	5242000	Orange Lounge is the new Black Wolf radio.
5242000	5245000	Something like that. Maybe. Who knows?
5245000	5252000	All right. Well, while we brainstorm that over the next year, let's get back into some rapid-fire news. Low-key.
5252000	5259000	So, hey, September is right around the corner, and with that, we've got some free games for you if you have Xbox Live Gold.
5259000	5268000	So, for the month of September, you can look forward to, on Xbox One, the Dear God, and that's going to be available for the entire month of September.
5268000	5276000	Also, Tomb Raider Definitive Edition will be available from September 16th through October 15th, so that's not quite in September, but close enough.
5276000	5285000	Xbox 360, you'll be getting Battle Stations Pacific from the first half of September, and the second half, you'll be getting Crisis 3.
5285000	5294000	So, yeah. And then also, How to Survive Storm Warning Edition is still available on Xbox One through the 15th, so go check it out.
5294000	5297000	I tend to download all that stuff regardless.
5297000	5302000	I always forget on Xbox. I'm pretty good about doing it on PlayStation, but I always forget about the Xbox Ones.
5302000	5307000	Yeah. Let's see. So, let's see here.
5308000	5311000	Then, of course, with that, PlayStation Plus.
5311000	5320000	We'll be getting some new games, including which was chosen by the actual users of PlayStation Plus, which is Grow Home.
5320000	5326000	They have the selection between three different titles in Grow Home 1, so that'll be coming out on PlayStation 4.
5326000	5333000	Also, for PlayStation 4, Super Time Force Ultra, Tesla Grad, and Xenodripper will be available.
5333000	5337000	Also, on PlayStation 3, Tesla Grad and Twisted Metal.
5337000	5342000	And then for the Vita, Xenodripper and La Mulana EX.
5342000	5353000	And because they weren't chosen to be free, Armello and Zombie Vikings will be 30% off for PlayStation Plus members for the first half of the month.
5353000	5359000	And they're not doing that voting thing every month, they said. That's a lot of discounts, so they're not going to be doing that every month.
5360000	5363000	That's too bad. I still think the free thing's kind of cool, though.
5363000	5364000	Yeah.
5364000	5370000	And then, of course, a little bit more was shown off on Minecraft Story Mode.
5370000	5374000	And guess what? It's actually headed to Wii U. What? Minecraft on Wii U?
5374000	5378000	But there's no actual Minecraft the game on Wii U.
5378000	5379000	That's sad.
5379000	5384000	You can get Minecraft knockoffs on Wii U, but no actual Minecraft the game.
5384000	5389000	Hey, if Minecraft Story Mode can run on Wii U, why can't Minecraft run?
5389000	5390000	That's a great question.
5390000	5396000	If the Vita can run Minecraft, why can't the Wii U run Minecraft? I mean, come on.
5396000	5398000	Fantastic question.
5398000	5404000	I don't know. No idea what the answer to that is, it's just not worth it.
5404000	5407000	It's not worth it to develop for the amount of users on there.
5407000	5414000	But yes, it'll be coming out on Wii U, and it's going to have unique control, of course, with the touchpad and everything.
5414000	5417000	So, pretty cool.
5417000	5421000	I'm not sure when that's going to be coming out, but hopefully later on you'll be able to check it out.
5421000	5426000	And then with that, Witcher 3 has sold a whole ton of copies.
5426000	5432000	It's only been out for six weeks, but it's already sold six million copies, and that's without any DRM.
5432000	5434000	So take note, everybody.
5434000	5437000	Nice. Wow, that's a great sales figure.
5437000	5439000	Yep, that's awesome.
5439000	5442000	And that's even without factoring in, I guess.
5442000	5450000	They were saying that the good old game's performance is up 68% over the same six month time period.
5450000	5452000	And that's without even factoring in Witcher 3.
5452000	5453000	Interesting.
5453000	5454000	Pretty cool.
5454000	5455000	And last but not least...
5455000	5458000	I need to really sit down and spend more quality time with that game.
5458000	5465000	It came out during a busy period, but now that I'm not sucked into Final Fantasy XIV as much as I used to,
5465000	5468000	I've got some extra time to sit down and really play some of that, I think.
5468000	5477000	And last but not least, Grand Theft Auto V's video editor is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One next month.
5477000	5482000	Or I should say September. When in September? I'm not sure yet.
5482000	5487000	But they're going to be adding that update, so you can check it out on there.
5487000	5494000	I think it's also supposed to come out on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 at some point, but that's a little later on.
5494000	5498000	But pretty cool to see that the video mode's going to be coming out as well.
5498000	5503000	I really need to go back and play more Grand Theft Auto V. I'm just so disappointed that they haven't released any story deals.
5503000	5504000	Me too.
5504000	5507000	Yes, absolutely. You need to do that.
5507000	5509000	It's a great game, I don't understand why.
5509000	5514000	No, I know. There's lots of great games I miss out on because there's only 24 hours a day.
5515000	5518000	Anyhow, I've got some stories for you guys as well.
5518000	5521000	Not coming to the 360 and the PlayStation 3.
5521000	5526000	I mean, you might be getting your Grand Theft Auto video editor, but you're not going to get Mortal Kombat X.
5526000	5532000	That's right, Mortal Kombat X for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 has been officially cancelled by Warner Bros.
5532000	5535000	In a statement they said, after months of development,
5535000	5542000	Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment has come to the regrettable conclusion that we cannot release Mortal Kombat X for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
5542000	5546000	Please know our teams worked diligently to meet the quality standards set by the current-gen versions of the game.
5546000	5552000	We were not able to get the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions to the quality expected of a Mortal Kombat game,
5552000	5556000	and are very sorry for not being able to deliver the products as originally planned.
5556000	5558000	You mean you're not going to release it like you did Batman?
5560000	5565000	Maybe you joke about that, but maybe that sure taught them a lesson that it better be damn good.
5565000	5570000	I honestly did. When they delayed it for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, I kind of figured it wasn't coming out.
5570000	5583000	Well, and my thought is, honestly, is that the adoption rate of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, I think, has been a lot more than maybe we saw in the last generation of people adopting PlayStation 3 from PlayStation 2 and so forth.
5583000	5588000	Maybe that's been a lot faster, that ratio, so maybe they don't really see the value input.
5588000	5595000	I mean, because let's be real, most people that were interested in that game just fucking bought a PlayStation 4 and bought it.
5596000	5609000	I'm sure there are some people that are upset that are still on the last-gen consoles, but the reality is those newer consoles are going to look more and more hopefully affordable.
5609000	5618000	There hopefully will be a price drop coming again soon, and then you can pick up one of those consoles, and then the year-end edition of Mortal Kombat X will be out that includes all that DLC.
5618000	5620000	That's the one I've been waiting for.
5621000	5623000	You know which version of Mortal Kombat I've been waiting for?
5623000	5624000	What's that?
5624000	5626000	PlayStation Plus Free Edition.
5627000	5629000	Well, didn't they give away Mortal Kombat 9?
5629000	5633000	No, they gave out Injustice, which I still haven't played.
5633000	5635000	That's right. They did.
5635000	5640000	So there it is. Tigerclaw saying the short answer to this, the 360 and the PS3 isn't powerful enough.
5640000	5642000	It's interesting they didn't figure that out a lot sooner, though.
5642000	5652000	I think that, yeah, I just think that they focused on the next-gen version, or the current-gen versions, and just, I don't think that they were ever going to put it out on those platforms.
5652000	5656000	And if they did, it would have looked like Mortal Kombat on the Game Boy.
5656000	5672000	It shouldn't be a surprise. Look at all these other games that they had earmarked for, you know, current-gen, or last-gen that just didn't happen, like Mad Max, or Dying Light, or Mortal Kombat, or, I don't know, probably Just Cause 3 at one point.
5672000	5676000	You know, so it's, I'm kind of expecting it at this point.
5677000	5691000	All right. Well, let's see. Moving on to another story here. This is interesting. There's a Mario Maker level that's out there, because, you know, Mario Maker is available for the press right now, and probably some early leaked copies as well.
5691000	5698000	And there's a Mario Maker level out there that is actually trolling people. This is the one that Jason was referencing in the intro of the show.
5698000	5708000	It actually says on the level notes that it's an all-Amiibo costume level, basically, and it's even in the featured section of the user-created courses.
5708000	5714000	But when you load up the level, Mario suddenly spawns on a conveyor belt, and the following thing happens.
5729000	5740000	And the best part about that, though, is they have, like, a block at the end that's supposed to have a costume in there, but it spawns after you've already cleared the level, which I thought was funny.
5740000	5749000	I thought that was funny as well. Yeah, I don't know. Some people are hearing a sound in the background that's, yeah, I don't know what that is. It's probably one of these other windows from one of these websites.
5749000	5757000	I'm on making a sound in their ad or something, so I'll try to close these windows quickly. I don't know about that. Sorry, I'm hearing it too, but it's just a couple times.
5757000	5760000	I thought it might have been the video for that level. We'll see.
5760000	5771000	Now, for these very naughty levels, Super Mario Maker is not going to have a filter, but there will be a report button in a statement by Nintendo.
5771000	5778000	All players will be able to report any content they think is inappropriate by clicking a button in the game. The level will then be reviewed by Nintendo.
5779000	5791000	So for all those of you that are getting ready to draw the giant penis and the giant boobs and butts in your Mario levels, watch out, because somebody's going to click the button and then Nintendo's going to shut you down.
5791000	5804000	There it is. This is neat. Puzzle Quest. I kind of wondered what happened to that series. I knew they were doing stuff with Marvel, because they have the whole Marvel Puzzle Quest, but it's not going to end there.
5804000	5808000	I guess they have Adventure Time. I didn't even know there was a Puzzle Quest Adventure Time.
5808000	5809000	I remember hearing about that, yeah.
5809000	5816000	D3Go is doing another Puzzle Quest game, and this one will be of great interest to at least one of our listeners.
5816000	5827000	I wonder if Ragenator's paying attention right now, because I think he's going to be into this, because in the next Puzzle Quest game, you will be doing Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest.
5827000	5836000	That's right. It's a Magic the Gathering Puzzle Quest game. It's going to be free to play, and you can build up creatures, spells, and artifacts in the game, I imagine.
5836000	5841000	It's probably going to play out a lot like the Marvel Puzzle Quest does, just with Magic the Gathering cards.
5842000	5856000	Another company that went from being a game publisher to mobile developer. Ironically enough, at the time when I was working at the game distributor, they actually were repped by...
5856000	5863000	Well, the rep that was working for D3, he had actually worked for Konami at one time, too, so that was kind of funny. He repped for both.
5863000	5865000	It's a small industry.
5865000	5866000	Small industry, yeah.
5866000	5867000	You don't want to burn your bridges.
5867000	5877000	Except the credit for D3, they didn't act like complete assholes when they were exiting the market, whereas Konami, they're taking the extra step.
5879000	5885000	All right, well, moving on to one more thing for me here, and this has to do with cover plates for the new 3DSs.
5885000	5894000	Sadly, it's not going to do us a lick of good here in the States, because we don't have the new 3DSs with interchangeable faceplates, because we only got the new 3DS XLs.
5894000	5902000	But for those countries that have the tinier ones, namely Europe, there are some new cover plates coming out on November 27th.
5902000	5908000	There is a cool little Yoshi one, with like a green and blue and yellow and pink Yoshi, you know, being all cute and Yoshi.
5908000	5914000	But most importantly, a Hello Kitty faceplate coming out on November 27th.
5914000	5920000	And this just makes me even more angry we don't have this here. No, I'm just kidding. I didn't even really want a new 3DS anyway.
5920000	5923000	What's the reason for me to get a new 3DS? I still don't understand.
5923000	5924000	It's new.
5924000	5927000	Oh. Oh! Oh!
5927000	5930000	Because it'll play those games that the 3DS-
5930000	5936000	Wait, all two games? One game? Xenoblade, that's already on the Wii anyway.
5936000	5939000	That's what they're going to name the system. It's going to be the new Wii U.
5939000	5941000	The new Wii U.
5941000	5944000	It'll play all the Wii U games, but it's going to be more powerful.
5944000	5945000	For a whole new Wii U.
5945000	5946000	A whole new Wii U.
5947000	5948000	Yes, alright.
5948000	5956000	Let's get to the foogle question of the week. Every week we go to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
5956000	5959000	Yes, there's still people on Google Plus.
5959000	5964000	So we go to Facebook and Google Plus, you slam them together and you get foogle!
5964000	5979000	You know, a lot of people this week talking about the Shovel Knight amiibo, and understandably so.
5979000	5990000	It's pretty cool to see Nintendo embracing an indie game like that and putting it right alongside their flagship characters in a way, even if it's being handled a little bit differently.
5990000	5998000	So this week we thought, you know, I don't want to ask about amiibo specifically, because I know some people are like, I'm not going to get any amiibo, screw those things.
5998000	5999000	Right, Logie?
5999000	6002000	But I did want to talk about collectibles in general.
6002000	6011000	With the Shovel Knight thing coming out, you know, that's a pretty, I don't want to say obscure, but it's certainly not a video game collectible I don't think anyone was expecting to be able to get.
6011000	6022000	So I wanted to ask the listeners this week, what video game character that doesn't yet have a physical toy or collectible available, would you like to buy a collectible for?
6022000	6033000	So let's get to some of the answers. We'll actually start with Google Plus tonight, and we'll say Retertainment starting us off, saying Henry Rollins was in Def Jam Fight for New York.
6033000	6036000	Where's my Henry Rollins action figure?
6037000	6043000	I would actually think Henry Rollins has a brand strong enough where he would have a doll or something, but maybe not.
6043000	6046000	I could support that. I could support a Henry Rollins action figure.
6046000	6053000	ActDeft in our chatroom says, well, I already have a Shovel Knight plush, and I'm definitely getting the amiibo, so I'm happy so far.
6053000	6060000	But if there's a character I would like to have a collectible of, a character that hasn't gotten one yet, is TheWonderful101.
6060000	6064000	Seriously, figures or amiibo of those guys would be awesome.
6064000	6073000	That was a really hyped Wii U game that, you know, I don't know if it met sales expectations or whatever because you haven't heard a lot about it since then, but I know there's a lot of hardcore fans of that game.
6073000	6080000	That would make sense. That would make sense also as a character in Smash Brothers, but we'll see.
6081000	6088000	Brozime says, Sarah Bella from Skullgirls. Her design is too cool to not have an amiibo style figure.
6088000	6094000	Actually, on second thought, pretty much all of the Skullgirls need figures. That art is outstanding.
6094000	6098000	That's a good thought there. So, the Skullgirls there.
6098000	6100000	Let's go over to Facebook where we have some different answers.
6100000	6108000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, where Fabrice A says, the car from Daytona USA is just so iconic to me.
6108000	6116000	I want one of those. Oh, and maybe Oppa Oppa. Those are some good answers, vehicles, as why not?
6116000	6118000	I bet Oppa Oppa probably has a figure.
6118000	6124000	You would think there would be something. Sega really thrives on that nostalgia, but it's probably only in Japan.
6124000	6128000	And Fabrice I know is in Belgium, so if he wants an Oppa Oppa, he's probably going to have to import it.
6129000	6136000	Silent Tom replied and said, I would love to have a wolf link in wolf form from the Twilight Princess amiibo.
6136000	6139000	And, of course, a Tingle amiibo.
6139000	6141000	And there is an Oppa Oppa figure.
6141000	6142000	Is there?
6142000	6143000	Yep, it's on Playasia.
6143000	6144000	There you go.
6144000	6145000	You can't buy it anymore, though.
6145000	6151000	Anyway, Tom finishes here saying, that would make the world a better place.
6151000	6156000	If I can't get Loki in a Tingle costume, this is the next best thing, a Tingle amiibo.
6157000	6160000	There was some guy that dressed up as Tingle. I saw the pictures from PAX.
6160000	6161000	Oh good, and I don't have to do it.
6164000	6170000	Andy R. said, for the longest time I really wanted the Edelweiss tank from Valkyria Chronicles.
6170000	6174000	Someone finally made a model kit, so I guess I already got what I wanted.
6174000	6176000	Now I just want the time to paint and assemble it.
6178000	6185000	Degenerajani says, I'm afraid I must live up to my name and say that I would push a bitch down the stairs for the great mighty poo toy.
6185000	6189000	What would make that toy better is if it would sing the great mighty poo song.
6191000	6195000	William Murderface says, my joke answer is Isaac from the Binding of Isaac.
6195000	6202000	I love that William Murderface answered after the guy that wants the great mighty poo and said this is my joke answer.
6202000	6203000	No.
6203000	6208000	My serious answer is Sora, Riku, and Kairi from Kingdom Hearts.
6208000	6222000	I will say as far as figures go, the only time I ever saw something Kingdom Hearts related in Disneyland, I saw a statue of Sora in the off the page store.
6222000	6225000	And I really regret to this day not buying it.
6225000	6232000	But you know, I wasn't in, even though I was going to Disneyland a lot, I wasn't quite in the same financial place then as I am now.
6232000	6235000	So I wish, really wish I would have picked that up, but I didn't.
6235000	6238000	But I will say that there's at least like some statues and things like that.
6238000	6245000	And I don't know if maybe Tokyo Sea or anything over in Japan might have a little more of a presence of those characters.
6245000	6247000	But that's probably going to be your best luck.
6247000	6252000	But I think, I bet you could find Kingdom Hearts stuff, just a lot of it's probably going to be imported from Japan.
6252000	6261000	And lastly, Justin H says, Fallout 3 vault dweller in any power armor, though the Tesla armor would be the best.
6261000	6271000	So some Fallout love there. I wonder if he's ordered the special Fallout 4 edition with the whole thing that you strap on your arm.
6271000	6275000	You can put your phone in. That'll look crazy.
6275000	6281000	What do they call that thing in Fallout I can't remember all of a sudden? The electronic device.
6281000	6285000	It's like your second screen. That's it, the Pip-Boy limited edition thing.
6286000	6288000	Alright, that's it for our Frugal Question of the Week.
6288000	6296000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
6296000	6303000	Alright, Act Def saying that there are figures for Sora and Riku. There are play arts figures.
6303000	6309000	Not sure about Kairi though. That's right, I forgot about the play arts figures. So check that out.
6309000	6318000	I saw a fan made one, but I want a Lego set for the Metal Slug.
6318000	6328000	And then I also want a figure for Sofia the Third and Bionic Commando. Not the shitty hot dog arms Bionic Commando.
6328000	6331000	I'm talking about the old Bionic Commando.
6331000	6338000	I want the Guardian from the Guardian Legend because maybe this would encourage there to be a new Guardian Legend game.
6338000	6340000	I think that would be the best thing ever.
6340000	6347000	Outside of that I would want Sofia the vehicle from Blaster Master since somebody brought up vehicles earlier.
6347000	6352000	That would be amazing. Or actually I want to say there might actually be Blaster Master stuff out there.
6352000	6356000	I actually think there was a Sofia something something like a long time ago.
6356000	6357000	There is and I looked.
6357000	6358000	Did you really?
6358000	6359000	Yep.
6359000	6362000	And then lastly my third answer would be a number muncher.
6362000	6366000	I'm really throwing it old school. And some troggles while we're at it.
6366000	6371000	I want a number muncher and some troggles and then I can actually put them on a board with numbers on it.
6371000	6373000	Come on. You don't want to see that.
6373000	6378000	There it is our Fugu question of the week. Let's get back into some more gaming news.
6378000	6382000	We will be opening up the Skype line later. 1877 Game OLR.
6382000	6386000	I'm not sure you're aware, but they do have number munchers.
6386000	6389000	You can purchase that for on the iTunes store.
6389000	6393000	Wait wait wait wait. Number munchers on the iTunes store? What?
6393000	6397000	Yeah the iOS store. Yep they have number munchers.
6397000	6400000	Oh like the classic game like reimagined or whatever?
6400000	6403000	Yeah like the classic game. I'm just trying to see some screenshots.
6403000	6406000	That's kind of rad actually.
6406000	6412000	I actually am just looking up Amazon.com right now and they actually have number munchers for PC and Mac.
6413000	6416000	But this looks old. This looks old.
6416000	6419000	Yeah you're going to run on your PC.
6419000	6427000	Or it's going to run super speed where the troggles just fly around the board and fuck you up before you can figure out which of the numbers on the board are multiples of seven.
6427000	6433000	It's the worst stage. Multiples of two, three. I can handle that. Multiples of seven? Fuck off.
6433000	6439000	Yeah they have a picture of the new version. It's kind of, I don't know, different.
6440000	6447000	I have to check that out. I'm really curious now. I had no idea. Of course though that's how they get us thirty-somethings.
6447000	6450000	Hey guys remember when Math Blasters was awesome?
6450000	6455000	So yeah I got to look some of this stuff up. Meanwhile Logie's going to get into some news.
6455000	6460000	So other things you can spend your money on. It's DLC for certain games.
6460000	6467000	In fact one game Galgun Double Piece which is out in Japan right now but not yet here.
6467000	6481000	Although they are supposed to be bringing it over here. You can actually get the DLC. It's the Pheromone Z DLC that allows you to zoom in and see through high school aged girls clothes for the low low price of ten thousand yen.
6481000	6487000	Which they say is about eighty-three dollars. Eighty-three dollars for DLC? That is a lot of money.
6487000	6492000	That is a lot of money for DLC. Way too much money for DLC.
6492000	6501000	So Galgun is like an on rail shooter game. I played the one on Xbox 360 and it was just silly. I mean I don't know.
6501000	6513000	You have some gun that causes them to experience an ecstasy like state after seemingly orgasming. Thank you Japan.
6514000	6522000	And then of course Galgun Double Piece is out in Japan right now on PlayStation 4 and Vita and is supposed to be coming out over here at some point.
6522000	6536000	But yeah I don't know. That's weird. Also with that they're saying that that DLC not only does it allow you to see through their clothes but it makes all the girls flat chested or heavily endowed boob wise.
6536000	6546000	Lord. So that's special. But a hundred dollars? If Jamie were here and not at Weird Al I'm sure she would be saying something like this.
6546000	6551000	That's not worth it for like that kind of money. That's just not worth it. That's too much money.
6551000	6559000	Maybe we'll get that included in the US. For that much money you could go see Real Boobs at a nearby juice bar. Right?
6559000	6561000	Yeah.
6561000	6570000	Alright. Moving on. I think this game is going to be a little more classy than this. Showing boobs and all that stuff.
6570000	6575000	But no. This game looks like it's going to be pretty cool based on some of the previews we're seeing coming out of PAX.
6575000	6581000	And it's Cliff Bleszinski's newest game. You know of course he was a big part of Unreal Tournament and Gears of War.
6581000	6589000	And you heard about Project Blue Streak previously. Well we finally figured out what that really is over the weekend.
6589000	6596000	It is a game called Lawbreakers. It is what they are calling a futuristic first person arena shooter.
6596000	6603000	And there's a couple trailers that came out of this. There was like a CGI trailer basically. And there was a gameplay trailer.
6603000	6613000	And the reason why they call it Lawbreakers is because it sounds like there's this whole thing about mankind has been recovering from a gravity altering cataclysmic event.
6613000	6618000	So what is the law you're breaking? The law of gravity. So interesting.
6618000	6622000	So now there's two factions. A peacekeeping organization and a crime syndicate that are at war with each other.
6622000	6628000	And I was watching a little bit of the gameplay videos. I'm sure many of you were. And it was definitely featuring a lot of different characters.
6628000	6635000	And it did look really like fluid kind of combat. Like one of them was kind of like swinging, like grappling hook type of stuff.
6635000	6640000	And another one would go into a mode where it was like you could kind of heat detect people that were nearby.
6640000	6646000	So it seems really cool. I gotta say, I was reminded an awful lot of Overwatch.
6646000	6651000	Just with the whole different characterizations and like the super, the fact that everybody is very distinct.
6651000	6657000	Not that I'm saying the two games are the same because I think Overwatch definitely has a big Team Fortress feel to it with these characters.
6657000	6661000	Whereas this I think is probably going to be more of a melee kind of free for all sort of thing.
6661000	6665000	But I'm very curious. I'm very curious to see where this goes. I don't play a lot of first person shooters.
6665000	6671000	But I was interested in what I saw. So good luck to them as they continue development on Lawbreakers.
6671000	6674000	I liked a lot of the characters I was seeing in that gameplay video. It looked pretty cool.
6674000	6681000	Alright. So this has been a while and I kind of forgot all about it.
6682000	6688000	But apparently the whole Vita false advertisement settlement thing. They have a class action lawsuit.
6688000	6694000	That is supposed to be paying out soon. And I guess they've been sending out emails.
6694000	6702000	Now I remember it was, I guess they had a settlement site that went live in April and offered eligible Vita owners $25 in cash.
6702000	6708000	$25 in Playstation store credit or three game bundles for Playstation 3 and the Vita.
6708000	6715000	I think I picked the Playstation store credit. Although I haven't seen anything hit my email yet on that.
6715000	6720000	Oh yeah. Did I fill that out? Now I'm worried. Did I get in on that? I think I did.
6720000	6727000	Which begs the question, Red Bull. Where the fuck is my fucking vouchers for Red Bull?
6727000	6733000	That's right. You were all excited. Because it doesn't actually give you wings.
6734000	6741000	I'm not an idiot that thinks it's going to actually give me wings. But you promised me fucking $10 worth of Red Bull vouchers.
6741000	6746000	And yes, I may have signed up myself and my other family members in my house even though they don't drink Red Bull.
6746000	6752000	So I expect at least one set of vouchers coming my way and I still haven't seen that. I'm very disappointed.
6752000	6761000	I still can't believe they have to give away free product because they lied and the product does not actually give you wings.
6763000	6768000	I'm sorry. It's funny. People are dumb. People are super dumb.
6768000	6775000	Why am I not gifted the power of flight for $2.50? I don't understand.
6775000	6777000	Oh god. Alright.
6777000	6779000	Marijuana gets you high.
6781000	6791000	Well moving on. This is a very interesting contest coming out of Hasbro. It's called The Next Great Game.
6791000	6799000	And even though this is a little more about board games, let's be real. A lot of board games and video games get tied together a lot.
6799000	6804000	A lot of great video games actually came from board games and a lot of great board games come from video game franchises.
6804000	6809000	Like I still kind of want that Mass Effect 3 risk set. Just saying.
6809000	6817000	Anyway, so this is more about board games. But Hasbro, they put out a lot of huge, huge board games.
6817000	6824000	So until September 30th, 2015, you can actually go to their website and submit an entry.
6824000	6828000	You know, what is The Next Great Board Game? It's nextgreatgamechallenge.com.
6828000	6835000	Now, they will announce five finalists on October 30th. But here's the kind of hilarious part.
6835000	6844000	You don't get prize money if you're one of the five winners. You get to launch an Indiegogo campaign to raise funds for your concept.
6847000	6851000	And I had the same reaction. I had the same reaction because I'm like, wait a minute.
6851000	6858000	Like, I would fucking need Hasbro to go launch my own Indiegogo concept. I mean, that's fucking stupid.
6858000	6865000	Here's the thing, and I had that same reaction at first, but then reading a little more into it, because I think Hasbro knew a lot of people would laugh at this.
6865000	6871000	Hasbro is promising to use its web presence to promote your project.
6871000	6879000	So it's not, I mean, anybody can launch an Indiegogo, but to have Hasbro, a board game making company, actually promote that Indiegogo.
6879000	6884000	Okay, well that's something, I guess. It's a little more. It's more than nothing.
6884000	6889000	But Hasbro and Indiegogo are apparently going to work with you to build the crowdfunding campaign page.
6889000	6900000	It will end on December 1st, 2015, and then a team of Hasbro game developers will scrutinize all the finalists and announce one grand prize winner in late December.
6900000	6912000	And if you get the top prize, then Hasbro gives you $10,000 in your pocket, flies you to Rhode Island sometime between December and January to actually turn your idea into a reality.
6912000	6920000	So it's kind of weird that the finalists all go to Indiegogo, and then Hasbro will kind of finally pick one and take it under its wings.
6920000	6925000	But maybe they're trying to see how the public gauges the games. I don't know. Kind of weird.
6925000	6935000	By the way, you may not know this, but Hasbro actually went to the public before. Everybody got to vote on a Monopoly board piece, right?
6935000	6937000	Or didn't we get to vote one off the island or something?
6937000	6939000	We were removing one.
6939000	6945000	They removed one in favor of another. Was it the thimble that got the boot? I don't remember.
6945000	6946000	The boot that got the boot?
6946000	6950000	No, did the boot get the boot? I don't know. Somebody in the chat probably knows.
6950000	6957000	And then there actually was a new word added to Scrabble's dictionary. I didn't even know about that.
6957000	6965000	The contest website's terms of service says that you do retain your ownership of all the intellectual property rights in the submission, copyrights, trademarks, and patents.
6965000	6968000	But we retain the rights to make a shitty movie sequel to it.
6968000	6975000	That's right. Maybe that's what they get as a shitty movie sequel. I don't know.
6975000	6981000	Now I want to know what word they added to the Scrabble dictionary as a result of that.
6981000	6983000	Meatcrub.
6983000	6987000	I'm going to research that while you do the next story, Logie.
6987000	6996000	Alright. So unfortunately, even though they launched the sequel to Angry Birds, Rovio is still cutting jobs.
6996000	7010000	And they had to cut their jobs by 260 employees. And they're saying now that that's the total layoffs now between, I guess now in October, it's about 40% of the staff that they had in October of last year.
7011000	7017000	So, I don't know. That's kind of, that sucks, I guess.
7017000	7028000	They're saying right now that they've laid off some people back in December. That was 110 employees.
7028000	7035000	So far, I think grand total is just the 260 jobs total.
7035000	7038000	So, I don't know.
7038000	7042000	But I guess they're still not doing as great with Angry Birds 2.
7042000	7047000	But aren't they supposed to be having a movie coming out soon or something like that? Like, I give a shit about that. I don't know.
7047000	7053000	But I thought there was supposed to be an Angry Birds movie coming out soon. Within like a year or so.
7055000	7064000	Alright. To do the results of what I was looking at earlier, they did add a cat piece to Monopoly in 2013.
7064000	7072000	That was the one that was voted in. And what lost was the robot, the guitar, the helicopter, and the ring.
7072000	7080000	Were the losing pieces. But it doesn't appear, oh no they did, they got rid of the iron. The iron got voted off the island in favor of a cat.
7080000	7082000	Yeah, the iron was kind of lame.
7082000	7083000	The iron was super lame.
7083000	7088000	It was like an old school iron too. It's like, everyone's like, what the fuck is this?
7088000	7095000	However, I'm not able to find out what the word is that they added into Scrabble. Although, Cial says it was a bunch of texting shorthand.
7095000	7098000	I thought it was just one word. I thought that was the deal. I don't know.
7098000	7101000	Let's see, go into chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7101000	7107000	Nasongames is commenting on what you just talked about. Loki's saying, Rovio cutting jobs. I can't even say I feel bad about that.
7107000	7109000	Even King did layoffs.
7109000	7118000	Yeah, actually they did add lots of words. Let's see here, this was actually earlier this year.
7118000	7130000	So they added, let's see here, emoji, bezzy, wah.
7130000	7132000	That was a cool DDR song, wah.
7132000	7139000	Well, it's W-H, W-A-H-H. Let's see here.
7139000	7141000	Alright, I'm over the Scrabble.
7141000	7144000	I think that was something different because that was 6500 words.
7144000	7156000	All of Scrabble is knowing those shitty little two letter words that you can just totally fuck somebody up by building one word off another word and then you make like two words out of it because you knew some two letter word and all that.
7156000	7162000	That's all the strategy in Scrabble. If you don't know how to do that, you're not going to win against people who do.
7162000	7166000	Because that's how the points just start chaining.
7166000	7172000	And then everybody likes to build an S on the end of your words and then again you get credit for two words.
7172000	7176000	We're talking Scrabble strategy here on Orange Laundrio.
7176000	7182000	ActDeft in chat says, wah. Warrior and Waluigi are on the Scrabble new words committee.
7182000	7186000	Wah.
7186000	7188000	Ah, lord. Alright.
7188000	7193000	Let's get to the mailbag. We invite emails from you guys every week to our mailbag.
7193000	7197000	Participate at Orangelaundrio.com is the place to send emails.
7197000	7207000	Let's go into the mailbag. We're going to dive in ahead first and pull out the emails that you guys have sent us this week.
7207000	7213000	Well, it's been pretty empty for the past couple of weeks, but thank god we're saved at this week with an email.
7213000	7216000	By the way, you've got to love the Dark Sakura last week.
7216000	7221000	Send us lots of emails. Send us tons of email. And then she doesn't come this week to read at all.
7221000	7228000	But nobody listened to her anyway except one person. We didn't get one email this week, so thank you to Robert M. for sending this email.
7228000	7236000	And I'm hoping that you guys will flood the mailbag over the next two weeks and make Dark Sakura work when she comes back in a couple weeks here on the show.
7236000	7240000	Alright, so anyway, here we go with Robert M.'s email tonight.
7240000	7244000	It's been a very long time since Video Games Live performed here.
7244000	7255000	And if one of my concerns was a lack of musical variety from the Legend of Zelda portion, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra will be performing the Symphony of the Goddesses concert around the weekend of Loki's birthday.
7255000	7259000	Did you know, by the way, Loki, Symphony of the Goddesses was in San Francisco last night?
7259000	7260000	No.
7260000	7263000	No, I didn't know that either until I saw the pictures of my friends there on Facebook.
7263000	7264000	I would have totally been able to go.
7264000	7265000	I know!
7265000	7267000	I would have been able to totally go last night.
7267000	7268000	I totally-
7268000	7270000	Because I have a family who I can't leave.
7271000	7276000	I would have been able to go, but I just had no idea that it was happening. Oh well.
7276000	7278000	I missed out. What can I say?
7278000	7281000	Well, Robert M. continues on the Symphony of the Goddesses tour.
7281000	7288000	I doubt I'll have the opportunity to see this one myself, but hopefully any other fans you have out here can report in.
7288000	7292000	Yeah, check those tour dates for Symphony of the Goddesses, because I just missed it in San Francisco.
7292000	7299000	But that means it's probably- and if it's gonna be where Robert M. is around Loki's birthday, that's just in a couple weeks.
7299000	7301000	So they must be touring right now, so check that out.
7301000	7304000	Robert M. continues with one more thing on the email.
7304000	7310000	One thing I would like to check out, though, is the Mastermind Room Escape across from the Arch.
7310000	7313000	Have any of you tried out such puzzle rooms?
7313000	7314000	And that is from Robert M.
7314000	7317000	Are you familiar, Loki, with the puzzle room thing?
7317000	7319000	This is some trend.
7319000	7324000	I haven't heard of the puzzle room, but I've heard of Mastermind, or seen videos of it.
7324000	7325000	I know what that is.
7325000	7332000	Isn't that the one where it's like trip lasers, basically, in a room, and you have to kind of step over them and stuff?
7332000	7336000	Well, I think depending on which one of these challenge rooms you go to, it's different.
7336000	7339000	Because I know they've done some in San Francisco.
7339000	7342000	I have not been to one, but I've had friends that have gone, and from what I've-
7342000	7344000	I thought Mastermind was like- they had one in Santa Cruz.
7344000	7347000	Maybe, I don't know. I mean, these could all be different things, too.
7347000	7354000	But I think there's something- like, you get on a team of seven or eight people, and you're in a room, and you're essentially, quote-unquote, locked in the room.
7354000	7356000	Now, of course, if you-
7356000	7357000	Live or die, make a choice.
7357000	7358000	No, it's not that bad.
7358000	7360000	It's like, aw, man, fell for this again.
7360000	7368000	If you can't figure it out in, like, 30 minutes, or whatever the time limit is, then they say, you lose, lol, and they unlock and let you out.
7368000	7371000	But I guess there's clues in the room on how to get out.
7371000	7374000	So I don't know if there's, like, a combination. I don't know, because I haven't done one.
7374000	7377000	And most of my friends that have gone, they don't want to spoil it for other people.
7377000	7383000	So they just post pictures with, like, t-shirts that say, we got out of the stupid room, or whatever it's called.
7383000	7388000	So I don't- I have never done one myself, although I'm not opposed to doing it.
7388000	7391000	It's just that, you know, we don't really get them here in Sacramento.
7391000	7393000	I'd have to go to San Francisco to do something like that.
7393000	7397000	And usually if I go to San Francisco, I'm not like, let me go get locked in a room today.
7397000	7399000	There's usually other things I'm gonna do.
7399000	7400000	Trapped in the closet.
7404000	7405000	Anyway.
7405000	7406000	Let's see.
7406000	7411000	VidPower is suggesting in our chat room, for anyone going to a future Zelda concert, use the coupon code, HeyListen.
7411000	7413000	Does that really work?
7413000	7414000	HeyListen, all one word in cats.
7414000	7416000	Who's getting the free kickbacks from that plug?
7416000	7419000	That's what I want to know. Are you getting the kickbacks, VidPower? I want to know.
7419000	7420000	Alright.
7420000	7429000	Also, ActDeft reminding us that ActDeft actually wrote a review on our website a little while ago called the, I love that concert,
7429000	7431000	The Legend of Zelda Symphony of the Goddesses.
7431000	7435000	That's right, because they rolled through Mexico, and ActDeft actually went to that concert as well.
7435000	7436000	So that's cool.
7436000	7442000	SSG100Matt mentions, I've done two of those Escape the Room games.
7442000	7445000	It's a lot of fun depending on the group you're with.
7445000	7447000	I imagine it's a lot like Benihana.
7447000	7448000	You ever been to Benihana?
7448000	7449000	I know you love Benihana.
7449000	7450000	Oh yeah.
7450000	7451000	Okay, right.
7451000	7452000	And usually the experience-
7452000	7454000	Ken, in one of those rooms, can I be locked in with a Benihana chef?
7454000	7459000	You know, where it's like, oh shit, I can't figure my way out, but at least I'm gonna enjoy some food.
7459000	7463000	I think there was one in Japantown in San Francisco next to Benihana.
7463000	7464000	So you're getting close.
7464000	7465000	That would motivate me.
7465000	7467000	Oh man, that smells so good.
7467000	7468000	Gotta get out of this room.
7468000	7469000	Gotta claw your way out of the room.
7469000	7471000	Gotta get that karaoke.
7471000	7472000	Hulk smash.
7475000	7480000	No, but I don't think they lock you in with Benihana, but they do lock you in.
7480000	7482000	SSG100Matt says, they let you out.
7482000	7484000	Oh, I was gonna say about the Benihana.
7484000	7489000	That whole experience can be made or broken by who you're sitting with at the table.
7489000	7491000	Because sometimes you might get some pretty cool people.
7491000	7496000	Like one time grandpa and I went in Seattle and it was like a bunch of like younger, like 20-somethings.
7496000	7499000	I think celebrating somebody just getting back from the military.
7499000	7500000	So they were all drinking and having fun.
7500000	7504000	And you know, grandpa being grandpa was like, thank you for your service.
7504000	7505000	And bought him a drink.
7505000	7506000	And you know, all that stuff, right?
7506000	7508000	So we had a great time at that Benihana.
7508000	7514000	But I've also been to Benihana when it's like, you got the family with their kids.
7514000	7518000	And they're very like, just, you know, not that I have a problem with kids.
7518000	7524000	But sometimes other people's kids, you know, can, you know, and they're just, it's out of control and that whole thing.
7524000	7527000	And it's like, ugh, can I get any other table in the restaurant, right?
7527000	7529000	So I imagine the escape the room thing is a lot like that.
7529000	7531000	It could really depend on who you're locked in that room with, right?
7531000	7533000	Screaming baby in the room.
7533000	7534000	Yeah.
7534000	7535000	It's like, why?
7535000	7536000	Why?
7536000	7537000	Why did you bring them in here?
7537000	7538000	Why did you bring the baby to get locked in a room?
7538000	7540000	SSG100Matt says, they do let you out.
7540000	7544000	Some of them stay in the room with you so you don't break anything.
7544000	7547000	Because people are dumb and try to break out the windows.
7547000	7552000	People would be dumb, I can see that.
7552000	7554000	NASA and games says there is one in SAC.
7554000	7556000	I didn't know there was one in SAC.
7556000	7558000	Oh my God, wait, NASA and games.
7558000	7562000	Buddy, pal, Gabe, have you done the break out the room thing in SAC?
7562000	7570000	Because if not, I'm thinking there's an OLR slash IGDA slash cool people trip in the works.
7570000	7572000	Doesn't that sound like fun?
7572000	7575000	It's like silent hill the room minus the silent hill.
7576000	7578000	I like that idea.
7578000	7581000	Alright, NASA and games says sold now.
7581000	7582000	I love that.
7582000	7588000	Ragenator in chat says, can I be locked in one of those rooms with several hooters girls and playboy models please?
7588000	7591000	You pig.
7591000	7597000	Alright, SSG100Matt further clarifying what the experience is like.
7597000	7601000	There are a bunch of clues and riddles that you have to follow too.
7601000	7607000	Some of the riddles involve finding a safe code with a black light on a certain page on a magazine that you find in another clue, etc.
7607000	7612000	You can make an appointment with a group of friends, you don't always play with random people unless you want to.
7612000	7616000	Bonds006 says, to be locked in a room with Rob.
7616000	7619000	Okay, I'm not sure how to take that comment.
7619000	7622000	I don't know if that was, I'm not sure how to take that.
7622000	7626000	I'm not sure if I should be creeped out by that comment or if I should just say thank you.
7626000	7629000	I like to talk though, clearly.
7629000	7632000	It's what I do for a living and it's what I do here on this podcast.
7632000	7638000	So you better be prepared for me to talk your ear off if you're going to get locked in one of these rooms with me.
7638000	7640000	Alright, there it is.
7640000	7642000	That was our email there from Robert M.
7642000	7643000	Thank you for sending that.
7643000	7648000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you'd like to send us an email for a future week.
7648000	7654000	But in the meantime, it's time to get to the FUs of the week.
7654000	7656000	We're going to get angsty here on the show.
7656000	7657000	Why?
7657000	7658000	Because it's tradition.
7658000	7660000	It's tradition to get angry.
7676000	7678000	Loki, since there's no Dark Soccer tonight, you can start us off.
7678000	7682000	I guess a few to retail customer service maybe?
7682000	7687000	I mean, I don't know because like I've had an issue just today and it's really random.
7687000	7690000	Like I've had two accounts broken into by somebody.
7690000	7697000	One in my Walmart.com account which I've used once and one on my GameStop account which I've never used online.
7697000	7702000	Except, you know, I have my power up rewards card or whatever.
7702000	7708000	So I had some points stored there and I didn't even really know what those points are for.
7708000	7713000	Apparently they used some of them to purchase like a congregate card.
7713000	7715000	Something like that.
7715000	7718000	Probably to resell it and it's harder to trace.
7718000	7720000	It's just weird.
7720000	7724000	You know, kind of looking into like that pwn.com or whatever like that.
7724000	7733000	Apparently my email's been associated with five websites that have been like, you know, had exploits done to them.
7733000	7736000	So I guess, I don't know.
7736000	7739000	I don't remember what my passwords were on those sites but I changed them anyways.
7739000	7741000	At least I changed the one on GameStop.
7742000	7745000	But Walmart.com, they like fucking switched the email it's associated with.
7745000	7747000	I mean, how is that even possible?
7747000	7748000	That's stupid.
7748000	7750000	That is absolutely stupid that you can just say,
7750000	7754000	okay, this account right here is just going to be associated with another email called customer service.
7754000	7758000	And they're like, well, I don't see it associated with this email.
7758000	7760000	Like, yeah, no shit.
7760000	7762000	And they're like, well, you can just create another one.
7762000	7764000	I'm like, well, what about billing information?
7764000	7766000	Is that on there? Do you keep that stuff?
7766000	7769000	I don't know, maybe you should watch your bank account.
7770000	7771000	Thanks.
7772000	7774000	Call the bank for real.
7774000	7778000	Make sure, I mean, I'm sure you already have, but they're usually the ones that can fix all that stuff.
7778000	7781000	Well, nothing's been charged to my account.
7781000	7784000	Like I said, the only thing that the Walmart thing, I don't think I had any billing information there.
7784000	7787000	We've only used it once to order something for my son last year.
7787000	7796000	And then, you know, I have this stupid thing that you get points for or money for any price changes that happen.
7796000	7799000	So, you know, that's tied to, I think, that account.
7799000	7801000	So, I mean, they have like maybe 20 bucks.
7801000	7804000	I don't even know how to redeem that shit, so good luck.
7804000	7809000	But, yeah, the power of rewards thing, it's not like, oh shit, you know, it's more of like, this is annoying.
7809000	7811000	I'm like, really? You bought this shit?
7811000	7814000	I mean, you could have bought like a gift card or something.
7814000	7816000	At least if you're going to steal stuff, buy something nice.
7816000	7819000	I hate stupid. It's like, whatever. Okay, cool.
7819000	7821000	I mean, you stole that.
7821000	7825000	I mean, I'm not missing it, but it's just like, really?
7825000	7827000	Well, I will give a related F.U.
7827000	7838000	I'm going to give an F.U. to credit card thieves because I actually had my debit card was used at some random ass store in Indianapolis, I think, for like 70 cents.
7838000	7842000	I think that was them just testing it to see if it would actually like take the money or not.
7842000	7848000	And then somebody at Chuck E. Cheese in Southern California ran up like 60, 70 bucks.
7848000	7852000	Thank God, I caught it like right away.
7852000	7856000	So I called the bank and they, you know, they did their thing, which is interesting.
7856000	7858000	I've had the same bank since like college.
7858000	7860000	So I've had a long time since my college.
7860000	7863000	And by a long time, I mean three years.
7863000	7866000	But, you know, I've had the same bank for a very long time.
7866000	7868000	And this is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me.
7868000	7870000	So I was just kind of like surprised.
7870000	7877000	But thank God I've been checking my finance because everything I'm going through with the job switch and everything, I'm checking my finances pretty religiously.
7877000	7879000	So I caught that early on.
7879000	7880000	So F.U. to credit card thieves.
7880000	7882000	Yeah, and I'll be definitely watching my account.
7882000	7883000	I mean, good luck.
7883000	7886000	There's not any money in there, but I mean, sure.
7886000	7890000	I mean, I don't think any credit card information, but it's like it was Adobe Boxy.
7890000	7893000	Thank you, Boxy. Your thing's shit.
7893000	7899000	And now that they've been exploited to Gawker, but Gawker didn't have anything.
7899000	7900000	I remember the other two.
7900000	7905000	There's some other website I like forum that was on it, but they didn't have anything.
7905000	7911000	And then I don't remember the last one, but I remember Adobe's on there, I think.
7911000	7913000	I don't know.
7913000	7915000	So I'm assuming that they just were testing.
7915000	7917000	Maybe I use the same password on that site.
7917000	7918000	Who knows?
7918000	7922000	All right. Get your dialing fingers ready because we're going to open up the Skype line at one eight seven seven game oil.
7922000	7927000	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio right after two more stories here.
7927000	7928000	And let's get to it.
7928000	7929000	Let's get to it, Loki.
7929000	7930000	This is very exciting.
7930000	7936000	So Lionsgate announced that they're going to be working on a Borderlands movie, and I totally can see that.
7936000	7940000	And I hope that actually comes out soon.
7940000	7951000	It's supposed to be, I guess, produced by Avi and Aria Arad, who did the Iron Man movies and Spider-Man and X-Men.
7951000	7952000	Oh, wow. Yeah, that's a lot.
7952000	7956000	I mean, that should be pretty awesome.
7956000	7961000	I don't know. There's been like, you know, Twitter has been like speculating on, you know, who could play some good roles.
7961000	7972000	And one of the suggestions was, I can't remember his name, the guy from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia playing Handsome Jack.
7972000	7975000	Glenn Howerton, I think, playing Handsome Jack.
7975000	7979000	And that would be awesome. I could totally see that.
7979000	7986000	I wonder, though, if it's going to be like an original story with like, original Vault Hunters, different Vault Hunters than the game and so forth.
7986000	7988000	Maybe. I mean, I think that'd be cool.
7988000	7992000	Either way, I'm totally down to see this.
7992000	7995000	Tigerclaw in chat says, who should voice Claptrap?
7995000	7998000	Just get the guy that does the voice for Claptrap right now.
7998000	8000000	Get the guy who does it now.
8000000	8002000	I think, yeah, why not?
8002000	8004000	It's iconic. You can't really change the voice.
8004000	8008000	I mean, if you can't get the same person, Ellen McClain.
8009000	8012000	No, that wouldn't work.
8012000	8014000	What can't she do?
8014000	8016000	I seriously think they should just get the same guy that does the voice of Claptrap.
8016000	8017000	Yeah, I do.
8017000	8018000	It's a robot.
8018000	8020000	I think it should be the same person that it is today.
8020000	8031000	I actually really hope they don't stunt cast that role, but you just, you can't help but have this sinking feeling that it'll be like Jack Black or something and you're just like, God damn it.
8031000	8033000	Stop it.
8033000	8037000	No offense to Jack Black.
8037000	8039000	No offense to Jack Black either.
8039000	8041000	Don't fucking voice Claptrap.
8041000	8043000	He hasn't really been anything in a long time.
8043000	8045000	He needs some work.
8045000	8047000	Alright.
8047000	8052000	Yeah, Tigerclaw is saying, the thing is, they would probably cast a name actor to voice Claptrap.
8052000	8056000	ActDef says, besides, Glados and Claptrap are romantically involved, it would be awkward.
8056000	8057000	Alright, fine.
8057000	8062000	Alan Alchemy says, Gilbert Godfried as Claptrap.
8062000	8070000	I could see that, but it's just not quite the same.
8070000	8075000	Oh my God. Alright.
8075000	8081000	AP all day in our chatroom says, Howard Stern for Claptrap. I don't know about that.
8081000	8085000	That doesn't strike me as the type of thing that Howard Stern would even do either.
8085000	8088000	He's not a silly robot.
8088000	8092000	I was the judge on that NBC show. I never thought he'd do something like that, so who knows.
8092000	8093000	Who knows.
8093000	8097000	Brad from Pod Culture suggests, Peter Dinklage.
8097000	8100000	Well, since they erased him from Destiny.
8100000	8102000	Boy, that was pretty cruel what they did to him there.
8102000	8105000	Yeah, they pulled a total Kojima on him.
8105000	8108000	Didn't they? Boy, oh boy.
8108000	8112000	Or, how about our pals from last week?
8112000	8117000	How about Greg Berger or David Sobolove for the voice of Claptrap?
8117000	8119000	Why not a shout out for those guys from last week?
8119000	8121000	I just think they should just have the voice that was in there.
8121000	8123000	See, and that's the other thing, too.
8123000	8127000	And here's the other thing, too, is like the new game for like, totally off topic here,
8127000	8133000	but the new game that they have coming out for Lego Avengers has different voices from the original.
8133000	8136000	They're going to have the actual voices from the movie actors in there.
8136000	8140000	I'm like, no. I like the voices in there.
8140000	8144000	They had fucking Troy Baker doing Loki. It was awesome.
8144000	8146000	And I didn't even know it was him at first.
8146000	8150000	And then, because we watched the movie that they have, too, the animated movie,
8150000	8153000	which I hope there is another animated movie that goes along with this one,
8153000	8157000	but they had him do the voice. I'm like, it was perfect.
8157000	8160000	Don't change anything. Leave it the same.
8160000	8165000	All right, one more from our chat room where AP all day in our chat room says,
8165000	8168000	okay, okay, Morgan Freeman.
8168000	8171000	Well, now, you know, as much as I want to tell you no,
8171000	8175000	Morgan Freeman really could just read the phone book, and I think I'd listen to that.
8175000	8181000	So, you know, I'm going to be okay with that answer, Morgan Freeman, if not Betty White.
8181000	8185000	All right, one more story here about Castlevania.
8185000	8188000	That's right. I got a story about something new in the Castlevania universe.
8188000	8191000	I shudder to find out what this is.
8191000	8193000	Yeah, sit down, because it's not a game.
8193000	8196000	But on the bright side, it's not a pachinko machine either.
8196000	8197000	Oh, well, that's really...
8197000	8205000	And this is actually a team-up with Adi Shankar, who is behind Dread and Power Rangers.
8205000	8207000	I did not realize he was the producer over there.
8207000	8211000	Announced on Facebook that he's going to make a super violent mini-series
8211000	8218000	based on Castlevania 3, Dracula's Curse, together with Fred Seibert and Kevin Klond.
8218000	8223000	Fred Seibert is already a big name in animated television, so that's pretty cool.
8223000	8227000	Shankar says it's going to be dark, satirical, and after a decade of propaganda,
8227000	8230000	will flip the vampire subgenre on its head.
8230000	8234000	So I'm assuming that means F.U. Twilight, is what I'm reading into that?
8234000	8236000	When I hear a decade of propaganda and flipping...
8236000	8240000	Well, everybody's been already saying F.U. Twilight, I mean, since Twilight came out.
8240000	8242000	Yeah, that's true.
8242000	8245000	So, anyway, that's interesting.
8245000	8248000	That's going to be cool if they actually bring that to fruition.
8248000	8252000	So, yeah, a Castlevania super violent mini-series.
8252000	8254000	I'd be down with that. That's fine.
8254000	8258000	It's not like Saturday morning cartoon material.
8258000	8262000	Like, I think, you know, back to, was it Captain Power?
8262000	8265000	Well, yeah, there's a part of me that's like,
8265000	8267000	well, God, what TV network's going to want to air something like this?
8267000	8272000	But we live in a world now where you could shop this to Netflix, Hulu,
8272000	8274000	or some of those, like, what, Crunchyroll,
8274000	8277000	and some of those things that specialize in animated series.
8277000	8279000	Like, you know, that's the type of world we're in now,
8279000	8282000	where, you know, this series could find a home somewhere else
8282000	8284000	and be okay and make some money.
8284000	8285000	Yeah.
8285000	8288000	So it doesn't even really necessarily have to be on TV.
8288000	8289000	We'll see.
8289000	8291000	All right. We're going to open up the Skype line.
8291000	8296000	It is time. 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype,
8296000	8299000	OrangeLoungeRadio. That's all one word.
8299000	8302000	Give us a call if you'd like to talk about anything we've talked about tonight
8302000	8304000	or perhaps something different.
8304000	8306000	Wow, it's lighting up already. Let's get to it.
8306000	8307000	Geez, lots of people trying to get in.
8307000	8309000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
8309000	8310000	Hey, this is Act Deaf.
8310000	8312000	Hey, buddy. Act Deaf. How you doing?
8312000	8315000	Pretty great since I got the first call.
8315000	8318000	Congratulations. There's a lot of people trying to get in.
8318000	8320000	You got lucky. What's up?
8320000	8322000	Well, I could talk about a lot of things,
8322000	8328000	but you didn't talk about something, well, maybe not as big as other stories.
8328000	8333000	But you remember the My Little Pony fighting game a few years back?
8333000	8335000	Fighting is Magic.
8335000	8339000	Yes, Fighting is Magic because they kind of got shut down,
8339000	8342000	but then they were going to get teamed up with somebody else.
8342000	8345000	It was kind of like an interesting resolution.
8345000	8348000	It wasn't just a cease and desist. It was more one of those,
8348000	8351000	well, we've got to shut you down, but we'll work with you type of things, right?
8351000	8354000	Yeah, basically they got shut down by Hasbro.
8354000	8356000	They got a C&D.
8356000	8362000	But eventually the creator of Friendship is Magic teamed up with them
8362000	8367000	to make a new game, at least a new sign and new characters and all that stuff.
8367000	8373000	And after years of working on it and getting the schoolgirl's engine,
8373000	8378000	they're finally going to launch their fundraising campaign.
8378000	8381000	Oh, so they're still going to go to Kickstarter or one of those places
8381000	8384000	to actually fund, I'm assuming, the distribution for the game?
8384000	8386000	Yeah, basically.
8386000	8388000	Does the game have a name?
8388000	8394000	Yeah, they announced the name and the Kickstarter campaign a few days back.
8394000	8398000	The name is going to be Dem's Fighting Herds.
8402000	8406000	I kind of love it. I want to sit here and go, that's so stupid.
8406000	8411000	But I kind of love how awful it is. I kind of love it.
8411000	8415000	Especially when you consider the long, sordid story behind the game.
8415000	8419000	It's kind of perfect. So kudos to whoever wrote that one on the board.
8419000	8423000	Yeah, that was pretty fantastic when I first heard it.
8423000	8425000	So I'm pretty excited about this.
8425000	8432000	The campaign is going to launch on Indiegogo on September 21st.
8432000	8434000	Really? They're going to go to Indiegogo?
8434000	8436000	Because that's where Hasbro goes for their stuff too,
8436000	8438000	which you might have heard earlier in the show.
8438000	8441000	Yeah, that's a pretty big coincidence.
8441000	8450000	Yeah, at least they're going to now release the Kickstarter they were planning on since all this happened.
8450000	8455000	So it's pretty great to finally see what's going to come for this game.
8455000	8461000	They're going to be announcing new characters, stages, all that stuff.
8461000	8467000	And even this following weeks before the Kickstarter launches.
8467000	8473000	It's going to be great. I'm definitely going to help fund this one.
8473000	8478000	And you know why they go to Indiegogo as well?
8478000	8483000	Because it's different than Kickstarter where in Kickstarter if you don't make the goal,
8483000	8487000	which some things like what Red Ash damn near didn't and some of that other stuff,
8487000	8489000	you don't get any of the money.
8489000	8494000	But on a site like Indiegogo, you get to pocket at least whatever is made.
8494000	8501000	So that at least seems to lend credit to the fact that this game will come out one way or another no matter what.
8501000	8503000	So that's pretty cool.
8503000	8510000	Yeah, I had back something on Indiegogo that was the Screwgirls PC port.
8510000	8519000	So yeah, I'm pretty glad that they chose Indiegogo for this.
8519000	8523000	Because yeah, the game will come out in some way or another.
8523000	8529000	Hopefully they will raise, and they will raise the whole amount they will ask for.
8529000	8537000	With the cult-like fandom behind My Little Pony, then I'm sure a lot of people moving on to this, it makes a lot of sense.
8537000	8540000	You'd be surprised, sorry to interrupt you.
8540000	8546000	You'd be surprised how many people are kind of against this despite of the fandom.
8547000	8552000	It's a minority, but there are people mad at this.
8552000	8561000	Well, I'm of the school of thought. I'm not a brony or My Little Pony fan, but I'm all about, you know what, whatever dude.
8561000	8564000	Whatever you like, as long as you ain't hurting nobody, who cares, right?
8564000	8567000	So if that's what you want to be into, awesome.
8567000	8576000	So I love though the fact out of this that they kind of were able to rise up from getting shut down.
8576000	8579000	And really kind of take some coal and turn it into, hopefully, a diamond.
8579000	8583000	By, okay, yeah, they got shut down by Hasbro, but they didn't let that stop them.
8583000	8590000	In fact, they were even able to team up with some of the influence there behind My Little Pony, create some new characters.
8590000	8595000	And now, with a title like Them's Fightin' Herds, that might even put them in a better position.
8595000	8599000	Who knows? NASA Games in our chat says that's going to catch on because of how dumb it sounds.
8599000	8605000	Hashtag America. And who cares as long as they get to cash the check at the end of the day, right?
8605000	8608000	Who cares the motivations for people buying it, right?
8608000	8615000	And yeah, I got to play the original game, the Finding This Magic One, and it had a really good potential.
8615000	8626000	So now, with a really good engine, which is the Skullgirls 1, and all that resource put into this game, it looks like it's going to be fantastic.
8626000	8633000	I really, really hope they do make the campaign, the work, and all that stuff.
8633000	8643000	And I hope that not only the bronies and all the fandom, but fighting game people. It catches on.
8643000	8650000	So, in other words, you're telling people, you know, put your feelings on My Little Pony aside and just check out the damn game for itself.
8650000	8658000	And see if it has any merit and maybe bring some new stuff to the table and is importantly fun. And I can support that.
8658000	8664000	And heck, if you don't like ponies, the game won't have ponies. It will have a cow. It will have an alpaca.
8664000	8670000	That should be the tagline. Absolutely no ponies, but maybe a cow.
8670000	8676000	All right. ActDeaf, my friend, I'm going to let you go to get some more calls, but thank you so much.
8676000	8678000	Hey, thanks for coming. Take care.
8678000	8682000	I still love that name more than anything, I've got to say.
8682000	8685000	All right, let's get to the phones. We've got more calls coming in.
8685000	8687000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8687000	8688000	Hey, it's Sturlock.
8688000	8690000	Hey, Sturlock, buddy. How you doing?
8690000	8691000	Pretty good.
8691000	8693000	Good. Long time no hear. How you doing these days?
8693000	8694000	Yeah, doing well.
8694000	8695000	Good. What you doing?
8695000	8701000	So I kind of wanted to gush about a game I've been playing for a couple months, actually.
8701000	8702000	Gush away?
8702000	8711000	It's my mobile addiction. It's Final Fantasy Record Keeper.
8711000	8713000	I knew it. I knew it. You know what?
8713000	8714000	Holy fuck.
8714000	8727000	You and Alan both. I will sometimes, like, I'll kind of be trying to go to sleep or whatever, and Alan, I'll see his on his phone looking at something, and I kind of look over and sure enough, it's Final Fantasy Record Keeper.
8728000	8747000	Oh, my God. I was so happy because I'm part of a forum called Audio Games, which is games that blind people can play, basically.
8747000	8755000	And the game is playable with VoiceOver, which is the iPhone screen reader, basically.
8755000	8776000	Really? So, yeah, and this is something that not everybody often considers when looking at games, but you've said on this show before, you're blind, and so some games aren't accessible to you for that reason, so it's really awesome when a game is more accessible to get more gamers to be able to enjoy them.
8776000	8782000	So with Final Fantasy, it'll actually read to you and you can use your voice? That's cool.
8782000	8788000	Well, not your voice itself. The screen reader itself is called VoiceOver.
8788000	8792000	Oh. Got it.
8792000	8802000	I could, if you want, I don't know how good of a radio this would make, but I could show you a little bit if you want.
8802000	8814000	Actually, I think that's a fabulous idea. If the audio doesn't come through good enough, then I'll shut it down, but right now, we're in radio, so everybody's blind right now and can't see what's going on.
8814000	8827000	So imagine you're trying to play Final Fantasy Record Keeper, and you can't necessarily see the screen, so what does it sound like?
8827000	8840000	You know what, it would probably help if I... just a sec. Sorry. Open settings. I'm going to turn down my speech rate so everybody can understand.
8840000	8852000	Yeah, I was going to say, dang. Is it true that if you aren't so strong in one sense, that your other senses get a lot stronger?
8853000	8856000	Not to the extent that everybody thinks.
8856000	8861000	Well, probably not like Superhero, but you can probably listen to things at that speed.
8861000	8881000	I wouldn't say they're enhanced, but you tend to notice more things. Actually, it's kind of funny speaking of Record Keeper. Japan is getting Kefka in an event now, basically.
8881000	8893000	But still no General Liro. I think you've placed us on hold, Sterlok. Hopefully, Sterlok accidentally placed us on hold, because this thing came up that says call on hold.
8893000	8901000	And I don't know if it's because maybe he's calling us from the same device he's trying to play Record Keeper on, but unfortunately, I'm unable to...
8901000	8902000	Okay, we're back.
8902000	8903000	I'm sorry about that.
8903000	8906000	That's okay. I saw you placed us on hold on accident.
8906000	8908000	Yeah, I had auto-answer on when I got a call.
8908000	8910000	Whoops! That's okay.
8910000	8926000	Alright, but yeah. Somebody posted a video of Kefka's soul break, and it has his infamous laugh in it.
8926000	8935000	And there was actually a second time that he laughs in the animation, but it was kind of covered up by the rest of the animation.
8941000	8946000	Wow. And I can hear it as he's tapping through the menu. It's reading all the options you would expect.
8952000	8956000	You know, some people will listen to this show at like 1.5 speed or 2 speed.
8956000	8958000	That's crazy. I can't do that.
8958000	8962000	I don't know how people do that, but I think that's kind of awesome.
8963000	8973000	That's okay. I will just speak slower so that it sounds normal to you.
8973000	8979000	And you can focus on every word I'm saying.
8979000	8982000	Alright, how is this? Is that understandable?
8982000	8986000	That's fine. It's good enough to give us an example here for time's sake, so go ahead.
8986000	8987000	Alright.
8997000	9004000	Now it's not perfect. You do have to turn VoiceOver off, because it won't see everything.
9004000	9007000	So there are some things you have to turn VoiceOver off for.
9012000	9015000	Oh, I'm in a dungeon. I forgot about this.
9016000	9018000	Let's get out of that.
9028000	9030000	That's the bad thing about it.
9030000	9033000	That's okay. You weren't expecting to have to do it live.
9033000	9038000	That's alright. Alright, well I'll go into the party menu here.
9038000	9040000	If I can. Maybe I can't.
9046000	9050000	There we go. I guess it's just going slow.
9050000	9055000	Alright. I'll show you what upgrading equipment is like.
9055000	9060000	Okay. Just a little bit more here, because we do want to move on to the next call.
9060000	9066000	But this is interesting to me, and I notice a lot of people in chat are kind of like, you know, there's a lot of people.
9066000	9069000	Some people are like, what the hell am I hearing right now?
9069000	9072000	But then other people are like, well, this is interesting.
9072000	9077000	I would have never kind of thought, you know, this is what the game sounds like to some people.
9077000	9078000	Yeah.
9088000	9090000	I'm going to upgrade something.
9090000	9103000	Now, the weird thing about this is a lot of the stuff is unlabeled, so I kind of have to go by memorization.
9103000	9106000	Luckily there's a lot of sorting options.
9106000	9114000	So usually what I kind of tend to do is just sort by newest and do it that way.
9120000	9135000	See Alan Chat says, just saying, I wish I had text speed settings as fast as his audio settings.
9135000	9139000	Nice.
9139000	9147000	Well, that's, I don't know, this is very enlightening to hear kind of this whole thing.
9147000	9153000	So let me go back to what you originally talked about, just like why you love the game.
9153000	9155000	What's so addicting about the game to you?
9155000	9159000	Well, one, the fact that I can even play it.
9159000	9175000	The interesting thing, too, is nothing shows with voiceover during battles, so it's all like memorizing where things are on the screen.
9175000	9182000	I had everything described to me, like what the layout and stuff was.
9182000	9200000	But anyway, why I really like the game is just, it's just a love letter to fans of 8 and 16 bit Final Fantasy fans.
9200000	9213000	And visually, even with the new stuff, like Lightning actually just had her event pretty recently from Final Fantasy 13.
9213000	9222000	And what they do with the more modern games is they kind of touch up the sprites to make them look more like 16 bit, I guess.
9222000	9236000	But I just like the fact that you can, it's kind of like, you know, a theater rhythm where you can just kind of mishmash a whole bunch of different characters that, you know, normally wouldn't.
9236000	9243000	Like, you know, next week we're getting Tella and Goldbez from Final Fantasy 4.
9243000	9247000	But it's like you can have that dream party since Final Fantasy games are always independent of each other.
9247000	9251000	It's like, what would happen if this character from this game and this character from this game actually went out of energy?
9251000	9252000	Yeah, I thought that was kind of cool.
9252000	9261000	I'm really, really, really looking forward to eventually having, like, Goldbez and Kefka and, like, Sephiroth, because, yeah, Sephiroth's in the game.
9261000	9265000	Like, in the same party. Like, just, it's amazing.
9265000	9267000	Yeah, you have an all-basket kind of party.
9267000	9271000	Guys, you don't chat over at live.vognetwork.com that says, is this a battle game?
9271000	9276000	It plays like old-school Final Fantasy fights. Like, you just do, like, a bunch of them in a row kind of thing, right?
9276000	9279000	It's all fights. You don't actually, like, move around dungeons and stuff.
9279000	9283000	Yeah, no. It is a little different because it is a free-to-play game.
9283000	9288000	But, you know, they capture the essence of the Final Fantasy battles pretty darn good, all things considered.
9288000	9294000	Yeah, they really do. Like, take all the bravest. Remember how crap that game was?
9294000	9295000	Yeah.
9295000	9300000	Like, this is the complete opposite of all the bravest.
9300000	9305000	And the good thing about this, too, that I've noticed before is that the guys who made this
9305000	9308000	are the same people that are going to be working on the Nintendo free-to-play stuff,
9308000	9310000	because we heard about Nintendo going to mobile.
9310000	9311000	Oh, nice.
9311000	9312000	Pretty cool.
9312000	9317000	Taijiro says, where can I download this? Or, whore can I download this?
9317000	9320000	I'm thinking AutoCorrect came into play there.
9320000	9322000	App Store and Google Play.
9322000	9326000	Yeah, it's on iOS and Android, so as long as you have one of those, too, just check out the store on the device.
9327000	9334000	Also, if you're like me and you like playing two copies of the game,
9334000	9340000	the global and Japanese versions are obviously independent of one another.
9340000	9347000	So, all you need is a Japanese iTunes account, at least if you're on iOS and you're good to go.
9347000	9348000	Very cool.
9348000	9351000	All right, well, Sturlock, I'm going to let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call.
9351000	9354000	But thanks for enlightening us on Final Fantasy Record Keeper.
9354000	9356000	It looks like you got one person to download it there,
9356000	9364000	and showing us a little bit about what that voiceover stuff sounds like for folks that need the help in reading the screen there.
9364000	9365000	All right?
9365000	9366000	All right.
9366000	9367000	Take care, my friend.
9367000	9368000	Thanks.
9368000	9369000	All right.
9369000	9370000	Bye.
9370000	9371000	Bye-bye.
9371000	9374000	Sturlock there, everybody, calling in. He hasn't called in the show for a while. I appreciate hearing from you.
9374000	9376000	We'll try to squeeze in one more call here.
9376000	9382000	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word.
9382000	9386000	Loki, do you want to, in last minute stories, you want to get out here?
9386000	9387000	Yeah, yeah.
9387000	9391000	So, Jackbox Games announced that Fibbage 2 is going to be part of the Party Pack 2.
9391000	9393000	Oh, a Party Pack 2? Wow.
9393000	9396000	Yeah, and that's going to, they said it's going to include some sort of streaming mode.
9396000	9400000	It's coming to PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC this fall.
9400000	9402000	That's pretty cool.
9402000	9407000	And in an unrelated news, apparently, I guess the VMAs are going on right now.
9407000	9408000	Oh, God, yeah.
9408000	9411000	And Kanye West announced he was running for president in 2020.
9411000	9414000	Good luck. And stuff.
9414000	9416000	That'll be hilarious.
9416000	9423000	Is it true that, I don't even understand why the VMAs are a thing, because when did MTV play music videos in the past few years?
9423000	9424000	I don't know.
9424000	9428000	Late at night, I guess. Somebody correct me on that. I guess it's like in the wee morning hours, they actually do.
9428000	9430000	Five minutes between 12?
9430000	9431000	Yeah, right.
9431000	9438000	But, what was I going to say? I heard she was supposed to be surrounded by RuPaul's Drag Race drag queens at one point.
9438000	9440000	Did that actually happen?
9440000	9441000	I don't know.
9441000	9442000	Or no.
9442000	9444000	And Wes Craven died from brain cancer.
9444000	9453000	Yeah, I saw that come through on Twitter. I guess he was probably battling that and didn't tell anybody about that, as a lot of the celebrities often do, when they're battling those sorts of things.
9453000	9455000	And Notch is depressed.
9455000	9457000	Are you sick, Notch?
9457000	9459000	Let us know.
9459000	9460000	Alright.
9460000	9465000	Kaijuto in chat says, he said more than president. He made a lot of sense tonight. Great speech.
9465000	9473000	He didn't interrupt anybody to do it, did he? As long as he was given the time, or he won his award. He didn't interrupt anybody, though, to do it, right?
9473000	9477000	Is his runny mate going to be Taylor Swift?
9477000	9489000	Actually, that would be a good compliment, because she could speak to, you know, there were a lot of people in that whole debacle. Some were pro-Kanye, some not so much.
9490000	9496000	Maybe if they can come together to be on the same ticket, then anything is possible. They can fix the country together.
9496000	9510000	I think it would be ridiculous, but okay. I'll take ridiculous. I'll take ridiculous as ridiculous as California. Was it the impromptu election they had with fucking Gary Coleman, Arnold Schwarzenegger?
9510000	9513000	Yeah, the recall election. That stuff was crazy.
9513000	9515000	I will take as ridiculous as that.
9515000	9525000	Alright. Let's fit in one more call here on the line, and then we'll see if anybody else is going to call. What are we going to do?
9525000	9527000	So, hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Who's this?
9527000	9530000	Hey, this is Ray Ginator.
9530000	9531000	Hey, what's up?
9532000	9552000	Not a whole lot. Two things to note. The first being a short story. For those that play games on Steam, if you go over to Humble Bundle's store page, they're giving end of summer sale.
9552000	9559000	Every day they change up what's up for sale.
9559000	9560000	On the Humble Bundle?
9560000	9562000	Yeah.
9562000	9573000	I feel like we had a story, too, and I think I had to cut it for time, but I feel like there was something about that Humble Bundle's expanded a lot of the charities you can actually donate to.
9573000	9575000	Yeah, 3,500 charities now?
9575000	9578000	That's pretty awesome. So that's cool.
9578000	9580000	I still think, too, that's free right now.
9580000	9584000	Where you can feel good, at least, about where some of your money goes when you buy games.
9584000	9606000	Yeah. And the nice thing is, I forget what the end date is for just one particular offer, but right at top of the store page, you'll see that they're giving away for free Stealth 2, which is the sequel to Stealth Bastard.
9606000	9622000	And it's normally a $15 game on Steam. I kind of played the original game a little bit on Steam. It seems like a decent game, so there's that.
9622000	9646000	And I did pick up a bundle of all the You Don't Know Jack stuff for $3. I think I really got on Steam this week because I've been dealing with all the stuff this week.
9646000	9666000	So if you want a free game, if you go to the store, grab the free game, and while you're there, you can save money, get some stuff there, and while you're saving money, you're making donations and charity.
9666000	9669000	Well, I like free games, that's for sure.
9670000	9692000	Anyway, now that that story is out of the way, now to get to the meat and potatoes of the call, I'm going to more or less repeat this for those that don't listen live, and me, we don't necessarily listen to Bobby's show.
9693000	9702000	Not to sound like a knocking Bobby show, it's a great show, not necessarily everyone's heard of the show.
9702000	9716000	But anyway, I'm usually not the one on VOD that gets into my own personal background and all that, just like You Don't and Jamie and all that.
9716000	9732000	This sort of ties into video games very loosely. I'm the oldest of four siblings, and my youngest brother is 14 years but junior.
9732000	9759000	And he lives way out in the suburbs of Buffalo, and every so often does come into town, and you know, case in point, a week and a week and a half ago, he came to town one day, and he, you know, whenever he comes into town and stops by my place, he always wants to play Grand Theft Auto.
9759000	9774000	Well, I just found out, I think it was Thursday, yeah it was Thursday the 27th, that apparently he got himself into a bit of trouble.
9774000	9784000	So, if you'll excuse my phrasing, he's probably piss-poor phrasing, but he kind of did a little bit of real life Grand Theft Auto.
9784000	9809000	And granted, the media really hasn't made the connection just yet. I'm willing to bet that within the near future, you know, a whole shipstorm of attention between VOD violence and real life violence is going to hit the news.
9810000	9825000	Hold on, hold on, I gotta jump in here. I know this is an intensely personal story and so forth, and I'm sorry to hear that this is happening in your family right now, but you said he did a Grand Theft Auto type of thing, he didn't kill anybody though, right?
9825000	9840000	I think Jamie shared with me what you talked about with her last night, and I saw that it was, if I'm not mistaken, it was that he had threatened a taxi driver with a weapon, correct?
9840000	9847000	But he didn't hurt anybody, but he threatened, and that's almost as bad, pretty much, in the eyes of the law.
9848000	9859000	Yeah, in effect, a little while before I called, I sent you a PM, a private message in chat with a direct link to the news story.
9859000	9870000	You know, I'm just trying to shorten things down for, you know, due to time constraints on the air, but the drill just over...
9889000	9904000	So believe it or not, I know some of what you're going through right now and what you're thinking and so forth, and it's interesting to me that you said that you worry that the media is going to jump on it and turn it into this video game type of situation and so forth,
9904000	9916000	and you mentioned that he liked to play Grand Theft Auto with you, and then he does this thing where he holds a taxi driver at gunpoint and so forth, and maybe in your head you're thinking,
9916000	9926000	oh God, did I put the wrong idea in front of him by showing him Grand Theft Auto or something like that? Is it the video game's fault?
9926000	9939000	You're asking the same question right now to yourself that I think a lot of people want to ask sometimes when tragedy happens, and not that this is even on the same level, Ragenator, but just for example's sake only.
9939000	9950000	When the whole thing happened with Columbine and the tragedy that happened there, what did everybody want to know? It was about what was in those guys' heads? What made them do the things that they did?
9950000	9956000	Was it the Marilyn Manson? Was it the video games? What is it that happened and made these people do that they were going to do?
9956000	9965000	And honestly, as difficult as it is to hear in some of these situations, sometimes, Ragenator, it's none of it.
9965000	9979000	It was something that was going to happen, and unfortunately, we tend to in these situations, I think, kind of blame ourselves, or what could I have done to stop this?
9979000	9988000	And especially considering that you have the relation that happened there and so forth, but Ragenator, it's not your fault, and that's very important.
9989000	9997000	And I'm going to tell you something. Hold on, hold on. I'm going to tell you something, and I'm going to tell the listeners something that I have not talked about on the show in a very long time, and for good reason.
9997000	10007000	My brother and I don't speak to each other, and there's a very good reason behind that, and part of it has to do with the situation that he put my family through many, many years ago.
10007000	10014000	It's not exactly the type of thing that you're talking about, but it's similar, and I'm going to leave it at that.
10014000	10022000	And the types of questions you're asking yourself right now, these were things that my mom was asking herself. What could I have done differently?
10022000	10028000	What, you know, this is my fault. Did I raise my kid wrong? What did I do?
10028000	10038000	And I'm telling you, she didn't do anything wrong, and neither did you. So I just want you to know that. It's not the video game's fault. It's not your fault.
10038000	10043000	It sucks that it happened, but it's not your fault.
10043000	10060000	Yeah, you know, logically speaking, I do acknowledge that. The one thing I also think at the same time is that, like I said, once this does hit the media,
10060000	10077000	both media and the public at large like to look for a scapegoat. This happens all the time. Hell, you brought up Columbine, so that's another example.
10077000	10084000	Yeah, it's exactly what it is. It's a scapegoat. And I'm not like trying to yell at you and be like, you're wrong, you're wrong, but I'm just trying to tell you.
10084000	10092000	I'm telling you firmly and I'm reassuring you because my family's asked themselves a lot of these questions when placed in a similar scenario.
10092000	10104000	I'm just telling you from that experience, you will come to this conclusion someday as much as it's going to be painful to get there, I think, is that this was a situation that was probably going to happen anyway.
10104000	10118000	And I know that might really sting to hear that in the moment, and I apologize, but unfortunately, when people sometimes need help, they lash out in ways that we would never expect to happen, Reginator.
10118000	10130000	And that's just what happens, and it's really unfortunate. And if there was easier access to mental health care in this country and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I could go on and on and on, but you know where I'm going with it.
10131000	10142000	Yeah, you know, the weird thing is, though, for the past, you know, roughly decade or so, he's been living in a group home.
10142000	10157000	Well, a company that runs several group homes, he's kind of bounced between the various locations within that organization.
10157000	10168000	He was living in one in the lower West Side of Buffalo up until a couple years ago. He moved to another location down in O'Hann, you know, not too long ago.
10168000	10184000	And I don't know if you're familiar with how group homes arrive, but they're supposed to be staffed 24-7 by mental health professionals and all that. They give out medications and all that.
10185000	10198000	Reginator, I know you definitely want to talk this through and so forth for the sake of our listenership and so forth. I don't think they want to hear all of these details because this is an intensely private scenario.
10198000	10212000	But Reginator, like what you're telling me and what I'm hearing in this is that he was sick. He was sick. And sometimes when you're sick, you throw up and you do some things that are sometimes like beyond your control.
10212000	10227000	You're sick, so you throw up. And you didn't want to throw up, but your body kind of made you throw up. I'm not saying it's necessarily like a cookie cutter type of situation, but you're telling me he's dealing with mental health issues. He threw up is what happened.
10227000	10237000	And so, Reginator, I want you to try very hard. Try to take yourself out of the equation. This is not your fault. You can't change what happened, but now how are you going to move forward?
10237000	10247000	And what can you do to maybe be there for your brother in this scenario and so forth? Maybe you'll have a better outcome at the end of the day than maybe I did in my scenario.
10247000	10256000	But I'm not going to get into all the rest. I've already said way too much about what I went through and so forth. So I hope for a better ending for you.
10256000	10265000	And I'm glad at least, A, very important, nobody was hurt. That's the most important thing. People were certainly scared, but thank God nobody was hurt. That's the most important thing.
10265000	10276000	And I will truly keep you guys in my thoughts and hope that your brother is able to get the help that he needs. But again, not the video game's fault. Not your fault.
10276000	10282000	Alright, well thank you for taking my calls. Definitely appreciate it.
10282000	10283000	You're welcome, my friend.
10283000	10285000	Speak to you soon.
10285000	10290000	Yeah, take care. Try to sleep well tonight. You know what? Play some games. Take your mind off it. Believe it or not, it helps.
10291000	10292000	Alright.
10292000	10305000	Yeah, I would play games and I try to say it physically helps as much. Even music really doesn't help that much.
10305000	10314000	Well, you know, it may be a matter of just finding that thing. Try going outside. Take a walk. Maybe do something you never thought of doing before.
10314000	10323000	Maybe take up a game-inspired craft project. Maybe you've always been curious, like, I've never actually tried painting, but maybe now I have all these feelings, I want to get that out.
10323000	10331000	Or maybe I've never tried crafting. Just take this opportunity to try to do something you've never done before. And your body will tell you what that is.
10331000	10335000	Alright, Ray Jeter, I'm sorry, I gotta let you go, okay?
10335000	10337000	Sure, no problem.
10337000	10338000	Take care, my friend.
10338000	10339000	Alright, have a good one.
10339000	10340000	Good luck, you too.
10340000	10341000	Alright, bye bye.
10341000	10351000	Intensely personal scenarios here on Orange Lounge Radio, but, you know, I think, you know, even judging in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, a lot of people, you know, lending words of support and so forth.
10351000	10359000	And, you know, people I think reinforcing the fact this is not something, you know, Ray Jeter caused by letting him play a video game or anything like that.
10359000	10364000	Certainly not an SSJ, 100 Matt lending the advice, go for a hike, it's what I do.
10364000	10368000	Kaijuto says, you do it case by case, there's not one solution to rule them all.
10368000	10372000	Akuma JP says, I go to a pet cafe when I have problems.
10372000	10381000	And I know Ray Jeter is a recent pet owner, so maybe, you know, give some extra hugs to the kitty tonight and so forth.
10381000	10383000	Anyway, I know that was a heavy call.
10383000	10390000	Not exactly the note I wanted to end on, but since we are well past 9 o'clock, I do want to go ahead and shut down the Skype line.
10390000	10392000	Thank you guys so much though for the calls.
10393000	10401000	If you have some more thoughts you want to get out for a future week, participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us an email in a future week.
10401000	10405000	And of course you can always tweet us, twitter.com slash o-l-r.
10405000	10407000	We're also on Facebook.
10407000	10417000	As a reminder, we will not be here next week because of DragonCon, but I hope you guys all have a happy and safe Labor Day no matter what it is you're doing in the upcoming weeks.
10418000	10422000	Loki, I'm going to check in with you one more time to see if there's any last minute stories or anything we might have missed.
10422000	10424000	Nah, not really.
10424000	10426000	I think we're good to call it a night here.
10426000	10429000	I think we made the three hour mark tonight, or if we missed it, just barely.
10429000	10432000	Maybe because of the break in the middle of the show.
10432000	10434000	So plenty of OLR to hold our listeners over.
10434000	10442000	But if you desperately need something next week, you know, there's 600 plus episodes that maybe you haven't heard yet.
10442000	10448000	And a lot of them are still up. I think all the episodes through 2008 are still on the Orange Lounge radio servers.
10448000	10451000	So there's a ton of stuff to listen to there.
10451000	10457000	And also, I know there's an Orange Lounge radio archive, and Dark Tetsuya is always in our chat room.
10457000	10463000	Well, not always, but he's around and he's also on the VOG Network forums and can help you in tapping into the OLR archive.
10463000	10467000	It's not something we officially support, but it's kind of cool that it exists.
10467000	10475000	And I love that it's a thing that people that wanted to hear old episodes kind of came together and built to distribute those old episodes.
10475000	10484000	Though I think old OLR is so different from the OLR of today, you know, we can't forget our roots and where we came from as a show.
10484000	10490000	Alright, well, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
10490000	10492000	Loki, I'll start with you.
10492000	10494000	Seriously trying to get my game done.
10494000	10496000	It will be done hopefully soon.
10496000	10505000	I've just been really tired and distracted, and so I haven't been able to get, you know, mentally I haven't been able to work on my game during breaks at work.
10505000	10515000	I just have like 15 minutes and it's just like, I just can't get into focus quick enough to be able to get anything done.
10515000	10521000	So I'm trying though. Soon, hopefully.
10521000	10522000	You're a busy guy.
10522000	10526000	Really, I just, you know, it's really the few things I want to get done.
10526000	10531000	Leaderboards so that, you know, the demo's, you know, fun because it's basically competing for time.
10531000	10535000	So, you know, I wanted that to be done.
10535000	10541000	And then aside from the leaderboards, really it's just menus and reskinning some of the stuff that's in there already.
10541000	10544000	Mainly just the menus and like kind of title sequence stuff and that's it.
10544000	10546000	I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.
10546000	10550000	As you get more seniority at work, then you'll get the better shifts when it comes time for the bidding.
10550000	10558000	Well, yeah, so I would have had a, okay, because it's based on performance for 90% of it and my performance is fucking awesome.
10558000	10562000	The problem is though is they're like, well, we're going to change the way we're going to do our shift bids.
10562000	10564000	And then they couldn't come into an agreement.
10564000	10568000	And they're like, eh, we're just going to, you can just stay on the same shift you were on before.
10568000	10571000	Except, you know, because we just got fully trained, I didn't get to pick a shift.
10571000	10575000	I just got whatever shift was there and they were all the shitty shifts.
10575000	10577000	That excuse they can't use next time.
10577000	10582000	And so now I have to shift until the beginning of the year. So whatever.
10582000	10583000	It'll get better. It'll get better.
10583000	10587000	All right. My final thought tonight. I'm going to echo what SSJ100 Matt said in our chat room.
10587000	10589000	There needs to be a USL archive.
10589000	10593000	I realize that most of the old Understation Live episodes aren't around anymore.
10593000	10599000	I agree with that, especially with Travis and Jessica deciding to, you know, drop the curtain and call it a night here at the end of the year.
10599000	10606000	I think that would be a really great thing for people that maybe are just now realizing what they might have missed out on over the years.
10606000	10617000	And that was a lot of fun and, you know, I wouldn't have learned a lot of the tricks that, you know, I'm using here on Orange Lounge Radio if it wasn't for my experience at Travis's house back in the good old days of Understation Live.
10617000	10619000	So I'm just, you know, sending them more well wishes.
10619000	10625000	Although I will be giving him lots of shit next week at Dragon Con and I can't wait for that.
10625000	10627000	So stay tuned for that.
10627000	10631000	I'm so excited for Dragon Con this week. It's something I really need after this year.
10631000	10634000	It's been a crazy year but things are getting better.
10634000	10646000	And Dragon Con is just going to hopefully be that nice little like, you know, kind of like palate cleanser before things even take off even more and things are better and more live streaming and hopefully more efforts at VOG Network.
10646000	10650000	Because I know I've been slacking a little bit the past few months. I apologize for that.
10650000	10654000	But things will be getting better as we get into the year and 2016 and beyond.
10654000	10657000	So thank you guys for being here tonight at Orange Lounge Radio.
10657000	10660000	Really appreciate you guys tuning in and participating with the show.
10661000	10665000	As we always say, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
10665000	10673000	Help spread the word because it is the show where every gamer has a voice but we don't know if the voices are out there, you know, if you're not sharing them.
10673000	10675000	So please tell a friend.
10675000	10681000	Also, you can always leave us a five star review on a nice place like iTunes or Stitcher or wherever you heard about this show.
10681000	10683000	And I haven't seen a new review in a while.
10683000	10685000	Granted, I haven't checked in the past couple of weeks.
10685000	10687000	But I haven't seen a new one in a while.
10687000	10689000	So I bet there's someone out there who hasn't written one yet.
10689000	10695000	So I would really appreciate that because that all helps with the discoverability stuff and with, you know, thousands of gaming podcasts.
10695000	10697000	Many of them that podfaded years ago.
10697000	10699000	Sometimes it's really hard to get discovered.
10699000	10701000	So I really appreciate those of you that use the word of mouth.
10701000	10705000	It's all the payment we need here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10705000	10710000	That's gonna do it. We will be back in two weeks to do it again.
10710000	10713000	And I will see some of you guys at DragonCon.
10713000	10718000	Otherwise, we'll be back here in two weeks to talk about whatever gaming news should happen over the Labor Day weekend.
10718000	10720000	Have a great holiday here in the States, whatever it is you do.
10720000	10722000	And overseas, have a great couple of weeks.
10722000	10724000	We'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio.
10743000	10746000	See you next week.
10773000	10775000	We'll be back here in two weeks.
