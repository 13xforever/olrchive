00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Tonight we recap the week in gaming news and we are joined by voice actors Andrew Jones, Drake Berger, and David Solov to talk about voice acting in gaming. Ask your questions live right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio. Episode number 611 for this, August the 23rd of 2015.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We're here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with myself here in studio, Rob Roberts, but you might know me on Twitter as Skie, at S-K-I-E.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And joining me is Miss, at DarkSakura. DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hi, how are you?

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Caffeinated now.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Caffeinated, and it's hot. The temperature in the studio keeps going from extreme hot to extreme cold. It's weird.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And it's only 88 degrees outside. Only.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I know. In beautiful, headquartered Sacramento, California where we're at. It's been pretty creepy.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
AKA Satan's asshole.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Actually, Satan's asshole has been kind of good to us this year. We've had only maybe like 5, 6 hundred degree plus days over the whole summer. I've seen some summers that are way worse.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's been relatively mild.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Some summers are straight up phoenix.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
For being in the middle of a drought.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
True, true. Not joining us tonight, sadly, Techmaster Loki. Techmaster Loki has the night off to take care of some other issues.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But filling in tonight in our third chair, very happy to have him joining us, and I'm not just saying that because I know him very, very, very well.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Say hello, everybody, to Alan, joining us here in studio tonight.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hi.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hi, Alan. Welcome back to the show.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thank you for having me.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're welcome. It's, you know, your house too, so I guess, you know, when this show's going on in the spare room, you know, you can pop on when you want.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But no, I appreciate you being here. Usually you work on the Sunday nights, so I'm glad you're here.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yeah, my work has had a bit of a drought the last two weeks, but considering that it's not an election year without getting too much into what I do.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The way it's been the last two weeks is more representative of what it should be like. The fact that it's been so busy up until this point was the anomaly.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And I guess that streak finally, the well ran dry, but hopefully I can get some hours soon.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But I'm here, so I'm going to help co-host the show.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I appreciate it.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I have stories and everything.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hooray. It's always nice to see you here on the program. And always nice to have you guys join us live.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And remember, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
vog.network.com. And if you are listening to us live, head on over to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And you can participate live with our show and have some of your comments read.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
For example, Brad from Pod Culture is in our chat room right now saying, nice, it's been a while since Alan has been on the show.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It has been a while.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Sj100matt saying, you all will need to pick up the slack in the rant side of things tonight.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Alan, you know Loki is infamous for his rants here in the studio.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can probably be pissy bitchy about something, just not Nintendo. I don't really have the hate in my heart.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can't really drum up that level of angst for them in particular.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And you know, we say this all the time, even though Loki gets very angry sometimes when the subject of Nintendo comes up, it comes from a place of, I'm a fan and I hate seeing you make these decisions I don't like.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's where Loki's quote-unquote anger comes from. But you're not really in the same boat. You think Nintendo's cute, right? I don't know.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They're fine.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
They're expensive. But you're more a PC gamer anyway. I have like every single console here in this house. I don't think I ever see you pick one up.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't know, just something about sitting in the living room and doing that is strange.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's weird because that's what I love doing. I almost think sometimes being in the, I mean, I don't know, the MMOs are one thing.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And maybe that's because of the more chat room style experience where I really need the keyboard.

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But sometimes when I'm playing games, I need to be able to plop on the couch, have that controller in my hand, you know, and just relax.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Just Cheeto dust from chin to ankles.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes! Precisely! Don't you be telling the listeners my secrets here.

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, I wish Alan would get over his fear of planes and come to Dragon Con sometime.

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And also I wish Alan's boss would let him take Labor Day weekend off. Well, I think that's just a matter of, it's also a matter of money.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's a money thing mostly this year because even, I mean, we try to call people when they're at home and Labor Day is like the biggest vacation weekend of the year, right?

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Maybe Memorial Day? So I probably wouldn't have a shift that weekend anyway.

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So you could come probably if tickets weren't so expensive and the fact that, you know.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I think there's another, we're doing Gamer X in December and then I think there's something in February or March.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
MagFest is the thing we're planning on.

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,000
MagCon, it's all about Marge Simpson. We're both going to do our cosplay. Patty and Selma.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So tell us a little more about PC gaming. Since you haven't been on the show in a while, what kind of games do you, I mean obviously we're going to do our gaming weeks in a little bit, what kind of games do you generally enjoy on PC?

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Action RPGs. Your Mass Effect, your Dragon Ages, your stuff that is on, you know, the big titles on Steam, Borderlands, I like FPSs if it has a strong narrative aspect, Bioshock.

63
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:59,000
One thing I noticed you like to do, and I see other gamers do this too, but for some reason I don't usually get into this, is you really like to replay classics.

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Like it seems like every year, and I mean I shouldn't say it that way because it's not like I don't go back and play Super Mario Brothers or Super Mario 3, but you will go back to the 100 hour plus games and really invest like on a yearly basis.

65
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Like I see you go back and go to Half-Life or Half-Life 2. I see you go to Dragon Age.

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The games that I'm more likely to replay like that, Half-Life 2 is a special case because it's a first, obviously it's an FPS so it's going to be the same experience from start to finish. I can just maybe tweak with the difficulties if I want and make it like really punishing.

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But a game like Skyrim or Dragon Age or Mass Effect where you can do things out of order, you can make your character an asshole, make your character a goody-goody, play a different race, there's going to be variety in something that I do in a replay.

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I mean overall the campaign is the same, but it's not like I'm going to fire up Final Fantasy 7 or 8 games that I love and I have played through those more than once, but that's like a once a decade thing because I mean the characters are static, the campaign is static, the grinding is static. I'm not as compelled to invest another 60 hours in that.

69
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Jamie, you want to jump in here?

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's actually how I feel, why I've gone back and I'm playing through, I think I'm on my fifth playthrough of Inquisition right now and I'm on my third or fourth playthrough for the original Dragon Age because I did play it through twice with the same type of character because I really like the Dalish origin, but now I'm playing the human noble and Alistair.

71
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Anyway, because he's pretty. He's a precious cinnamon roll, too perfect for this world. And you know Mass Effect, because modding makes him even better.

72
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You got some fans, fellow fans of PC gaming in chat, Dungeon Buster in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying, yeah PC gaming! And SSG100Matt giving us an update on MAGFest. MAGFest is aiming to have tickets and hotel registration open within the next week or two, re their Twitter.

73
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's going to be my first MAGFest, but I was a fan of the Rockage thing they did out here, which was related, and everybody tells me, you got to do MAGFest, you got to do MAGFest. Alright, fine, I'll go.

74
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I also, since we're talking about PC gaming, I want to give a special free plug because it's not like we have an affiliate thing with them.

75
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:34,000
For anyone who remembers the early 90s games, the Forgotten Realms, the Baldur's Gate, BioWare's first foray into RPGs, the Icewind Dale, some of the more obscure.

76
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Because a lot of those old TSR D&D RPG games were pretty, like Ravenloft I think was one of them with the mummy on the cover. All that stuff is on good old games, GOG.com for like $1.98 per game.

77
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
GOG does some great deals.

78
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And that is for this weekend, so this is a live audience exclusive. So if you're downloading this on the podcast feed, unless Rob gets it up by midnight and you listen to it before you go to bed tonight, which, wow, okay.

79
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's just a tip for those listening live. You can get a whole bundle, I think for like $15 for like 20 games, literally hundreds of hours of gameplay.

80
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Planescape Torment, which a lot of people think is the best 90s RPG ever for PC, is also like $1.98. It's insane, so everyone go check that out.

81
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Awesome. Yeah, hey, I know we don't get paid by these companies to give shout-outs, but I am a fan of good deals tonight. Anyhow, I want to get into our kickoff topic tonight because we actually have a really big show tonight.

82
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I mean, you know, we always try to do a big show here at Orange Lawn Straight Open. Tonight's like a really big show. We actually have some guests joining us tonight.

83
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
At about 6.30, we are actually going to be joined by some voice actors, and I'm really excited about this. We're pretty much going to have like a live panel.

84
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We've been talking about conventions, right? We're going to have like a live panel here on the show tonight all about voice acting. We're going to be joined by Andrew Jones, who's like a casting director, and we're going to talk to Greg Berger.

85
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Greg Berger, you video gamers probably know him, I mean he's done a few things, but you guys probably know him best as Jecht from Final Fantasy X.

86
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Although if you watch cartoons, Dark Sakura practically peed her pants when she heard.

87
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
He's Grimlock.

88
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He's Grimlock.

89
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And Skyfire.

90
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes.

91
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Grimlock.

92
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And he's Odie. So, I mean, he's going to be here live, taking your questions in just a little bit.

93
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If you have to ask who Grimlock is, then you need to leave.

94
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Go to Wikipedia quick and figure it out.

95
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Alright, also joining us, so that's two, we have three, David Sobolov going to be joining us as well.

96
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Very excited. He is Asmodan. You guys, gamers, if you play Diablo 3, Heroes of the Storm, you guys know Asmodan.

97
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He is that voice, and he also has an impressive resume from other cartoons and games.

98
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He is the one that actually had a minor role in Mass Effect 3 as well, so he's tied to our beloved BioWare.

99
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So we're going to talk to all of them in just a little bit, in about 15 minutes here on Orange Laundry Radio.

100
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So if you want to be able to ask questions, get to our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

101
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Meanwhile, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, and you know, tonight's kickoff topic,

102
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
not the sort of thing I like to lead off the show with. In fact, a topic like this isn't really about gaming,

103
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:27,000
but it's more of a side effect of what happens as gaming is getting bigger and bigger and more and more mainstream and so forth.

104
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Those of you that have probably been paying attention to the news today might have heard about the Pokemon World Championships that are going on right now.

105
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The Pokemon World Championships are happening out in Boston, and unfortunately today, there was a bomb threat at the Pokemon Championships.

106
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And they have actually arrested two individuals in conjunction with this bomb threat that's happened there.

107
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is crazy. Obviously, sick people doing sick things with this whole thing.

108
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And you know, now we're seeing this type of stuff where these large gaming events are getting targeted.

109
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You know, if you heard that somebody made a bomb threat against the Super Bowl or the Olympics or some other big sporting event,

110
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
you'd probably go, that's messed up, people are stupid, but you'd probably also go, it seems like there's always some crazy targeting these large events.

111
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And now we're seeing it happen with these gaming events even. It's something else.

112
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What do you guys think when you hear this, that there were people targeting the Pokemon World Championships?

113
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And shout out to the police for catching it and shutting it down before anybody got hurt, thank God.

114
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What do you guys think about this when you hear this? Anybody?

115
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So the two individual suspects, was there actually a device found?

116
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You know what's funny is the story I had closed on me, so I'm trying to find it.

117
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Not that it matters, but I mean, the people that, whatever their intentions were, are going to pay the consequences.

118
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But aside from the arrest, was there an actual device? I'm just curious.

119
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I got it, I got it. Okay, here we go. So a 27-year-old and an 18-year-old, and I'm not going to read their names and give them any attention,

120
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:36,000
27-year-old idiot and 18-year-old moron, we'll call them idiot and moron, were, I guess they were actually invited to play in the Masters Division of the tournament.

121
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And they had made threats on Facebook, and there was a post where there were guns that these guys had posted that they were going to take,

122
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
saying that idiot and I are ready for the world's Boston here we come. And this was brought to the attention of the police.

123
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And so they were stopped from entering the venue on Thursday, firearms were found in the car that idiot and moron had when they drove from Iowa.

124
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Neither one of them had a license to carry, the car was seized, the vehicle had a shotgun, assault rifle, hunting rifle, 250 rounds of ammo.

125
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
They were arrested on Friday night. So there was no bomb, I guess the bomb threat was on Facebook.

126
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Okay, but it very easily could have been like a mass shooting situation, and I totally want to throw up now.

127
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:35,000
People are garbage, and it's gross, and I guess, I include myself in the fact that I do identify with this group, but like the gaming, gamers are gross.

128
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Some gamers are gross.

129
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's an awful industry.

130
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, here's the thing that strikes me as like, just like really scary about this. I mean, obviously the whole thing is weird to begin with.

131
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But, you know, usually when we think about video games make people violent, what are the things they target?

132
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
They target the first person shooters, the Duke Nukem's, the overly, Grand Theft Auto's, the overly violent games.

133
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This was fucking Pokemon. This was a family event. This is something kids play. That's, well, really disturbing.

134
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I understand what you're saying, but it's a different discussion between the content of gaming and what these two idiots would want to be infamous or getting into notoriety.

135
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And for that reason, it's a very, I mean, it's, they're all E-rated games. Parents play them with their kids. Kids love it.

136
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's got a larger audience than say if it was like, I don't know, BlizzCon or something, which I think is going to skew older.

137
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,000
So it's really frightening that they picked a, you know, something that has that much crossover mainstream appeal.

138
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Anyway, SS21 Hunter Matt says, Boston doesn't mess around with security. Act Deaf to reminding me in chat, the Olympics have had that happen.

139
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I apologize if that comparison was in poor taste, but I was just naming some big sporting events that came to mind first.

140
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But I mean, unfortunately, yes, in, in 96 in Atlanta, where I'm going in a couple of weeks, there was a bomb event that occurred and it was all over the media and stuff.

141
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And it was, it was sick then and it's sick now. So, yeah, let's see, also looking in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, SS21 Hunter Matt confirming that one of the guys was a known member of the Pokemon community.

142
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And Dungeon Muster says they boasted about doing this on social media, which the police picked up on, which, you know, was some really weird, sick cry for attention.

143
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:52,000
So anyway, again, not that I think this has anything to do with gaming directly, but the reason why I bring it up is it's just one of those like really like sad after effects of seeing gaming get bigger and bigger and more into the mainstream.

144
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You know, gaming is becoming more mainstream. These on demand, you know, Shane was over here the other day, we were watching like a Heroes of the Storm tournament on the TV, like it was ESPN practically.

145
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Granted, we were using Twitch to do it, but, you know, as TV gets more and more virtual, you know, more and more of this stuff gets mainstream, you know, these big gaming events are big sporting events.

146
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So I guess also the moral of the story, so to speak, you know, these guys were talking about it on Facebook, you know, I would hope that none of you hang out with people that would ever do things like this.

147
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But if you ever see something like this on Facebook or something, like, you need to alert the authorities. And don't fucking joke about this stuff either, because it's no joke.

148
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Not that I think any of you guys would, but I'm just saying, you know, you have to take this kind of crap seriously, because unfortunately, those guys had guns in their car, they were serious.

149
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Anyway, let's try to change the topic. Back to the games that are fun, we like, we enjoy, and not where there's-

150
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Not that violent Pokemon stuff.

151
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah, right? Let's talk about our gaming weeks here real quick. I'll probably have to interrupt us in the middle of this here, because we're gonna have our guests on shortly.

152
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But we always like to start off the show with, how was your gaming week? So I want to talk to Dark Soccer real quick. How was your gaming week, Dark Soccer?

153
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Old. I played some Dragon Age Inquisition, of course, because I always do. I played Final Fantasy XIV, I'm actually getting back into the story, I'm around the 2.2 patch stuff right now.

154
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But I'm playing, I'm playing. And Dan and I busted out the Super Nintendo last night, we busted out the sealed box of games, the ones that we've got in the special plastic, and we are playing through Chrono Trigger.

155
00:18:44,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I, all of my save files were intact, so we new gamed plus that shit, and we are piling through the story. So, since playing since last night, we just got the epic last, uh, today. So, we are on our way.

156
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Nice!

157
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We're at the point where you go back to 12,000 BC and get, uh, Magus. Man, he had such a cool name in Japan, though.

158
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What was that? I forget.

159
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Maul.

160
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, that's right.

161
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Demon King.

162
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Sounds scary.

163
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah.

164
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:40,000
When I saw that box of games, of in their case, or in their box with the instructions and all that, the first thing that I thought was, I used to have nearly all of those, but then that leads me to my second thought, that's easily like $1,500 on eBay.

165
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yes, it is.

166
00:19:42,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The reason why I no longer have those things is because I think I parted with my near mint Chrono Trigger for like $120, $150, and then I was able to sell the official strategy guide, which had a ton of really gorgeous artwork in it from Akira Toriyama, for like another $50 or $60. So, money, money, money. Especially that Ninja Gaiden trilogy you have.

167
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yeah, we, um, the last one of those that went in the condition ours is in.

168
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

169
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Went for about $450.

170
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Wow.

171
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Um, one without the manual or box went for about $200.

172
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yeah. Not that you guys would ever, but as soon as I see all that stuff.

173
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We tried to sell it once.

174
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm just like.

175
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
We tried to sell Ninja Gaiden first. Um, we put a $350 buy it now on it.

176
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah, but if they don't make your limit, then you're not gonna sell it.

177
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We didn't go at the time, but we, we were sort of talking about downsizing the collection a little bit just because, um, it's not that we have less space, but the room is oddly shaped with the windows and closet and everything.

178
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:54,000
So, um, we were talking about that last night, but we're, we're thinking about how we can bring back the vault properly and what we're going to do with it. More news, news later, news later.

179
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Good. I, I need to come over and we're going to stream some games cause you got so many games that I think there's so many people out there that haven't seen a lot of these classic games.

180
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Like, you know, I'm sure everybody knows Chrono Trigger. If you don't, you probably want to look into that.

181
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Uh, but there's, there's a lot of stuff you guys have in the vault.

182
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll try to post some stuff up on my Tumblr in a few.

183
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Awesome. Awesome. All right. Uh, well, um, Alan quickly before we get to our interview here, how was your gaming week?

184
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Good. Um, really quickly, I have a Final Fantasy 14 story on, uh, the show roll for me, so I won't talk about that as much.

185
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Um, I've been doing a lot of PvP in 14 simply because for the end game, uh, story content and rating and stuff, I'm, I've run out of stuff to do, um, without doing the savage heroic hardcore mode, which I have no interest in doing.

186
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Um, I bought Pinball Arcade, uh, two weeks ago on Steam. They had the pro edition for 19 bucks and almost every single table that I would want is in the season one pack.

187
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Um, the Addams Family, which I know you had the guy on, was interviewed on OLR about getting the Addams Family.

188
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That is correct.

189
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's season four. Um, there isn't a lot that interests me in the other seasons.

190
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I almost feel like season one has too many good games in it that they needed to spread out amongst the other ones because I don't really have any incentive to buy it.

191
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So I've played a lot of that, a lot of, um, Twilight Zone. It's amazing how much crap is crammed into that board.

192
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Um, lots of Elvira Scared Stiff, which I played a ton of when I was, uh, 1920 at the Nickel Arcade in Walnut Creek.

193
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Uh, I'm playing Mass Effect trilogy all the way through again, or I plan on it.

194
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The reason why I'm playing it again is because I want to be gay with Kayden in Mass Effect 1 that you can do, but you have to do it one of two ways.

195
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
If you, if you want to do Sheploo, which is the generic Shepard, you can do that from jump.

196
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:57,000
If you want to use a custom Shepard with a custom face and background and name, which I do, you play it all the way through, you set yourself to female, then you beat it.

197
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And then when you do a new game plus, you set yourself back to male and then that screws up the flag enough to where you can be a custom Shepard and romance Kayden as if you were a woman.

198
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But not have Jennifer Hale's voice coming out of a male Shepard's body, which is one of the bugs that can happen if you do it the other way.

199
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
All right. So kind of, kind of some general mods on the game.

200
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah.

201
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Why is it that you, you go back and visit Mass Effect? I mean, why, why this game? Why now?

202
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's...

203
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Is this prepping for Andromeda or...

204
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:35,000
But kind of, I know I have a lot of problems with a lot of the stuff that they did at Inquisition story-wise and how it kind of shed on a lot of the, the first two Dragon Age games.

205
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Bioware's kind of gone downhill in their writing quality, maybe lost up their own butt a little bit.

206
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Ooh.

207
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
But they're still great or whatever. Like, don't send an email.

208
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
They've gone from a 10 to a 9.

209
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yeah.

210
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
In your eyes. Okay.

211
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Mass Effect 1 and 2 is just really fucking good storytelling.

212
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Like, Vermaier, even though you know it's going to happen, is really intense.

213
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And Ilos and the whole spree from Ilos through going back into the Citadel and, spoiler, spoiler, is all really intense.

214
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So it's all really great storytelling that's so good that so long as I shelve it for like maybe a year, I can revisit it again and it's still just as exciting.

215
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's like watching a classic movie.

216
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Yeah.

217
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Except you're the star.

218
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Yes, exactly.

219
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
All right. Anything else for your gaming week before we move on?

220
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Pinball. We played that new You Don't Know Jack game.

221
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Oh, the Quiplash.

222
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Quiplash, which we only had three people and I think it needs at least five to be really good.

223
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It wasn't bad. It was just you only have one person really voting on your stuff when there's only three people.

224
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yeah.

225
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I noticed they really set that game up for streaming though.

226
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
They must have seen how many people were streaming the Jackbox Party Pack and so they really set up Quiplash.

227
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
You can extend the time for answers. It really lends itself well to game streaming.

228
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I liked how the studio saw that that was happening.

229
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Remember, we had them on the show right before Jackbox Party Pack came out.

230
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We had them on the show and they were kind of talking about watching and participating even with some of those streams.

231
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Pretty cool.

232
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, so that's it really.

233
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
All right.

234
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
DungeonBuster in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

235
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I really like the first Mass Effect for the same reasons.

236
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
When I finally made it to Ilos, that was a great moment.

237
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
There you go.

238
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I am going to slightly disagree with some of the shitting on the lore stuff for Dragon Age Inquisition.

239
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If you go back and look at some of the things, I think these were all planned from the beginning.

240
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:39,000
There was a very big, long explanation about how no one writing the actual codex entries within the scope of the universe actually knows what they're talking about.

241
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's all having to do with things getting lost to time, things being a perception, having half of your history wiped out and coming from an oral history.

242
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:00,000
So I think that what we're getting is actual source material as opposed to an interpretation.

243
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Opinions here at OLR.

244
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
We have them and you have them.

245
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And you know what else we have tonight?

246
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
We have some guests that are going to be joining us here live.

247
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And since this is live radio, I'm going to actually call these guys right now.

248
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
We are going to welcome onto our program.

249
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
We actually have a trio of voice actors joining us tonight.

250
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
We have Andrew Jones, Greg Berger, and David Sobolov are going to be joining us here.

251
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We're getting them on the line right now to join us on the program here at Orange Lounge Radio.

252
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
If you guys are listening live, you can head on over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

253
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And if you have any questions for our trio tonight, we'd be happy to get out as many of these questions as we can.

254
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But I think we have everybody connected on the line.

255
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So welcome, guys, to Orange Lounge Radio.

256
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Hello.

257
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Thank you.

258
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Hello.

259
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yo, yo, yo.

260
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
It's like we're doing a live panel tonight.

261
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I know you guys have to do the convention circuit all the time with all the many voices that you guys have provided over the years.

262
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So it's kind of like we're going to do that live here on OLR.

263
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I love that.

264
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
All right. Are you cosplaying?

265
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Am I cosplaying?

266
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Actually, I am wearing my outfit that I wore for like half my Joker costume, like my casual Joker.

267
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Joker for Mass Effect 3, not Joker for Batman.

268
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Oh, cool.

269
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, every time I say Joker, everybody assumes that one.

270
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Seth Green's Joker.

271
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
And I'm signing a photo for you right now.

272
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Awesome.

273
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Yes, autographs.

274
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Can we get a picture, a selfie?

275
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Sure, sure.

276
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
All right, awesome.

277
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Let me go down the line and introduce everybody we have here on our panel tonight.

278
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
First off, Andrew Jones joining us tonight.

279
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
What's up, Andrew?

280
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Nothing much. How are you?

281
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I am great. Tell us a little bit about yourself.

282
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
So I work in casting, directing, and actually it's funny because David and Greg are both my mentors.

283
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I've studied voice acting and acting with both of them.

284
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And I've tried to work a little bit in voice acting.

285
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I worked on a show for Fusion, formerly TV Reguide, called Like, Share, Die.

286
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And I'm doing some stuff for some video games, so it's going to be pretty awesome.

287
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Awesome, awesome.

288
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Also joining us on our panel tonight, David Sobolov is here tonight, everybody.

289
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Welcome, David.

290
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
David, can you hear me okay?

291
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I just got you.

292
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
On the Skype call, sometimes if you get a phone call, it cuts it off and that's what just happened.

293
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Oh, no, you're a popular guy.

294
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
The people are trying to call you right now.

295
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm here, I'm back. David Sobolov, happy.

296
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Well, welcome to the program, David.

297
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I know a lot of gamers probably know you best as, I know, like, Asmodan from Diablo III, Heroes of the Storm.

298
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Huge character.

299
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:43,000
What are some other voices some gamers out there might know?

300
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Let's see, over the years, I'm literally going to scroll down here.

301
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Oh, Army of Two Devils Cartel, if people saw that, I did a performance capture role on that.

302
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It was Tyson Rios.

303
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh, wow.

304
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That was fun.

305
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I worked on Star Trek in Darkness, that was the movie.

306
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
There's a Star Trek video game that I was on as well.

307
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I play a whole bunch of parts.

308
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Dota 2, I was Terrorblade.

309
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Oh, that's a huge game, especially in Russia.

310
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I think Dota 2 is gigantic.

311
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's very, very big in Asia, I've heard.

312
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yes.

313
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's an e-sport.

314
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
It is. It was one of those huge e-sports.

315
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
We were watching Heroes of the Storm.

316
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I think somebody was playing Asmodan even.

317
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Oh, cool.

318
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Yeah, very cool.

319
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
There's a lot more dialogue in that game than he did in Diablo 3.

320
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Really?

321
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I would have thought he had a ton more in Diablo 3. Interesting.

322
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
There's more in Heroes of the Storm, and it's much more comedic, too.

323
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Did you enjoy that, getting to put a more comedic edge on a character?

324
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Oh, I always do, because I don't get to do that very often with my voice.

325
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah?

326
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I always play the deep voice, like serious guys.

327
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Do you find that you get typecast a little bit sometimes, maybe?

328
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Oh, yeah, that's okay.

329
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I used to play 12-year-old girls, but it wasn't really paying the bills, so I went into the deeper voice stuff.

330
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I don't know. I think you'd make an amazing Powerpuff Girl, but I guess they already filled that.

331
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I hope they're listening. I'd love that chance for that role.

332
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Awesome.

333
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Also joining us tonight on our panel, say hello, everybody, to Greg Berger joining us tonight.

334
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
How are you doing, Greg?

335
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Howdy, howdy. Doing well. Thanks for having me.

336
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Thanks for having me. I only go where I'm invited, so thanks for putting out the welcome mat.

337
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You are most welcome. Hey, I know. I love Diablo 3 and Heroes myself, so obviously that was the first thing that came to mind with David.

338
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
And for you, I am a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series.

339
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
So when they told me that Jecht was going to be on the show, I was like, what? That's awesome.

340
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Will somebody have to teach that kid to play Blitzball?

341
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Oh, my gosh, that's amazing. I love it.

342
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:55,000
And then, okay, so then I told my co-host here at Dark Soccer, Jamie, I said, you gotta get familiar with Greg, take a look at the IMDB, take a look at the resume.

343
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I might have squealed.

344
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And she literally squealed. What was the one that you saw that got you to squeal, Jamie?

345
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Grimlock.

346
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Grimlock.

347
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Me munch metal.

348
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I love it.

349
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
You're not playing with your voice.

350
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
You don't know how many copies of Transformers the movie I have, including the Japanese laserdisc.

351
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I've had the great good fortune at convention of being involved in some big screen screenings of the film with popcorn fights in the audience and people screaming and basically knowing the script, you know, by heart.

352
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The Rocky Horror Transformers show.

353
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I just have enjoyed every time I've seen it. One of them was with Flint Dilly, who was the story editor and one of the producers, and he actually had a stop motion option, which allowed him to tell some behind the scenes story as we watched. Phenomenal.

354
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I mean, I remain extremely proud of it. I think it's a great story with lots of twists and turns and a really good movie about robots.

355
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
That's awesome.

356
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I mean, Transformers was pretty much like the first real addiction to any animated series I had. I mean, as a kid, I was a kid in the 80s, and that was like every day for me.

357
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I was introduced at a convention by a guy who said when this show was on in the morning, it's the reason I was late for school every day. When they moved to afternoons, it's the reason I always left before the end of my last period class.

358
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I'm going to ask Dark Soccer to do some breathing techniques and calm down the fandom just a little bit. It's professional here.

359
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:47,000
But I do have to ask this because it is a video game podcast, and we always stay up on the gaming news. Greg, I don't know if you've probably haven't heard of this, but in Splatoon, the Nintendo title, they oftentimes do what they call Splatfest, where it's Team X versus Y.

360
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:54,000
For example, a few weeks ago, they had Team Cat versus Dog. They had, what was it, Team Roller Coaster versus Team Waterslide?

361
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
And there was Marshmallow and Hot Dog.

362
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Yeah, something like that. Well, the upcoming one is actually the first tie-in with another property, and it's Transformers.

363
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Cool.

364
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So it's Team Autobots versus Team Decepticons. Now, I would think the answer to this is probably obvious, but you never know. So I'm going to ask, Greg, which team do you think you would be splatting in Splatoon for? Team Autobots or Team Decepticons?

365
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Well, Long Haul is a Constructicon, so there's that. And he didn't join his outfit to be no dump truck, but he's a worthy adversary. But meet King! So I kind of got a pull for my team.

366
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
All right.

367
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Now, if it's Autobots versus Marshmallows, I think that remains, that's pretty easy.

368
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Well, there it is. It's settled, guys. I think I just ruined Splatfest and had the whole thing tilted in one direction there. All right. There we go.

369
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Oh, I wouldn't have the slightest idea. I'm just speculating.

370
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I think you should have, like, Greg Burger and David Funanabi. David, you were shockwave on Transformers Prime.

371
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yes, I was. I was also depth charge on Beast Wars, so I was on both sides.

372
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Oh, jeez.

373
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Oh, my God.

374
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But he was, you know, depth charge was barely good. Just on the good side, just like 5%.

375
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Love it. Well, again, thank you guys so much for joining us tonight. And if you guys have questions for our trio in the chat room, head on over to live.vognetwork.com.

376
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,000
We have some comments here in chat. Bonds006 says, I'm looking at the IMDB stats. The fandom is high tonight.

377
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Let's see, another comment in chat here. Everyone in the OLR chat room just wetted themselves there at the Grimlock. Awesome.

378
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Well, hey, let me ask this. So you guys are all voice actors, and I'm sure this, you know, kind of brings this first question to mind.

379
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,000
What made you decide this is the life for me? I want to get into voice acting. This is my calling. This is what I want to do.

380
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Andrew, I'll start with you.

381
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
My thing is I've been trying to get more into voice acting. I've done a few things non-union.

382
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It's funny, the more I do that, the more I get pulled into doing, like, casting and voice directing, more so casting than that.

383
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But the reason I particularly liked voice acting or I like it and it's something I want to pursue is I studied theater in Florida and I studied theater out here.

384
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And I just found it more freeing to be able to just get behind a microphone and embody a character.

385
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I feel like it's a little bit, for me, less anxiety or some sort of stress, but it capitalizes on creativity because they don't really care that I'm 5'6".

386
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's like, oh, you're Frodo Baggins. You are not going to play an action hero. And it's like, yeah, yeah, I understand that.

387
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:51,000
You know, so I like the idea that if I can sound like a character, if what I'm saying is believable and what I bring to the table is what they, you know, want, then that's all they care about.

388
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It doesn't matter what I look like. I could show up in, like, feedie pajamas and wear a T-Rex hat and they wouldn't care.

389
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Casual Friday is every day in voice acting, right?

390
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Love it. Greg, what about you? What made you decide that voice acting is for me?

391
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Well, I can abbreviate the story and tell you the emphasis is more on the acting than the voice because when the character is three-dimensional and true, the voice goes wherever the rest of it carries.

392
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I came to Los Angeles as an actor with a show. I actually have always pursued this as supplemental, but I was seen in a show that started in New York and I was in the L.A. company by someone notable who asked to say hello after the show.

393
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:48,000
He said if I was as versatile as what they had seen on stage, they should know about me for animation and without missing a beat, I said you've had my demo for several months now.

394
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,000
If you can move it from the bottom of the pile to the top of the pile, it's exactly what I'd love to be doing.

395
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I've been smitten by it since my, you know, chin was on my fist on Saturday morning watching shows on the floor of the living room.

396
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So I have a great loyalty to all of the greats and when I was seated next to Mel Blanc and in the room with Don Messick and June Ferre still, I'm working with my heroes and they may or may not be well-known names to other people, but to have been allowed in the course of my career to work with most if not all of my heroes is just jaw-dropping for me.

397
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:43,000
And you know what's so funny is like right as you're telling this story, SSG100Matt just posted a question in our chat, who is your idols or inspiration in voice acting and so it's so funny that you said that and then Dark Soccer, you know, June Ferre.

398
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
You named one of mine.

399
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yeah, I mean she's flawless, she's amazing and Mel Blanc's certainly like one of the just originals, so.

400
00:37:51,000 --> 00:38:03,000
We actually, I don't know how many know, but in addition to Grimlock, I'm also Odie, Haridee, Alley Cat, Herman the Mailman and Squeak the Mouse on the Garfield show.

401
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And June Ferre has over the past few seasons been an irregular regular, so she's dropped in with some frequency and you know, just to be able to call her a friend is fantastic for me.

402
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I think we're all excited that we get to call Grimlock a friend now, having been on OLR.

403
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Me no kisser!

404
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Okay, fair enough, fair enough.

405
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
David, how about you? What made you decide voice acting, this is what I want to do?

406
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Well I had studied acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and I was thinking I would be doing theater, I was thinking I would be doing on camera and I did a lot of theater, I did about 30 plays.

407
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And while I was doing the plays, people were saying, I've got this great voice for villains, you should do these villains. And I kind of have a great face for radio, like a thug look to me.

408
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I get the same thing, I get the same thing all the time, I hear you.

409
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah, so the parts I was being offered on camera were just not really that interesting. And it got way more interesting when I got into voice acting, so I stuck with it, they kept encouraging me with a paycheck.

410
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And I also had a lot of fun along the way and it just became something I was trying out and became my life. That was about 20 years ago I started it.

411
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I think you guys are all very fortunate to just be born with that type of voice, you know what I mean?

412
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Because when you guys are talking, I'm like, I would just listen to a podcast with these guys, just talking.

413
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I think we are listening to a podcast with these guys.

414
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
I think we are right now listening to a podcast with us talking.

415
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Rob's going meta tonight.

416
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Sadly, I only get you for 30 minutes, but I'm talking on the regular. Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom over at live.vogue.com says, just erase the rest of the show role and keep them on.

417
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,000
I'll keep them here as long as I can. I will.

418
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Well, here's the deal. A distinctive voice can only help to serve you. However, if your acting chops are honed, and both David and I are teaching for Grey Knight Productions right now,

419
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:14,000
but if your acting chops are honed, you'll come up with something original, unique, and memorable if that's what you're suited for.

420
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:23,000
If I hadn't studied acting, I'd probably have about 5 credits on my IMDB instead of 100, because you have to be able to just go in 50 different directions.

421
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I don't really have the type of voice, the type of comedic training that I think Greg has.

422
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I think a lot of what I'm doing is variations on a theme, but it's really based on telling the story, living truthfully under these crazy given imaginary circumstances we have in animation and video games.

423
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Often they'll throw the character in front of me and I'll make it up on the spot. I'm sure Greg's had to do that at times, too. I don't really have a lot of voices that I pull out of a hat.

424
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
If I may chime in, by the way, I completely agree with my mentors and the people I've studied with, and I completely agree.

425
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:07,000
A lot of the stuff that they talk about actually came into casting for me, because I found that the projects that I've worked on, I've had someone with a voice that I'm like,

426
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I literally push my chair back. That's great, but then I don't believe a darn thing that they're saying.

427
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I've had people that have the everyday approachable average voice, but their performance is so captivating that you feel for them.

428
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
That's what I think it's about, reaching out and finding a way to make your audience care about what you're saying.

429
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So let's talk a little bit more, Andrew, about this Grey Knight productions that you have, because I know you are, since we're talking about having the voice but then learning how to refine the voice,

430
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I know this is a big passion that you guys have, is that you're actually helping people learn how to more refine the voice and how to act and so forth.

431
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So tell us a little bit about this school that you've set up, Andrew.

432
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So I started Grey Knight as a means, because I've taken acting classes all throughout Los Angeles, and there's some predators out there who will take your money and go,

433
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Ha ha ha, you're so good at acting.

434
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Predators? In Hollywood? Get out!

435
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
No, they're all so honest and caring.

436
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:17,000
But no, I started my production company because I'm like, okay, well, I know some of the best people on the planet who do what they do, and I figured those are the best teachers.

437
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Now, granted, just because someone's famous or does this and is in this project doesn't mean that they're qualified to teach.

438
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:33,000
A lot of people that I bring in, I've either studied with or they've gotten ridiculous references, or their background really supports their argument.

439
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But yeah, so the goal is, you know, I work in casting, and I've discovered that a lot of people, especially with my generation, some of them don't have the substance.

440
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:53,000
They go, oh, that looks easy, and, you know, Greg and David can tell you the same thing, where it's like, they go, wow, you know, I do a great Donald Duck impression, or I do this really well.

441
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
And it's like, oh, that's nice. Can you act? And they're like, uh, uh, uh.

442
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So the whole point of Grey Knight was just, it's to basically offer the highest quality classes, you know, in a premier environment.

443
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I mean, like, we're using Formosa Interactive, and they did, like, God of War, and they worked on, like, Last of Us, and they worked on Carlson Riddick, and some of the stuff for Frozen.

444
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So, you know, it's creating the best possible environment with the best teachers, and, you know, trying to make it competitive and fair so it doesn't kill a student's pocket.

445
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I think that's a really good point, too, about the whole I can do an impression versus can you stay in that impression, because I know I can do a mean Miss Piggy.

446
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
It's all about you.

447
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I can do a Miss Piggy.

448
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
You can't do a happy Miss Piggy?

449
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Only a mean one.

450
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You might need to do a happy one sometimes.

451
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I can do a Miss Piggy, but I can't, like, you asked me to act, I would never be able to do it.

452
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,000
So, you know, I think I might need a class or seven to teach me how to get that better.

453
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:00,000
But this is, unfortunately, I know we're a global show, but you're mostly focused in the Los Angeles area, right?

454
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:09,000
For now, actually one of the things I'm trying to figure out or work out, I'm figuring out if I can do a phone patch or if I can do, ISDN is way too expensive.

455
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:24,000
But I'm trying to find a way to actually make it so that people can study if they're in, you know, like freaking New Zealand or Australia or London or whatever, and they can kind of tap in, you know, finding a way to make it so that people around the globe can actually take these classes.

456
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And, you know, I'm currently trying to find a way to kind of just, you know, I guess the best way to put it is put up the resources and the materials so that people who really want to do this, this is a passion for them.

457
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:47,000
They can't live without it, you know, they're doing it because they enjoy it, not for the money, you know, that they have the ability to pursue it.

458
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I don't think anyone's location should really necessarily limit them for their ability to educate themselves for what they want to do in their lives.

459
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Well, excellent. I hope through, you know, web conferencing technologies or things like that, you guys are able to do that.

460
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You know, I know we have the podcasting, but, you know, sometimes, you know, it's kind of difficult to set that up in like a school type format, but I think that would be great because actually Greg and David are two of the teachers, correct?

461
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Yeah, no, they're amazing teachers and yeah, they're the ones who actually kind of justified me doing it.

462
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Greg and David have been the staples for my education in the entertainment industry and really just nailed and drove home the whole acting element and I had brought this idea forward and I'm like,

463
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Hey, Greg, David, I'm going to try to do this thing. Do you want to try to do it? Oh, yeah. Oh, no questions asked. I would love to teach. I would love to be able to do this. This is great. I love, you know, and I'm pretty sure that you guys have been approached by other people before, right?

464
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I mean, it's just it's one of those things that's found on ethics. I like to think they like they're doing it because they like what I'm trying to do.

465
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It definitely seems like the voice acting circle is a very tight knit, like little family I noticed because, you know, I see again, it seems like you guys are going to a lot of the same conventions and so forth.

466
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And, you know, I know our pal Marissa here in Los Angeles was actually the one that got us all introduced. And, you know, she's she's talking about all these wonderful people she's meeting and networking with which shout out to Marissa hearts.

467
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah, Marissa Meisel.

468
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Love that woman.

469
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
She's great.

470
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So let me let me ask a couple more questions about video game voice acting and so forth.

471
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Let me let me ask Greg and David, because you guys have such diverse resumes. You guys have done cartoons, movies, you know, screen capture and so forth.

472
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:56,000
What is what are the challenges that go into video game voice acting specifically as opposed to I'm going to be doing a cartoon or something like that? How are video games different?

473
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Well, in a cartoon, quite often you have the entire cast. So it's like doing a radio play and you can work off of each other.

474
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:12,000
But I think I have about fifty five or sixty video games on my resume and I'm DB and only twice have we ever had more than one cast member in the room.

475
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,000
It's usually me by myself and any other dialogue that's happening. I either have to just have it in my head or the director might say it.

476
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
So it is a lot harder without other actors there.

477
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I would think, too, the whole fact that the dialogue can branch in a video game, whereas, you know, with a cartoon, it's static.

478
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
But, you know, you kind of have to suddenly be like, OK, this is the good answer. This is the bad answer.

479
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You know, I could I could see where that like just is is so easy.

480
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It would it would not make it possible to have everybody in the same room, I would think, in some cases.

481
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Well, I'm sorry. I'm just echoing everything David said up to this point.

482
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And he and I did a game called Halo Wars to get Halo Wars together.

483
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Oh, I think a few people have heard of that one. Halo Wars.

484
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yes, Halo Wars is it's pretty popular. That was one of the notable exceptions.

485
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
That's one of the two. We did it ensemble style.

486
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I'm sure it was inconvenient from a production standpoint.

487
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And part of the reason for that is actually understandable.

488
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:18,000
And that's because there are so many nearly infinite possibilities that the only way to really cover an actor is isolated in the booth.

489
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:27,000
It's much more difficult to cover that ground ensemble, although it's way more fun for actors to play with actors.

490
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:39,000
But the relationship in in games, which David was was pointing at, is is really more between the director and the actor, because you're kind of acting in a vacuum.

491
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:50,000
The director on the other side of the glass has to paint you in and out of scenes and help you find levels that are consistent with other people who may have recorded before you.

492
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
But you don't have the luxury of working directly opposite them.

493
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Quite often they have a writer there as well, because on Guild Wars 2, for instance, I get called in to work on that fairly often.

494
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,000
And they will sometimes have three different studios going with milk crates full of scripts.

495
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
And we all have our own little section that they've they're very organized.

496
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,000
But I've seen in the one studio and imagine this is times three studios, you have three milk crates.

497
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Each milk crate has maybe, I don't know, 4000 pages in it and a quart of milk and a little bit of cream cheese because it's delicious.

498
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:36,000
A little voice acting schmear. But no, they they'll take out the binder and take out your section and off you go.

499
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And if there's one hundred and eighty thousand lines in a game, there's no way the director is going to have read all that.

500
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So they often will have a producer and they'll have the writer there to help them.

501
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Wow. I can I can only imagine like, well, and that's got to be like so much.

502
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And this this leads into a great question from our chat room over at live.vognetware.com from SSJ100Matt saying that the various voice acting con panels he's gone to, he's heard it put stress on your voice after long sessions.

503
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:11,000
How long normally does it take for your voice to recover after a recording session or an entire voice acting project?

504
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Let me ask Greg something here. Does your agent generally limit you to two hours of screaming or do you sometimes get the four hours of screaming from video games?

505
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
The effort is always to confine the I mean, if it's a war game or if it's a extreme stress.

506
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:39,000
First, I believe they have to include that language so that there's an option of whether or not you're strong enough, vocally strong enough to withstand that kind of stress.

507
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Because when you say yes to an engagement, you better bring one hundred and fifty percent of your abilities with you.

508
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
That's no time to find out that you've overreached your grasp.

509
00:50:50,000 --> 00:51:06,000
But yes, efforts are made on on behalf of clients to confine those high, high intensity and stress sections of a game to a two hour period rather than a full four hour session.

510
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Although if you're doing, it's not a video game, but if you're doing a feature film, the language is a bit different in that contract.

511
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I've been in situations where I was in a group situation with say about ten voices and we'd be there seven, eight hours.

512
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
And it sounds like, oh, well, hey, I work forty hours a week. What's the big deal?

513
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:37,000
You know, everyone out there saying that. But when you're screaming at the top of your lungs for four hours, that's pretty much all they're going to get.

514
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,000
You're not going to be able to do it. You asked about recovery. Oftentimes I'll take a day off.

515
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I will schedule, if I can, the video games on the times of the week when I know I have an extra day afterwards before I have to do anything else.

516
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And there is no single answer to recovery time because it differs by different talents.

517
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:03,000
But it also there's no way of knowing how consistently torturous a session is going to be.

518
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,000
But as a rule, most of them, especially if they're combat oriented, are going to be stressful.

519
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Now, we don't get the scripts in advance for video games. For the most part, we're just walking in cold and we might have six hundred lines.

520
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:23,000
That's a long session. But say we have four hundred lines to do in four hours and we will have never seen that before.

521
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So there's, I think, an additional vocal stress in just having to come up with characterizations in the moment.

522
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Sometimes you've done them before, but oftentimes you haven't.

523
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You can do up to three voices in a session and sometimes they have you do more and pay you a bit more.

524
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
You know, I bet these are things that most gamers never even think about when they're playing the game.

525
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Is that, you know, there's all that energy that goes into all those screams and everything else that you're doing in the game.

526
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
And the fact that because there is such an air of secrecy around video games,

527
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,000
like I'm sure you guys have plenty more projects in the works you can't talk about because there's all that secrecy that goes into it.

528
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And so you have to go into it cold because, heaven forbid, the script for something like Mass Effect Andromeda or Halo 5 or something leaks.

529
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
You know, it's going to be huge. Jamie, you want to jump in here with something?

530
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I was just thinking that it would probably require the same sort of control like with modulation that goes into singing,

531
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:22,000
especially diaphragm control, controlling your breath, keeping your voice at a particular level.

532
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And I've had a friend of mine who halfway through her master's program as an opera singer had to have vocal surgery for overtaxing yourself.

533
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Not pretty.

534
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Yeah. And so you guys...

535
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
That's like a football player getting a leg injury.

536
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Or if you want to look at more pop culture, Chris Cornell, when he had three surgeries on his mostly singer of Soundgarden.

537
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,000
And his voice has never been the same ever since. So, I mean, you guys totally get props from me.

538
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Well, like any other artist, you want to acquire whatever mastery you can over whatever instrument it is you're playing, even if it's your own voice.

539
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:07,000
But speaking for myself, I believe that in these sessions, by bringing your A-game every time, by not holding back,

540
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
you don't go out of your way to damage yourself, obviously.

541
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:19,000
But holding back can make every session take twice as long because it's not translating as true.

542
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
If you hold back, it sounds held back.

543
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So there's just a sweet spot, just like a tennis racket, that you look for that strength for yourself.

544
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,000
It's something you learn just through repetition and skill building.

545
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:45,000
And if you're skilled enough and they trust you and you're screaming like crazy, they will sometimes allow you to just do one take and they'll take it.

546
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And you're able to come up with a good enough performance that you don't ruin your voice by having to do three or four takes of every line.

547
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
That's pretty awesome.

548
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Wow. This has been so informative. And I'm sad that our time is running out tonight.

549
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:10,000
But if our listeners want to keep in touch with you guys, I want to make sure you guys have a chance to amply plug your Twitter and your websites and what have you so that folks can follow you.

550
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
So let me just go down the line here.

551
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
David, do you have a place that people can follow you and find out more information and hear more from you later?

552
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:25,000
I'm at Twitter, at Volo Boss. It's my last name backwards. V-O-L-O-B-O-S. And that's kind of my only social media right now.

553
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,000
There's a lot of them. Sometimes you have to focus on one or two.

554
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Yeah, that's what I'm doing right now.

555
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
There's too many. I understand. Greg, how about you?

556
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Best is Facebook slash my name G-R-E-G-G-B-E-R-G-E-R at Greg Burger on Twitter and coming soon to a, I don't know, Pinkberry near you. I don't know.

557
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Ooh, that's our favorite.

558
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Pinkberry.

559
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I think we're on the first name basis of the Pinkberry Twitter.

560
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:08,000
No, but hopefully coming soon to a convention near you. And I really love the convention vibe. I love the opportunity to say thank you to the people who are kind enough to come and say thank you to us.

561
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Albeit WasabiCon in Florida, October 31st and November 1st.

562
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Greg, any upcoming appearances for you convention-wise?

563
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:36,000
TFCon, Charlotte, October 16th through 18th. There's some other things in the pipeline, but boy that NDA, those are the three letters we live with daily. And it's all, things are not disclosed until it's time to disclose them.

564
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Well, when they are disclosed after E3 or Game Awards or whatever, they're going to announce it out. We'll have to have you guys back to talk about it.

565
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Andrew, I want to make sure you can plug your website as well. And please, one more time, the acting classes.

566
00:56:51,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Oh yeah, so my website is greenightproductions.com and you can follow me on Twitter and talk to me. I'm pretty responsive to people.

567
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:10,000
At AJjones828. But yeah, the classes, I'm trying to actually schedule a four-week class with David and Greg in the next couple of months.

568
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So, I mean, I always put stuff up. So yeah, just let me know. Message me if you have a question. And that's another thing too. I feel a lot of people are very, that would be my phone freaking out.

569
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Sorry you guys are fast at following on Twitter.

570
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Oh my god, that was me following you on Twitter that said off your phone? Wow. That's amazing.

571
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:43,000
My phone is amazing. No, it's, you know, I feel a lot of people get a little bit wow or a little bit shy about stuff because they think, oh, it's, you know, it's Greg Burger and David Sobolov.

572
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:50,000
And it's like, no, I mean, they're amazing teachers and, you know, I'm open to questions and so are they.

573
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Oh, I am announced at a G.I. Joe, original G.I. Joe panel at Long Beach Comic Con September 12th, I believe.

574
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Another favorite. I know we could just, we could just spend hours and hours talking to these guys about all these various roles and impacts they've had on our favorite games and cartoons from way back.

575
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
But I got it. They got it. They got a busy night ahead. I got to let them go. Thank you so much for taking the time out to be on our show tonight. I really appreciate it, you guys.

576
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,000
And best of luck with not only the classes, but all your future projects that you can't talk about yet.

577
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Thank you. Thank you for having us.

578
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You are most welcome, guys. Take care.

579
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Take care.

580
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
All right.

581
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Cheers. Bye.

582
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Good one. That was Andrew Jones, Greg Burger, David Sobolov. Some fantastic voice acting talent there on the program.

583
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Dark Soccer, you were covering OK from fangirling over there? No, that was awesome. That was awesome.

584
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I have happiness.

585
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:57,000
I wish, you know, sadly, I was not born with the deep voice that those guys like David has.

586
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:04,000
But, you know, it is what it is. And I think those guys are extremely talented at what they do.

587
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,000
And that was great to hear even those little little excerpts of some of their characters here. Alan, what do you think of all that?

588
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
It was great.

589
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yeah, we get some great guests here on Orange Lounge Radio. We're so happy. So happy.

590
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Hey, if you want to, if you think you have an idea for a guest here for Orange Lounge Radio.

591
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Because like I said, Marissa got us and hooked us up and got us in touch.

592
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Please feel free to reach out to me anytime. robatvognetwork.com

593
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
If you want to get in touch and get somebody booked here on the show.

594
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
ActDeftInChat saying, it's always great to hear voice actors. I agree.

595
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
SG100Matt says, everyone follow him, break his phone. Good plan. Good plan.

596
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:51,000
And Bobby Black Wolf saying VOG has the best interviews. You know, we're pretty, I try to be humble, but we're pretty darn good.

597
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
You should have asked me for some interview questions because I had some stuff I could ask them.

598
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Oh no, I didn't know you were, you should have thrown something at me.

599
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,000
No, I wasn't waving at you. You had it all planned out.

600
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Actually, I improved most of that. With the help of the chatters.

601
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Rob reached into his underwear and pulled out. No.

602
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,000
But I only had 30 minutes, so I had to make the best of the time I had.

603
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
What would you have asked out of curiosity?

604
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:20,000
If anything jumped out at them where a video game script, especially for the Final Fantasy ones,

605
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
where the word salad was so bad that they had no problem saying it,

606
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,000
but they had to turn to the producer and be like, life ether, what the fuck am I saying?

607
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Because I know that's come up.

608
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:37,000
If any of them are still listening, tweet me the answer at OLR, let me know.

609
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,000
What do you do about that word salad? That's right.

610
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Some video games that have some weird-

611
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
LeCie, Falsie, Seif, like 13 is awful with that stuff.

612
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:52,000
I just totally want to like find a way to contact Gideon Emery and ask him,

613
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
okay, do you just crack up every time you say anything as Urianger in 13?

614
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Oh yeah.

615
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
And I love him because he's like all of my favorite BioWare people, practically.

616
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,000
But I have to fast forward every time because I can't get over the really bad language.

617
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,000
Well, that's just how-

618
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
That's how the character's written.

619
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:23,000
It's how it's written, but he has to read those pretentious, overly, anon, forthwith, thou, hence-

620
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And on top of that, it's grammatically incorrect.

621
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Yeah, it's butchered.

622
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It's very, oh my god. So anyway, but as like I was saying though, I was a music major for a short while,

623
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:41,000
which is how I met my poor friend who ended up getting vocal surgery halfway through her masters.

624
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And I have nothing but mad respect for people who use their voice as their instrument.

625
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I mean, your body using that as an instrument for what you do.

626
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,000
I've pulled my diaphragm before playing the bass when I played Contralto Clarinet.

627
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Any abuse that you put your body through and still get up the next day and do it, mad respect.

628
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I think there's always a part of me that thinks, Rob, you really should have done a cartoon character.

629
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
You really should have gotten into some of that stuff.

630
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And I think there's still a part of me to this day that says that, but I really like doing this radio stuff too.

631
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
It's an awful lot of fun doing the podcasting.

632
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I was surprised that one of them had said that for the cartoons, they get to do the ensemble recordings

633
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:34,000
because when Ayesha Tyler had Adam Reed on talking about Archer on her podcast,

634
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
that show is exclusively separate, each person.

635
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
That is all spliced together using software and basically the direction that they get.

636
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
It might just depend on who.

637
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Because Ayesha Tyler and H. John Benjamin have a million gigs going on at once.

638
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
That might be part of it too.

639
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So I think that show in particular is probably maybe a bad example.

640
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
But yeah, I believe that show is almost entirely done piecemeal.

641
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Yeah, and Marissa is saving the day.

642
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
You're asking all these voice acting questions.

643
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Marissa is saving the day in our chat room over at live.vogue.com.

644
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Marissa is saying studios collect clips of when actors lose it.

645
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
That's because that cast has so many working actors.

646
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Yeah, that is probably a really bad example.

647
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
All right, well, again, we want to thank Andrew, David, and Greg for joining us tonight.

648
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
That was a great interview.

649
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,000
And the cool thing is, thanks to kind of getting in with those guys and so forth,

650
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
I'm getting connected with more and more voice actors.

651
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
So look forward to bringing some more on Orange Launch Radio in the coming months.

652
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I'm hoping to meet up with one at Dragon Con.

653
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
You know, I have like, as far as anything that goes into the production of video games,

654
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
and I'm just going to actually single it back to video games.

655
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
My heart, I think, and I appreciate the things that everyone does,

656
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:58,000
but my heart goes to concept art, manual production, and voice actors,

657
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
and manual production is dying.

658
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
All right, well, let's move on.

659
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
We're still at 7.09.

660
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
We're now we're into the show, and we still haven't even touched a news story yet,

661
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
but you know what, well worth it for that interview, well worth it.

662
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I just want to quickly get into my gaming week because I had to take a quick detour.

663
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
So I've played a lot of the similar stuff that I've talked about in previous weeks.

664
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Still trying to make progress on Gauntlet on the PlayStation 4,

665
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
which I've surpassed what I did on the PC and gotten a little further.

666
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
So that was pretty cool.

667
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I also was playing a little more of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture,

668
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
which I talked about in more detail last week, so I'll kind of leave my review there.

669
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
But I was chasing some trophies in the game last week.

670
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Just a couple quick new games I want to mention.

671
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
On the PlayStation 4, well, this is an old game in new clothing,

672
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
but they actually have this growing library of what they call arcade archives

673
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
available on the PlayStation 4.

674
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I believe the price to be a little pricey.

675
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
They won $8 a game, and they have things in the collection like Gradius,

676
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
but the one I decided to finally pick up this week was Bomb Jack,

677
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
which had just come out just in this past week, I believe.

678
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And Bomb Jack was a game that I remember from the Commodore 64,

679
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
and I believe there was a version of it on the NES as well.

680
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I think Mighty Bomb Jack was on the NES.

681
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
So I have fond memories of the game, so I decided,

682
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
what the hell, I'm going to pick up the game.

683
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And, you know, it's an 80s arcade game being emulated on the PlayStation 4.

684
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Pretty hard to mess that up.

685
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
But one of the things I like is that they have a lot of options,

686
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
so you can do all these different ratios in the game.

687
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
You can flip the screen 90 degrees.

688
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
So, you know, for emulation of an 80s arcade game,

689
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
you know, because not every, you know,

690
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
when you go to like Virtual Console on NES,

691
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
you don't always see all these options available.

692
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
What did I say on the NES?

693
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
When you're doing NES Virtual Console on the Wii U,

694
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
you don't always see all these options.

695
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
So it was pretty neat to have all that.

696
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,000
But one thing that cracked me up about Bomb Jack was that the trophies are a joke.

697
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I got every trophy, I think there's like five bronze and two gold,

698
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
in ten minutes in that game without even trying.

699
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Because the trophies are things like...

700
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
You started a game, you scored a point.

701
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
You access the options menu, submit your high score online.

702
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Like seriously, you read the manual.

703
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Like, the trophies are a joke.

704
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
But I'm pretty sure that's because the easiest way for them to do the trophies

705
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
was to program them all into the shell, the emulator shell.

706
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And so therefore, none of the trophies have anything to do with the game itself.

707
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Like the score you get in the game.

708
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:35,000
But yet, the shell knows enough to extract your high score from the game

709
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
and put it on an online leaderboard.

710
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
So you would think there would be some trophies that are like,

711
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
get a hundred thousand points, get five hundred thousand points.

712
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,000
You know, things like that.

713
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
So I was a little surprised at that.

714
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,000
So that would be my only little complaint.

715
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I mean, the trophies are a real gimme.

716
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And that's kind of a minor.

717
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Because, you know, who really cares?

718
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
There's not a lot of people that super care about trophies.

719
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Some do, don't get me wrong.

720
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
If you're a trophy whore, these are the easiest trophies you'll ever get

721
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
in these arcade collections.

722
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
But if you're not, you're probably going to laugh at how easy most of them unlock.

723
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Just go into every menu option you have and you'll get, like, all these trophies.

724
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
It's pretty funny.

725
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So that is Bomb Jack.

726
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
And then otherwise, I want to talk about one other quick game.

727
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
This is actually a game that is on the phone.

728
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
And I don't talk about a lot of phone-based games.

729
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
But it's a brand new one that came out this week.

730
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
It's called Pac-Man 256.

731
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Pac-Man 256 is, of course, a Pac-Man game.

732
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I think we've talked about it previously on the show.

733
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
It was one that was in development.

734
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
They've taken the concept of an endless runner,

735
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
like Temple Run, Jetpack Joyride, those sorts of games,

736
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
and applied it to Pac-Man.

737
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
And they call it Pac-Man 256 because,

738
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
you remember how on the 256 board on Pac-Man,

739
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
half of it glitches out and it renders the game unplayable, right?

740
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It's the kill screen version.

741
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Yes, exactly.

742
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
So what they do, instead of it being a left and right thing,

743
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
they have a glitch at the bottom when you play Pac-Man 256,

744
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,000
and the glitching slowly moves up the screen.

745
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,000
And the maze is an endless maze vertically.

746
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So you're basically forever chomping away vertically

747
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
to try and escape the glitching that's happening at the bottom of the screen.

748
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
And they put a bunch of other twists on it too.

749
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
For example, you have these little power-ups,

750
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
like lasers and bombs and things like that,

751
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
that'll help you in taking out the ghosts.

752
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
But that's where the free-to-play mechanic comes in as well,

753
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
is that you use coins to get these power-ups,

754
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
and you can collect them slowly, or...

755
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Pay $3.99.

756
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Exactly.

757
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Or watch a movie, watch a 30-second ad to get some.

758
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
But you know what, all things considered for a free-to-play game,

759
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
it's pretty well constructed.

760
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
So I've got to say, I've played some pretty shitty free-to-play games.

761
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I'm always going to say that Act of Time battle, or whatever the square one was.

762
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
The Soul Calibur one.

763
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Oh god, the Soul Calibur game.

764
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I'm like, oh, I blocked that from my memory.

765
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Why are you doing that to me?

766
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
So as far as free-to-play games go...

767
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
I could bring up something worse.

768
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I like Pac-Man 256. What?

769
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Yaris.

770
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Repressed memory. Why did you do that?

771
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
So anyway, Pac-Man 256, you know, it's free.

772
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
And I think it's a cool little game on the phone.

773
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I would check that out if you haven't seen that yet.

774
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
So there you go.

775
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Alright, that is it for our gaming weeks.

776
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I'm reading our chat room.

777
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Bonds006 in chat says,

778
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I love when I get lazy trophies.

779
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
You found ammo, food, new player.

780
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Yeah, it's even easier than that.

781
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And we do have a link, by the way, to greynightproductions.com in our chat room.

782
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Oh, I noticed that it looks like Andrew actually joined us there in chat.

783
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Hello!

784
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Welcome to the chat room.

785
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
If you guys want to keep asking some questions,

786
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,000
maybe he'll be good enough to answer there in the chat room.

787
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Before we get into gaming news, some real quick housekeeping.

788
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Of course, follow us on Twitter at OLR.

789
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,000
We're also on Facebook.

790
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

791
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
As far as upcoming shows go, we will not be here in two weeks.

792
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
There will be no show in two weeks,

793
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
because I will be at Dragon Con in Atlanta.

794
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It's also Labor Day weekend,

795
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
so many of you guys here in the States are off on travel and so forth.

796
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Those around the world who don't have Labor Day, sorry,

797
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
but it's a week when a lot of people are going to be away

798
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
if your favorite show tapes on the weekend.

799
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I will be in Atlanta at Dragon Con,

800
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Bobby Blackwell and I participating in a couple of panels.

801
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Actually, the Dragon Con app is out and now updated,

802
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
so if you are attending Dragon Con,

803
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
you should check out the Dragon Con app,

804
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:41,000
and you're going to want to mark the podcasting past, present,

805
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
and future panel is the one that I will be attending,

806
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
and that is on, I believe, Sunday at 1 p.m.

807
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,000
That's going to be fun to chat on, because we've been doing OLR for,

808
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I lost count, 13 years, right?

809
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
We've been doing Orange Lounge Radio for 13 years,

810
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:03,000
so I think I'm there to talk about the past before it was in iTunes and so forth.

811
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Bobby is going to be doing a panel, I believe it's about community.

812
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Podcasting community, you can check that out Monday at 10 a.m.

813
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I was trying to pull up my own schedule, but it's updating right now on my phone.

814
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And I must say, I actually am not going to be on the show next Sunday.

815
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
You're not?

816
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Because you know who I'm going to get to meet.

817
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
How dare you?

818
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Oh, is that next week?

819
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
That's next week.

820
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Who are you meeting next week?

821
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Weird Al.

822
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
You should get a bumper.

823
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,000
I wish.

824
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
We've got backstage passes and meet and greet tickets to see Weird Al.

825
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
This is the day before my 10-year wedding anniversary.

826
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Ah.

827
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
So, screw you guys, I'm going to see Weird Al.

828
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
That's fair, I understand.

829
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
You know, we sponsored a convention in Atlanta,

830
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:52,000
and Bobby actually left said convention that we paid money to be at

831
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
to go see a Weird Al concert.

832
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:00,000
So, this is not the first time that Weird Al has completely interrupted something.

833
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Bobby is a wise, wise man.

834
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:07,000
And I just interrupted you in something related to Weird Al.

835
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
And now you're going to drink from the fire hose.

836
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
That wasn't Weird Al that said that, though.

837
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
What's his face that was...

838
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Seinfeld.

839
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Yeah, that show I don't watch.

840
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
The guy that then went, kind of bonkers.

841
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Wheel of Fish.

842
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
All right, let's get into it.

843
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
We could talk about Weird Al all night, but we're not.

844
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
It's not a Weird Al podcast.

845
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,000
It's a gaming podcast.

846
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
So, let's get into some gamer news.

847
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Alan, start us off, please.

848
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Nintendo is dropping the price of the 2DS starting August 30th.

849
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
It's going from, I believe, $129.99 down to $99.99.

850
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
So, $100 will get you a 2DS.

851
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And they are now...

852
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:56,000
The core 2DS package will come with a download code for Mario Kart 7.

853
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
So, that is just standard now.

854
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Some caveats about the 2DS.

855
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
The screen size is not as big as a standard XL 3DS.

856
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:12,000
The slider and ability to view the 3DS with the two screens that overlay is removed entirely.

857
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Because it's technically meant for little kids.

858
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
And that's obviously why it's called the 2DS.

859
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
So, the 3D ability has been removed.

860
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
I know adults that use it, too.

861
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Yeah, a lot of people that originally liked the 3DS play with it off.

862
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Just because I think for some games, like I think Pokémon X and Y,

863
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
the battles have a slightly higher frame rate if you just turn it off entirely.

864
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
And I think a lot of other games are like that.

865
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
A lot of Pokémon don't even do the 3D.

866
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I get motion sick from the 3D.

867
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:44,000
And honestly, like in Final Fantasy Theatrhythm, the 3D is distracting.

868
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I have to turn it off.

869
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Yeah, so if you're like, eh, it was nice, but I don't need it, then that's for you.

870
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Also, again, if a game requires the new 3DS, because certain games require

871
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,000
whatever new chipset is in the new 3DS, you cannot play that on a 2DS.

872
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Because it's a 2DS and not a new 3DS.

873
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:12,000
So, yeah, that's yay for affordable consoles.

874
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
3DS is still, you know, the DS platform is still dominating the portable market.

875
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I'm going to be a little bit tinfoil-hatish here, and I apologize,

876
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
but do you think they could be dropping the price because they're trying to offload these

877
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
because there could be a successor on the way relatively soon?

878
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Well, whenever I do the gaming predictions for the new year,

879
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,000
I always say Nintendo is going to come out with yet another SKU for the DS.

880
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:45,000
So there's going to be the 2DS plus Omega they have to clear shelf space for.

881
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I don't know.

882
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Alright. Well, also in Nintendo's camp this week, a lot of people talking about

883
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
a patent application that has been, you know, we get a lot of gaming secrets

884
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
out of patent applications, but sometimes it doesn't mean anything.

885
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Sometimes companies file these patents that maybe they're thinking about doing something

886
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
and they don't end up doing it, or they just want to have those legal protections

887
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
or what have you. So this week, a lot of people with raised eyebrows at the fact

888
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:16,000
that Nintendo has filed a patent for a stationary game console without an optical disk drive.

889
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Here's an excerpt from this patent.

890
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
An example system includes an internal hard disk drive storing a program and or data,

891
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
a communication unit transmitting or receiving a program and or data via a network,

892
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:33,000
and a processor executing a program stored in the hard disk drive to perform game processing.

893
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:39,000
The example system is not provided with an optical disk drive for reading out a program

894
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
and or data from an optical disk.

895
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:50,000
So this has a lot of people jumping to conclusions that possibly Nintendo's next console

896
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
may not have a disk drive.

897
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Now you may remember, Microsoft got in a lot of poopy water when they announced that

898
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Xbox One was going to have all these locks on it and it was essentially going to be digital only.

899
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
You remember the whole thing about DRM and so forth.

900
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Well, if you're not going to have a disk drive on a console, one would assume this means

901
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
that they're going to a digital only type of system.

902
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Well now granted, it would be the only digital only system to have ever existed.

903
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I believe that Ouya was a digital only system.

904
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Correct? Maybe you could put a USB thing in there and read it that way,

905
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
but there was no disks in the traditional sense.

906
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:39,000
The Ouya was also only $99 and has recently been sold, as we talked about a couple weeks ago.

907
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:46,000
I'm not sure how gamers would react to a Nintendo console with no disk drive.

908
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I think again, there is a certain type of equity that comes in with having a large gaming library

909
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
because you can sell those games back and so forth.

910
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
But if Nintendo is about to unveil their new console and say,

911
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
well, there's not going to be any disks, so you're not going to be able to buy, sell, trade and all that stuff,

912
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
but all our games are now only going to be 20 bucks.

913
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Well, that might be, that might, I don't know, I doubt they'd go that low,

914
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
but even if they were to say 30 bucks, I don't know, that might make some people think twice.

915
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Again, we're hugely jumping to conclusions with this.

916
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:28,000
We can't assume anything is going to happen until we hear it from Nintendo themselves,

917
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
but a lot of people speculating what could be happening with this whole NX thing.

918
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
SSG100Matt in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying,

919
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,000
I would be worried about this. This is a huge step in the technical direction,

920
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,000
and if Nintendo doesn't pull it off right, then it won't go well for them.

921
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Bonds006 says, I think Nintendo can go diskless and get away with it.

922
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:57,000
I kind of think they can too, because Nintendo also has a very rabid fan base,

923
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:03,000
where Microsoft, they have a fan base too, but they have just as many detractors as they do fans.

924
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I'm not sure Nintendo has that same ratio, honestly.

925
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I mean, there's always going to be Nintendo detractors.

926
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
There's always going to be haters. You're always going to have a hater somewhere,

927
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
but I just think the ratio is, is different.

928
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
DarkSaga?

929
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I'm just going back to the no disk thought.

930
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Nintendo has always been one for wanting to control, though, their format.

931
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:28,000
You know, hence, they had the, they stuck cartridge for so long,

932
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:34,000
and then moved on to their own proprietary disk format,

933
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:43,000
and I think, honestly, going digital is the best way to control their, I mean,

934
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:47,000
then again, I think the other part was it too, is that people would have to pay them for the,

935
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
the media as well, because it was their proprietary,

936
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,000
but still, it just reeks back to having that controllable aspect of it, you know.

937
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Well, you know, not everybody sees this as such a bad thing.

938
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Grayknight is in our chat room and says, I'd love to have no more disks.

939
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
GameStop needs to go away.

940
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Brad from PodCulture responds directly to that comment saying,

941
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
only problem, disk space and bandwidth. Games are so huge these days.

942
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Well, you know, I think the bandwidth problem, by the time Nintendo puts out their next console,

943
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
which, you know, even a year from now, I think a lot of that is going to resolve itself out.

944
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
I'm not as worried about that, but then I also think about, well,

945
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,000
DarkStalker just started opening the show talking about the vault and her collection,

946
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
and to hear that those tangible things might be going away is kind of, it's sad in a way.

947
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I don't have the same attachment I do to media today as I do for the older media.

948
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I mean, yeah, it's one thing to bust out the Super Nintendo and plug in Chrono Trigger,

949
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:52,000
and go, Chrono Trigger, and then look at my copy of Chrono Trigger on disk and go,

950
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
do I want to play this one? No, I'd rather play the cartridge.

951
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,000
You know, it's the same thing. I don't mind digital content.

952
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:07,000
I mean, every last game I've bought now in the last, actually, I take that back.

953
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
We've bought two games that were on disk, and they were when we got our PS4.

954
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:18,000
We got Batman, which came with it, and we got Puyo Puyo Tetris.

955
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Dungeon Buster in our chat, one more comment here, says,

956
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Arguably, though, we've slowly been moving in that direction with more and more games being available for direct download.

957
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
So if Nintendo's leaping to conclusions with their new console, that's a big bet.

958
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Well, you know, and to be fair to the prior comment from Grey Knight, too,

959
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
is that, you know, if you look at, like, phones, iPhones or Android,

960
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
you don't put in cartridges in those things right now. It's all digital.

961
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
That's the digital world we live in.

962
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:48,000
But it's also, you pay 99 cents, or free, or, you know, you know what I mean?

963
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Like, it's a lot less, there's very, very few games that can get away with charging $15

964
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
as an iPhone or Android download, and the only ones that can are usually what?

965
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Square Enix games. That's about it. They actually get away with doing that. Anyway.

966
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Well, there's something else, actually, that occurred to me.

967
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:15,000
In our big, you know, relocation of the vault back to the house, we found our boxes of laser discs.

968
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:23,000
And Dan and I were having a conversation about, I wonder how many of our discs have succumbed to disc ride.

969
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Ooh.

970
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:32,000
And I haven't, I know that video CDs can also have that layer separation.

971
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Mm-hmm.

972
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:42,000
And be subjected to the same thing. But I'm wondering, though, for CD, DVD, Blu-ray media,

973
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:48,000
if they have the same susceptibility to layer separation, disc rot.

974
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I mean, disc rot is really just another term for the layer separation on the discs.

975
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:59,000
But they don't have the sustainability, I think, that our old cartridge-based media does.

976
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:05,000
So, and this is actually more in a response to Bobby saying,

977
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,000
in 30 years, people our age will wax politically about their old Halo discs.

978
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Their old Halo discs may not even be functional, if you consider that aspect of it.

979
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:20,000
And I will scream fury if our Tron box set is no longer playable.

980
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I will cry bitter, bitter, bitter, slightly manly tears.

981
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Tears, tears don't have a gender.

982
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:38,000
They will be angry. They will be, my tears, if my tears had a voice, it would be Lewis Black.

983
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
I'll put it that way.

984
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
All right, fair enough. We could talk about this subject for a very long time.

985
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
It's just, it's one of those great games.

986
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Halo will never be classic game of the week.

987
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
It's one of the, and you'll have to wait for a week, she's not here.

988
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:55,000
It'll be one of those great debates that goes on for a very long time.

989
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:01,000
But, you know, to humor Bobby's comment there, in 30 years, when we're still doing OLR,

990
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:05,000
we might be looking back on, wow, has the industry changed?

991
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Remember when he had a big box of video discs and laser discs and so forth?

992
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Anyway, to be continued, if Nintendo decides to go in that direction, we will see.

993
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
In the meantime, we've got more gaming news to cover,

994
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
so let's go to Dark Soccer for our next story.

995
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Well, in other news, and let me get off of the list of every voice actor I'm in love with right now,

996
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:32,000
there actually was a hearing on the 21st, which was two days ago,

997
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,000
so I haven't seen anything about the outcome of this,

998
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:41,000
but the California Assembly Committee on Arts, Entertainment, Sports Tourism, and Internet Media,

999
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I wonder if that actually has a decent acronym,

1000
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:55,000
had a hearing, an info hearing, called California's Video Game Industry Staying on Top of the Changing Game,

1001
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
to where they're basically looking at seeing what the industry looks like now,

1002
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:07,000
and how California can stay a leader in the video game industry.

1003
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:16,000
So, they were supposed to go over all kinds of different contributions of computer and video gaming,

1004
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:23,000
of the role in colleges and universities for training, the development talent,

1005
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
different opportunities for strengthening California's position in the industry,

1006
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:33,000
as in money, money, money, and the future of video games,

1007
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
as how it applies to education, research, and workforce development.

1008
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:45,000
It's organized by the 57th District Assembly member, Ian Calderon,

1009
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
and supposed to have just all kinds of people there.

1010
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:56,000
There's a few folks from EA, there's folks from the Entertainment Software Association,

1011
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,000
and a bunch of other folks.

1012
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I don't know what the result is, if they're going to publish anything,

1013
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
but hopefully we'll see something published before too long.

1014
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:12,000
So, I'm glad that they had some people in the industry there,

1015
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:22,000
but I think if you want a real grasp on, I guess this really was more about the business aspect of it,

1016
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:31,000
but I would have liked to have a little bit more about the social aspects of it,

1017
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:37,000
about how this is affecting social media.

1018
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Well, this is me coming from the sociology background.

1019
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:50,000
I would love to see a little bit more about how it encourages education amongst the players,

1020
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:57,000
increases the more social aspects, and I want to see more in-person social events,

1021
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:04,000
and not just contributing to the deterioration of in-person social interaction.

1022
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Things like that.

1023
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,000
But I can see California, we need money, and this is money.

1024
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,000
All right. Well, thank you.

1025
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Again, you're bringing up things that will be different.

1026
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
It's so interesting to hear about these things that we research now,

1027
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
but it's all going to change in ten years anyway.

1028
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,000
All right. Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates

1029
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
and some video games that are coming soon to a store near you.

1030
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:36,000
With Loki not here this week, I'm going to go ahead and just jump in here with the US release dates.

1031
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,000
So, all the releases this week seem to, well, most of the physical ones anyway, all on the 25th.

1032
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,000
So, on the 25th, you have to look forward to Amnesia Memories on the PlayStation Vita.

1033
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
There's Honored Definitive Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1034
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Gears of War Ultimate Edition arrives on the Xbox One.

1035
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I Am Bread on the PlayStation 4, and it's Madden week.

1036
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Madden 16 is out on PlayStation 3 and 4, and Xbox 360 and the One.

1037
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
The Mega Man Legacy Collection is out this week.

1038
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I know a lot of you are looking forward to that.

1039
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,000
You can get that on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1040
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Nova 1-11 on PlayStation 3, 4, Vita, and PC.

1041
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:23,000
One Piece, Pirate Warriors 3 on PlayStation 4, 3, and Vita and Windows.

1042
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Shadowrun Hong Kong, PC, Mac, and Linux.

1043
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Steins Gate on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita.

1044
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And lastly, Until Dawn on the PlayStation 4 on the 25th.

1045
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:38,000
That's the one that they showed at E3, I think, last year with the, what's her name?

1046
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Hayden Pantoneer, the... I can never say her name.

1047
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
The cheerleader?

1048
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
The cheerleader from Heroes.

1049
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Right, she's the one that's like motion capture.

1050
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
It was like the scary game where you're running away from the killer,

1051
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,000
and I'm sure a lot of you horror fans will be into that.

1052
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Also noteworthy, it's coming on a day that we don't usually get video games.

1053
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:01,000
We usually get games on Tuesday, but we're getting some off-cycle game on Sunday,

1054
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
and it's a big one.

1055
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And when you're this company, you can release a game any damn time you want.

1056
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Disney Infinity 3.0 is one week from today.

1057
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
On everything. Literally everything.

1058
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:14,000
On all the things.

1059
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It will probably run on an Atari 2600 if they can sell you figures, honestly.

1060
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,000
All the things.

1061
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Now I'm just picturing this.

1062
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:27,000
We're not picking you up, Alan, for some reason. Is that microphone off?

1063
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Sorry, it was off because I'm snacking.

1064
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Try again.

1065
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
You had whispered about,

1066
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I don't know, I think I'm really going to get Disney Infinity 3.

1067
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
With all the amiibos you already have.

1068
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Rob, don't do it.

1069
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Thinking about it, but luckily I have Mega Man Legacy Collection to distract me this week,

1070
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
and I want to check out I Am Bread as well.

1071
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
So as long as you can keep me focused on those games,

1072
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,000
I probably will be able to put it off for a little while.

1073
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I always talked about that with Disney Infinity 2.0 as well.

1074
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I'm going to get it, I'm going to get it, and then I never got around to it

1075
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
because there's all these other games to occupy my time.

1076
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Rob.

1077
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
What?

1078
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Dragon Age Inquisition.

1079
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Play it and do multiplayer with me.

1080
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
That's a thing?

1081
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Actually, I've played more multiplayer in that game than I probably have single player.

1082
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
I haven't played multiplayer yet and I want to play with my friends.

1083
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I'm not good though.

1084
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
So?

1085
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Alright, fair enough.

1086
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I still can't make it past whatever the, what, bronze and mass effects or whatever.

1087
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Alright.

1088
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Going to Japan quickly.

1089
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,000
On the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week on the 27th, Dishonored HD.

1090
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Dragon's Dogma Online Limited Edition.

1091
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Madden 6.

1092
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Sorry, that's not Japan.

1093
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
That's your update sneaking in there.

1094
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Until Dawn.

1095
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:40,000
Sangeki no Senso is also out in Japan.

1096
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
So that's interesting that that game is also coming out in Japan.

1097
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
At the same time, we're getting it here in the US.

1098
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:54,000
On the Xbox One, Dishonored is also being released on the Xbox One for ye few Xbox owners.

1099
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Devil's...

1100
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Why are all these Europe dates suddenly showing up on my list?

1101
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Sorry, guys.

1102
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Super Mario Maker is the next Wii U title to look forward to in early September.

1103
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Nothing this week otherwise.

1104
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,000
On the PlayStation Vita.

1105
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
You know the Vita's kicking in Japan.

1106
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Yet again, another week where everything's on the Vita.

1107
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Ayakashi Gohan Omori.

1108
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
Himawari, Pebble in the Sky.

1109
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
One Piece, Pirate Warriors 3.

1110
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Rere Falaise Red of Another.

1111
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:27,000
And Raine des Fleurs in limited edition and limited edition DX packs.

1112
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
All coming out this week on the Vita.

1113
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Lastly, looking at that other handheld, the 3DS.

1114
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Oh, this is kind of a big deal.

1115
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Dragon Quest VIII gets a Japanese release on the 3DS this week.

1116
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Aren't they also getting a Famicom faceplate?

1117
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
For the new 3DS?

1118
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
The new 3DS.

1119
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
There is like a red 3DS coming out.

1120
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Oh, the Game & Watch faceplate.

1121
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Maybe.

1122
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I'm not seeing it on my list here.

1123
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
It may have already come out.

1124
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:54,000
It may have then.

1125
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I remember hearing about it, which I'd be like, I want one.

1126
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:02,000
But, Famicom Remix is also out on 3DS this week in Japan.

1127
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
That would obviously be like Nintendo NES Remix over here.

1128
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,000
So that's kind of neat.

1129
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
That's nice.

1130
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Cool.

1131
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I wonder if it'll have the extra sound channel like the Famicom actually has.

1132
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Ugh.

1133
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:17,000
You know, there was something that we picked up a while back.

1134
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
It was the power base converter with the FM sound chip playability in it.

1135
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And, I mean, it was really cool playing R-Type and whatnot on it.

1136
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:35,000
But I would like, it would just be some, you know, a cool thing if there was like a cheap re-release of like a disc system add-on or something.

1137
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Yeah.

1138
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,000
You know, I would love to go back and play like Zelda with a different sound set.

1139
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Or, Castlevania 3 was one that actually, not only did it have a different sound set, but it had different character animations for some of the other characters.

1140
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
And it's kind of a little bit harder too.

1141
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Didn't they censor a lot of that too, those Castlevania games?

1142
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:59,000
There were some, actually quite a bit of censorship in the Castlevania series.

1143
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:06,000
But like, my favorite thing about the, actually no, I don't think it was a disc one.

1144
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I think it was that it was on the cartridge, but the cartridge had the extra animations.

1145
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Like Grant could throw his swords, not his swords, but his daggers and whatnot.

1146
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
She could use them as a projectile player.

1147
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Didn't mean to get on that note, but it also though had different sound processor, different, I think it had, now my brain is failing me, but it did have a different sound set.

1148
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
No, you're right. That extra channel was used to enhance the music.

1149
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
That was it.

1150
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Anyhow, let's move on. You got Europe released.

1151
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:46,000
All of three things. On the 25th of August we have Frozen Freefall Snowball Fight on Xbone.

1152
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:52,000
On the 28th we have Doubles Third for Wii U and Until Dawn for PS4.

1153
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Alright. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1154
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
But first, Alan.

1155
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Hello.

1156
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,000
You got a story about a game you play a lot.

1157
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I do. So back in February, I believe, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XIV, which got a revamp after its horrific original launch in 2010, had 4 million active accounts.

1158
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Well, now this week they have announced that Final Fantasy XIV, which just had its first expansion, Heavensward, come out two months ago.

1159
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Yeah.

1160
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
They're now at 5 million active accounts.

1161
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:53,000
What that means is that 5 million people worldwide, this does not include free trials, 5 million licenses have been purchased and entered into their account to give them full access to the game plus the free 30 days that you get as a part of buying the game.

1162
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,000
So they've sold 5 million copies of the game but those people may or may not be still playing.

1163
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Exactly.

1164
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:04,000
World of Warcraft, which I know announced they're really trying to sweep the Warlords of Draenor cycle.

1165
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:10,000
I'm not sweeping under the rug but they've already announced their new expansion and they didn't even wait for Blizzcon to do it.

1166
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Even though allegedly their subscriber base has been free falling, their last announcement was 5.6 million active subscribers.

1167
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Which I take it to mean people who are beyond their first 30 days, people who have been rebuilt at least once, and people whose accounts have been active.

1168
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:37,000
Which of course is a huge number and when will you fave for all the crap that people talk about World of Warcraft, it's still the juggernaut.

1169
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:46,000
It's far more much more money to have 5.6 million recurring subscribers.

1170
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:57,000
But it's just proof that I think that a lot of people said WoW was the last MMO that could sustain a subscription based format.

1171
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:12,000
And in 2010 or 2013 when Final Fantasy XIV A Realm Reborn relaunched, people were like there's no reason to pay $14.99 a month for a game when you could play three free to play MMOs back to back and give money to none of them.

1172
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Or just pick the one that you're really into to occasionally give $10 a month to and play the other two on your board.

1173
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:25,000
There's no way that it's just not possible in the industry and I guess Square's kind of proven them wrong.

1174
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:31,000
There was a time when people would say there is no MMO that can compete against World of Warcraft. There isn't a single one.

1175
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:39,000
And not that, again, it's little apples to oranges. I don't always like the Final Fantasy XIV to WoW comparisons because they're two different games.

1176
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:43,000
They're two completely different games, they just happen to be in the same genre.

1177
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And also every big blue chip license like the Bioware's, the Old Republic MMO, Elder Scrolls had a lot of momentum in the first six months.

1178
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:03,000
And they've not necessarily gone free to play, but they had a big hump and then a big drop down.

1179
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:13,000
XIV is still growing. It's the first MMO that people would say, oh it's going to be the WoW killer, which whatever, no it's not.

1180
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:20,000
It's the first one that survived its year and not fallen off a cliff. I think that's safe to say.

1181
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Because if you think of all the other big titles, like, what are the two that came out? The one that still was really into?

1182
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Was it Wildstar? Elder Scrolls Online.

1183
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:39,000
And then there was another one that I'm blanking on. It came out around the same time as Guild Wars 2.

1184
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Everyone was like, oh, hype, hype, hype. And it might have sold great the first couple months, but it always has that drop off and then always that announcement, we're going free to play.

1185
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:58,000
And I think XIV is the first MMO to really, it's kept its inertia.

1186
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:11,000
This might also be the game's Japanese roots or something. I'm talking like business stereotypes. You get the Japanese business stereotype is often very stubborn. We've said that about Nintendo a lot.

1187
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Final Fantasy XI, you still have to pay to play that. How long is that game?

1188
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
And they're officially ending that.

1189
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Hell no. They're ending it on PlayStation and 360.

1190
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
But as far as coming out with new content?

1191
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Yeah, done. But they're still going to charge for it.

1192
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,000
But then they're going to shift it to mobile. I don't know what the hell is going to happen with that.

1193
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,000
So anyway, I've said this once on the show before. I'm going to say it again.

1194
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:42,000
I think gaming history will be very kind to Naoki Yoshida for what he's accomplished with Final Fantasy XIV.

1195
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,000
He took the worst MMO of all time and made it one of the very best.

1196
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Basically, he loves MMOs and he's played a lot, including World of Warcraft. So he's a huge fan of the genre.

1197
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:04,000
He's not a suit that barely knows what he's talking about. So his heart is in XIV so much.

1198
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:13,000
I think the only bummer about it is that I honestly truly believe the renaissance of Final Fantasy XIV in 2.0 and everybody being really into it.

1199
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:19,000
I don't want to say saved Square Enix, but it's put their company on a different trajectory.

1200
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:26,000
The only downside is that they're going to pull him and some of his team to work on something else that is another big thing for Square.

1201
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
That's the only thing that I worry about.

1202
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Yeah, well between XIV and Record Keeper and their mobile games, the ones that are actually good, are making disgusting amounts of money.

1203
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Obviously we can see how they're spending money in XIV because they have a good content patch come out every three months.

1204
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:51,000
They have tons of content and they technically don't have to do that. They can follow the WoW model and be like, new patch in nine months, bye!

1205
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Well, but to be fair, and I sound like I'm up XIV's ass, which I guess in some ways I'm a little bit of a fanboy, but I will say this.

1206
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I am a little burned out right now. Heavensward, brilliant expansion, phenomenal story, worthy of the Final Fantasy name.

1207
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Best campaign story probably since X.

1208
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Oh my god, I would say since VI, but people will argue with me there and that's fine.

1209
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:23,000
But I will say, now that I'm kind of all done with it and I'm in the endgame, I'm in the lull.

1210
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I'm a little bit, okay, I log on, I grind my tomes, I'm a little bit over it right now.

1211
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
That's why I've been kind of, I need to finish Diablo III.

1212
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:35,000
3.31 is on the horizon for next month, I think.

1213
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Oh, did they say as soon as next month? I know 3.07 is like this week.

1214
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I'm glad I've taken it so slow, even though it was due to a lot of personal crap that I took a big part of my break with everything going on.

1215
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
But I'm kind of glad that I took it as slow as I did.

1216
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Oh yeah, and there's a lot of people for various different reasons in your boat too.

1217
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
It means I'm going to have content out the ass for a long time.

1218
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:07,000
And I'm really enjoying how much that I've just been able to sit back and do story stuff.

1219
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I actually, I'm even enjoying doing some of the different battles too, like I just did Moogle Mog.

1220
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Oh, I love that file.

1221
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:28,000
It was kind of a pain in the butt when I died right at the end, but it was still hilarious because of Disco Moogles.

1222
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:40,000
But like, I'm ready to do the Ultima fight now and all the, I think the big thing is that there is something for fans of the older series in the past, as well as the newer ones.

1223
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
And that's giving it a bit more longevity apart from just the revamped play.

1224
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Right.

1225
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
So anyway, that's my 12 cents.

1226
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Alright, well moving along here, since we are running, we're almost to two hours in this segment.

1227
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:56,000
But when you have, this always happens when we have an amazing interview on the show, is that we just run long. That's alright.

1228
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Let's talk about Konami again. Oh boy, what did they do this time?

1229
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
Well actually, some people are looking a little more favorably on that.

1230
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Konami apparently released a heritage game survey.

1231
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:13,000
They're asking players about some of the IPs and how you feel about them.

1232
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
It's also asking, what do you want to see brought back?

1233
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I'll tell you what's on the list here in a minute.

1234
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,000
There's well known and obscure on here, but not on the list.

1235
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
Silent Hill and Metal Gear.

1236
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:31,000
Does this mean that they're already, I mean, obviously we have a new Metal Gear game coming out in a week.

1237
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:35,000
You know, is Silent Hill still continuing?

1238
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Survey be damned, who knows?

1239
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Or could this just be the Konami's trying to get in people's good favor again?

1240
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:46,000
By throwing out these names of reminding us why we love them.

1241
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:52,000
And teasing us, giving us just a taste that we could be seeing it again in the future.

1242
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Here's a list, here's what they put out.

1243
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Jamie, you're going to be surprised at some of the things on this list.

1244
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Rocket Knight. What?

1245
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Bishi Bashi. Ooh, Bishi Bashi.

1246
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
Parodius. What?

1247
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
Sunset Riders. Parodius.

1248
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Contra. Parodius.

1249
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Suikoden. Parodius.

1250
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Gradius. Parodius.

1251
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Okay, but can we talk about Gradius? Sure.

1252
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
Track and Field.

1253
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Bomberman, because remember they have Hudson now.

1254
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
Castlevania.

1255
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Mystical Ninja, or Goemon.

1256
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
Zone of the Enders.

1257
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Vandal Hearts.

1258
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Yu-Gi-Oh.

1259
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
And I love that there's an option, none of these.

1260
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Parodius.

1261
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Yeah.

1262
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Parodius.

1263
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Well, you know.

1264
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I do know. And I think a lot of the listeners by this point know.

1265
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
But just in case we have new listeners, Dark Soccer.

1266
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Sunset Riders is a freaking good game, by the way.

1267
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
But Parodius. These are all good games.

1268
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Oh my god. I could totally,

1269
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
totally stand to have

1270
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
a

1271
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
a

1272
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Parodius.

1273
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Dark to see you.

1274
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
I just lost my brain. Dark to see you in chat says

1275
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
I did vote for a new Sunset Riders.

1276
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Fifth Dream says Zone of the Enders.

1277
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Act F. Zone of the Enders. Bonds. 006.

1278
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Zone of the Enders. Hmm.

1279
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
We got a lot of Zoe fans in our chat there tonight.

1280
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Anyway. We'll see. I don't know.

1281
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
It's a poll. It's a survey.

1282
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
I'm kind of looking at it going

1283
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
whatever until I see some evidence

1284
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
that it's actually going to happen. We'll see.

1285
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Anyhow. Let's

1286
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
Actually, I would like to say

1287
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
if they did anything in the Castlevania series

1288
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
as much as I like the new

1289
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
series. You know, the ones that have been on the handhelds

1290
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
in the last few days. I would

1291
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
daze my butt. I would

1292
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
like to have a continuation

1293
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
of the Dracula X storyline.

1294
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
You know, we had Dracula X.

1295
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
We had Rondo

1296
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
of Blood. We had Symphony of the Night or

1297
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Nocturne in the Moonlight

1298
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
as it was in Japan. I would love

1299
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
to have a direct

1300
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
trilogy. You know.

1301
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
That would be pretty rad.

1302
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
Alright. Well, let's go back to a

1303
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
classic time. Let's go back to a time when Konami

1304
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
was actually making all these series.

1305
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Even when Konami

1306
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
was making games people liked.

1307
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
I get it. To be fair,

1308
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I'll give her a solid five. I'm sure tons of people are going to like.

1309
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
But anyway, it's just one game.

1310
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Dark Soccer is going to step into

1311
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
the vault. Newly refurbished and remodeled

1312
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
vault. And find a game, which actually

1313
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
tonight isn't Konami. It isn't exactly

1314
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
remodeled as much as shits everywhere.

1315
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
She's going to go into the archive

1316
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
and find a game that she thinks, hey, brats

1317
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
check out this game. This is a classic.

1318
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Or, I think,

1319
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
and she sometimes does this, because a game

1320
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
to qualify as a classic game of the week has to be at least

1321
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
ten years old. So sometimes Dark Soccer

1322
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
comes in here and goes, ha ha

1323
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
remember this game? It's because you're old.

1324
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
And I think that's what she's

1325
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I think that's what she's doing to us tonight.

1326
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
This is called

1327
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Watch Out My Foot's

1328
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Heading Toward Your Age Balls.

1329
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Dark Soccer, what is the classic

1330
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
game of the week tonight?

1331
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Zuma. Yes.

1332
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Zuma is over ten years old.

1333
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
How does it make

1334
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
you feel? You are a rude

1335
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
rude individual.

1336
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
Oh yeah.

1337
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Zuma, like when old people go to the

1338
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
YMCA and do calisthenics? No.

1339
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
No, that's

1340
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Zumba. That's Zumba.

1341
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
And it's not Zima, which is

1342
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
And it's not what cleans your house. That's a Roomba.

1343
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
See, here I was going for

1344
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
even more old and going for the Zimas

1345
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
which was what the

1346
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
drink of

1347
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
of the preppy frat plays

1348
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
everywhere.

1349
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Anyway,

1350
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Zuma is a tile

1351
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
matching puzzle game. It was put up by

1352
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
PopCap and

1353
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
you can still play it for free a bunch of places

1354
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
because no one

1355
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
cares about putting any more money into it

1356
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
because Zuma's revenge is out.

1357
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
And that will make you feel

1358
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
old because that will be a ten year game in 2019.

1359
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
That came out in 2009.

1360
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
Good lord, people. Stop

1361
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
blowing up my chat here.

1362
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
For those of you that know Extover from

1363
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Horde House,

1364
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
this is like, I have

1365
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
my god, he played so much Zuma, you guys.

1366
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
This is probably like his classic game of all time.

1367
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
He played a lot of this game.

1368
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Until he discovered Devil's Crush.

1369
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Yes.

1370
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
On the Wii U

1371
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
or the Wii release.

1372
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Anyway,

1373
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
it received

1374
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
the 2004 Game of the

1375
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Year award from Real Arcade.

1376
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
So,

1377
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
anyway,

1378
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
with this particular game, I always called

1379
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
it kind of like, bust a move

1380
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
on a track.

1381
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
I can see that. Yeah, because, I mean, you basically

1382
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
have the different multicolored balls

1383
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
and you move a little thing around in a

1384
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
He said balls.

1385
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I didn't say deez nuts.

1386
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
Deez nuts for president.

1387
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Anyway.

1388
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Anyway.

1389
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Ah, don't get me started.

1390
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
So,

1391
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
as I was saying, before Rob

1392
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
rudely interrupted me. I'm just waiting for you to

1393
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
actually pick the game, Balls,

1394
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
as the classic game of the week.

1395
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Just for, I think I've done, um

1396
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Balls has a better chance than Halo, you guys.

1397
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
Oh, I should do

1398
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Balls. I did, um, Vector

1399
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Man before and he's made of balls.

1400
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Wait for election day. You can do Balls.

1401
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
In honor of deez nuts.

1402
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Anyway, go ahead, I'm sorry to keep interrupting.

1403
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
I'm sorry to keep interrupting. Go ahead. No, I'll probably

1404
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
because when

1405
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Bernie wins, I have to do something relatively

1406
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Jewish. Back to the

1407
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
game.

1408
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
So, anyway, um,

1409
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
the balls are gonna go, are on like

1410
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
a track and you have a little

1411
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
360 degree

1412
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
ball shooter thing

1413
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
that looks like a big Aztec

1414
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
monument head face thing.

1415
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
So, um, basically

1416
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
the balls, you have to stop the balls before

1417
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
they reach, um, a skull or

1418
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
else, you know, game over.

1419
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
So, um, you eliminate

1420
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
the balls by shooting a colored

1421
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
ball of the similar color

1422
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
until you, um,

1423
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
uh, match up a particular

1424
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
color. So when you have three or more of the same color

1425
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
in contact, they'll explode

1426
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
and they can even trigger

1427
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
explosions and chain reactions. And the

1428
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
level's completed when you fill up

1429
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
your bar for as many of them

1430
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
as you do. You get bonuses

1431
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
for collecting coins that show through the

1432
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
different gaps and making

1433
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
things explode.

1434
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
And then you have, um,

1435
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
different power ups you can get. There's the

1436
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
backward ball that pushes

1437
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
the furthest out chain

1438
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
backwards for a little bit.

1439
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
And there's a slow down, uh, ball that

1440
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
slows down time. Or,

1441
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
you also get, um,

1442
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
an accuracy ball that

1443
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
lines up your shots.

1444
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Um, and then you have

1445
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
an explosion ball that just makes

1446
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
things go boom. I like that.

1447
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Um, you've got

1448
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
adventure mode, you've got gauntlet mode,

1449
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
um, you've got

1450
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
all kinds of different stuff in it.

1451
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
But there was a controversy about this.

1452
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
There was, um, a

1453
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Japanese developer called, uh, the Mitchell

1454
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Corporation that said Zuma infringed

1455
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
on a 1998

1456
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
game called Puzloop that

1457
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
was released as ballistic outside

1458
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
of Japan.

1459
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
The game was, uh,

1460
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
uh, re-released, um, for

1461
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
the Nintendo DS.

1462
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Um, well, I'll

1463
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
backtrack on that one. They re-released

1464
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
the design as a game called Magnetica.

1465
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
And PopCap,

1466
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
um, basically went

1467
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
back and forth and saying that it wasn't an exact

1468
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
clone. And

1469
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
that they were actually

1470
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
happy that the games were getting copied.

1471
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
It was a whole bunch of odd stuff.

1472
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
So, but anyway, yeah,

1473
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
um, congratulations. Everyone feels

1474
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
old now because Zuma is

1475
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
officially a classic.

1476
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Not a real

1477
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
classic, but it's old enough to be

1478
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
considered classic.

1479
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Classic enough.

1480
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I suppose.

1481
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
And this is just really one of my

1482
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
little spiteful ones. Like, hey, guess what?

1483
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Heh heh.

1484
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Alright. There it is.

1485
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
This person's not playing very well.

1486
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
There it is, your classic game of the week.

1487
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Zuma!

1488
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Not to be confused with Zumba, or Zima.

1489
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
To

1490
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000

01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Rake. As pointed

1494
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
out in our chat room,

1495
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Bobby Blackwolf says Zuma is backwards

1496
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
compatible on the Xbox One right now.

1497
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
So it's a classic that's playable on a very modern console.

1498
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
That's a very good point. You can check that out.

1499
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
That's gonna do it for this

1500
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
first half of our show, but we've got plenty

1501
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
more. It's more like first two thirds.

1502
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
But we still have more show to come

1503
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
when we come back. We're gonna get into rapid fire news.

1504
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
The fugal question of the week

1505
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
about voice acting tonight, in honor of the

1506
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
guests we had on earlier. And we're gonna get to our

1507
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
mailbag, the FUs of the week, and your

1508
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR

1509
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
or on Skype, at Orange

1510
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Lounge Radio, all one word. We're gonna get to

1511
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
all that when we come back after this

1512
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1513
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange

1514
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Lounge Radio. Live tonight

1515
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
August the 23rd of

1516
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
2015 with the 611th

1517
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
episode of our show

1518
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
already in progress. And

1519
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
yeah, we've had a great

1520
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
interview with a trio of very

1521
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
talented voice actors there

1522
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
at the top of the show. So if you're just joining us

1523
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
live, again, you need to go check out the podcast feed once

1524
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
it's posted. Available on iTunes

1525
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
or Stitcher Radio or pretty much

1526
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
vognetwork.com. If you wanna have it over there, you can always listen

1527
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
on demand there. Show is always posted

1528
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
about an hour after we wrap up live.

1529
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Anyhow, we're

1530
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
gonna get right back into it. We're running a little long tonight

1531
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
so we're gonna get right back into the gaming news

1532
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
and remember if you want to participate along

1533
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
with our show, we like to read comments and things like that

1534
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
live.vognetwork.com

1535
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Alan's joining us tonight in place of Loki.

1536
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Hello. Hi.

1537
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
What do you got for us for rapid fire news tonight?

1538
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I'm gonna actually

1539
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
make these very quickly, quick

1540
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
because I don't have much personal

1541
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
commentary to make about any of them.

1542
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
So people are all a

1543
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
flutter about a job posting

1544
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
that Bungie put on their website

1545
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
specifically asking for a

1546
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
PC compatibility tester.

1547
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
This is exciting because

1548
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
I don't believe Bungie has put a game out

1549
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
on the PC platform since Halo

1550
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
or Halo 2 and those were, I think,

1551
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
probably just ports. They weren't developed

1552
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
natively for the PC.

1553
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
So the scuttlebutt

1554
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
or the popular opinion

1555
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
is that they're

1556
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
thinking about bringing

1557
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Destiny to PC

1558
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
though Bungie has not

1559
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
announced anything

1560
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
like that. But the

1561
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
job description says

1562
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
evaluate PC hardware specific features

1563
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
and ensure various systems work together

1564
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
across multiple PC configurations

1565
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
to provide a great experience.

1566
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
So basically it's a

1567
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
quality assurance

1568
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
beta tester for PC.

1569
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
So people think that that is

1570
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
interesting to note.

1571
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
There

1572
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
was a lawsuit between

1573
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
3D Realms, Gearbox Software, and I believe

1574
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
another software company called

1575
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Interceptor about a spinoff Duke Nukem

1576
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
game that 3D Realms

1577
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
licensed to Interceptor.

1578
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Except Gearbox is like, no, we

1579
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
own that intellectual property now.

1580
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
It was a part of us doing Duke Nukem forever.

1581
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
That case

1582
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
has finally

1583
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I don't think

1584
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Yeah, they all

1585
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
voluntarily ended their litigation

1586
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
so I believe it was settled out of court.

1587
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Gearbox is now the sole

1588
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
owner of the Duke Nukem license

1589
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
and Interceptor and 3D Realms is

1590
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
working on their own new game.

1591
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
So hooray

1592
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Gearbox, even though

1593
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
that wasn't really their fault but Duke Nukem forever

1594
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
wasn't the best and I don't really know if there's

1595
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
even any hype for that franchise to live on.

1596
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Yeah, it's kind of, hooray, it's

1597
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
been settled, a franchise that I think

1598
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
most people are done with.

1599
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
I don't know, I think

1600
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Duke Nukem could be reinvented still.

1601
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
He's a classic character.

1602
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
The statements from 3D Realms and

1603
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Interceptor were very gracious in

1604
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
saying, you know, we did this on Good Faith

1605
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
didn't know there was a legal

1606
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
issue, congrats to Gearbox, we look

1607
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
forward to future blah blah blah.

1608
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
If Sonic can survive Sonic

1609
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
2006, then

1610
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
If Britney Spears can survive 2007

1611
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
then you can make it through this day.

1612
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
I say

1613
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
that to myself every morning.

1614
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Finally, there's a game

1615
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
on Steam which I believe is on HellasHale

1616
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
this weekend called Zombie Army Trilogy.

1617
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Valve and Steam

1618
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
put out this weekend a

1619
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
free update that puts all

1620
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
six, or sorry

1621
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
six or eight, all eight, excuse me

1622
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Left 4 Dead protagonists in

1623
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Zombie Army Trilogy so you

1624
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
can play as the cute redneck

1625
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
or the sleazy

1626
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
guy in the white blazer

1627
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
or the biker dude that kind of looks

1628
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
like the guy from Grand Theft Auto 4.

1629
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
They are playable characters now in

1630
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Zombie Army Trilogy for you

1631
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Left 4 Dead fanatics out there and that's all I have

1632
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
done.

1633
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
because that's

1634
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
what you learn when you do something like that

1635
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
is you get off the internet.

1636
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
S2100Matt says about the Duke Nukem

1637
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
What I'm hoping for with this is that Duke Nukem could make a guest

1638
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
appearance in Borderlands.

1639
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Imagine him as the villain in the next Borderlands game

1640
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
as a rival Vault Hunter.

1641
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
Just saying, that would be epic.

1642
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
That would be pretty rad.

1643
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
S2100Matt, you need to write a letter.

1644
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
Or something.

1645
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Let's go and talk about

1646
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Pokken Tournament.

1647
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
It's going to be happening on the Wii U.

1648
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
It's coming next spring.

1649
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
They announced the release of

1650
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
Pokken Tournament for the Nintendo Wii U.

1651
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
It's an arcade game in Japan

1652
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
but it will be released worldwide

1653
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
in Spring 2016.

1654
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Being developed in collaboration with Bandai Namco

1655
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
who of course made Tekken

1656
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
so they know a thing or two about fighting games.

1657
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Will you play Tekken with Pokemon

1658
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Dark Saga?

1659
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
No. I'll play Tekken with Gon.

1660
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
I will. I will.

1661
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Look, if Tekken can have a panda bear

1662
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
and whatever

1663
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
that tree thing was

1664
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
the wooden- Mokujin.

1665
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Mokujin, that's it. By the way, to go back to

1666
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
the last segment, I just told

1667
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
Konami that Silent Hill, all of Silent Hill

1668
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
is Silent Hill ever forever.

1669
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Did you actually fill out that interview?

1670
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Yes I did. And I put Silent Hill.

1671
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Sorry, did I say interview? I meant survey.

1672
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Survey, yes.

1673
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
My wires are crossing tonight. I'm in a short circuit here any moment.

1674
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Alright, well Dark Sakura

1675
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
pay attention because I know you want to know about this

1676
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
because it has to do with Gunstar Heroes.

1677
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
No, I'm not announcing a new Gunstar Heroes

1678
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
game, I apologize. But

1679
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
a remake, sort of,

1680
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
of the Gunstar Heroes

1681
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
game is available on the 3DS

1682
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
eShop as of August 20th.

1683
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
This is,

1684
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I don't know if this is a

1685
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
oh yeah, it is a 3D version of Gunstar Heroes.

1686
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
It's the Gunstar 3D Heroes

1687
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
for the Sega Ages thing

1688
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
that already came out.

1689
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
But this has already been

1690
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
a thing. On the 20th.

1691
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Right? Yeah, I think actually I

1692
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
have this, I think.

1693
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I don't know, I've got so many copies of

1694
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Gunstar Heroes that it's ridiculous.

1695
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
I'll ask Dan, he knows. Well it's Gunstar.

1696
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I don't know, I'm reading here, it just came out this week.

1697
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Maybe it was in a collection, now it's not.

1698
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
So, whatever, it's Gunstar Heroes.

1699
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I want to say it was one of the Sega Ages things.

1700
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

1701
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Also, you know, last week on the show

1702
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
we talked about how Resident Evil 2 is being

1703
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
remade. Well,

1704
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
there was a fan project, if you didn't know,

1705
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
that was already in the works, Resident Evil 2

1706
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Reborn. And it was going to be made

1707
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
in Unreal 4. So what happened this week?

1708
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
It got shut down

1709
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
is what tends to happen with these fan

1710
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
projects all the time. But,

1711
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
good guy Capcom,

1712
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
doing this the right way, because usually like

1713
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
if Square Enix or Nintendo does this to you,

1714
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
like when Nintendo pulled that Mario 64

1715
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
thing, you disappear.

1716
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
But, in a good

1717
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
guy Capcom, which I don't use that phrase

1718
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
very often anymore on this program,

1719
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
but Capcom actually reached out to

1720
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
the Reborn team and has invited

1721
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
them to share their ideas

1722
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
for it. So,

1723
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Capcom saying, hey look, legal

1724
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
reasons, got to shut you down,

1725
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
but you know what, let's talk,

1726
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
let's have a meeting. So, that's

1727
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
a reasonable end

1728
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
to this situation.

1729
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
Alan? I was going to say,

1730
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
the fact that they would give them

1731
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
the time of day and be like, okay

1732
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
we'll see what

1733
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
ideas you had. Because, I mean,

1734
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
this type of thing happens

1735
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
all the time where, you know,

1736
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
with the Streets of Rage

1737
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
compilation, Sega see indeed that,

1738
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
it happened so often that they could have

1739
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
just, okay, seasoned assisted because

1740
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
intellectual property rights, blah, blah, blah,

1741
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
and then been done with it and I don't think anyone

1742
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
would have faulted Capcom

1743
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
worse than they fault anyone else when this happens.

1744
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
So the fact that they're meeting with them is

1745
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
pretty cool. Exactly.

1746
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Alright, let's move on, Dark Sakura. Stuff.

1747
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
Um,

1748
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
there is a big reason why

1749
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Dan and I have been on our Chrono Trigger

1750
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
kick lately.

1751
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
And the big reason for the

1752
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
Chrono Trigger kick is because Chrono Trigger

1753
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
has had its 20th birthday.

1754
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
My tummy hurts, I don't feel good.

1755
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I know, right?

1756
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
God, you thought the Zuma thing made you feel old.

1757
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
That would make you feel.

1758
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
We were in high school. Next year

1759
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
is our 20 year high school

1760
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
reunion. Fuck off. Mine already passed.

1761
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Anyhow,

1762
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
sorry Dark Sakura.

1763
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
We had to whine.

1764
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Get off our lawn.

1765
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
So, and I mean,

1766
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
this was, it just had such a great

1767
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
creative team. It had

1768
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Sakaguchi, who's the guy who created

1769
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
Final Fantasy. It had

1770
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Hori, who was

1771
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
the creative

1772
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Dragon Quest. And of course,

1773
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
one of everyone's favorite

1774
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
mangaka, Akira

1775
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Toriyama

1776
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
was in it.

1777
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
I

1778
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
did the right away

1779
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
ending just so I could see

1780
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
his little sprite in the game.

1781
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
So, it was

1782
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
such a good game. Such a good game.

1783
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
In fact, Dan and I were actually just

1784
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
whenever character music would play, we'd just like

1785
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
stop the dialogue and do the Robo

1786
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
dance. The Robo's theme

1787
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
is incredible to this day. Yeah.

1788
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
Actually, I'm going to be ring toning

1789
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
that before too long

1790
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
because it's so great.

1791
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
But yeah,

1792
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
you actually,

1793
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I mean,

1794
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
the battle system in it was

1795
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
I'd say fairly

1796
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
revolutionary too. I mean, you had

1797
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
your different techniques and the combination

1798
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
techniques and

1799
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
the fact you could actually

1800
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
bypass certain fights.

1801
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
It was a little unheard of.

1802
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
It wasn't just the woosh woosh

1803
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
random encounter. Oh my god.

1804
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
But you could get away with some.

1805
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
In fact, Dan today, he

1806
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
runs right through the middle of the enemies, leaves

1807
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
the room and is like, hey, weren't enemies supposed

1808
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
to spawn here? Went back and they spawned.

1809
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Because he went back to check.

1810
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Good job.

1811
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
The humor and everything was great.

1812
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Okay, so I would

1813
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
add enough gushing on that one for me.

1814
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Super Mario Maker.

1815
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Some news about that.

1816
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
It's going to have different skin tones

1817
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
and fur

1818
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
colors.

1819
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
So basically,

1820
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
it's supposed to be

1821
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
a dog's paw.

1822
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Why are they focusing on the dogs?

1823
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
Where's the cat love?

1824
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
But you're going to have different

1825
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
skin tones that will go with what you

1826
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
associate with if you want to.

1827
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
Oh, I remember. Or you have the gloved hand

1828
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
like Mario. There was a controversy

1829
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
on this a while ago when people were like

1830
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
why is the hand only this

1831
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
one white hand that you can play in the game?

1832
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
And so they

1833
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
said they would have more.

1834
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
So it sounds like now they've shown like, oh, you can be

1835
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
a dog's hand if you want. Or you can be a

1836
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
cat paw. A Mario hand. Why all the cat hate

1837
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Nintendo? I know. Took them forever

1838
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
to add Nintendo cats. Maybe that's in there too.

1839
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Super Mario Cats is already a game.

1840
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
It's called Super Mario 3D World.

1841
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Fair

1842
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
enough. Fair enough. And

1843
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
then this

1844
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
I laughed so hard when

1845
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
I read this. And I even

1846
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
like how you put it in the show Roll Rob.

1847
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
PS4 in my

1848
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
pants.

1849
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
A shoplifter

1850
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
tried to fit a PS4

1851
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
in his pants.

1852
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
On top of that is Florida Man.

1853
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
You know Florida Man

1854
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
is my favorite criminal.

1855
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Florida Man, Florida Man. You know about the

1856
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Florida Man theme.

1857
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
You say Florida Man.

1858
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Florida Man has a sexual relationship

1859
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
with all of their relatives.

1860
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
And they smoke tons of crack and bath salts in there

1861
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
in every story ever. Wasn't Jack Voldemore

1862
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
a lawyer in Florida? Yes.

1863
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
But no, Florida Man has kind of

1864
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
made a bit of a meme.

1865
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Where, you know, they'll say like on Twitter

1866
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
Florida Man accused of this.

1867
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
And then just over and over. So Florida

1868
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Man has become this

1869
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
like super villain. And so

1870
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
now Florida Man tries to stuff

1871
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
a PS4 in his pants. Sorry.

1872
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
You just say Florida Man, I think of Jack Voldemore.

1873
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
And it's funnier.

1874
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I'm done. I quit.

1875
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
How did they find the PS4

1876
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
in his pants?

1877
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Let's see.

1878
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
He managed to stuff the PS4

1879
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
and the accessories in his pants

1880
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
while going to a Walmart.

1881
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Only at Walmart.

1882
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
And he walked out of the store

1883
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
without paying and was stopped and

1884
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
arrested on a felony

1885
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
grand theft charge. Oh, I get it.

1886
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
I feel so uncool. He was already on probation.

1887
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
I feel so uncool for not having

1888
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
heard of this before. Tigerclaw linked me to a Wikipedia

1889
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
article, which by the way, I'm surprised this is on

1890
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Wikipedia and not like Encyclopedia Dramatica

1891
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
or one of those other websites.

1892
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
What's the meme? Urban Dictionary.

1893
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
So anyway, link me to Wikipedia

1894
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
and it actually says the reason why it's

1895
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Florida Man is because that's the way all the headlines

1896
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
always read. Florida Man steals PlayStation

1897
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
4 in his pants. Florida Man got it.

1898
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
I get it. Now it's funny.

1899
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
And I don't want to mention Florida Man's

1900
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
actual name here. But Florida Woman's

1901
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
just as crazy. But he's 36 years old.

1902
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Which makes me think that he still

1903
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
had a pair of jinkos in his closet.

1904
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
From like 1994.

1905
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
It's either sweatpants, a big old pair

1906
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
of sweatpants, or he's still got the jinko, the raver jeans.

1907
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
I'm going to vote for the jinkos.

1908
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Because if you like

1909
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
cinch off the ends of them, you could probably fit

1910
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
like a small family in those things.

1911
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Alright, well

1912
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
let's see.

1913
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I think it's time

1914
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
for us to get into the foogle question

1915
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
of the week.

1916
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Every week we ask you guys a question on our

1917
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

1918
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
You put Facebook and Google together,

1919
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
you get foogle!

1920
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
Tonight,

1921
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
I thought we would ask about

1922
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
voice acting. Because you know,

1923
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
we had some voice actors on our show tonight

1924
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
so why not?

1925
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I mentioned that we were going to have our interview tonight and said

1926
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
what or who is your

1927
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
favorite voice acting performance

1928
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
in a video game and why did you pick that

1929
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
performance? So

1930
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
what was a voice acting performance

1931
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
that really resonated with you?

1932
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Redertainment answered over on Google Plus and said

1933
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
due to the fact that we don't regularly see

1934
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
actor in roles in video games

1935
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
like how we see the actors in movies, TV

1936
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
shows and plays and so forth.

1937
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Individual actors don't stand out to me as much as the

1938
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
characters do. Unless the actor has

1939
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
a really distinctive voice that I know from

1940
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
some other platforms, I don't remember

1941
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
what actor plays what roles. So that's

1942
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
why my answer is Stephen Merchant from Portal 2.

1943
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
You know,

1944
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
if a voice actor is doing an amazing

1945
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
job though, that would mean that you

1946
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
shouldn't necessarily be able to tell. I mean

1947
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
sometimes you do, it just depends on the type of character

1948
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
but I think when you look at

1949
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
especially the resumes of some of the gentlemen that were on the show tonight

1950
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
say whoa, that was the same person?

1951
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
That's cool. You know and I think a lot

1952
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
of you guys probably have done that when you go to

1953
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
one of those websites that list everything that the

1954
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
voice actors do that I know

1955
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Marissa linked one of those sites earlier in our chat room.

1956
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
I had no idea that Jennifer Hale was

1957
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
as prolific as she was. Yes.

1958
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Like I knew obviously that she was a big

1959
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
name but it's like no, she was

1960
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
voicing stuff. She's in Baldur's Gate

1961
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
and all this stuff from way back

1962
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
when. I also love

1963
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
Marc Meer not because

1964
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
he was Commander Shepard because a lot of

1965
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
people, not maybe the best

1966
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
acting in some of the lines he delivered

1967
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
but as a personality if you see

1968
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
his YouTube videos and his cosplay he's

1969
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
really funny. Well

1970
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
do you guys remember Hitoshi

1971
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Doi? He had the

1972
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Seiyu database. Yes.

1973
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Which was basically

1974
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
a visual novel,

1975
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
video game, anime

1976
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
and drama.

1977
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Drama programs.

1978
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Yeah. For Japan.

1979
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
And then I think there was supposed to be a

1980
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
branch out of it

1981
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
when anime started getting bigger in the

1982
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
US. And I don't know what

1983
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
happened to that. I don't even know if his Seiyu

1984
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
database is still around.

1985
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Alright.

1986
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Well let me move on here

1987
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
with some of the answers on Facebook.

1988
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
Chad B says

1989
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
Gideon Emery is Balthier

1990
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Without a doubt Balthier and Fran

1991
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
made Final Fantasy XII for me and

1992
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
it was quite a nice surprise to hear Emery pop up

1993
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
through the Dragon Age franchise as well.

1994
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
And I just found out he played one of the Russian brothers

1995
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
in the Daredevil Netflix series which makes it that much

1996
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
better. That's one of my all time favorites too.

1997
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Like that's an amazing

1998
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
performance. Balthier and Fran for that matter.

1999
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Both are fantastic in that game.

2000
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Elliot B says

2001
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
I'll get the obvious out of the way. Portal would not be

2002
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Portal without Ella McClain as GLaDOS.

2003
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
And Stephen Merchant was great in Portal too

2004
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
especially in comparison to other voice over work by

2005
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
big name actors.

2006
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
DeGenere Johnny says

2007
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
Sarah Kestelman's performance as

2008
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Kreia in Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic 2

2009
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
The Sith Lords. Her portrayal matched

2010
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
every aspect of the character and how she was written

2011
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
which was the highest quality I've ever

2012
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
seen in a game. It takes a great deal of

2013
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
talent to sell a villain that the player will sympathize

2014
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
with and she nailed it perfectly.

2015
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
To this day I still get teary eyed when

2016
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
remembering her performance.

2017
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
Dark Tetsuya says

2018
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
David Hayter as the original Solid Snake.

2019
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
The Phantom Pain just won't sound the same

2020
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
with Keith or Sutherland taking over.

2021
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Honorable mention for Cameron Clark as

2022
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Liquid or Master Miller.

2023
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
I do have to insert there.

2024
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Playing the Dragon Age Inquisition DLC

2025
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
because he voiced Ren.

2026
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
And I was just having

2027
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
major Metal Gear flashbacks

2028
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
the whole time.

2029
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Let's see. Moving on to

2030
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
SSJ100Matt says

2031
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,000
He also has a long resume working on many games.

2032
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Wing Commander, Darksiders, Kingdom Hearts

2033
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
and of course Batman Arkham games.

2034
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
His Joker role is iconic and

2035
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
certainly can have the case made of

2036
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
being the definitive Joker even

2037
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
amongst the movie Jokers.

2038
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
And I don't think there's really a lot of

2039
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
people that would argue with you on that to be honest.

2040
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
So, let's see.

2041
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Asking around in the room here.

2042
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
Dark Sakura, what is your favorite

2043
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
voice actor or actress performance in a game

2044
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
and why is it Jennifer Hale?

2045
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Laughter

2046
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Laughter

2047
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Laughter

2048
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Am I right or am I right?

2049
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I love Jennifer Hale so much.

2050
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Well, I mean it's not just the whole

2051
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
You're gonna cry at GamerX3

2052
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I just know it.

2053
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
It's not the whole fem-shep thing.

2054
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
She plays so many

2055
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
good, strong female characters

2056
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
that I can't help but go

2057
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
doki-doki in my heart.

2058
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
But

2059
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
I'm actually gonna go

2060
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
This is

2061
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
his favorite voice actor

2062
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
in games in general.

2063
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Or his particular performance.

2064
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Like Balthier for me

2065
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
would have probably been my answer too.

2066
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I've got voices that I can

2067
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
pick out anywhere.

2068
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
I can pick her out.

2069
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Everyone who has

2070
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
ears can pick out Gideon Emery in anything

2071
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
he ever does because

2072
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
that gravel. Oh god.

2073
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Shivers, shivers, shivers.

2074
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
You alright? You need a moment?

2075
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
Laughter

2076
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
But the hard thing for me is that

2077
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
I can't, once I recognize

2078
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
a name with a voice

2079
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I can't unrecognize it.

2080
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Do you know what I mean?

2081
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
So I keep, there's characters

2082
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
who I would probably think were kinda crap characters

2083
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
but I love them for the voice actor.

2084
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
I mean

2085
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
there's voice actors that I

2086
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
would love to hear in

2087
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
modern games. I mean

2088
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
God, my youth.

2089
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Oh, is that it?

2090
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
No, I just actually had

2091
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
a moment of nostalgia because

2092
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Chris Latta

2093
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
I would have loved if

2094
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
he was still around.

2095
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Alan

2096
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
you pretty much already said yours

2097
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
any other shout outs you want to give there?

2098
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
Shout out to the voice actor

2099
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
for Hoagie in Day of the Tentacle

2100
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
he was the big kind of chunky

2101
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
rock and roll dude with Bernard

2102
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
and the way that

2103
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
that voice was delivered was very

2104
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I guess against type where he sounded

2105
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
sort of like the rich snotty

2106
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
dude on Gilligan's Island. That's in the early

2107
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
days of voice acting too because voice

2108
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
acting showed up on computers way before

2109
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
there was the CD talky version that was

2110
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
ten dollars more when these people just got it on

2111
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
three and a half diskette.

2112
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
So that, the way that character was done

2113
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
I really like. And then

2114
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
for his weird, bullshitty

2115
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
sort of fairy tale Xanadu

2116
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
the green ending in

2117
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Mass Effect 3 is with the whole Shangri-La

2118
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
and everyone. Oh my God.

2119
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
The monologue that Edie gives

2120
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
is incredible. Oh my God.

2121
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
Trisha Helfer

2122
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Six from Battlestar Galactica

2123
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Yes.

2124
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Like, you will be moved

2125
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
to tears. Like, it's so good. She's so

2126
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
good. Oh my God.

2127
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
And I was going to say, Balthier

2128
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
probably would have been mine, but for newer

2129
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
performances go, like, you know, again

2130
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
here I go, fanboy, but seriously

2131
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
one of my favorite performances

2132
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Sivan Hewlett, who does

2133
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Yasael in Final Fantasy 14

2134
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
He was going to say Yasael in Heaven's

2135
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
World is great. Oh my God. She is

2136
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
so good. And some of the

2137
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
scenes in Heaven's World with her

2138
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
wow. That's all I'm

2139
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
going to say. I don't want to spoil, but wow.

2140
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I am going to, though, bring up

2141
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
actually a pair of performances because they're in

2142
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
the same game.

2143
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
OK. I had really high

2144
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
standards for the Berserk games

2145
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
as in Berserk as in

2146
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
from the manga and anime

2147
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
you know, with Gatsu and everything

2148
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
because one of my favorite Japanese voice

2149
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
actors was Gatsu

2150
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Great. Now I can't

2151
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
say his name, but he was also

2152
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Toski in Fushigi Yugi

2153
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
and who else did

2154
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Basara in

2155
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Macross 7 and

2156
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
why can't

2157
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
Nobutoshi

2158
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
first name. Anyway, so

2159
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
I was like, OK, I'm not going to like the

2160
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
US version of Berserk. I'm not going to like it. I'm not going to like

2161
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
I'm not going to like it. And then I heard Michael

2162
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Bell. I was like

2163
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
and then I heard BJ Ward and I'm like

2164
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
I was like

2165
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
it's like Voltron in a

2166
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
different universe. My brains, I can't shut

2167
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
them off. So, yeah.

2168
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
And I actually have to think

2169
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
S.J. 100 Matt for bringing up Tim Curry

2170
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
doing voice actors. Yeah, I was just going to say

2171
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
S.J. 100 Matt, let's not forget the various

2172
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
roles Tim Curry did. Honestly,

2173
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
you just won right there. And Nolan

2174
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
North. That's it. Nolan North. There's nothing

2175
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
else to say after Tim Curry. Our Deadpool.

2176
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Nothing else to say. Tim Curry

2177
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
the end. Rob.

2178
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
What?

2179
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Ah, Tim Curry.

2180
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
Alright, let's get back into some more. He was the first

2181
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
man that ever scared me in a movie.

2182
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Oh, what? As Darkness or It?

2183
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Legend. It was all legend.

2184
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Or Rooster in Annie.

2185
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
No, it was

2186
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Legend.

2187
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Alright. We're going to get back

2188
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
to some gaming news and then of course your phone calls

2189
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
coming up in a little while. 1877 Game OLR

2190
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio

2191
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
all one word. But some more gaming news

2192
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
to get out there. Alan. As we like to say

2193
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
on OLR, hackers going to hack.

2194
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Not necessarily

2195
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
the standard usage for that phrase

2196
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
with this story. But a third party

2197
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
has come out with

2198
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
a little device which I imagine

2199
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
is going to be sued

2200
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
into the atmosphere and stripped off

2201
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
the face of the earth. They have a little

2202
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
neat device called the Amico.

2203
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Or Ami-quo. It's A-M-I-I-Q-O.

2204
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
The price

2205
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
given is

2206
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
49.75 pounds. So I

2207
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
believe it is a European creation.

2208
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
I think that's what? 60 or 70 bucks

2209
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
American. What this thing

2210
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
does, and why it's going

2211
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
to be probably blasted off the face of the earth

2212
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
is a lot of people

2213
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
when the Ami-Bos, the little Wii U

2214
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
figures were announced, a lot of people were upset

2215
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
that they can only store data for one game at a time.

2216
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
So if you have your Princess Peach

2217
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Amiibo, you can have your Smash

2218
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
your custom Peach Smash character on

2219
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
the figure. Or

2220
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
you can have your custom Peach Mario Kart

2221
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
on the figure. What this thing does

2222
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
is it lets you, you also have to

2223
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
have an NFC compatible

2224
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Android device

2225
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
like any Samsung phone from the past three years

2226
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
to interact with this

2227
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
thing. What it does is it lets you

2228
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
back up those

2229
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
NFC

2230
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
or ARFID, whatever, the

2231
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
little data that is on the

2232
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Amiibo. You can back it up so you can

2233
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
not have to buy the Fireball Mario

2234
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
versus the regular doing the

2235
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Mario pose Amiibo because they have three different

2236
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Mario ones now. You can

2237
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
just swap out the data using this device

2238
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
and not

2239
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
have to go completely bankrupt on Amiibos.

2240
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Also, and this is the

2241
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
big, the real big one,

2242
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
it lets you download

2243
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Amiibo

2244
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
character profiles like the

2245
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
unique identifier for NES, the unique identifier

2246
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
for Pac-Man. And it lets

2247
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
you emulate that so

2248
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
that when you put it on the Wii U

2249
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
pad, it'll think that you have

2250
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
whatever character that is and it'll unlock

2251
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
whatever goodies.

2252
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
It honestly doesn't surprise me

2253
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
that

2254
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
something like this happened.

2255
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I'm surprised it took

2256
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
this long, honestly. I'm surprised

2257
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
it's not on the phone because of all the near-field

2258
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
stuff on the phone.

2259
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
So this is just

2260
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
an interesting thing.

2261
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Yeah.

2262
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
So each

2263
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Amiibo device comes preloaded with

2264
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
data for 10 figurines

2265
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
and 200 figurines can be stored

2266
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
in it in total.

2267
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
The downside, of course, is you don't get the figurines

2268
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
themselves, but

2269
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
I would think that if you sought out this device

2270
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
and purchased one, you knew exactly what you were

2271
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
doing and what you were going to use it for.

2272
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
That means your figurines can stay

2273
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
on your shelf and look pretty forever.

2274
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
When was the last time there was a sort of

2275
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
bootleg device like this?

2276
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
What if we needed

2277
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
one like that? Because

2278
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
usually peripherals, they don't

2279
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
really need to be... I keep thinking back

2280
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
to the Ninja Pass and the

2281
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
loaders.

2282
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
3DS loaders, yeah.

2283
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
3DS loader, exactly.

2284
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Alright. Well, moving

2285
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
on to a story. I just have to bring this up in chat

2286
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
because this is so hilarious what's happening right now.

2287
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Oh, act deaf.

2288
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
SS2-100 Matt, because we brought up

2289
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Tim Curry a minute ago, right? And what a

2290
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
legend he is just in everything

2291
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
but that he also did voice acting against.

2292
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
Oh, come on. I can watch the worst witch on repeat

2293
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
because of him. SS2-100 Matt brought up in chat.

2294
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Oh, my God. I just realized Greg Berger

2295
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
worked with Tim Curry on

2296
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Real Monsters. We had someone on the show

2297
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
who worked with Tim Curry and that just made me

2298
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
realize I has failed you as an interviewer

2299
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
in every possible way. You didn't fail.

2300
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
No, I completely failed. But here

2301
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
it is. Gray Knight

2302
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
potentially saving the day in our

2303
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
chat room over hearing all this saying, did you want me to

2304
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
ask Greg another question for you?

2305
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
And I was like,

2306
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
yes.

2307
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Yes, please.

2308
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
I just need to find the old

2309
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Rocky pictures of you in the corset.

2310
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Or not. Maybe

2311
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
some things our listeners don't need to see.

2312
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
It's a radio show. Let's leave

2313
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
it that way.

2314
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
Why did you say that

2315
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
on air? I hate you.

2316
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
People don't know that you've been Frank

2317
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
before, Rob.

2318
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Gray Knight says,

2319
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
what do you want me to ask him?

2320
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Okay, because we just know

2321
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
that we had a connection with someone on the show

2322
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
who worked with Tim Curry.

2323
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
I think the question would be what?

2324
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
Did you get to meet

2325
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
him?

2326
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
How was

2327
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
working with Tim Curry, I guess.

2328
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
But then I worry that it was the whole thing where they were

2329
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
isolated in the booths and he's going to come back and say

2330
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I never got to meet the guy because we all did

2331
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
our stuff at the same time.

2332
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
That's not a game.

2333
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
It doesn't matter. Oh yes, right.

2334
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Cartoons are sometimes a group reading.

2335
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
We're going to gamble. Did you get to meet him?

2336
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
And if so, just

2337
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
literally tell us anything about Tim Curry because we all

2338
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
worship him here at OLR.

2339
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
And in life.

2340
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Is there anybody out there who doesn't worship

2341
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Tim Curry? If so, I need you to

2342
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
stop listening.

2343
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2344
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Just to comment on what Dungeon Buster said about

2345
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Tim Curry as Gabriel Knight in the

2346
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Sierra Adventure Game Classic.

2347
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Which wasn't Roberta Williams.

2348
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
It was another woman

2349
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
who wrote that.

2350
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
I've played that game.

2351
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Tim Curry is incredible as Gabriel Knight.

2352
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
However, the fact that

2353
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
Gabriel Knight is supposed to be

2354
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
a creole womanizing

2355
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
20-something with a thick New Orleans accent.

2356
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Tim Curry was a very

2357
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
strange choice

2358
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
because his attempt at a New Orleans accent

2359
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
isn't the best.

2360
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
He's still great as Gabriel Knight, but that was just weird

2361
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
casting.

2362
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Alright.

2363
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Let's move on to talking about this story here.

2364
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
About Windows 10.

2365
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
You know, a lot of you guys have been upgrading your

2366
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
devices to Windows 10.

2367
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
You know, because they're giving it away now

2368
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
that they are competing with Apple on that front

2369
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
who also gives them away.

2370
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Windows 10, apparently

2371
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
not playing nice with

2372
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
some DRM. The infamous

2373
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Secure ROM having issues

2374
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
in Windows 10, as is SafeDisk.

2375
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Now, Microsoft

2376
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
is saying everything that ran in Windows 7

2377
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
I'm sorry, this isn't the company,

2378
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
but Microsoft's Boris Schneider

2379
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
John, who is

2380
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
being interviewed at Gamescom,

2381
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
saying, everything that

2382
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
ran in Windows 7 should also run in

2383
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Windows 10. There are just two silly exceptions.

2384
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Antivirus software and stuff that's

2385
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
deeply embedded into the system.

2386
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
And there are old games on CD-ROM that have

2387
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
DRM. This DRM stuff is also

2388
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
deeply embedded in your system.

2389
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
And that's where Windows 10 says, sorry,

2390
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
we can't allow that because that would be a

2391
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
possible loophole for computer viruses.

2392
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
That's why there's a couple games from

2393
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
2003 to 2008 with Secure ROM that

2394
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
don't run without no CD patches and such.

2395
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
We can just not

2396
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
support that if it's a possible danger for

2397
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
our users. There are a couple patches from

2398
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
developers already and there's stuff like good old games

2399
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
where you'll find versions of those games

2400
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
that work. So, this

2401
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
is also in response to, I think, a lot of those

2402
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
sensational headlines

2403
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
that were out last week that Windows 10 is gonna

2404
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
sneak into your house in the middle of the night and

2405
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
install all your pirated software and things like

2406
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
that. And in reality, there's

2407
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
nothing in the user license agreement

2408
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
that wasn't already there before.

2409
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
But

2410
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
we all know that Secure ROM and all that

2411
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
DRM stuff was way too restrictive and terrible

2412
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
so it's no surprise that it's

2413
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
already broken as

2414
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Microsoft regulates heavier

2415
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
which you can and can't do.

2416
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us next?

2417
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Stuff and things. In this case,

2418
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
some UK news because we like to

2419
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
give some attention to our friends

2420
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
overseas. The UK

2421
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Committee of Advertising Practice

2422
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
which is pretty much a watchdog agency

2423
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
for advertising rules

2424
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
and making sure they're enforced

2425
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
has put out official

2426
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
guidance for video game

2427
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
content makers that take

2428
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
payments to promote

2429
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
products in their game. Basically,

2430
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
it's controlling product placement.

2431
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
So, you know, when you're driving along in your

2432
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
racing game and you see a Valvoline

2433
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
ad for it, they're

2434
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
going to be the watchers for this in the

2435
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
UK. So in the new rules,

2436
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
basically, you can't

2437
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
endorse or

2438
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
promote a product that

2439
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
has been paid without offering a

2440
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
full and highly visible

2441
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
disclosure. So basically,

2442
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
if you take the money for the product

2443
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
and

2444
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
the ad is there, it has to

2445
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
be marked as such.

2446
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
So this is

2447
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
really going in after an

2448
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
advertising standards authority investigation

2449
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
basically found that content

2450
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
creators were failing to properly

2451
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
disclose that they had been paid to

2452
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
promote the products.

2453
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
So,

2454
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
yeah, it's got to be fully

2455
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
in place on there now.

2456
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
However,

2457
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
it has said that

2458
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
YouTubers basically

2459
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
who are doing streaming content, they don't

2460
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
have to say anything about

2461
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
that because

2462
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
they didn't pay for the content.

2463
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
However, YouTubers that are

2464
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
being paid to promote the games,

2465
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
they need to be

2466
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
upfront and say, we were paid

2467
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
to play this and review it.

2468
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Interesting.

2469
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
You know, and the YouTube gaming is just going to

2470
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
get bigger and bigger. You know, I thought their dedicated

2471
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
gaming thing was supposed to launch by now. Maybe

2472
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
I thought it was late August. Maybe it was September.

2473
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
But I think that's just, there's

2474
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
heavy, heavy rumors too. You know,

2475
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
rumor, can of salt, that

2476
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
the next PlayStation 4 firmware

2477
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
that's coming out towards the end of the year will

2478
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
stream to YouTube gaming

2479
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
when that is all worked out. So maybe they're

2480
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
waiting on that. I don't know. Anyway, sorry.

2481
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Interesting timing with

2482
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
what you're saying. Well, there have been,

2483
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
there was kind of a stink going

2484
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
on around that about Twitch players

2485
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
and folks on YouTube and whatnot who

2486
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
were live reviewing

2487
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
or doing reviews of games, you know,

2488
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
without saying, well, hey,

2489
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
we were given a promo

2490
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
copy of this or so and so.

2491
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
I

2492
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
personally would like to know up front, by the

2493
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
way, if someone is reviewing a promotional

2494
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
copy and

2495
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
that they say up front, I am,

2496
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
this is an unbiased review

2497
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
of whatever the

2498
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
hell game this is. And

2499
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
just so y'all know, over at vognetwork.com

2500
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
where we do have reviews,

2501
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Eric RPG's been posting a lot of

2502
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
cool video game reviews. In fact, he just

2503
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
did the Oni Chimbara sequel just

2504
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
today that went up. And we always do say, we

2505
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
say it at the end, we don't say it at the beginning, but it's there

2506
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
in the same size font and everything else. And it

2507
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
actually says how we got the game. Did we

2508
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
get a code? Did we, you know,

2509
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
and if for whatever reason we were

2510
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
actually paid to play a game, that never happened,

2511
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
but if it happened, it would be there.

2512
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
It would be there. Yes. Now,

2513
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
I've been paid to break

2514
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
software. Now,

2515
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
before we get to the next story, this is

2516
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
very important. Uh oh.

2517
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
Tonight has come back with an answer

2518
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
from Greg.

2519
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Frequently, I worked with

2520
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Tim Curry on Ah, Real

2521
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Monsters and Duckman.

2522
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
So you guys,

2523
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
it's official.

2524
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
We here at Orange Lounge Radio,

2525
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
as of tonight, are two

2526
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
degrees of separation from Tim Curry.

2527
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
I

2528
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
need a minute. Rob's a little

2529
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
verklempt. You thought you fan-boyed

2530
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
over the... Talk amongst yourselves. You thought you fan-boyed

2531
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
over the Grimlock thing.

2532
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
I'll give you a topic. My love

2533
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
for Tim Curry is

2534
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
very, very deep.

2535
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Really? Tell us how you really feel.

2536
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
Don't take it to a dirty place.

2537
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
I didn't! I've loved him

2538
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
since I was in grade school, so don't make it

2539
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
dirty. Wadsworth and Clue,

2540
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
there it is.

2541
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Oh my gosh. Yes, the answer

2542
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
is yes.

2543
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Great. Would you like to

2544
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
interview Tim Curry? If his health is up to it.

2545
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Yes, if his health is up to it. That's the most

2546
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
important thing in the world, is his health.

2547
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Because he is a national treasure and must be protected.

2548
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
But if he's up to it...

2549
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
I have to say it was

2550
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
actually a little heartbreaking to see

2551
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
the pictures that came out after

2552
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
his recovery. My dad

2553
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
had a stroke.

2554
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
I just was...

2555
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
It's sort of when you know someone

2556
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
who's been through that and then you see someone

2557
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
who's been an icon of

2558
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
most of your life suffering

2559
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
through the same thing, it's sort of

2560
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
the empathy level is there.

2561
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
I will say

2562
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
this as well though is that

2563
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
people can also make great

2564
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
recoveries. Like Nichelle Nichols

2565
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
going to be at Dragon Con. She had that.

2566
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
And

2567
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
Tracy Morgan from 30 Rock

2568
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
was in that horrific car accident in New Jersey.

2569
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Was in rehab,

2570
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
physical rehabilitation, not the other type of rehab

2571
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
that a lot of people used to go to. And he's actually going to be

2572
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
doing Saturday Night Live in October and that's fantastic to see.

2573
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
So...

2574
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
SSJ 100 Matt says, I'm happy I derailed

2575
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
the show for this. Oh and that's really

2576
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
good. Gray Knight says

2577
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Charlie Adler is very good

2578
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
friends with him. Tim is doing fairly well

2579
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
to my knowledge. Yeah.

2580
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
I think that could be like

2581
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
a lifetime goal up there.

2582
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
I actually have done a bit of

2583
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
design work for a few

2584
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
stroke survivor and

2585
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
therapy non-profits.

2586
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
My...

2587
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
I'll just go ahead and say this right now. I lost

2588
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
my maternal grandmother

2589
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
after complications from several

2590
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
strokes and my dad is in a nursing

2591
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
home right now. I think you've

2592
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
mentioned some of this in prior episodes.

2593
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
This is what you've been dealing with this year.

2594
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
Anyone who has

2595
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
been through that and recovers from it

2596
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
it takes a lot

2597
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
of determination so

2598
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
it's kind of a big thing for me.

2599
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
Sure. I understand. Anyhow,

2600
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I'm going to try my best not to just lose it

2601
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
and fanboy out right now.

2602
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
My people will have to talk to your people. Good sir.

2603
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
In the interest of

2604
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
the utmost professionalism, I must move

2605
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
on with more gaming news.

2606
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Alan, you've got more for us.

2607
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
This story is near and dear to my heart.

2608
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
A

2609
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
creator named Thomas Cole has released

2610
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
a fan game

2611
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
called Halfline. It is a

2612
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
mashup of Half Life 2 and Hotline

2613
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Miami. It has the graphical

2614
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
8 slash 16 bit style

2615
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
of Hotline Miami, the top

2616
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
down isometric view and the incredibly

2617
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
fast paced

2618
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
sort of

2619
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
tank control run and gun action as

2620
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Hotline Miami except the

2621
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
sprites and the overall

2622
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
levels are

2623
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
basically follow the story of Half Life 2.

2624
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
The first one is the train station

2625
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
and then I imagine you go to the

2626
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
prison. You can

2627
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
download it on

2628
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
I think it's

2629
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
itch.io

2630
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
itch.io

2631
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
just

2632
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
google

2633
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
Halfline

2634
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
fan game

2635
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
and check it out. I'm definitely going to

2636
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
get it before it disappears.

2637
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Before it gets cease and desisted. Yeah.

2638
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
Like all the good ones do, right?

2639
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Alright, well the Game Awards

2640
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
was an experimental thing that happened

2641
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
last year and it was

2642
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
it was okay. I mean it was

2643
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
it had some flaws but for a

2644
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
first year thing it really, it could have been a lot

2645
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
worse. Let's put it that way.

2646
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Excuse me.

2647
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
It is happening

2648
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
again this year and

2649
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
apparently this, I don't know

2650
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
why it's making the rounds on game blogs this week

2651
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
because I think it was announced in June

2652
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
but now all the news sites are

2653
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
picking up on it because it was tweeted

2654
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
that the Game Awards 2015

2655
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
are coming this December and

2656
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
stay tuned for more news soon

2657
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
and that was on the official Twitter.

2658
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
I think the problem was the news came

2659
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
out during E3 so most people

2660
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
missed it there so we'll see

2661
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
if they make some of the improvements this year. I got to say

2662
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
it was really awkward the whole like

2663
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
I'm going to interview you and then oh hey you won

2664
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
this award. I'm just going to pull this out of my jacket. You got

2665
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
an award too. I understand they got to keep

2666
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
it moving quickly but then

2667
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
there were some things they did right

2668
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
like the tribute to

2669
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
Roberta Williams and that

2670
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
whole, that was fantastic.

2671
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
So there's

2672
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
there's room for improvement

2673
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
but it could have been a lot worse.

2674
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
Anyhow it's time to get to the mailbag

2675
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
every week Dark Soccer jumps into the mailbag

2676
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
but was there

2677
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
anything to be found this week?

2678
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
Not a damn thing.

2679
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
I'm actually sad.

2680
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
At this point I would

2681
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
take Ross till UT sending an email.

2682
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Oh stop. You like reading his

2683
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
emails. I do like reading his emails.

2684
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
Um.

2685
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
Well that's it. Kill the music.

2686
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
No. No emails.

2687
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
No.

2688
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Now it's gotten to the point. See usually Dark Soccer

2689
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
is like I don't want to work but now

2690
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
it's been so many weeks.

2691
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
Dear Rob. Dear me.

2692
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
Jamie is the best

2693
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
email reader in the universe

2694
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
and bite my butt.

2695
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Love Jamie.

2696
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
P.S.

2697
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
Alright

2698
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
well this seems like an appropriate

2699
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
transition to get into a reoccurring

2700
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
segment we do every week here on Orange

2701
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Lounge Radio. Why?

2702
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
I don't know because we got feelings and stuff.

2703
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
It's the FUs of the week time.

2704
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Dark Soccer?

2705
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
FU to the person who

2706
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
was doing

2707
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
how fast were they going?

2708
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
30 in a 45 zone

2709
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
because drivers

2710
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
and

2711
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
FU

2712
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
to situations.

2713
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Um.

2714
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Not going into a lot of detail.

2715
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Pretty personal.

2716
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
But

2717
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
situations.

2718
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
Uh. Alan you want to go next with your FU of the week?

2719
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
Sure.

2720
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
FU to work not having

2721
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
very many hours.

2722
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
Um. Not really.

2723
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
FU to not paying attention to your diet

2724
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
and what you eat and how active you've been and then

2725
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
gaining weight because that's what happens when you

2726
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
do those things. And FU to

2727
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
being kind of starving because you forgot

2728
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
to eat lunch and I make star dinner after

2729
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
my last story. Alright that's fair.

2730
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
It's going to be spaghetti. That's fair.

2731
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Mmm spaghetti. Uh.

2732
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
My FU of the week. Actually you know I talked about

2733
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
my big personal change last week on the

2734
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
show and I have nothing bad

2735
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
to say about that. Everything

2736
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
my send off at my prior job

2737
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
everybody was fantastic and

2738
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
it was really more than I could ask for.

2739
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
And I'm really excited about

2740
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
the prospect of new jobs so how can I possibly

2741
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
be mad at any of that right now? I'm

2742
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
actually have nothing to say negative at all.

2743
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
So I guess I'm going to give like a completely

2744
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
like not serious

2745
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
like tongue in cheek FU and I'm just going to

2746
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
say FU to

2747
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
the blue team at Ingress who have been

2748
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
stepping up the pressure lately and Megan Allen

2749
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
and I actually work harder. Do I need to download

2750
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
that game again? Yes play with us.

2751
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Play with us. But I

2752
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
deleted it because I needed the brain.

2753
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
Enlighten the planet Dark Saga. Being real

2754
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Jamie I wouldn't worry about it.

2755
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Yeah.

2756
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Because like it was funny that Konami thing is like

2757
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
how often do you play games

2758
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
on this device? Well on

2759
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
your mobile phone I'm like I play Bejeweled.

2760
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
No I don't. You got to do your Bejeweled

2761
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
daily. As much

2762
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
shit as you all give me for it which is fine it's

2763
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
deserved. I do get hardcore about it but I get hardcore

2764
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
a lot about a lot of MMOs.

2765
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
I do more exercise because of that game

2766
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
period. It has impacted me

2767
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
positively in that regard. If Ingress

2768
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
actually did have the functionality to use my

2769
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
Apple Watch I would probably play it a lot more.

2770
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
See because they're a Google company it works

2771
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
with the other watch but I don't think the

2772
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
Apple Watch works yet.

2773
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
It's probably coming though. Actually with

2774
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
the Google alphabet thing

2775
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
and the antique who made Ingress is now

2776
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
separate from Google. So that may

2777
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
happen in the future.

2778
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
That and WatchOS

2779
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
2.0 is out eventually.

2780
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
It's in testing right now.

2781
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
I mean the open beta is for it.

2782
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
Gotcha. And for those

2783
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
listening. I didn't really mean that.

2784
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
I mean just

2785
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
in case you happen to be a blue player that's

2786
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
listening it's whatever.

2787
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
It's just a game for fuck's sake.

2788
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
But I can still get huffy and puffy.

2789
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
Evidence that Rob

2790
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
is really into this game.

2791
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Blow your portal over. Two weeks ago or

2792
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
last weekend he asked us

2793
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
so Alan would you judge me if

2794
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
I agreed to do an op.

2795
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
And an op in Ingress is when a bunch of people

2796
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
go out because it's a GPS game.

2797
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
So you have to go out to the location to do whatever

2798
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
stuff you want to do. Would you be mad

2799
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
if I went and did an Ingress op at 3 AM

2800
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
on Saturday?

2801
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
And I was like I'll judge you a little bit

2802
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
but you do you girl.

2803
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
You do what you want. The late night

2804
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
stuff is fun. And they do it at

2805
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
3 AM because obviously

2806
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
anyone with sense is asleep.

2807
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
So whatever

2808
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
you choose. When I was

2809
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
kind of playing

2810
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
I did go over to Dad's

2811
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
kitchen in Folsom and saw

2812
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
the bottle cap bench

2813
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
that is like one of their landmark

2814
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
whatever the hell it is.

2815
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
And I rubbed my butt on it.

2816
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Because it was the other team.

2817
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
I

2818
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
I

2819
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
because I wasn't high enough to attack

2820
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
or do anything.

2821
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
And then I was like and

2822
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Dan's like what are you doing as like

2823
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
I'm just rubbing my butt on this portal.

2824
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I was like I did it at

2825
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
a spike.

2826
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
And I think that was when

2827
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
I finally stopped playing. I know exactly

2828
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
what portal that is.

2829
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
And exactly yeah

2830
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
that portal is usually blue for reasons

2831
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
but it's oh my god I'm dying.

2832
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
I'm dying. I thought that you would

2833
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
appreciate that story. And I said it

2834
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
live on air. Thank you.

2835
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
So that you would stop fangirling over

2836
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Tim Curry. All right. Thank you.

2837
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
I appreciate you taking my mind off Tim Curry

2838
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
with your assing of portals.

2839
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
All right.

2840
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys.

2841
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at

2842
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
1877 Game OLR. Our username

2843
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
on Skype Orange Lounge Radio.

2844
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Alan? Is it me? Yeah.

2845
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
OK. So. Is it me? It's you?

2846
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
I try

2847
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
not to be a petty person but

2848
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
sometimes it's a lot of fun.

2849
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Shut up.

2850
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
So someone noticed

2851
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
that at JB Hi-Fi

2852
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
which is a retailer in Australia

2853
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
someone who worked at that

2854
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
store did their own

2855
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
little banner

2856
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
for their shelf that has

2857
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
pre-order copies of Metal Gear

2858
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
Solid 5 The Phantom Pain.

2859
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Someone put on it

2860
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
it's a Hideo Kojima

2861
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
game because

2862
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Konami or as I like to refer to them

2863
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
as toilet clowns

2864
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
they

2865
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
they are trying to do some weird

2866
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Jason Bourne Men in Black

2867
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
number six I'm not a number I am a free man

2868
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
sort of thing

2869
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
Hideo Kojima who's that?

2870
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
We don't like him. He's gone.

2871
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Just strip the name off. So this

2872
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
this petty video game employee

2873
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
put up their own

2874
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Who's one of your heroes?

2875
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
For this? Yeah.

2876
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
So just put up hey this is a Hideo Kojima game

2877
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
and Kojima caught wind of it on

2878
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
Twitter and retweeted it

2879
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
and was like oh yes it is nice

2880
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
for me to get some

2881
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
credit and notoriety that I did in fact

2882
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
make this game. Ooh shade.

2883
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
That's pretty good.

2884
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
So petty, petty, petty

2885
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
but people can be as petty as they

2886
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
want to Konami. So.

2887
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
SSG100Matt in chat says what a

2888
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
rant by Alan and Act F says

2889
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
and you were worried Alan wouldn't fill the rant quota.

2890
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
There

2891
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
it is. Congratulations there Alan.

2892
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
Yes. Speaking of um

2893
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
shade throwing we gotta talk about our fries

2894
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
trivia today. I'm gonna go ahead and uh

2895
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
oh wait shit I got one more story. Hold this thought

2896
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
we're gonna talk about shade throwing

2897
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
right after I talk about this

2898
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
which is just gonna make you

2899
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
well actually this might make you happy.

2900
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
It's gonna make you angry because

2901
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
we're gonna talk about Silent Hills yet again

2902
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
and how it's not happening but

2903
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
do you remember that somebody

2904
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
remade PT and called it

2905
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Allison Road? They actually

2906
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
kind of remade that PT demo and it was

2907
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
inspired by that. Well now

2908
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
That was named something different

2909
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
cause I still have the freaking installer for it

2910
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
on my Mac. Well

2911
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
It was a punity.

2912
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Oh there was that too.

2913
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
This is something else. This is something different.

2914
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
But uh Allison Road has actually gone

2915
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
to what else? Kickstarter

2916
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
Hey y'all figure

2917
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
PT would end up on Kickstarter. Kojima

2918
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
and Yomototaro will end up on Kickstarter at some point

2919
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
so the folks behind

2920
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Allison Road have actually gone to Kickstarter

2921
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
and they are looking to fully

2922
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
realize their game

2923
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
that started as a PT

2924
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
clone essentially. You need to get more

2925
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
information AllisonRoadgame.com

2926
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
I'm gonna have to see if we can get them on the show. I think it'll be fun

2927
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
to talk about. This will take

2928
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
my Kickstarter virginity. Really?

2929
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Hell yeah.

2930
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Alright. I'm gonna go ahead and open up the

2931
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Skype line 1877 game OLR

2932
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
or a username on Skype orange lounge radio

2933
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
all one word. Can we talk about fries? Yes

2934
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
Can we talk about the fries trip and the hilarious

2935
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
thing we saw there? Go ahead. You're a better story

2936
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
teller than me. Go ahead. So obviously

2937
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
this was just a coincidence

2938
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
of them being in between

2939
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
uh moving inventory

2940
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
around. No it was on purpose. Okay it was

2941
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
on purpose. So in the video

2942
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
game section one aisle over

2943
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
the header where on every

2944
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
shelf there's a little thing that tells you what should be on

2945
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
that shelf. At the top there was the

2946
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Xbox 360 logo and it said

2947
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
360 or Xbox 360

2948
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
accessories except what was

2949
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
actually on the shelf were those little

2950
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
like in a corporate environment when

2951
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
you have your office desk the little trash

2952
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
can. It was trash cans.

2953
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
So they were saying Xbox 360

2954
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
accessories aka trash bins

2955
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
put your 360 in the garbage. I think

2956
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
was the subtext

2957
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
there. Yes. And we

2958
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
saw it and had a good laugh and you

2959
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
put a picture on Twitter. I did at my personal

2960
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Twitter. Twitter.com slash SKIE

2961
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
I actually was sky SKIE I actually put

2962
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
a picture of the Xbox

2963
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
360 accessories trash but then also

2964
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
like Shane pointed out Shane was with us

2965
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
like just next to that it was something like

2966
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
um Xbox like regular

2967
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
accessories and it was a bunch of frozen

2968
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
lunch pails or something

2969
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
so I was like frozen

2970
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
everything. Frozen has gone too far

2971
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
too far this time

2972
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
anyway again the skype line is

2973
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
open 1877 game

2974
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
olr or username on skype orange

2975
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
lounge radio

2976
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Brad from pod culture saying

2977
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
that toilet clowns is the name of my

2978
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
band and rock band well it will be

2979
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
anyway so there you go

2980
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
look at that Alan inspiring

2981
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
people's future rock band

2982
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
the real reginator wasn't Allison

2983
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
wrote a gin blossom song it might have been

2984
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
actually yes it was

2985
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
alright well

2986
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
looks like folks are being a little bit shy on

2987
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
our skype line tonight you know sometimes we get 20 people

2988
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
fighting over the phones tonight it looks

2989
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
a little empty I guess I guess people don't want to follow

2990
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
the Alan rant or the great interview we had

2991
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000

3002
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
I think sometimes we like to take some random

02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000

3012
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
answers but keep it clean keep it classy

3013
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
you know who else would be cool to interview

3014
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
random questions for no reason at all

3015
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
other than awesome Betty

3016
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
White

3017
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
I could die

3018
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
what video game did she do?

3019
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
she did everything awesome at least

3020
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Tim Curry did have some gaming

3021
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
experience even though I don't know I was just randomly

3022
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
thinking about Betty White because I was thinking

3023
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
about cheesecake

3024
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
she did some voice over work for the golden girls

3025
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,000
RTS

3026
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000
there is no golden girls RTS

3027
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
there should be

3028
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000
absolutely

3029
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
actdeft in our chat room is asking the

3030
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
quintessential ASL

3031
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
37

3032
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
as often as I can

3033
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
SSJ100Matt asks

3034
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
what three people would you want in your foxhole

3035
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000
Foxhole's

3036
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,000
taking it back to World War 1

3037
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000
I think that sounds dirty

3038
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
a foxhole sounds like

3039
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
forget the Collins we need to

3040
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
do an ask Orange Lounge

3041
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
that's what I was kind of getting at

3042
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
we need to do an official ask Orange Lounge

3043
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
an official ask Orange Lounge

3044
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
but we're barely

3045
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
getting any questions

3046
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
as it is

3047
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
fine I have a question

3048
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
what

3049
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
can we get cheesecake

3050
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
not this late I start a new job tomorrow

3051
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
girl

3052
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
it's never too late for cheesecake

3053
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
SSJ100Matt is confirming that is

3054
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
the World War 1 saying

3055
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
so what three people would you want in your foxhole

3056
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
it just sounds dirty

3057
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
who do you want in your

3058
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
foxhole

3059
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
all I'm thinking are like

3060
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
of like

3061
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
I'm just thinking of names of like really good looking actors

3062
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
I know because that's where my mind

3063
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
goes I go Chris Pine

3064
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
Zachary Quinto

3065
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
you know what just the cast of Star Trek

3066
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
just put the entire cast of Star Trek

3067
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
I would want

3068
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Neil deGrasse Tyson

3069
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
Bill Nye

3070
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
and

3071
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
Laverne Cox

3072
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Act Deft is asking a question

3073
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
okay so if you could have a video game item

3074
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
any video game item

3075
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
which one would you want

3076
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
so are we talking like a video game item

3077
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
in real life

3078
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
like a hook shot I'm assuming that's what it means

3079
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
if you could have a video game item in real life

3080
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
what would you want

3081
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
gravity gun

3082
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
a portal gun

3083
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
yeah but you'll break your legs if you also

3084
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
don't have the long fall boots

3085
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000
fine I want a portal gun and long fall boots

3086
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
I would snap my neck

3087
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
just doing stuff around the house with a portal gun

3088
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
alright let's go to the

3089
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
phones and take a call

3090
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000

3091
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000

3096
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
thank you so much for getting us in touch with

3097
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
them and putting me two degrees from Tim Curry

3098
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000

02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
that was incredible

3100
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
yeah I just called to say hi

3101
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000
so no one was calling

3102
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
and I felt bad and it's been a while

3103
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
and I miss you and we still need to have Rob and Marissa

3104
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
at giggle time

3105
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000
I know that's a future podcast we need to have for sure

3106
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
is the Rob and Marissa giggle time I miss your face

3107
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
you know what's weird I haven't been to LA

3108
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
in like months and months I haven't been to Disneyland in a year

3109
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
I think just with everything going on

3110
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
at my former job that was so busy

3111
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
I just didn't get really down to LA

3112
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
I'm really over due for a trip

3113
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
but now I'm going to be in this new job and I have to focus on that

3114
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
for a while so

3115
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Rob there may be plans early next year by the way

3116
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
early next year I might be able to swing that

3117
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
I might be able to work with that

3118
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
well Marissa you heard all the chat

3119
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
you heard all the chat on voice acting earlier

3120
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
was there anything out of that interview

3121
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
that kind of made you go wow

3122
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
that was a really good point that somebody made

3123
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,000
oh you know

3124
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
I love you anytime I have the opportunity

3125
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:12,000
to hear both of them speak

3126
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,000
it's just always a thrill

3127
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:16,000
and there are wonderful interviews out there

3128
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
on the internet and I've had the pleasure

3129
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,000
I'm not taking classes with Dave yet

3130
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:22,000
I hope to soon but with Greg

3131
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:24,000
and he's an amazing

3132
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:26,000
teacher and just a great

3133
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,000
guy as you can see he's a lot of fun

3134
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
I bet

3135
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
it is true though this gentleman

3136
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
oh no I was just going to say

3137
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
when he was doing the interview I liked how he would

3138
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
slip into some of his voices there

3139
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
as he was doing the interview does he do that when he's teaching too

3140
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
if somebody asks

3141
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
you know he's really wonderful about that

3142
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
he doesn't mind

3143
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
he's just a sweetheart about that

3144
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
and it's been a great thing

3145
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
putting all these classes together because

3146
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
if you're not in town you might not know about it

3147
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
but you know it's like an old

3148
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
LA thing about all sorts of classes

3149
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
you know there's so many things

3150
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
to choose from and it's really nice

3151
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
for these wonderful teachers

3152
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
so although Jamie was actually asking

3153
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
about the strain on your voice

3154
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
and I hear that a lot

3155
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
what they alluded to

3156
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
specifically with video games

3157
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
well you know even

3158
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
I didn't want to make it about me

3159
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
but now I can make it about me because

3160
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
we're old friends and we're at the back

3161
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
of the show but you know I used

3162
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
to MC Rocky Horror Picture Show and other cult

3163
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
movies like Repo and some of

3164
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
that stuff here in Sacramento and

3165
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
even just yelling at Rocky Horror

3166
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
for two hours on end the next day I've come

3167
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
into OLR and you guys go back a couple

3168
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
years in the show I've done OLR sounding

3169
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
like this and it's because of the strain I put on

3170
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
my voice the night before when I was doing

3171
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
Rocky Horror and that's just

3172
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
a couple hours of being loud and obnoxious

3173
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
in front of a cloud of 500 and then

3174
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
you know I'm a teacher by day as

3175
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
well the corporate type

3176
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
and so you know that can put a strain on my voice

3177
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
as well so like I

3178
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
hear you in it but it's one of those things

3179
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
like until David or Gray

3180
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
you know says it like

3181
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
oh yeah my god when they go into those

3182
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
booths there must be like

3183
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
that time when they have to do the war

3184
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
calls and the my character's getting

3185
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
shot and stabbed stuff you know

3186
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
and it's like oh my gosh that's got to be crazy on the

3187
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
voice. Allen?

3188
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Oh yeah especially with a lot of those fantasy

3189
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
games or war games

3190
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
there's an incredible amount I've heard all sorts

3191
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
of interviews and actors talking about

3192
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
you know just streaming for hours

3193
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
I mean you know it depends on the context

3194
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
for example like you know if it's a union

3195
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
job you know they make efforts

3196
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
to try to protect the actors or

3197
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
you know things happen anyway at the job

3198
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
or they try to give them notice but even

3199
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
I had a session you know where I went in and

3200
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
I did no shit about it

3201
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
I was screaming for two hours at the top of my lungs

3202
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
so I mean people try to employ

3203
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
you know various vocal

3204
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
techniques too or you know there are certain

3205
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
ways to scream you know that don't

3206
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
damage your voice as much but you know if it's really

3207
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
emotional you have to try to do it and

3208
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
I guess the best you can try to do is

3209
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
you know like the first

3210
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
time as much as you can I guess

3211
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Alan wanted to jump in here and say something too

3212
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
I've heard from other

3213
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
podcast interviews that a lot of

3214
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
beginning

3215
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
voice actors sort of a rookie mistake they make

3216
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
when they're just starting to get regular work

3217
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
is they will come up with a voice

3218
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
for a character for like a Cartoon

3219
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Network show and they really love

3220
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
the voice that they came up with and they can't wait

3221
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
to show the producer and then when they get

3222
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
in the recording booth it's like oh this voice

3223
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
involves me screaming this voice is totally

3224
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
not sustainable for like a regular character

3225
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
you're absolutely right

3226
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
yeah we hear that a lot

3227
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
or somebody they'll be like at the highest

3228
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
part of their range

3229
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
but you know

3230
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
your voice levels change with emotion

3231
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
so if you're at the highest

3232
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
part of your range you can't go anywhere

3233
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
you know where to go

3234
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
so yeah that's a great point I forget yeah

3235
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
they talk about that a lot too like you have to make

3236
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
sure that you can do it and

3237
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
you're not going to be strained and I see that all

3238
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
the time honestly you know sometimes

3239
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
people got to do these big growly things

3240
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
and they swear that they can do it all day and you can hear

3241
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
you're like no I know you want to take the job

3242
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
but you know you're going to

3243
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
hurt yourself

3244
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
oh my gosh

3245
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
wow I get to answer this question

3246
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
in our chat room again making it about me

3247
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
sorry Marissa but ST100Matt is asking

3248
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
didn't you meet at least

3249
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
didn't you meet at least one

3250
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
cast member from Rocky Horror in

3251
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
your shadow cast years Rob?

3252
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
believe it or not no

3253
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
when I went to the 25th in Vegas

3254
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
years ago this would have been the year 2000

3255
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
I went to the 25th

3256
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
they taped some VH1

3257
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
shows and so I was in the audience

3258
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
they used to have a show called Celebrity Karaoke

3259
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
which is so funny that now there's that

3260
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
lip syncing show on Skype

3261
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
on Spike TV because it's like

3262
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
okay they used to have like karaoke on

3263
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
TV and now it's lip syncing whatever

3264
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
but they did a karaoke thing and

3265
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
Richard O'Brien, Little Nell

3266
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
and Patricia Quinn were all there and in it

3267
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
so we got to see them and that was cool but I didn't get to meet them

3268
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
but here in Sacramento

3269
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
actually we are having a big con coming

3270
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000

02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000

3272
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000

about me but oops I guess I did

3292
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Dragon Con and so we're going to try to make that happen

3293
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
so I am totally okay

3294
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
and me and that actor are working together on a

3295
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
on an audio

3296
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
an audio play you know kind of like a radio

3297
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
drama well that's exactly what it is just in

3298
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
podcast format and that's going

3299
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
that's run by Ben Padme if you

3300
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
remember him he does

3301
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
he wrote even the Jump Leads

3302
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
webcomics in addition to Port

3303
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Center

3304
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
and he's called in a few times

3305
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
those would be a lot of fun to

3306
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
work on I bet you know those

3307
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
types of podcasts I have some friends that do them

3308
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000

3309
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
fun those audio dramas good stuff

3310
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000

bye always good to hear from

3336
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
our pal Marissa here who by the way

3337
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
and you might be wondering

3338
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
well she didn't talk about video games

3339
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
that whole call what's she playing what's she doing

3340
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
she mentioned earlier it doesn't matter because Marissa

3341
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
yeah it doesn't matter because Marissa

3342
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
so F you and B

3343
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
she loves

3344
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
some thief and she actually named earlier

3345
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
in chat I didn't read it on air but she actually said

3346
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
that in

3347
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
the original thief not the new one that's some of

3348
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
her favorite voice acting she's had in a

3349
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
game there so there it is

3350
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
anyhow I think

3351
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
that's going to do it I think we're going to go ahead we're after

3352
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
9 o'clock on the west coast midnight on the east coast

3353
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000

02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000

way as well

3376
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000

it's great when you can join us thank you as I

3382
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
absentmindedly turn my mic

3383
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
off again and then try to speak into it so

3384
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
when you get the technical hurdles figured out

3385
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
you do very well on the program

3386
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
I have a hyperactive thumb apparently

3387
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
uh do you have a final thought for our

3388
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000

3391
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
people can follow you if they like your sense of humor

3392
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
or want to see more uh I don't

3393
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
really update anything that much I'm barely

3394
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000

02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000

you'll hear from him when he

3398
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
goes looking for you that's for sure

3399
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
all right uh let's see my

3400
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
final thought tonight is um

3402
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000

3403
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
thought last but not least dark

3404
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
your final thought for tonight

3405
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
I

3406
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
don't know I think about

3407
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
ice cream

3408
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
mmm ice cream

3409
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
I just want sweet stuff

3410
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
I can't have it

3411
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
all right maybe it'll be a

3412
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
cheat day in your future

3413
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
I had a cheat weekend what are you talking about

3414
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
that's the way to do it

3415
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
the whole thing is that I have to be super good this week

3416
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
because like I said next Sunday

3417
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
well technically it's the

3418
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Tuesday next

3419
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
Tuesday I will have been

3420
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
married to Dan for ten years

3421
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
and haven't set him on fire yet

3422
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
I did scald him once that was an accident

3423
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
all right

3424
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
I want to thank again

3425
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
by the way Andrew Jones

3426
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Greg Berger and

3427
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
David Sobolove

3428
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
for being on our show tonight thank you so

3429
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
much they were great they were so

3430
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
fantastic oh my gosh I'm just like

3431
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:30,000
and it seems like now we've like

3432
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
we've broken the seal and now like

3433
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
there's going to be more voice actors on OLR in the future

3434
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
which I'm super excited about

3435
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
that's awesome because that's like a movie

3436
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
podcast getting actors and actresses

3437
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
so why wouldn't we want voice actors

3438
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
and actresses on our show I can't wait

3439
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
they totally get mad respect

3440
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
for me in fact I have to

3441
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
say that

3442
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Greg was one of the first ones that I actually

3443
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
got an appreciation for versatility

3444
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
of voice acting when I was a kid

3445
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
for that one episode in Transformers

3446
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
where Grimlock gets really smart

3447
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
and I was like

3448
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
is that the same person

3449
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
and as a kid so I think

3450
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
that's sort of what started my fascination with

3451
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
just learning more about it so

3452
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
very cool awesome and yes Dan is definitely

3453
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
the man for me respect

3454
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
respect for

3455
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
voice actors and actresses respect

3456
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
for other gamers keep on

3457
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
respecting we'll see you in seven days on the next

3458
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000

02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
