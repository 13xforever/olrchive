0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	17000	Another gaming event comes to San Francisco. With a mere four and a half months left in the year,
17000	21000	Sony announces that the PlayStation experience will happen this December in San Francisco's Moscone West.
21000	27000	There's this, Disney, Nintendo, and more, and it all starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	46000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with episode number 610 for this, August the 16th of 2015.
46000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, California.
51000	57000	You can find me on Twitter, at SKIE, and over there, joining me in Studio, live as she always does,
57000	64000	say hello to the one and only, at DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers, who just leveled up according to her phone beep up there.
64000	68000	No, that's my husband texting me, because he's weird.
68000	75000	I feel, am I out of place, because I'm like the one person who doesn't have video gaming noises as the text message alerts on the phone.
75000	77000	Well, get with the program.
77000	84000	I know, I need to get with the modern times, I guess. I don't know, I just, I hardly ever have the sound on anyway,
84000	89000	because I hate being that, not that I'm, I'm totally not criticizing you, I'm just going to sound bitchy and it's not,
89000	93000	but I hate being that guy who's like, phone goes off right in the middle of something else.
93000	96000	So it's like, I'm always on vibrate, so I don't know.
96000	105000	It was just like, right at perfect time too. Well, your sound on my phone is the Enkindle This from Blasto.
105000	113000	Oh. In Mass Effect. I thought at one point you had me as, it was either a Golden Girls thing, or it was Shoes from Kelly.
113000	118000	I never had either of those on my phone. I thought for some reason. Your ringtone was, let me borrow that top.
118000	122000	Okay, alright. But now I think I gave you Castlevania. So I was in the right ballpark.
122000	130000	No, Dan is Castlevania on my phone. I was going to give you the Metroid level up. I'll take that.
130000	135000	It was too long to make as your text sound. I'll take that. So I gave you something different.
135000	141000	But like Becky, she has, there's a new message for you at your private terminal.
141000	149000	And then like, Grandpa is the Star Trek communicator sound. And Dan's the one up.
149000	155000	Alan sets all those little text tones on his phone and he has a specific one set up for Ingress.
155000	159000	You know that little GPS game we play? So he actually has one that says...
159000	162000	Does it go NERD?
162000	167000	Oh hi, Techmaster Loki. How are you? Here to make your witty, insightful commentary as always, I see.
167000	168000	I am.
168000	170000	Hold on, I don't know what the hell I have for you.
170000	176000	It does not say nerd. It says, it's Joker from Mass Effect going Commander, we're under attack, or something like that.
176000	182000	So anytime we hear that, it's like, jump, get the phone, recharge, recharge. Somebody's trying to take our nodes.
182000	185000	Okay, your ringtone is Brinstar from Metroid.
185000	190000	Okay, I'm alright with that. When do I ever call you though? Like not to...
190000	191000	You don't?
191000	193000	Well it's text message, but I text you all the time.
193000	197000	Yeah, and because I have my watch now, I usually just voice text back.
197000	202000	There you go. The whole Dick Tracy thing going on there with your little watch. Anyway...
202000	207000	Bold. It's Power Rangers. Use the terminology the kids will understand.
207000	213000	Sorry, excuse me. Back when I was your age, it was all about that Dick Tracy movie with...
213000	220000	I almost said with Dick Tracy. No shit Sherlock. Warren Beatty and Madonna. Remember Madonna? Vogue?
220000	221000	That was Dick Tracy.
221000	222000	That movie was pretty awful.
222000	223000	It was very awful.
223000	228000	But she was amazing because it was Madonna as Breathless Mahoney.
228000	233000	That's right. Anyway, hi chat room. We do tape live every Sunday night, of course.
233000	237000	At the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com. V-O-G network.com.
237000	242000	And if you are listening live, you should be participating in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
242000	245000	Where people are actually talking about their various ringtones.
245000	251000	Act deaf saying, I have Balloon Fight and Super Smash Brothers. 64 sounds for my notifications and stuff.
251000	256000	I think a lot of people, you know, not to bring up, you know, it's still a sore spot for a lot of people,
256000	261000	but with the Iwata passing, you know, a lot of people, I think, did things related to Balloon Fight and Kirby
261000	264000	and some of the things he was very very heavily involved with, as a bit of a tribute.
264000	268000	So, I totally get that. I think that's really cool.
268000	275000	Let's see, TigerClaw says, my phone's ringtone is a dubstep remix of the Zelda theme.
275000	279000	Dare I ask what a dubstep remix of the Zelda theme sounds like?
283000	285000	So I have to pause because I'm gonna have to link this to the chat room.
285000	286000	Okay.
286000	293000	I found the picture, I was looking at the, 15 years ago was the first Teen Choice Award,
293000	305000	and I found the picture of Christina Aguilera that they got the inspiration for Maria in, or was it Mary or Maria?
305000	307000	Either the character in Silent Hill 2.
307000	308000	Mmm.
308000	309000	The outfit.
309000	310000	Okay.
310000	311000	So I'm gonna post that in the chat room.
311000	313000	Alright, that's very random, but okay.
313000	314000	It's video game related, shut up, don't touch me.
315000	320000	Okay, here's the thing. Now I have to give background, because the internet's gonna be like, that woman has Tourette's,
320000	322000	she always just jumps in with something really random.
322000	326000	Before the show, DarkSakura and I were talking live in studio about cosplay.
326000	328000	So now she has cosplay on the brain.
328000	334000	Because I was talking a little bit about how I'm going to do my first, like, major cosplay effort I've ever done.
334000	339000	And, you know, I've dabbled in cosplay, I've experimented with cosplay.
339000	343000	I hung out with cosplay in the closet for two minutes for a little bit.
343000	345000	Coffee with it.
345000	349000	Yeah, when Rama and I, er, Rama loaned me his Black Mage costume.
349000	351000	I wore that around Katsucon many years ago.
351000	353000	And I've done, like, a few things here and there.
353000	356000	But, like, my first, like, actual cosplay, I'm doing a DragonCon.
356000	360000	So if you're gonna be in Atlanta in a few weeks, check that out.
360000	364000	There's gonna be actually some panels on the podcasting track you're gonna wanna check out.
364000	367000	I'm gonna be on a panel about podcasting past, present, and future.
367000	371000	And then Bobby Blackwell's gonna be on another one Monday morning.
371000	376000	And you can hear these all live, and I'll reiterate all this with the times and everything when we get a little closer to the show.
376000	379000	But I will see you there, of course, Labor Day weekend in Atlanta.
379000	387000	So I'm gonna be doing my first cosplay, but I was talking about how, well, I can use this cosplay since, you know, I'm paying good money for it.
387000	390000	I am having it made. A seamstress here locally who does great work.
390000	393000	She's done stuff for the Rocky Horror Group here.
393000	398000	I commissioned her to do it, and we went shopping and bought all the fabric and did all that stuff.
398000	407000	So I said, since I'm putting money in this, I'm gonna use this not just for DragonCon, but I will use it for GamerX.
407000	414000	And I'll use it for MagFest and whatever other cons happen to happen in the next few months.
414000	419000	And so Dark Soccer is like, well, what am I gonna do for GamerX? I gotta think of something I wanna do for GamerX.
419000	420000	I already had a plan to do this one.
420000	422000	Yeah, well, but now you're talking about-
422000	423000	I have a new idea.
423000	424000	Can we talk about it on the show?
424000	425000	Yeah, let's talk about it. Why not?
425000	428000	You wanted to do a cross-
428000	429000	Crossplay.
429000	431000	Crossplay of Ness.
431000	432000	Yes.
432000	438000	But you said you've looked up other girls that have cosplayed Ness, and they do the boy Ness, they just happen to be girls.
438000	442000	But you wanna actually kinda give Ness femininity, which is very unlike you.
442000	445000	I know, but I wanna grow up Ness. That's why it's cosplay.
445000	446000	Yeah.
446000	447000	So I cannot be me.
447000	449000	So you're talking about doing like a jean skirt.
449000	451000	No, no, no. I'm talking about doing like a full-on blue circle skirt.
451000	452000	Okay.
452000	456000	A little blue and yellow scoop neck top. I found the t-shirt to modify.
456000	457000	Mm-hmm.
457000	461000	And, you know, like a belt, and maybe some girl shoes.
461000	462000	Yeah.
462000	463000	Ooh.
463000	465000	But then I was talking about, well, then I should do Paula.
465000	466000	Yeah.
466000	467000	Obviously.
467000	469000	We'll have to get you a yellow mullet.
469000	475000	Which is gonna look weird, because I really don't wanna shave my red beard, but if I do it, I'm gonna do it for art.
475000	477000	No, no, don't bother with shaving it. Just leave it.
477000	478000	Just leave it?
478000	479000	Just leave it.
479000	480000	Yeah. There is red in her.
480000	484000	But we were thinking doing, what, red headphones instead of like the bow that she has.
484000	485000	Yeah.
485000	490000	And then like a peach sweater type of thing instead of like the dress. It would be like a sweater with a white collar.
490000	491000	Pop the collar, bro.
491000	492000	Yeah, exactly.
492000	493000	Yeah.
493000	494000	So anyway.
494000	495000	You're gonna be bro'd out Paula. You'll just be Paul.
495000	498000	And I'll be Nessa.
498000	501000	Kaijuto in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says,
501000	504000	I'm gonna be dressed as a rare amiibo and not show up to the con.
504000	507000	Well, there you go. Or you would be-
507000	509000	Wait, you show up to GameStop instead?
509000	516000	Or will you be stuck in the port of San Francisco in the midst of a strike? Isn't that the old excuse?
516000	522000	All right, look, we can talk about cosplay and so forth, but I want to get into the show and get into tonight's gaming news.
522000	524000	And I want to get into our kickoff topic tonight.
524000	532000	There is a lot going on this weekend with the Disney-centric expo, D23, which-
532000	535000	And here I thought it was just a really oddly shaped dice.
536000	539000	It's a brand new thing they're using. It's Dungeons and Dragons 5.0. Get used to it.
539000	541000	D23 is happening.
541000	551000	And speaking of cosplay, our pal Victoria and Bobby, they do some mean- not Bobby Black Wolf, but this is a female Bobby, Barbara.
551000	555000	They're doing some mean cosplay at D23 right now.
555000	557000	They did characters from Inside Out yesterday, right?
557000	560000	Because Bobby did let Sadness and Victoria was the despair.
560000	561000	Disgust.
561000	562000	Disgust.
562000	563000	I haven't seen the movie. Don't judge me.
563000	564000	I want to.
564000	565000	Judging.
565000	567000	I want to, but I just never get out of the movies.
567000	572000	And then today, Victoria went as a Mouseketeer, but she did the whole, like-
572000	574000	She went as one of the Mouseketeers.
574000	580000	Yes. She went and she painted her entire body in the black and white makeup.
580000	584000	For those of you that happen to watch RuPaul's Drag Race, because you all know that's my favorite show on TV,
584000	589000	if you remember what Detox did for the Season 5 reunion, that's what Victoria did for Mouseketeer.
589000	592000	Imagine troll cosplay, but as a Mouseketeer with no horns.
592000	594000	Something like that. Something like that.
594000	601000	So anyway, so D23's happening and our friends dressed up, but there's a lot of announcements coming out of D23, right?
601000	607000	For one, I know this is a video game show, but inherently, if I love Disney and I love video games,
607000	609000	I'm going to love Wreck-It Ralph, probably.
609000	614000	And I'm also probably going to love Tron, probably depending on my age, or I'll love both.
614000	619000	And can we just talk about the ride in Shanghai?
619000	625000	And how, like, you know, I think China would be a really beautiful place to see,
625000	630000	and the Great Wall I'm sure is one of the most fantastic, majestic things you'll ever see.
630000	635000	But it was like, am I really going to be able to save the money and go to China? Probably not.
635000	643000	But now, now that I know there's a Tron light cycle ride in Shanghai, do we have any listeners in China?
643000	647000	Or are we blocked in China? Because if we have any listeners in China,
647000	652000	I need you to take me to Disneyland in Shanghai and ride the Tron thing, because that is going to be amazing.
652000	656000	So that's one great thing that's coming out of D23.
656000	660000	And, you know, if you do follow the parks, what, they talked about Star Wars land is going to be happening?
660000	664000	That's a real thing. And there's some other gaming things we're going to get into a little later.
664000	670000	But of course, Disney video games, they come together into a franchise I'm sure everybody out there knows
670000	677000	and probably has played a lot of, Kingdom Hearts. And so, Kingdom Hearts 3, everybody's really anticipating this game,
677000	680000	even though it's probably not coming out until the year 2021.
680000	685000	I will probably get to Shanghai before Kingdom Hearts 3 actually releases, but we'll see.
685000	690000	And so there's been a lot of talk about, well, what worlds are we going to see in Kingdom Hearts 3?
690000	696000	We can kind of guess some from the trailer, and I think they did say the world of Tangled previously was going to be one.
696000	699000	Wasn't that their big E3 announcement about Kingdom Hearts 3? Was it Tangled?
699000	704000	That world is going to be Flynn Rider and Rapunzel and all that was going to be in Kingdom Hearts 3.
704000	715000	I think they said that at E3. Now at D23, they actually said that now Big Hero 6 will be one of the worlds as well in Kingdom Hearts.
715000	722000	And that's pretty awesome. You know, I have to be honest again, because I hardly ever get out to movies anymore.
722000	725000	I did not see the movie, but I heard a lot of great things about it. I want to see the movie.
725000	735000	And I like the fact that it's something really different. Not that, you know, I don't love the classic Disney franchises as well.
735000	746000	But this shows that, you know, between Tangled and now Big Hero 6, it seems like Disney might be going for a much more modern approach with some of the games or some of the lands that they're putting in the game.
746000	752000	And maybe this means we will see things like Wreck-It Ralph, although, I don't know, getting the other video game properties.
752000	761000	I think if they do Wreck-It Ralph, it's going to be limited to the Sugar Rush or whatever, the go-kart land.
761000	766000	Because those were all original creations. It wasn't really based on anything. So you'd probably see that.
766000	774000	But I think we're definitely going to see things like Frozen and things that are kind of like the newer Disney properties.
774000	776000	You'll probably see a lot of hopefully some Pixar as well.
776000	781000	But I was just curious, what do you guys think of this whole Big Hero 6 coming to Disney?
781000	785000	Ooh, and the fact that that's a Marvel. Big Hero 6 is based on a Marvel thing.
785000	793000	You know, it's not Iron Man or anything big like that, but it's still a Marvel property. So we're seeing that being dipped into.
793000	796000	I'm curious what you guys think in chat about that. What do you guys think about this?
796000	800000	Dark Sakura, you excited for Big Hero 6 in Kingdom Hearts 3?
800000	801000	Maybe.
801000	803000	Maybe? A little bit?
803000	807000	I'd be excited when I have the game in my hands.
807000	815000	So it's one of those things where it's like, I'm not going to get excited about anything because I'm going to be hyped for five years while I wait for this game to come out.
815000	816000	Logie?
816000	823000	I don't know. I haven't seen Big Hero 6 yet. I'm aware of it. It's cool, I guess.
823000	826000	Well, it still gives you a sense of the direction Disney's going with it, right?
826000	831000	No, not really. It doesn't. Because it's just a hodgepodge of stuff that they throw at the guys sometimes.
832000	836000	That's fair, that's fair. Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
836000	839000	ActDeaf says, I'm excited for Kingdom Hearts 3 in general.
839000	845000	Tigerclaw says, for Wreck-It Ralph, I don't think Disney could get the permission to use the other video game characters that show up in the movie.
845000	849000	I am disappointed with their announcement of the Hannah Montana world, though.
849000	851000	There is no Hannah Montana world, be quiet.
851000	857000	Dungeon Buster, she twerks now. They wouldn't be able to get Hannah Montana. She kind of went...
857000	858000	She could be summoned.
859000	863000	She could summon and she could come in like a wrecking ball and take out all the enemies.
865000	869000	Dungeon Buster says, Disney World Hollywood's getting a big Toy Story area.
869000	872000	Now Buzz Lightyear doesn't have to fight alone in Tomorrowland.
872000	880000	Toy Story, I would say you could definitely... I mean, if they are going to dip into the Pixar stuff, I think Toy Story would be at the top of the list of what they're probably going to bring into the game.
881000	888000	Let's see, also William Murderface says, they need to be careful with how much they try to throw in.
888000	891000	Those are all some good comments from our chat room over at live.vog network.com.
891000	893000	Yeah, we don't want them to go overboard.
893000	899000	They are going to have to limit it to X number of areas and then just kind of, you know, go with it.
899000	902000	And there's going to be things left out that we're going to be pissed off about.
902000	906000	I know, it's going to be disappointing that they will be available for DLC in part of the season pass.
907000	912000	I'm sure. I'm sure. DLC for sure. It will be the stuff you want most.
914000	919000	Tiger Claw says, I'm surprised they didn't use some of their other Pixar movies such as A Bug's Life in these games.
919000	926000	That's because A Bug's Life really is, like, if you take the list of Pixar movies from best to worst, Bug's Life is going to be near the bottom.
926000	927000	I'm sorry to say.
928000	936000	And at Disneyland, like, California Adventure, the Bug's Life area, I mean, it's for kids, so you can't hold it to the same standards.
936000	940000	But it's starting to feel a little dated just because that movie is getting dated.
940000	952000	And I think the only reason there is a Cars 3 movie even coming out at all is because Cars Land at Disney is pretty fucking amazing with the special effects just in the way it looks and visual and all that.
952000	955000	I mean, it's just stunning. It's very modern, especially if you see it at night.
956000	961000	Bug's Land? Eh, it could probably use some redoing, but it would cost a lot of money to do so.
961000	967000	But, I don't know. That's just me. And I hate the movie thing they have for Bug's Life at California Adventure.
967000	971000	I don't know if you guys have seen that or been to that. That movie thing is really awful.
971000	976000	So, and I think I heard they were getting rid of it. They didn't get rid of it, but they've just moved other stuff in there.
976000	981000	But they did, they've done the same thing to Captain EO, which is sad. I mean, I know Captain EO had to go some day, but...
981000	983000	That's a land that needs to be...
983000	984000	What? Captain Eoland?
984000	985000	Captain EO in...
985000	987000	Or just Neverland Ranch?
987000	989000	Kingdom Hearts 3.
989000	993000	Oh, Captain EO as a... I think that should be a summon.
993000	998000	Of course, then you'd have to get the estate of Michael Jackson to sign off on that. It's probably not going to happen.
998000	1000000	Probably not going to happen.
1000000	1006000	Just saying. I think Lucas has to get... No, because Lucas is part of Disney now, so that would be a little easier there.
1006000	1008000	I don't know. Anyhow.
1008000	1010000	That would be amazing, though.
1011000	1018000	Alright. Let's move on. We're going to talk more about some of the news out of D23 as we move on with the show.
1018000	1021000	There's, of course, been some other related Disney announcements.
1021000	1025000	And, of course, we'll get to your thoughts on Disney or anything else that's been going on in the gaming world.
1025000	1029000	When we get to the Skype line later in the show, add us on Skype. Be our friend.
1029000	1031000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
1031000	1036000	You can also do it the old school way, 1-877-GAME-OLR, toll free in the US and Canada.
1037000	1041000	We'll get to that a little later on, though. It's going to be when we get towards the end of the show.
1041000	1047000	For now, though, let's get into what we get into towards the top of every show and talk about how is your gaming week?
1047000	1050000	What are the types of video games that you played this week? Dark Soccer.
1050000	1052000	Dragon Age Inquisition.
1052000	1054000	Ah, yes, because the new DLC came out, right?
1054000	1063000	Exactly, and I had to fight to get it working because for some reason it read the beta version that I had and wouldn't install properly on my regular one.
1063000	1070000	So I had to do a whole bunch of futzing with it and then I'd have to, like, unload my mods and reload my mods to actually get the thing to load.
1070000	1076000	And then I played through, like, all of it until, like, midnight last night.
1076000	1081000	And yeah, it's pretty good. And there's more I haven't done yet.
1081000	1087000	Because after you've beaten the DLC, you get a ton more exploration shit to do.
1087000	1093000	And it's just, like, if you like the lore and dwarves, it's perfect.
1093000	1109000	Now, that was something you were mentioning to me before the show is that, you know, you go so far with the lore as to, you know, you're doing some of the fanfic and some of the, you know, just really, like, deeper discussion about the story of what's going on with Dragon Age.
1109000	1117000	So did this DLC just give you, like, a whole new, like, it's like, oh my gosh, this is a whole new encyclopedia to work with.
1117000	1133000	Not so much for my story for, actually, yeah, it did because with where I'm going with my story, it helps give me a little bit more of a sandbox to play in.
1133000	1139000	But I'm not going to touch that too often because I started too much because I already started writing before the DLC was out.
1139000	1143000	But nothing, at least that I've written, has counteracted the DLC, so that's good.
1143000	1154000	Yeah, I was going to say, did you get into that awkward position of the DLC, like, totally did something opposite that was your vision that you had to fill in the gaps?
1154000	1155000	Not really.
1155000	1158000	How do fanfic writers deal with that? Is that a curiosity?
1158000	1163000	Some just stop writing, and others just say, well, I know this is different, but I've already started writing, so screw it.
1163000	1168000	So it's kind of like one of those things where it's like we don't acknowledge the alternate universe or whatever?
1168000	1170000	Well, no, no, no.
1170000	1172000	The J.J. Abrams timeline isn't real?
1172000	1179000	Every piece of fanfiction is technically not canon.
1180000	1191000	They're your interpretation of canon or an alternate universe or expansion on what's in your head, but it's not canon, even if it says it follows the story canonically.
1191000	1199000	Yeah, it's following canon, but every single independent thought that you write for the character is not necessarily canon.
1199000	1209000	And simply because you can't expect that the people, I don't want to say the real writers, but you know what I mean, the ones that get paid to actually do the script for the game.
1209000	1211000	The creators of said canon.
1211000	1215000	Yes, they're not out there reading all that, there's too much fan, they might read some of it, but they don't read all of it.
1215000	1218000	And some of it they probably, quite frankly, stay away from.
1218000	1228000	Actually, quite a few of them on Twitter think that there's really interesting theories out there from fanfiction and discussions and have entertained a few things.
1228000	1236000	And even a couple of them even said, yeah, you guys are awfully close to it, we can't say who's close to it, but there's some people out there who are really close to where we're going.
1236000	1239000	But in the end, canon is in the hand of the creators.
1240000	1249000	And what we're talking about really close to where the story's going, we're talking about all the cross-species sex. That's exactly where we're going.
1249000	1257000	I think that's the type of fanfic the creators tend to not look at, just kind of leave to the back alleys of the internet.
1257000	1263000	Anyway, so that's it, Dragon Age DLC and exploring all that, probably took a lot of time.
1263000	1266000	It had shiny moments, I'll leave it at that.
1266000	1268000	Fair enough. Loki, how was your gaming week?
1268000	1276000	I don't really remember what I played this week. I know I did play more of the Windows 10 beta edition of Minecraft.
1276000	1285000	That client's actually really good. It runs way better than the Java version by, like, miles.
1285000	1288000	It is still beta though, so it's missing a lot of things.
1288000	1301000	Like, for example, there's no steel doors, there's no pistons, a lot of the crafting stuff.
1301000	1304000	For example, you can craft a bow and arrow, but there's no arrows.
1304000	1308000	So you just have unlimited arrows, which is kind of weird.
1308000	1314000	But it runs super smooth. You can set the draw distance to forever and it just runs like crazy.
1315000	1317000	So I'm really digging that.
1317000	1325000	So once they get that patched up to where the PC version is now on the Java version, I think that's going to be pretty awesome.
1325000	1329000	Definitely check that out. Especially if you own a copy of Minecraft, it's free.
1329000	1332000	So go download the beta client, because it's awesome.
1334000	1337000	With that, I also played...
1337000	1340000	Oh god, what else did I play this week? I don't know.
1340000	1344000	Like, I just kind of played a bunch of different random things.
1344000	1347000	I bought more games. I bought that Namco bundle.
1347000	1350000	Installed Ridge Racer, but I haven't played that yet.
1350000	1355000	I did, unfortunately and embarrassingly, play a little bit of Sakura Clicker.
1355000	1359000	It's another clicker game, but it's with big-breasted anime chicks.
1359000	1366000	So, you know, you're attacking monsters, but it's just really more big-breasted anime chicks.
1366000	1369000	But I played it for 45 fucking minutes!
1369000	1371000	I'm sucked into these stupid clicker games.
1371000	1375000	I'm just like, okay, this is going to be stupid, it's free, whatever, I'll just check it out.
1375000	1377000	And you tap the titty over and over?
1377000	1380000	Yeah, and they're like, ah, ah, ah, ooh, eh.
1380000	1383000	And of course the cat girl's like, meow, meow.
1383000	1385000	Wait, wait, wait, wait, there's a cat?
1385000	1392000	Oh yeah, they're all different. They have bears, they have cats, there's like slimes, all sorts of weird stuff.
1392000	1397000	So you start by tapping. Usually in these games you click the same thing over and over again.
1397000	1399000	Like in Cookie Clicker you're always clicking a cookie, right?
1399000	1403000	So you're clicking a titty in this game, but what, the titty changes?
1403000	1405000	And then suddenly it's a cat?
1405000	1413000	Yeah, it's another creature. They have all sorts of just scantily clad women in it.
1415000	1418000	And I don't know, there's really no point to the game.
1418000	1423000	But for some stupid reason, I was brain dead this afternoon, and so I played about 45 minutes of it.
1423000	1426000	I'm like, oh god, why am I playing this so long?
1426000	1432000	Fifth Dream in Chat says, Sakura Clicker is great, I've played it for a lot of hours.
1432000	1434000	It's a whole girl, not just a titty.
1434000	1437000	Yeah, it's not just titties, it's just, you know, it's an anime.
1437000	1444000	But like, you know, their DLC or whatever you can buy for it, it's like costumes for like the hero girl.
1444000	1446000	Which is like, whatever, you don't even need to do that.
1446000	1450000	But yeah, so I played that for like 45 minutes today.
1450000	1452000	What else did I play? I played...
1453000	1454000	I can't believe...
1454000	1458000	I played Grand Theft Auto! I played Grand Theft Auto 5 for like 5 minutes.
1458000	1465000	Because my son likes watching my old YouTube videos, and so I have one that I did that was Breaking Rad.
1465000	1467000	Which was, you know, with Trevor Phillips.
1467000	1473000	It was set to like, you know, the theme music from the 80s movie that was so amazing, Rad.
1473000	1475000	And so it's just BMX stuff.
1475000	1478000	So I was like, oh cool, I can play the game and do that again, you know.
1478000	1483000	And so I was playing that and riding around on a bike and shooting people with explosive bullets.
1483000	1486000	So that was fun. I played that for a bit. Need to go back and play that some more.
1486000	1487000	Good times.
1487000	1489000	Yep. And then I worked on...
1489000	1493000	I didn't really work on my game this week, I worked on my website and logos and stuff.
1493000	1496000	Game related, but just not quite games.
1496000	1503000	Let me guess, StubbornLoki, after all the talk last week about Jamie or Cody or somebody else out there helping you on your logo, you're just doing it yourself.
1503000	1505000	Because that's how you roll.
1506000	1507000	Cody, I never heard back from him.
1507000	1509000	Someone never messaged me.
1509000	1512000	I know, I didn't message you. And it's because I wanted to do it myself.
1512000	1516000	And then I finally found a logo that I thought looked nice.
1516000	1519000	I didn't want to stop and ask for directions. I'll figure it out.
1519000	1521000	Exactly. So, I...
1521000	1522000	Typical.
1522000	1526000	I found... Well, the thing is, you know, I didn't have any direction to go with it.
1526000	1531000	I didn't know what I wanted. I just wanted... I'd know it when I see it. You know, type of thing.
1531000	1532000	And so I...
1532000	1535000	When I see the McDonald's that we go left at, I'll know.
1535000	1540000	So yeah, I've been learning how to do a lot of web stuff because, you know, it's a lot...
1540000	1547000	Web development has gotten so much, you know, more involved since GeoCities, so, you know.
1547000	1552000	I know. I remember when I could write a web page by hand in HTML markup.
1552000	1555000	You can still do that. It's just a pain in the ass.
1555000	1557000	You'll look like a GeoCities page.
1557000	1559000	Just saying, I can code CSS by hand.
1559000	1563000	Can you? Great. Fixhornslaungeradio.com.
1563000	1565000	That's PHP, Rob.
1565000	1566000	Oh.
1566000	1569000	Shows you how much I know.
1569000	1572000	Alright. Is that it for your gaming week?
1572000	1577000	Yeah, that's gonna be it. And then, of course, this week I'm gonna be playing Goat Simulator because I just bought that.
1577000	1580000	I played that a little bit on Xbox One. And well, I am PC.
1580000	1583000	You know what would be, though, a fun game? Not fun, but fun in a really disgusting way?
1583000	1584000	What?
1584000	1585000	Goat Stimulator.
1585000	1588000	Where you work at a goat farm.
1588000	1595000	Okay. I was gonna tease him for the whole titty clicker thing, but now you're talking about Goat Milker or whatever you're talking about.
1595000	1597000	You guys, Goat Simulator.
1597000	1601000	I've got screenshots. Let's pull up some screenshots, shall we? Or we'll just hit play.
1601000	1604000	Of course. Of course. He pulls up Steam and it's defaulted to Sakura Clicker.
1604000	1609000	Because I was just playing that before I came here. I told you. 45 minutes this afternoon.
1609000	1611000	48 minutes. I stand corrected.
1611000	1612000	You know, Steam does have it.
1612000	1614000	Are you getting trading cards?
1614000	1619000	No! There's no achievements. So, really, there is absolutely no reason for me to play this.
1619000	1620000	Okay.
1620000	1622000	But, yeah, see, here's what the game looks like.
1622000	1623000	Oh, God.
1623000	1624000	And so you just...
1626000	1628000	That's it. And I'm fighting the witch.
1628000	1630000	Because I know it's radio.
1630000	1632000	And, see, look. That's a panda bear.
1632000	1633000	Oh, my God.
1633000	1634000	I'm fighting a panda bear.
1634000	1643000	These various... Okay, when he says he's fighting a panda bear, it's a girl dressed up with a little tiny panda bear coming out of her panties that she's wearing.
1643000	1646000	And her bra and panties happen to be a black and white pattern.
1646000	1647000	What? A dragon?
1647000	1652000	That's not a dragon. That's a girl in a very revealing dragon costume.
1652000	1654000	Showing a lot of side boob.
1654000	1655000	There's a bear.
1655000	1656000	Okay, these are not...
1656000	1660000	See, I'm thinking in my mind of actual animals.
1660000	1666000	No, it's just... It's pretty anime ladies in unrealistic proportions dressed up as creatures.
1666000	1668000	All right, Loki, you're crazy. I love it.
1668000	1670000	All right, Mike, give me a week.
1671000	1673000	So, believe it or not, not a lot of Final Fantasy XIV this week.
1673000	1678000	I know that's usually my go-to game, but I think I've kind of worn that game out for right now.
1678000	1683000	I'm trying to still do enough content where I'm getting my tomes every week so I can get my gear.
1683000	1685000	But I'm kind of burned out on that.
1685000	1692000	I actually went back to a game that I've been playing a lot of in the past, Diablo III, because I read that Season 3 is ending.
1692000	1695000	And so now I'm like, oh, shit, I didn't unlock everything.
1695000	1698000	I still need to get 400 achievement points so I can get my portrait.
1698000	1706000	So I've been working on Diablo III, hoping I can just barely make the buzzer on that before they end Season 3,
1706000	1708000	which I think I have about another week.
1708000	1714000	And then Season 4 will be starting on, I think it was the 28th, don't quote me on that, but it's coming up before too long.
1714000	1716000	So, yeah, I wanted to get that done.
1716000	1720000	So it's been nice to kind of go back and play a little more Diablo.
1720000	1722000	Otherwise, new games this week.
1722000	1726000	On PlayStation 4, I played two new games that came out this week.
1726000	1730000	The first one I played a little less of because I'd already played this game on PC,
1730000	1735000	but I checked out Gauntlet on the PlayStation 4, or as I think they're calling it, Gauntlet Slayer Edition,
1735000	1740000	which is very similar to the Gauntlet on the PC, except of course it's built natively for the controller.
1740000	1747000	And I think some of the level design and the structures are a little different than the PC version, at least from what I remember in my experience.
1747000	1752000	But otherwise, I'll say mostly the same stuff I said the first time about Gauntlet.
1752000	1755000	It's a pretty cool little reimagining of the game.
1755000	1761000	It is different in Diablo in that you're not really on the hunt for gear, you're on the hunt for gold,
1761000	1763000	and you turn around and you use the gold to buy gear.
1763000	1767000	So you're not going to do these endless grinds that you do in Diablo,
1767000	1777000	but you can do a dungeon randomizer and you'll try to go as far into a randomly generated dungeon as you can,
1777000	1782000	which has a lot of the feel of the old game, which yes, I know the old game was not random dungeons,
1782000	1786000	but sometimes they felt that way as you started to forget what the levels looked like one after the other.
1786000	1788000	So there's that.
1788000	1794000	Plus the other thing I kind of like about what they do with Gauntlet is that all the different characters have a very different feel in how they play.
1794000	1798000	You know, the warrior plays how you would expect a melee class to play.
1798000	1802000	It's not like the old school Gauntlet where the warrior is throwing axes across the room all the time.
1802000	1803000	It's not really like that.
1803000	1808000	But if you go from the warrior and then you go play as the elf, the elf plays like a twin-stick shooter.
1808000	1813000	Like if you use the R-stick, he's just constantly shooting arrows at the enemies over and over again.
1813000	1815000	I actually like playing as the elf the best.
1815000	1821000	And you can use like, if you buy a certain power-up, you can use R1 to like dash and get out of tricky situations.
1821000	1829000	And then the wizard plays like that game Magica, where like you have a fire button, an ice button, and a lightning button,
1829000	1832000	and you can hit like fire, fire, and it'll do a fireball.
1832000	1837000	Where you hit fire, lightning, and it does like, it does a kind of like a thing that mixes both those elements.
1837000	1842000	So I think that's kind of neat, because I like that whole little mechanic in Magica as well.
1842000	1843000	I thought that was pretty cool.
1843000	1849000	So it's neat that they've given those characters completely different play styles inside Gauntlet.
1849000	1852000	And spoiler alert, although it's not that hard to figure out if you check out the leaderboards,
1852000	1855000	there's a fifth class that wasn't even in the original game, Necromancer.
1855000	1857000	And that's going to be different as well.
1857000	1859000	I haven't unlocked the Necromancer yet, but...
1859000	1861000	Oh, I was hoping it was Pojo.
1861000	1864000	No, it's not Pojo.
1864000	1866000	But the chicken class was the best class, let's be honest.
1866000	1872000	From what I understand, the Necromancer is like, I don't know, she controls like undead creatures,
1872000	1875000	like a summoner or something like that, I don't know, I think is the way it works.
1875000	1877000	You don't say a Necromancer controls undead.
1877000	1878000	I know, right? Right?
1878000	1879000	That's...
1879000	1880000	Not just a clever name.
1880000	1881000	That's just silly.
1881000	1882000	That's how it plays in the game.
1882000	1883000	So there's Gauntlet.
1883000	1888000	Then the other game I played this week, and I actually played this game from start to finish,
1888000	1894000	and Dark Sakura watched me play probably the last quarter of it or so today,
1894000	1899000	is a brand new game that was on the PlayStation 4 this week called Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
1899000	1903000	And yes, that's the name of the game, and it's kind of a silly title for a game,
1903000	1910000	but when you start to play the game, you understand that it definitely appears that the rapture has occurred.
1910000	1913000	You are exploring this world.
1913000	1919000	You wake up in a place, and you learn that all the citizens in this town have disappeared.
1919000	1923000	And you're trying to figure out the why in it.
1923000	1929000	I'm going to caution you, because the reviews for this game are going all over the map.
1929000	1936000	And it's because it's a gorgeous game with a really deep story that's very well acted,
1936000	1939000	and the music in the game is incredible as well.
1939000	1942000	It's got a great orchestral score to it.
1942000	1945000	They do some really neat things where they have choirs singing songs.
1945000	1948000	It almost feels like Bioshock Infinite a little bit in some parts.
1948000	1951000	They do some really great things with the soundtrack.
1951000	1953000	But, here's the thing.
1953000	1957000	If you didn't like Gone Home, and you thought that game was pretentious or whatever,
1957000	1959000	you're going to hate this game. Don't bother.
1959000	1968000	Because it's very similar in the aspect that there's not a lot of, and I'm using my quote-y fingers, game.
1968000	1974000	You're not fighting zombies, although it seems like one's going to jump out behind the door at some point.
1974000	1977000	You don't really die. There's no risk factor in the game.
1977000	1988000	At the best, the game is that you're chasing a ball of light, and the ball of light kind of helps you know maybe where to go next.
1988000	1994000	But one thing I learned after my first playthrough of the game is that if you just follow the ball around,
1994000	1999000	and don't bother to do any of your own exploring, you're not going to get the entire story.
1999000	2005000	The ball of light will show you those cutscenes you have to see, but it's not going to show you everything.
2005000	2010000	Anyway, I don't want to give away too much of the game or what have you, but I just want to caution you.
2010000	2019000	If you are not into the idea of an interactive story, as opposed to maybe a game, then you're probably going to want to pass on this game.
2019000	2027000	However, I will say, for those that are going with the whole video games or art thing, this game is a work of art.
2027000	2030000	And it's one of those games, not just, is it gorgeous?
2030000	2033000	I mean, Dark Soccer, you were watching the game on PlayStation 4. It's a gorgeous game, right?
2033000	2035000	I just told Dan that we need to buy this.
2035000	2040000	The graphics, I mean, it goes, and you were noticing, wow, the times of day change.
2040000	2047000	The one thing that bothered me was the trees and grass. You had wind effects, but none of the environment moved.
2047000	2055000	So it made, but it actually added to the atmosphere to me, and that it made it seem like you were stuck at a time.
2055000	2063000	Like you were an outside observer, like you were dropped and time had been frozen for the moment that you were there.
2063000	2065000	It was very metaphysical.
2065000	2071000	SSJ100Matt says, let me guess, is it preachy? No, and I think that might be where they're going to regret the title,
2071000	2077000	because people are going to make the assumption that their game has a lot of religious tones in it, and actually it doesn't.
2077000	2085000	But, well, I will say this. There is a preacher character in the game, and so there are some religious tie-ins,
2085000	2093000	but the game itself, and there's, I gotta be careful, I don't want to spoil things, but there's also not a lot to spoil,
2093000	2099000	because a lot is left up to interpretation, I believe. I don't think the game is really about the rapture.
2100000	2109000	God, I have a comparison to make, but I have a feeling it would be a little spoilery if I made it.
2109000	2112000	We better not. We'll wait a few weeks, then maybe talk about it later.
2112000	2114000	Ask me in chat and I'll tell you what I think it is.
2114000	2121000	But I will say this. You know, the minute I beat the game, I kind of just wanted to talk to somebody else about it.
2121000	2125000	You know, and even Dark Sakura and Shane was actually here too, and I was just talking to Shane.
2125000	2135000	I was like, so does that mean, so that means, you know, and we're just trying to talk it out and figure out what the hell it all meant,
2135000	2141000	because there is a lot of it that's opened up to interpretation. That could also frustrate the shit out of some people.
2141000	2147000	So, in a nutshell, everybody's gone to the rapture. Gorgeous graphics.
2147000	2152000	I actually think Dark Sakura, what she said about the environment is super, super nitpicky. I don't even think you'll notice it all.
2152000	2155000	Gorgeous graphics. Well, I mean that in a, you know.
2155000	2157000	Well, yeah, but I noticed stuff like that.
2157000	2160000	It's a fair criticism, but it's so minor in the context of things.
2160000	2166000	The graphics is great. The sound in the orchestra, orchestral music is great.
2166000	2170000	The voice acting is fantastic and all that.
2170000	2179000	But as far as where's the game, some of you may be left wanting a little more, because it's more of an interactive work of fiction in that regard.
2179000	2186000	And maybe the one thing that really frustrated me the most is for the first half of the game or so,
2186000	2191000	I had no real sense of, am I progressing? Am I doing this right?
2191000	2197000	What am I, because the game gives you so little to work with, what the hell am I supposed to be doing?
2197000	2202000	Am I, if there are 10 cut scenes to see in this part of town, did I see them all?
2202000	2207000	How do I know? Because I'll tell you this much as well, which is crazy to me.
2207000	2212000	I beat the game start to finish, right? There's probably like 20 trophies in this game.
2212000	2216000	I got two of them playing the game from start to finish.
2216000	2220000	So that tells me there's a lot of game I didn't see.
2220000	2224000	So it's, I don't know. It's interesting that I couldn't figure that out.
2224000	2230000	But yet I do have that sense of, maybe I should go back and play it again, because I think there is a lot that I missed.
2230000	2237000	Now, like if I knew when I started what I knew when I finished, maybe now there's more that I'll be able to uncover.
2237000	2243000	And I think in that regard, if not only the game can be a work of fiction and get you to play it like that,
2243000	2248000	but then make you want to go play it again immediately, I think that's a hell of an accomplishment.
2248000	2251000	So just kind of something to throw out there.
2251000	2256000	Alright, I'm looking in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2256000	2259000	DungeonBuster wants to know, how long is the game?
2259000	2263000	That could bother some people as well. I would say it was about four hours for me, start to finish.
2263000	2268000	I bet some people out there could beat it a lot faster, and I bet some will take their time a little more.
2268000	2273000	But remember what I just said. I beat the game, and then I wanted to go back and play it again,
2273000	2279000	because I realized I think there's a lot of shit I missed that now I know stuff that I didn't know at the beginning I could go back and find.
2279000	2285000	So I'll leave that to you, how much you think you could really get out of a game like that.
2285000	2291000	Let's see, also going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2291000	2297000	Fifth Dream says, at the beginning I was scared a lot. It made me think of PT, and that made me freak out.
2297000	2299000	But there was nothing to be scared of. Oh yeah.
2299000	2304000	And I was actually showing Shane the game for the first time on SharePlay, and I was telling him as I was playing,
2304000	2310000	I'm like, every time I open a door, I think Chica's going to jump out and go, and like, bite my head off.
2310000	2319000	Like, I keep thinking that the game definitely has a very scary ambience to it, but there's nothing, like there are no jump scares in the game.
2319000	2324000	And I was telling Bobby Black Wolf before the show, the game is in Bobby Black Wolf mode. You cannot die.
2324000	2331000	You will not, there's no consequence in the game really, except time wasted running around in circles.
2332000	2338000	One last thing I'll say about the game. Tip, if you get the game, hold the R2 button.
2338000	2344000	In most scenarios, the R2 button will move you faster. They do not say that in the beginning of the game, and I think that's a mistake.
2344000	2350000	It's in the manual, if you bring up the manual and go look at the online manual, and that's the only way I found it.
2350000	2359000	But yeah, I think it was a mistake not to call that out in the game, because if you don't know about the R2 button, some of the, it's going to move really slow.
2359000	2360000	For not reading the manual.
2360000	2361000	Really slow.
2361000	2362000	For some people.
2362000	2363000	RTFM.
2363000	2368000	So there you go. That's my thoughts on Everybody's Gone to the Rapture.
2368000	2375000	A very, I think this is an art piece that I think a lot of, I think you're going to see these Game of the Year awards.
2375000	2378000	I think this thing's going to get nominated for a ton of them.
2378000	2383000	And I think some people are going to say, what a pretentious piece of shit, it shouldn't win all these awards.
2383000	2385000	It's going to be the same thing with Gone Home.
2385000	2391000	I think this is just kind of this year's Gone Home, and it's going to be a lot of the same stuff that you saw happen with that game.
2391000	2395000	Alright, anyhow, and by the way, for the record, I loved Gone Home.
2395000	2409000	I actually liked Gone Home a little more than this game, but I thought the graphics and the music and the presentation and some of the things that kind of the game leaves open are a little better in this game.
2409000	2413000	So I guess they kind of both have their pros and cons, don't they?
2414000	2419000	Alright, quickly, some housekeeping, and then we'll get into this week's gaming news.
2419000	2424000	Follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r. We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2424000	2429000	We're also on Google Plus, at google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
2429000	2432000	We will not be here over Labor Day weekend.
2432000	2441000	That is because, as I mentioned earlier in the show, I will be at DragonCon with some of my other buddies from the Voice of Geeks Network, including Travis from Under Sedation Live, Bobby from the Bobby Black Wolf Show,
2441000	2448000	some of the guys from Critical Myth are going to be there, and I believe Brian from British Invaders also making the trip out from Canada to be there.
2448000	2458000	So there's going to be quite a bit of VOG representation around the show, and I'll give you more information about what panels to look out for and what to tune into online.
2458000	2464000	If you can't make the show, I'll get you that a little closer to the actual date of DragonCon, which is Labor Day weekend.
2464000	2471000	But we will not be here live because of it, but I'm sure so many of you are going to be going to cons of your own or on trips.
2471000	2479000	I know PAX is the same weekend. There will probably be some gaming news out of that. It's going to be a busy weekend, but we will not be here that weekend.
2479000	2484000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news for the week. And speaking of expos, right, Loki?
2485000	2491000	Yes, this is pretty exciting. I don't know if I can go, but it's going to be much closer this year.
2491000	2498000	But the PlayStation Experience 2015 is going to be held in San Francisco as opposed to Las Vegas last year.
2498000	2504000	It's going to take place December 5th and 6th, and will be at Moscone West.
2504000	2512000	I don't know when tickets are going to be available, but you can check out the official PlayStation Experience website, which is really long.
2512000	2516000	Just look for PlayStation Experience on PlayStation.com.
2516000	2527000	I'm happy, well, the selfish part of me, completely 100% selfish part of me is happy that they moved into San Francisco because now I could go without having to take time off work.
2527000	2534000	So the chance that I could actually attend the event this year is way higher than it was in previous years, or previous year, really.
2534000	2546000	So, yeah, that's exciting. Although, it is the week before GamerX, which VOG Network is actually a sponsor of, so doing both back to back is going to be a little tiring.
2546000	2552000	But, you know, it's not like, you know, San Francisco is only a two hour drive, so it's doable. It's doable.
2552000	2559000	Interesting, because Jason, who does the voiceovers for our show, like in the beginning, he was actually texting me, he's like,
2559000	2565000	Wow, weren't you guys just talking about PlayStation Experience last week on the show? And I was like, what are you talking about? They just announced it this week.
2565000	2572000	He's like, no, no, no, but you were, you were talking about something that kind of led to you talking about where's PlayStation Expo and aren't they going to announce things?
2572000	2578000	And yeah, I think last week we were talking about Gamescom and that it was kind of Microsoft heavy. We didn't hear a lot, a lot out of Sony.
2578000	2584000	We heard some, but not a lot. It kind of begs the question, was Sony going to do their own thing? And here we are.
2584000	2594000	And some interesting things that I was reading around the internet as to why they do this, and I thought this was a very smart theory, why this PlayStation Expo is working very well for them.
2594000	2604000	Because by doing this expo around the holidays, when there's not usually a lot of gaming news otherwise, everybody's talking about what?
2604000	2607000	During the holidays, PlayStation.
2607000	2608000	Hanukkah.
2608000	2614000	And that's, well, and what they want under their menorah for Hanukkah is a PlayStation because there's all this-
2614000	2615000	The Hanukkah bush, get it right.
2615000	2628000	I think, I think it's very well timed how they do. I thought that was a really interesting theory that PlayStation does this purposely during the holidays to get the conversation around PlayStation right when people are looking to buy that type of stuff for the holidays.
2628000	2642000	I thought it was pretty clever insight, especially when you consider this year, you know, we've, and we talked about this in the, on previous editions of the show, Sony PlayStation doesn't exactly have a lot of first party games to be putting out there.
2642000	2653000	So they have to kind of steer the conversation into a different direction and they're really putting a lot of their focus on Street Fighter 5, a lot of focus on Street Fighter 5, No Man's Sky, and some of these other games that are coming out that aren't necessarily-
2653000	2657000	I mean Morpheus stuff at that point, cause you know, it's almost 2016 at that point.
2657000	2670000	Well, maybe that's, that's a big chunk of what we're going to say. I mean, if, if the Morpheus is indeed spring 2016, maybe the conversation at this PlayStation experience is really going to focus on Morpheus and it's going to get people to go, Oh, I want that.
2670000	2679000	Make sure you put a PlayStation 4 under my Hanukkah bush or my Christmas tree or whatever it is, your Festivus pole for that's what I want.
2679000	2691000	So, uh, very, very interesting. So, um, I hope to go, did they say tickets are on sale yet or they didn't really say, cause they'll probably sell out in 15 minutes.
2691000	2704000	So I'll, uh, I'll have to just hope I can get one. So, cause I, I feel like I'm only going to be able to go on Saturday just because of the working situation and everything, but I'd love to go just at least for a day. I think it'd be a lot of fun.
2705000	2713000	Well, maybe one game that will show up at the PlayStation experience, you know, again, one of those games that Sony has been pushing a lot, even though this game is supposed to be on Xbox one as well.
2713000	2725000	But I think that when a lot of people think of Sony, they think of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy 15. It's been announced this week that Final Fantasy 15 will get a worldwide simultaneous launch.
2725000	2734000	This was in an interview with GameSpot. Final Fantasy 15's director Hajime Tabata actually said that Final Fantasy 15 will get a release worldwide.
2734000	2745000	This is noteworthy because typically a lot of Square Enix games come out in Japan, you know, a good six months even before they're out here. Like Final Fantasy 13. I remember, Loki, you imported Final Fantasy 13.
2745000	2749000	No, I didn't import Final Fantasy 13. I imported Final Fantasy 13, the demo.
2749000	2758000	The demo of 13 you imported. So it's not uncommon that things come out in Japan much earlier than they are actually released here.
2758000	2775000	But Final Fantasy 14 broke that trend quite a bit. Granted, 14's in a different situation because 14 is an online game. There's a different set of rules that go with that, but I guess it showed that Square can certainly do these simultaneous releases.
2775000	2786000	So a quote from the interview. This may be something that we are a little bit embarrassed to talk about, but really this is the first time that we've done a packaged standalone Final Fantasy game with a simultaneous global launch.
2786000	2793000	And I'm only letting that comment slide because he said packaged standalone and I'm like, again, 14 launched globally, but anyway.
2793000	2801000	So we didn't have the setup to deal with that really. The first thing we had to do was rearrange our internal structure to be able to create something that could do that.
2801000	2816000	That was the first important work on the project. And maybe I would think that if you're working on this game and you're in Square right now, a big part of the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One is about that social connectivity.
2816000	2829000	And you can go onto Twitch TV, the built-in PlayStation 4 viewer right there on your crossbar, and watch people play Japanese games that are only out in Japan right now.
2829000	2836000	And likewise, people in Japan can watch people play games that are out in the US that are not out in Japan, and Europe can do all the same things as well.
2836000	2843000	So I think they fully realize, if we release Final Fantasy 15 in Japan first, what's going to happen?
2843000	2848000	Everybody's just going to watch Twitch streams and get the story that way. It's built right there into the PlayStation 4.
2848000	2855000	And they'll just get their fill of the story that way. You know somebody's going to run that channel that's like, I'm going to play Final Fantasy 15 and I'll translate as I go.
2855000	2860000	And somebody who's very well-versed in Japanese and English can play through the game and translate everything as they go.
2860000	2869000	So I think they kind of see that we, and I've been saying this for years as I think a lot of us have, we now live in a world economy of sorts.
2869000	2878000	You know, with the internet having us all connected, no more can you release a game over here and not expect any news about it to never make its way over here.
2879000	2887000	When Nintendo re-skinned Doki Doki Panic and made it Super Mario Bros. 2, they could kind of keep that a secret because there was no internet.
2887000	2890000	There was magazines. They could kind of control that information.
2890000	2896000	Most people in America didn't know for years and years and years that Super Mario Bros. 2 was a completely different game in Japan.
2896000	2900000	Nobody really knew that until the Mario lost levels and all that stuff.
2900000	2905000	How did no one notice that? It looks completely different. It plays completely different. It doesn't make any sense.
2905000	2906000	Color palette was different.
2906000	2908000	Well, because we didn't have their Super Mario Bros. 2.
2908000	2911000	Yeah, but seriously though, it's like, what?
2911000	2915000	But now that the internet is out there, could Nintendo ever do something like that? No.
2915000	2922000	So, you know, because it would be out there on the internet in a minute that, you know, this is what they've done and they changed the game and it has a different name and all this other stuff.
2922000	2924000	It would just be out there the instant.
2924000	2929000	They took Tomb Raider and they re-skinned it to Mario and now it's Mario.
2931000	2932000	It's Mar-Rader.
2932000	2939000	Anyway, Final Fantasy XV is going to be launching globally and I think that's good news for Final Fantasy fans here in the state and in Europe.
2939000	2950000	Is that we will not have to wait for the game to be translated and all that localized because they're doing it simultaneously just like they're doing it for Final Fantasy XIV, so it makes sense.
2950000	2952000	Let's move on. Dark Sakura.
2953000	2956000	This is happy news. Happy. Everyone, happy.
2957000	2961000	Resident Evil 2 is getting a remake. Booyah.
2961000	2968000	Because how many different ones have we had for the first one? Like, a million? Or at least three or four?
2968000	2984000	Well, it looks like there will technically, it's been hinted a lot that there's going to be a possible Resident Evil 2 remake and now it's actually been officially approved.
2984000	2993000	So, we are going to be getting one. There's no details about it, but hopefully it has my favorite line in it.
2993000	2996000	It's time to take down Umbrella.
2997000	2999000	Because it's not raining anymore.
3002000	3010000	I guess I get why not. You know, a lot of people really love the earlier Resident Evil games, so why not? Especially 2. Why not go back and remake it?
3010000	3018000	Cap come out of ideas. I mean, is that what I'm hearing here? Because I understand Street Fighter V, which, let's be honest, it's not that different from Street Fighter IV.
3018000	3020000	I mean, you're tweaking things.
3020000	3022000	Fighting game fans may take issue.
3022000	3030000	I understand that. Whatever. That's fine. I'm talking about just a purely development. I mean, we're not talking like it's completely different. I mean, the systems may be a little bit different.
3031000	3033000	Okay, fine. Whatever. I'll give you Street Fighter V.
3033000	3042000	But like, they're remaking Mega Man, or they're doing like a collection for Mega Man. They're remaking Resident Evil. They just remade Resident Evil.
3042000	3049000	It's like, I guess you ran out of ideas. Let's just make all the old games again. I mean, I don't know.
3049000	3059000	Well, this is the one who's actually in charge of the project is Yoshiaki, and I hope they did not just miswrite his name.
3059000	3068000	Hirabayashi, who is the one who is also behind the last one. And he seems really excited and passionate about it.
3068000	3073000	So that first Resident Evil remake must have sold really well for them to be thinking about this.
3073000	3075000	I have it. Have I played it? No.
3075000	3081000	Capcom's gonna go where the money is. And I think, Loki, if you're asking, why are they doing all this? Because that's what people are buying.
3081000	3083000	Everybody loves nostalgia.
3083000	3087000	You know what they love more than nostalgia? The new Mega Man game.
3087000	3091000	Well, Anna, if you believe Capcom, it's Pochislot.
3091000	3097000	Well, I bet if that Mega Man collection sells absurdly well, maybe they will do a Mega Man 11.
3097000	3103000	Or they're gonna bundle a 7, 8, 9, and 10 type of thing. I don't know. We'll see. Anyhow.
3104000	3106000	Let's move on, Loki.
3106000	3111000	So, Phantasy Star Online 2 is coming out for the Playstation 4.
3111000	3117000	That's pretty great news. And there's a guy wielding a fish. So that's something.
3117000	3123000	Of course that's in Japan, of course. Not announced over here yet.
3123000	3126000	But region free, right?
3127000	3130000	I mean, I'm sure it's a little bit more complicated when you get into an MMO.
3130000	3137000	But, I don't know. Is it gonna operate the same as Phantasy Star Online did, where you can play offline?
3137000	3139000	I don't know.
3139000	3143000	Yeah, there was a whole single player campaign, and Universe had a great one. Well, I thought.
3143000	3146000	I liked Universe more than most people did.
3146000	3149000	I've been wanting to play Phantasy Star Online 2 for forever.
3149000	3151000	And I realize, yes, there's the whole...
3151000	3154000	Just recently, we were talking about this too, maybe not even a month ago.
3154000	3159000	There's the server now that they took the region restriction off of, so you can get a patched client and do that.
3159000	3165000	But it's like, is it too much to ask, with all that being said, for Sega to just kind of officially acknowledge it?
3165000	3170000	And just, maybe it's easier said than done. Patch it into English and put it out already.
3170000	3174000	Maybe it might be a good idea to make something other than Sonic for a change.
3174000	3180000	Because Sonic ain't working for you right now. So, maybe put up Phantasy Star.
3180000	3184000	Dungeon Buster in chat says, you can solo a lot in PSO2.
3184000	3187000	Rama says, Sky, what patch? The region lock is back on.
3187000	3192000	I don't remember the details. I'm sorry, maybe some of you people that are more tuned into the Phantasy Star Online current goings ons.
3192000	3196000	I don't think you're playing the same game that the Japanese audience is.
3196000	3202000	I think it's a different territory. And it's like a year behind in updates from what Japan has.
3202000	3205000	But it does have the region restriction gone on it.
3205000	3208000	So, it was something I was seeing on Twitter a while back.
3208000	3212000	It was one of those things where I wanted to play it because I loved Phantasy Star Online.
3212000	3217000	I love Phantasy Star Universe. But when I see Sega kind of giving us the finger here in the States,
3217000	3219000	I kind of just want to give them the finger right back.
3219000	3223000	We do. That's why their sales are in the tank for Sonic Boom.
3223000	3227000	Dungeon Buster says, the server restrictions are back. Oh, that sucks.
3227000	3231000	But there's a proxy you can use to get around it. I've been playing for a few weeks now.
3231000	3234000	There are several versions. The C version is the one everyone avoids.
3234000	3240000	The Japanese fan translated version is the one people suggest to play if you want to jump through the hoops to do it.
3240000	3246000	I'm just kind of like, Sega, just acknowledge that I exist. Is it too- Sega, give me a hug.
3246000	3251000	That's all I want. Just give me a hug. Please. Please, Sega.
3251000	3256000	I defended Phantasy Star Universe on this show. It's not that bad.
3256000	3262000	It's gone now. I think they pulled the plug on the servers years ago. But it wasn't that bad.
3263000	3267000	Wheeling the two swords in two hands is really awesome, anyway.
3268000	3272000	Moving on. Well, since we won't have Phantasy Star Online 2 to play in the States,
3272000	3275000	I guess I can look forward to this game and that makes me very excited.
3275000	3282000	It's Super Mario Maker. Super Mario Maker, some more details were revealed in advance of the September 11th release date,
3282000	3286000	which I love that they're releasing this, on Loki's birthday. How appropriate.
3286000	3288000	I keep watching videos for it. It looks cool.
3288000	3289000	Yeah, it does look cool.
3289000	3294000	I'm digging it, but once again, I was at Walmart the other day, because I needed the router fast,
3294000	3299000	and I looked at the system like, how much do we use now? $2.99? No, fuck that.
3299000	3304000	That's pretty much what it is. That price is not going to sell me. I'm sorry.
3304000	3307000	Well, a lot of people are excited about some of the things they saw in the video,
3307000	3311000	including a lot of the different features that will be in there and things that you can do to the different levels.
3311000	3318000	But some people are very upset about the whole fact that it will take nine days to unlock all the content.
3318000	3324000	That's right, they're going to slowly release content. It's not like DLC thing, like what they're doing with Splatoon,
3324000	3331000	but it's because you're going to, you go in and you edit a level, and as long as you spend five minutes in the level editor
3331000	3335000	with the tools that you have, you'll get new tools the very next day.
3335000	3342000	And I guess the concept behind this is they don't want to overwhelm you by throwing all the tools at you at once,
3342000	3351000	which I kind of get it. I actually kind of get that. And to be fair, LittleBigPlanet gated its stuff as well.
3351000	3357000	It wasn't a day release, it wasn't a 24 hour time lock, but you did have to play through the single player campaign
3357000	3362000	to get all the bubbles that would unlock all the mechanics that you would end up using in the level editors,
3362000	3365000	especially when it came to cosmetic things.
3365000	3372000	Okay, so it's a little bit apples to oranges, but I kind of understand the whole, you got to teach somebody to do a simple level
3372000	3378000	before they can just do a complicated level. I'm not, I don't know. I saw a lot of outrage on Twitter and stuff at this,
3378000	3383000	and I actually like, you know, I'll call Nintendo out when I have a problem with what they're doing,
3383000	3388000	but this doesn't seem like the greatest of crimes they've ever committed. It's just nine days.
3388000	3394000	And I'm sure as a lot of people are figuring out, you could just change the clock on your Wii U.
3394000	3396000	We were just talking about time shifting.
3396000	3402000	If you need it that bad, just do what you did in Animal Crossing and set the clock ahead, and there you go.
3402000	3408000	Problem solved. You can unlock everything. But you still will have to spend five minutes with the current set of tools.
3408000	3414000	I mean, I kind of think it'll be a bigger pain in the ass to set the clock forward all the time than to just fucking wait.
3414000	3420000	It's not, I mean, I feel like you can do a lot with the tools that'll be there already.
3420000	3426000	It's gonna start a lot of people on creating a very basic level and then improving that level over and over.
3426000	3433000	I don't know. I just, it's nine days, not thirty. I just think this isn't the biggest deal in the whole wide world.
3433000	3439000	Loki, you usually, if you've got a problem with Nintendo, you're one to say it. Do you think this is an issue or nah?
3439000	3443000	No, because you can just easily take like ten minutes, well probably more than ten minutes,
3443000	3448000	but you can take less than an hour to time shift it nine times and just unlock it that way.
3448000	3455000	It's an inconvenience and it's kind of stupid, yes, but whatever. I understand their point, but I don't agree with it.
3455000	3463000	Alright, well one other thing to point out about Super Mario Maker is that it's going to be compatible with over fifty amiibo.
3463000	3467000	You don't say. Amiibo support in Super Mario Maker.
3467000	3473000	But what it's gonna do is it will allow you to, I guess, place the character in a question mark block,
3473000	3477000	so when you play the level, you can transform Mario into that character.
3477000	3485000	There's some exceptions. I think the actual 8-bit Mario amiibo will put mustaches on all the enemies. Silly little things like that.
3485000	3489000	But I was, you know, and in the video they show Link...
3489000	3492000	No, that one made Mario super big.
3492000	3498000	Oh, wait, which one's the one that puts mustaches on the monsters? There's two of them, right?
3498000	3505000	I don't remember, but like the 8-bit Mario that allowed you to put like a big mushroom into one of the blocks and you can make Mario extra huge.
3505000	3509000	Got it, that's right, and I remember seeing that as well. So there's maybe one does one and one does the other.
3509000	3514000	But anyway, oh, Dartusuya says the giant Mario does both those things, so we're both right.
3514000	3522000	Okay, but the other thing, and in the video they show Mario turning into Link, and I think they show Wii Fit Trainer in the video as well.
3522000	3527000	But if you go look at the list of compatible amiibo, there's some pretty funny ones in there,
3527000	3531000	because some of the Animal Crossing characters that are gonna be amiibo are gonna be playable in this game.
3531000	3532000	Sonic?
3532000	3540000	Sonic is one of the amiibo! So that means that you can play as Sonic in Mario Bros.
3540000	3543000	Now, hold on people, I don't mean that you're gonna...
3543000	3544000	The universe will implode.
3544000	3547000	Yeah, you're not gonna be able to spin dash through blocks or anything like that.
3547000	3557000	It's gonna look like one of those crappy 8-bit ROM hacks back in the day, like when people would do like super nude Luigi ball sack or whatever.
3557000	3562000	You know, people did Super Penis Bros., where just everything was a dick that you would play in the game, right?
3562000	3565000	Remember these ROM hacks? When things like...
3565000	3569000	Oh God, what was that Nintendo emulator everybody used back in the day?
3569000	3570000	Nesticle?
3570000	3575000	Nesticle! Because it had a dirty name. Nesticle. And Genesis, remember?
3575000	3579000	Everybody had these stupid ROM hacks and patches.
3579000	3584000	That's what it's gonna look like. You're gonna have Sonic, but it'll play like Mario, which it happens to be Sonic.
3584000	3588000	And Pac-Man and Mega Man, also on the list.
3588000	3589000	And Kirby.
3589000	3599000	And Kirby! So I just think that's hilarious that after all these years, finally, Sonic playable in a Mario game. Like that.
3602000	3610000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh man, Bloodlust Software. Those guys really knew their stuff back in the day. Wasn't it just one dude?
3610000	3613000	I don't think it was like a whole team. I thought it was just one dude who was just kind of a...
3613000	3617000	I'm curious to see what they look like, because I know they have the 8-bit versions and the Super Mario version.
3617000	3621000	But what about other, because you can switch it between Mario 3 and all those.
3621000	3625000	They look like the 16-bit versions in Mario World.
3625000	3628000	They probably share a lot of the similar looks that they have in Smash Brothers.
3628000	3632000	I would imagine maybe they recycled some of the shapes and things from that. We'll see.
3634000	3639000	Well that's pretty cool, because I have a nice growing collection of Amiibo.
3639000	3646000	Growing way more than it should have, but I kind of like a lot the Amiibo that I have.
3646000	3651000	And last week, thanks to AkumaJP, I now have a Pac-Man and a Greninja from Japan.
3651000	3657000	So hey, I'm happy. I wanted a Pac-Man, because I actually play Pac-Man in Smash Brothers.
3657000	3659000	It's like one of my three characters I use all the time.
3659000	3662000	So now I have all my actual characters in Smash Brothers.
3662000	3665000	I have a Ness, I have a Wii Fit Trainer, and I have a Pac-Man.
3665000	3670000	I had to go to Japan to get, well I didn't actually go to Japan, but I had to turn to the Japanese market to get all of them.
3670000	3672000	But I have them.
3674000	3677000	Almost to release dates, but first, Dark Sakura.
3677000	3679000	Yes.
3679000	3682000	Did you play, did you play Nesticle back in the day?
3682000	3685000	Hell yeah, I had it on Linux.
3685000	3688000	On my little teensy netbook, it's what I'd play in class.
3688000	3690000	I feel like Nesticle ran on my 486.
3690000	3698000	Actually, I didn't play Genesis. I played Gens, which was the only one I had that could play Panorama Cotton.
3698000	3700000	Oh, right.
3700000	3702000	Panorama Cotton was notoriously...
3702000	3705000	There's always that one game. That one game that you have to play in the emulator.
3705000	3711000	It was just notoriously difficult to run because of all of the scrolling and everything it did.
3711000	3714000	So, but back to some Nintendo news.
3714000	3719000	They actually pulled a game out of the 3DS eShop because it had been hacked.
3719000	3721000	Well, not really.
3721000	3724000	It was one you could use to enable homebrew games and software.
3724000	3730000	It was a game called Ironfall Invasion.
3730000	3739000	Basically, they created this thing called the Iron Hacks Exploit, which would let you go get, you know, your own homebrew on there.
3739000	3743000	And everyone really, really wanted it.
3743000	3748000	It was actually announced by a coder named Smeelum, I guess how he goes.
3748000	3750000	Jordan Smeelum Rabbit.
3750000	3758000	Who basically posted on Twitter, everyone interested in 3DS homebrew should get Ironfall from the eShop for free.
3758000	3761000	Tell your friends about it. Please retweet.
3761000	3763000	So it was supposed...
3763000	3766000	The method was supposed to launch this week.
3767000	3770000	And basically, Nintendo yanked it.
3770000	3776000	And the guy behind it apologized to the developer for causing the removal of the game.
3779000	3786000	But the game was downloaded several hundred thousand times before the exploit was announced.
3786000	3790000	Of course. Well, the exploit was announced somewhere.
3790000	3797000	They announced which game the expo was going to work with before the exploit was released.
3797000	3800000	But look at Cubic Ninja and how expensive that is now.
3800000	3803000	It's because there was an exploit in that to run the homebrew channel on there.
3805000	3806000	There you go.
3806000	3810000	Yeah, and this isn't something exclusive to Nintendo.
3810000	3814000	Like, I think about this happened on iOS.
3814000	3817000	Is that there was a game that was on the App Store for free.
3817000	3821000	And it ran one of the public domain MAME games.
3821000	3824000	You know, it's public domain so you can do whatever you want with it.
3824000	3827000	I think it was like Mr. Robot or something like that. You download it.
3827000	3831000	And it was actually the full MAME emulator on your device.
3831000	3835000	So you use something like iFunBox or something to go into your iPad or your iOS.
3835000	3838000	You just dump the other zip files in there and congrats.
3838000	3841000	You got a MAME emulator on your iPad or your iPhone.
3841000	3844000	Now, it took Apple a week to pull that thing from the store.
3844000	3846000	But so many people went and downloaded this app.
3846000	3850000	And once you got it, you got it on your device.
3850000	3853000	Unless they do a PT.
3853000	3855000	I don't know if they did.
3855000	3861000	Only if you have saved the downloaded version on your computer would you be able to bring something like that back?
3861000	3867000	If you delete the file, then it's not downloadable again.
3867000	3870000	Which is why I keep a backup in my iTunes, always.
3870000	3872000	Not everyone does.
3872000	3874000	Not everyone does, no.
3874000	3876000	So there it is. Oh, Dark Tetsuya says it was Robbie Roto.
3876000	3880000	As I recall, the original creator released it to the public domain since years ago.
3880000	3882000	That's right. That sounds right.
3882000	3889000	So again, these types of like openly hackable things are not exclusive to Nintendo.
3889000	3892000	Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out release dates.
3892000	3894000	Let's see what bugged games are coming out next.
3895000	3904000	So we've got this week Dungeon Travelers 2, the Royal Library, and the Monster Seal for the Vita.
3904000	3906000	A Vita game?
3906000	3909000	Yeah, a Vita. I know. Shocking.
3909000	3913000	Hell Divers Super Earth Ultimate Edition.
3913000	3917000	They're getting a boxed version of that that's coming out on PlayStation 4.
3917000	3924000	And then LBX Little Battlers Experience for Nintendo 3DS.
3924000	3930000	That's one of those first party titles that no one knows is coming out and then it comes out.
3932000	3934000	Surprise! Surprise release.
3934000	3937000	Surprise! There was no Nintendo Direct about that title.
3937000	3939000	Alright, is that it?
3939000	3940000	That would be it.
3940000	3943000	Alright, traveling to Japan. It's a very quiet week this week in Japan.
3944000	3948000	But on the PlayStation Vita, we have Romeo vs Juliet, the all-chapter pack.
3948000	3953000	I think I mentioned this one last week because it was a very slow week last week as well.
3953000	3958000	And then on the Nintendo 3DS even, there's Super Robot Taisen BX, but that's really it.
3958000	3964000	We start to get some more stuff next week, such as the Dragon Quest VIII remake is out next week.
3964000	3966000	And I think a lot of you are going to be into that.
3966000	3969000	But for this week, things remain pretty quiet in Japan.
3969000	3971000	How about Europe? Dark Sakura?
3971000	3979000	There are a few things. What we have on the 18th is Final Fantasy Type 0 HD for PC, Fingered.
3979000	3986000	Volume for Vita and PlayStation 4 PC. Also, Zombie for PC and PS4 and Xbox One.
3986000	3992000	Oh, that's right. That's this week. The Zombie thing. The Wii U one that's now on other systems. That's right.
3992000	3999000	Yes. On the 19th, we have Smite for Xbox One. And the 20th, we have Trine 3, the Artifacts of Power for PC.
4000000	4001000	Nice.
4001000	4002000	That's it.
4002000	4006000	Just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week. Loki.
4006000	4015000	Alright. So, Disney Magic Kingdoms was a title that they kind of announced during D23.
4015000	4025000	And what is Disney Magic Kingdoms? Well, it's kind of an iOS or a mobile game where you basically design your own Disneyland or Disney World or whatever.
4026000	4031000	And they have lots of crap that you can pull in there. I guess sort of like a rollercoaster tycoon game.
4031000	4038000	But I remember they showed you can even add Flynn's Arcade in there. So that was pretty cool. Still no Tron game.
4038000	4042000	Wait, so I can have a Disney park with a proper Tron arcade? Thank God.
4042000	4043000	You can, yes.
4043000	4045000	The world is going to be correct somewhere.
4045000	4053000	Yes, and it's being put out by Gameloft. No word on when that's going to be out. I'm guessing this is probably going to be free to play when it comes out.
4053000	4059000	It sounds like a free to play game. So we'll have to wait and see. I think that was announced today.
4059000	4063000	I'll check it out. Yeah, it's probably part of D23. It was probably this weekend at some point.
4063000	4066000	I'll check it out. It sounds like fun.
4066000	4075000	Anyhow, last but not least before we get to the classic game of the week, we'll talk about Nintendo and why they don't do annual franchises.
4075000	4082000	I mean, let's be real. Nintendo does have a tendency to always put out that Mario game or that Zelda game or a Mario Kart game.
4082000	4089000	But they don't do it every year. We're not talking like Madden, FIFA, Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed. Nintendo's really not at that level.
4089000	4097000	And why is that? Talking to the examiner, the executive VP of sales at Nintendo of America, Scott Moffett said,
4097000	4103000	We tend not to annualize our franchises. There's not a new Mario Kart every year.
4103000	4109000	What we've tried to do with the Wii U is first create a fully featured, really enjoyable game that is something for everybody,
4109000	4114000	has surprises that you'll discover as you play through levels, and it gives you a good amount of quality entertainment.
4114000	4122000	For fans who love Mario Kart, we've released extra content over time so that it keeps the game fresh and allows them to experience more than they could when they originally bought the game.
4122000	4130000	That's the approach we take. Rather than annualizing the franchise, we're periodically releasing new courses, levels, and features that keep people playing.
4130000	4134000	We see a huge surge in gameplay hours on Mario Kart when we release new content.
4134000	4140000	We take different approaches with different franchises. If you look at the Pokémon franchise, we've released multiple core games for 3DS.
4140000	4149000	We like to give Pokémon fans something every year, but something like Mario Kart or Smash Brothers, there may be only one version of that franchise in the whole console cycle.
4149000	4156000	It all depends on the franchise, the developer, and what new ideas they can bring to the franchise to move the gameplay forward and keep the franchise fresh.
4157000	4164000	I think we always need to innovate and we need to always bring new ideas and new thoughts, but they have to be sufficient enough to justify the next release.
4164000	4168000	Small incremental changes may not be worth a whole new release.
4168000	4183000	I like that perspective. I still feel like this is a lot of new ground for Nintendo because that whole enhancing the game that's already out there through DLC is something really unique to this generation with the 3DS and the Wii U.
4183000	4195000	That's not something Nintendo's really been able to do before, but certainly I do like the way that Mario Kart 8 lasted for 18 months through the game coming out.
4195000	4208000	Then you've got the Zelda DLC, then the Animal Crossing DLC, the 250cc. They've been giving little bumps to that game to keep it current without you having to buy Mario Kart 9 to get these courses.
4208000	4210000	That I can appreciate.
4211000	4218000	But they do that with every single game that comes out now. They act like, look, we take this really original approach about keeping our games fresh. Fuck you.
4218000	4226000	You know what? Seriously, you have done what every fucking publisher of a game has done for the last several years.
4226000	4234000	You release a game, you do updates for it, you release DLC, and you know what? Those publishers still do an annual series or whatever.
4234000	4236000	Let's put some more DLC out before it then.
4236000	4243000	I was gonna say, wait a minute, I don't get the anger because Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty, they do all of that. And they're yearly.
4243000	4255000	Exactly. That's exactly my point. Is that they're acting like this is some unique thing that they're taking a completely different approach when they're doing the exact fucking thing that everybody else is doing.
4255000	4263000	Would you rather, just to be clear, would you rather that there is a Mario Kart 9 and then a Mario Kart 10 next year and a Mario Kart 11 the year?
4263000	4267000	You wanna see Nintendo go annual so that there's more of it?
4267000	4274000	No, I'm saying if they're trying to, if they're gonna tout themselves as taking an original approach, make it fucking original.
4274000	4280000	Put more DLC out there. Make it so that there's a lot more tracks. Because people want more tracks.
4280000	4290000	I have to be honest though, and I truly believe this, I think Nintendo is putting some of the best DLC out there. Like their DLC is very well-rounded.
4290000	4298000	You know, those Mario, or the Mario Kart tracks are not just like some BS little additional thing to the game. Like it's a really impressive start.
4298000	4305000	No, I understand. They're not BS little additions to the game. Those would be the amiibos that are the meaningless BS things that they add to the game.
4306000	4313000	No, so they do spend the time putting out quality stuff for those games. And let's be honest, they put out quality games.
4313000	4320000	But, they're not doing anything unique. They're just doing what everybody else is doing. So stop fucking touting it.
4320000	4324000	Like, just say, listen, we're just doing what everybody else is doing and it's working for us. Cool. That's it.
4324000	4331000	You don't have to be like, listen, we're doing something completely different. We don't want to do it this way because, you know what, fuck it.
4331000	4334000	You would do it if you had the manpower to fucking turn out those games.
4334000	4337000	We use capabilities are limited and nobody's gonna say that. Nobody's gonna fucking do that.
4337000	4344000	It's because, listen, we put out another fucking game but we got a new system coming and we'll put out the game on that. So that's what it really comes down to.
4344000	4353000	Alright, let's travel back to a time when things were simpler. You know what, there was no patching. You put out the game and if it was fucked up, oh well.
4353000	4365000	That's why we tested things. It's the classic game of the week. Dark Soccer's gonna step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful little brats.
4365000	4370000	Play this game and then get off my lawn. Get off my lawn while you're playing this game.
4370000	4373000	Just go play the game on someone else's lawn.
4373000	4381000	Go play, exactly. Go play the game on Loki's lawn. Alright, it's the classic game of the week and a very, very appropriate timed one this week, right, Dark Soccer?
4381000	4383000	Indeed. That's why I picked it.
4383000	4396000	In light of D23 and the announcement of Star Wars Land, or whatever it will be called, at the Disney parks, I've decided to go with the 1983 Star Wars game from Atari.
4396000	4400000	Atari is awesome.
4401000	4411000	So it was basically a first person space simulator and it had the, basically it was just the Attack on the Death Star over and over.
4411000	4426000	It was made with 3D color vector graphics and it is probably one of the best games of its age, especially since everything else around that time was all vector-y too.
4426000	4430000	And the music in it was really good, I mean, just for the built-in time.
4430000	4442000	The age has treated this game very well. Not a lot of games from this era have aged well, but I believe Star Wars is still a shitload of fun to play.
4442000	4448000	It is. And I love being able to find a game that's still in really nice, vivid condition.
4448000	4456000	So basically you go through the three attack phases. You are Luke Skywalker, or Red Five, as he pilots the X-Wing.
4456000	4461000	And you don't have to kill every enemy to advance, you just have to survive through the level.
4461000	4468000	So, you know, and every time that you get hit takes away one shield of the six that you start with.
4468000	4474000	So in the first game, you're in outer space and you have to do the dogfight with Darth Vader and TIE Fighters.
4474000	4484000	And the second one, you basically need to shoot down turrets. And the last one is the trench run at the Death Star.
4484000	4487000	The trench run stages are the best. Best, best, best.
4487000	4498000	And if you manage to destroy the Death Star without firing at anything except the exhaust port, you get the using of the force bonus.
4498000	4501000	Achievement. Achievements, guys.
4501000	4515000	So, it used voice samples from the movie. You had Mark Hamill, Alec Guinness, James Earl Jones, Harrison Ford, and R2-D2 and the growling growls of Chewbacca.
4516000	4518000	Thank you.
4518000	4524000	The world record actually has been set and reset several times.
4524000	4531000	In 1984, it was 300 million points in 49 hours, which is the world record for an individual.
4531000	4540000	2005, it went to 54 hours on the single credit with a score of 283 million. That's the longest endurance record, sorry.
4541000	4554000	And then a group played for 5 days, 2 hours and 26 minutes on the single credit to get the world record score of 1 billion and 12 points.
4554000	4557000	I love that it's 1 billion and 12.
4557000	4558000	Yeah.
4558000	4566000	So, as far as home versions, they were designed, well, the original was designed by Mike Hallie for Atari.
4566000	4571000	Parker Brothers converted it in 83 and 84 to 8-bit consoles and computers.
4571000	4578000	So, you have Atari 2600, 5200, the Atari 8-bit systems, ColecoVision, the Commodore 64.
4578000	4583000	The ColecoVision version was designed by Wendell Brown.
4583000	4587000	And I'm actually looking at what else Wendell Brown did.
4587000	4593000	Can I just say while you're looking that up how damn impressive this game was on 2600, all things considered?
4593000	4601000	I don't, I think I was missing one of the levels, I don't remember, but, like, for a 2600 game? Seriously, this game was great.
4601000	4604000	By the way, Wendell Brown did a bunch of Intellivision games.
4605000	4616000	Other conversions that were out in 87 and 88, we had Amiga, Atari ST, the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, Acorn Electron, BBC Micro, and Enterprise 64.
4616000	4620000	Again, converted for the Atari 8-bits and Commodore 64.
4620000	4628000	There were Apple II, Macintosh, Commodore 64, and DOS versions in 1988.
4628000	4632000	The closest being the Amiga and Atari ST versions.
4633000	4642000	So, on the Nintendo GameCube Star Wars Rogue Squadron 3 Rebel Strike, you could also unlock this, Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi.
4642000	4644000	So, there you go.
4645000	4651000	Hey, I don't know if this is, like, on your resource or in your brain, but what was up with the hidden messages on the Death Star?
4651000	4655000	Like, if you looked really carefully, like, as you would zoom into the Death Star, there's usually, like, messages written on it.
4655000	4657000	Bye Atari, bye Atari, bye Atari, bye Atari.
4657000	4660000	Yeah, or like you would say, like, use the force, or like, there's all these, like...
4660000	4662000	They're not very hidden, but yeah.
4662000	4666000	Well, you know what I mean. Like, it's subliminal. Subliminal messages.
4666000	4668000	Yeah, worship Satan, smoke crack.
4668000	4669000	Drink your Oval Team.
4669000	4670000	What?
4670000	4671000	Drink your Oval Team.
4671000	4676000	Wholesome fun, wholesome fun. Bye Atari. Bye our games, dammit.
4676000	4683000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, the vector version of Star Wars by Atari.
4683000	4688000	The old school Star Wars Atari arcade game, which is seriously one of my all-time favorite games.
4688000	4693000	Seriously, Disney needs to bring back, you know, these old vector games, like Tron.
4693000	4697000	Right? Well, they had the Xbox 360 version of Tron, to be fair.
4697000	4701000	But anyway, Brad from Pod Culture, very excited about this pick, saying,
4701000	4705000	Best game ever, I will kick a puppy to have an arcade version of this.
4705000	4708000	Don't kick a puppy.
4708000	4711000	Dungeon Buster says, yay, vector Star Wars.
4711000	4717000	Fun fact, the control stick was also used in Atari's only laser-diss game, Firefox.
4717000	4721000	SG100Matt says, my summer camp as a kid had an arcade with a few games in it,
4721000	4723000	and one of the games they had there was this.
4723000	4726000	It was the sit-down cab, which is apparently hard to find.
4726000	4731000	Did you know, DarkSahara, they used to have, at the Sunrise Mall tilt,
4731000	4734000	this is how old that was, it was a long time ago, right?
4734000	4736000	They used to have a sit-down Star Wars cab.
4736000	4737000	I remember playing it when I was a kid.
4737000	4742000	Did you know, Rob, that they had a sit-down Star Wars cab at Crestview Lanes before they closed the arcade?
4742000	4743000	No, I did not.
4743000	4746000	I wonder if it's the one that used to be at Sunrise Mall.
4746000	4748000	Well, keep in mind, that's the same place they used to go play Air Guys.
4748000	4749000	That's awesome.
4749000	4750000	And Blazing Star.
4750000	4754000	I miss Crestview Lanes, that place was so amazingly ghetto.
4754000	4755000	Love that place.
4755000	4756000	I miss real arcades.
4756000	4758000	It's officially been torn down.
4758000	4759000	Yeah, I know.
4759000	4760000	It's gone.
4760000	4761000	What are they building, a Walmart?
4761000	4762000	Fuck, if I know.
4762000	4763000	Panera Bread.
4763000	4765000	Crestview Walmart.
4765000	4769000	Anyhow, alright, that's going to do it for this first half of the show,
4769000	4772000	but we have plenty more show to come,
4772000	4775000	including the FUGO Question of the Week, rapid fire news,
4775000	4778000	your emails, if there are any, because there weren't when I checked earlier.
4778000	4781000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, the FUs of the Week, and...
4781000	4783000	I'm really not that mad at long emails, y'all.
4783000	4785000	And Maple Bacon Chips.
4785000	4786000	And Maple Bacon Chips.
4786000	4788000	Maple Bacon Chips, eat them.
4788000	4789000	I will, during break.
4789000	4792000	We'll be back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
4792000	4801000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio,
4801000	4805000	live on this Sunday evening, August the 16th, 2015,
4805000	4808000	with episode number 610 of our show already in progress.
4808000	4812000	We're going to get to some rapid fire news and your calls a little later.
4812000	4816000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4816000	4820000	First, I thought I'd give you all a little bit of a personal life update in some ways,
4820000	4823000	because sometimes we talk about our personal lives on this show once in a while,
4823000	4827000	and this might actually give a little insight to some of the things I've been saying in the past couple weeks on the show,
4827000	4829000	because there was something going on that I kind of had to keep a secret,
4829000	4831000	but I don't have to keep it a secret anymore.
4831000	4836000	So I can actually say that this week, I'm going to talk about my day job.
4836000	4841000	I don't do that a lot on this show because I don't like to mix my day job with what we do here,
4841000	4844000	but certainly it's a big part of my life.
4844000	4847000	It pays the bills. It pays for this show.
4847000	4858000	But I actually resigned from my job of the past 14 years this week, and it's a job I've had longer than I've been doing OLR.
4858000	4862000	For the longest time, I could say my job is the thing I've had longest in my life,
4862000	4864000	longer than any relationship, longer than OLR.
4864000	4870000	Now, OLR is the longest thing I've had in my life as of this Friday because I get my two-week notice on Monday.
4870000	4876000	I do have another job lined up. It's not like I did not quit out of malice or anything.
4876000	4878000	I'm pissed off or anything. No, it's nothing like that.
4878000	4884000	It's just that I got an amazing opportunity with another company in the same field that I do now.
4884000	4891000	I don't get too much into the details of my work because, again, I just don't need people trying to find me at work.
4891000	4894000	That's very awkward. But I'm a corporate trainer by day.
4894000	4902000	So, yes, I get paid to talk to people all day long and teach them about the wide, wonderful world of our industry and all that.
4902000	4908000	So, I'm going to be doing corporate training for a similar type of company here in the area,
4908000	4912000	but it's more of a ground-level growth type of thing.
4912000	4916000	So, I'm very, very excited about it, even though that's a huge change.
4916000	4918000	So, I'm a little bit freaked out about it.
4918000	4925000	So, if next Sunday's show is cut just a little bit short so I can get to bed at a decent hour, you'll understand why,
4925000	4927000	because I got that going on.
4927000	4931000	So, yes, it's going to be some big changes ahead for me, but I'm very excited about it.
4931000	4933000	DragonCon is still on, despite all that.
4933000	4939000	I got a message from Travis Donovan over at Understation Live when I made the announcement that I was leaving the job and starting anew.
4939000	4941000	He's like, are you going to be able to go to DragonCon still?
4941000	4943000	I'm like, yes, yes. I worked that all out.
4943000	4945000	I told him up front, I already have plane tickets to Atlanta.
4945000	4946000	Can we work around that?
4946000	4949000	And they were very, very accommodating with that.
4949000	4951000	DungeonBuster in chat says,
4951000	4955000	Grats on class change. Distribute those new points well.
4955000	4957000	That's a great way of putting it.
4957000	4959000	Thank you very much, DungeonBuster. I appreciate that.
4959000	4961000	And that's Jonah to Matt says, good for you, Rob.
4961000	4963000	You deserve a better opportunity and we're all here to support you.
4963000	4965000	Thank you so much. I really appreciate that.
4965000	4969000	And I can say this, I don't work in the games industry.
4969000	4973000	We're going to get into a story a little later on that will probably tell you why I don't.
4973000	4977000	But in the meantime, let's get into some rapid fire news. Loki.
4977000	4979000	I wouldn't know anything about that there.
4979000	4983000	About working in the games industry and the radio show.
4983000	4987000	Yeah, I think we might have all shot ourselves in the foot on that, but we'll see.
4989000	4995000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase PROFIT.
4995000	4997000	So this is kind of cool.
4997000	5003000	CGProticRed has released mod support for Witcher 3, the Wild Hunt.
5003000	5011000	And they have a nice picture of a unicorn with, looks like, star makeup on its eyes.
5011000	5013000	I don't know. That's pretty cool.
5013000	5020000	But yes, apparently you can use Nexus mods and you're able to incorporate all sorts of mods into the game now.
5020000	5024000	So look for those nudity mods right around the corner.
5024000	5027000	Not already there, I'm sure. First thing out the gate.
5027000	5029000	So, awesome.
5029000	5031000	This is kind of cool.
5031000	5034000	There's a Final Fantasy VII remake coming.
5034000	5036000	And no, I'm not talking about the one that Sony's doing.
5036000	5040000	This is actually a fan-made 2D action game remake.
5040000	5043000	And this is done by PD Design Studio.
5043000	5045000	They're a small indie developer.
5045000	5052000	And what they did is they put together a proof of concept playable demo that you can check out and play.
5052000	5055000	So, let's see.
5055000	5062000	The actual website that you can download that would be ffvii-reimagine.com.
5062000	5064000	And it looks pretty cool.
5064000	5066000	I watched the video, I haven't played the demo yet.
5066000	5068000	But I'd play that.
5069000	5071000	If they're going to be giving it away, sure, why not.
5071000	5074000	Yeah, play it now while it's still up on the internet.
5074000	5078000	Well, Loki, once it's on the internet, it'll always be on the internet.
5078000	5081000	It might just be a little harder to find than it used to be.
5081000	5083000	Darktedsuya in our chat saying,
5083000	5088000	That reminds me, I never did finish playing that fixed translated version of that Chinese bootleg Famicom edition.
5088000	5090000	Oh yeah, that didn't look very fun though.
5090000	5091000	Try saying that five times fast.
5091000	5093000	That didn't look very fun.
5094000	5100000	If you're a PlayStation Plus member, you're going to get some additional rock band songs with your pre-order.
5100000	5113000	So, you'll get ten exclusive tracks. Those include All That Remains, Divide, Blitz Kids, Run For Cover, Bring Me The Horizon, Throne, Dead Sarah, Mona Lisa, Duran Duran, The Reflex.
5113000	5114000	That's awesome.
5114000	5115000	Hell yes.
5115000	5116000	Janis Joplin, Move Over.
5116000	5117000	Hell yes.
5117000	5119000	Of Mice and Men, Would You Still Be There?
5120000	5132000	Oh Honey, Sugar You, Pantera, Cowboys From Hell, Live From the Monsters in Moscow Festival, and Seastick Steve, Summertime Boy.
5132000	5134000	And yes.
5134000	5143000	So basically, if you do a digital pre-order, you'll get a rock band 4 theme, and you'll be able to get those free songs.
5143000	5152000	Maybe an attempt to sway people who are like, I'm going to buy it on Xbox One because all of my songs are on 360. Because I'm in that camp right now.
5152000	5162000	So, my question is though, are the old instruments working with the new game? Because how the fuck are you going to play those songs if you don't buy the game?
5162000	5166000	I think I heard they're trying, and that's where things were at right at the last turn.
5166000	5173000	You might want to just avoid buying those songs right away and maybe, I don't know, think about it.
5173000	5182000	Because that does seem kind of a sticking point there. How does one buy that game digitally if there are no instruments for it?
5182000	5184000	Did they purchase those separately?
5184000	5186000	Maybe. We'll see.
5186000	5191000	Anyhow, moving on, talking about some of the news around the world of gaming.
5191000	5197000	This is a book that Loki's talked a lot about on the show, and I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with. Ready Player One.
5197000	5201000	And I think a lot of you are aware that they are turning this into a movie.
5201000	5203000	2017!
5203000	5205000	Steven Spielberg. You're very excited, aren't you?
5205000	5207000	Steven Spielberg is the one that's going to be directing this.
5207000	5213000	Well, in the book, which I must admit I haven't read, although I feel like I have because Loki's told me all about it.
5213000	5215000	You need to read it. I can load it to you.
5215000	5217000	I might actually take you up on that.
5217000	5227000	There's a character in the book named James Halliday who's kind of like, and correct me if I'm wrong, he's kind of like a Willy Wonka-esque kind of figure where he's the one that's putting him on.
5227000	5229000	Well, here's the crazy part.
5229000	5237000	Steven Spielberg, the rumor is out there, and granted this is coming from Ain't It Cool News, so here's an entire salt shaker to go with this rumor.
5237000	5252000	But the rumor is that Steven Spielberg is trying to court Gene Wilder to actually play this character who was Willy Wonka in the 70s version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
5252000	5254000	Didn't he quit acting after?
5254000	5258000	He did. So if he were to do this, this would be him coming out of retirement.
5258000	5263000	I believe he did do at least one movie after Gilda passed away.
5263000	5273000	I think he did something in the early 2000s, but after his wife, you guys may or may not know, he was married to Gilda Radner, one of the original Saturday Night Live players.
5273000	5282000	Hysterical woman. One of my inspirations, quite frankly. She's so fucking funny if you go back and watch just her old stand-ups and all that, but she tragically passed away.
5282000	5285000	Just listen to Let's Talk Dirty to the Animals.
5285000	5287000	Or just watch any Roseanne Roseannadanna sketch.
5287000	5289000	That's it. That's going to be the fortune cookie.
5289000	5299000	So anyway, go check that out. But anyway, ever since she tragically passed away, I think he really took over a lot of the charity work.
5299000	5305000	Gilda's Club and the things that she had left behind. So he hasn't been acting as much.
5305000	5308000	So for him to show up in this would be huge.
5308000	5313000	And the fact that it's like a video game 80s throwback thing is really cool if Gene Wilder would show up.
5313000	5315000	You seriously need to read the book. It's amazing.
5315000	5316000	I do.
5316000	5322000	I haven't read too much of it or listened to too much of Armada yet.
5322000	5328000	I'm not enjoying Armada as much as Ready Player One, but Ready Player One was exciting enough to where I just blazed through that.
5328000	5333000	What do you think of that casting? They're saying in chat, isn't Gene Wilder 82 years old? Yeah, he's 82.
5333000	5340000	I don't know if I'd see him as that character, but yeah, I still think it's cool.
5341000	5346000	They could cast it as somebody else and it would be fine, but it would be neat to see him.
5346000	5351000	As G-100 Matt wondering, I don't know how well he will fit. I have a feeling if they did it, it would be...
5351000	5358000	I don't want to say stunt casting, but it would definitely be for the fact that Gene Wilder is in the movie than maybe anything else.
5358000	5364000	I don't know. We'll see. Anyway, time will tell. They've got to start filming that real soon if it's coming out in 2017.
5364000	5366000	It's December 2017, so...
5366000	5368000	We have a little time.
5368000	5373000	Anyhow, did you know that Square Enix has a streaming game service because Loki didn't?
5373000	5375000	No, I did not know. I was like, what?
5375000	5380000	Even though we talked about it, it was a long time ago. We talk about it a lot on OLR. I forget all the things we talk about too.
5380000	5385000	Sometimes I have to go to Dark Tetsuya and be like, did we ever talk about this? He's the one that knows.
5385000	5388000	Yeah, it was episode number 487. What are you talking about?
5388000	5393000	So anyway, Square Enix is actually going to be shutting down Dive In.
5393000	5396000	It was a game streaming service that they actually had last year.
5396000	5399000	You probably haven't heard of it because it was only in Japan.
5399000	5403000	It's not something that they actually had here in the US. That's probably why many of you haven't heard of it.
5403000	5407000	Maybe AkumaJP has heard of it. I don't know. Or whoever else is in Japan listening.
5407000	5415000	This is a way that you could rent titles like Final Fantasy XIII or Season of Mystery on your iOS or Android device.
5415000	5421000	And so how much you pay for the games, that just depended on how long you wanted to play them.
5421000	5425000	But you would get free demos for 30 minutes at no cost.
5425000	5431000	Now, I can only sit here going Final Fantasy XIII with touch-only controls does not...
5431000	5435000	Well, then again, I guess to play Final Fantasy XIII, you really only need one button.
5439000	5442000	But for some of the other more complex games, you might, you know, I just...
5442000	5451000	A controller on the... I don't know. That's always been my bitch about gaming on the tablets, no matter if it's Apple or whatever.
5451000	5456000	It doesn't lend itself well to the tangible controls.
5456000	5462000	And so, you know, when a game is designed with touch controls in mind, it works really well usually.
5462000	5464000	But these games don't usually translate over very well.
5464000	5467000	But this is also Japan and not America.
5467000	5472000	And I know the culture, especially when it comes to mobile gaming and so forth, is very, very different over there.
5473000	5481000	But I just think the Final Fantasy Record Keeper lends itself much better to a mobile experience than maybe Final Fantasy XIII would.
5481000	5482000	But that's my opinion.
5483000	5488000	Hey, somehow I got a story about Mass Effect. I must have stole this one from Dark Sakura.
5488000	5492000	But it's a story about Mass Effect Andromeda, and I'm sure she already knows.
5492000	5494000	But how many of you guys heard about this?
5494000	5498000	Well, there was actually a little bit of a Q&A going on on Twitter this week, not officially.
5498000	5505000	But Chris Nguyen, who is part of the development team, actually was talking a little bit on Twitter about some of the information with the game.
5505000	5509000	Including, are there going to be any familiar faces in Andromeda?
5509000	5513000	And Chris replied and said, story-wise, it wouldn't make much sense.
5513000	5520000	So don't expect that you're going to get to see Garrus and Caden and Rex and all them all over again.
5520000	5523000	We kind of already knew that. It was going to be a completely different part of the galaxy.
5523000	5527000	You still can't help but wonder if maybe there will be a cameo or something.
5527000	5529000	No, but anyway.
5529000	5536000	Also, apparently, some of the combat in the game is going to feel very similar to Mass Effect 3.
5536000	5543000	Which I enjoy hearing that because I think, you know, I did not care for Mass Effect 1 as much as I did 2 and 3.
5543000	5545000	Very similar between the 2 and 3, especially.
5545000	5549000	I thought the combat was great in 3 and multiplayer. I love that an awful lot.
5549000	5551000	So, very cool.
5551000	5556000	So, Mass Effect Andromeda, just a few details there on Twitter this week.
5558000	5562000	AkumaJP responding to my comment about, I'm not sure how the mobile thing goes in Japan.
5562000	5569000	He says, in Japan, less is good. We play most game and train where we can only use one hand while standing.
5569000	5572000	And that could lend itself as to why.
5572000	5574000	You know, you get the image of the crowded train.
5574000	5579000	One hand is probably holding onto a pole or a little leather strap thing so you don't go flying through the train.
5579000	5586000	That probably makes a game like Final Fantasy 13 very hard to play in that rare case you are hitting more than one button.
5586000	5590000	Or, yeah, I was going to say, not in Final Fantasy 13's case.
5590000	5594000	You do have to move lightning around the screen at one point on the map.
5594000	5597000	Even if you are going down a tunnel, sometimes you have to turn left and right.
5597000	5600000	You get to Chapter 10 eventually when you're on the world.
5600000	5603000	Alright, anyhow. Dark Sakura.
5603000	5606000	Well, this is, hold on.
5606000	5611000	Sorry, apparently my boobs can no longer hold up the microphone.
5611000	5615000	Well, have we talked about on the show your makeover today?
5615000	5617000	We haven't brought that up on the show yet.
5617000	5621000	Dark Sakura, sorry to distract from the topic at hand, but you all want to hear about Dark Sakura's hair, don't you?
5621000	5624000	Dark Sakura got her hair did today and it looks great.
5624000	5626000	I put pictures on my Tumblr.
5626000	5634000	She has this fade, this red to black fade going on and it's very, like, Dark Sakura has been touching herself all night.
5634000	5636000	And don't take that dirty, you dirty birdies.
5636000	5639000	Meaning she's been petting her hair, going, my hair feels great, I can't stop touching my hair.
5639000	5641000	And it is, your hair is like, fantastic.
5641000	5643000	I've been telling everyone to touch my hair.
5643000	5645000	You have? Anyway.
5645000	5647000	Where were we? Gaming, news, yes.
5649000	5651000	I was trying to find my Tumblr for people.
5651000	5653000	Oh, for people that don't know your Tumblr.
5653000	5662000	Anyway, there is a suggestion that there will be a third Taiko no Tatsujin or Taiko Drum Master for Wii U.
5662000	5674000	There is WiiU3.Taiko-CH.net that will, I guess they're thinking about doing another one.
5674000	5676000	That's still speculation.
5676000	5686000	But it was found from, but the second one came out with WiiU2.Taiko-CH.net.
5686000	5688000	So, who knows.
5688000	5694000	Also, there's going to be a new Pachi Slot game, yay, Bayonetta, yay.
5694000	5696000	Sega just wants the Pachi Slot money.
5696000	5698000	Whatever.
5698000	5700000	And-
5700000	5702000	Your favorite's becoming Pachinko Machines.
5702000	5704000	It's not just Konami.
5704000	5706000	Not even just Pachi, they're the slots of Pachi.
5706000	5708000	They're Pachi sluts.
5708000	5710000	But not just Konami.
5710000	5712000	Hey, you watch it, she's a strong female.
5712000	5714000	She don't take no shit from no man.
5714000	5717000	That's right, she's not going to take your dirty mouth over there calling her names.
5718000	5724000	Anyway, Epic Games has a warning out to the community that there are going to be phishing attacks.
5724000	5726000	Or that there are phishing attacks.
5726000	5729000	Saying they're officially coming from Epic Games, but it's a lie.
5729000	5731000	Lies.
5731000	5733000	Don't click it.
5735000	5746000	You remember how we used to, way back in the early days of OLR, we used to not make fun of, but we used to, I don't know, riff on the Don't Copy That Floppy anti-piracy song.
5746000	5750000	I think that Dark Soccer needs a version that's like, don't click that link.
5752000	5755000	You want to know what happens next? Don't click that link.
5756000	5758000	Don't tink that link.
5760000	5767000	Alright, but one link we do need to click on this show is on over to our Facebook and our Google Plus pages.
5767000	5771000	Because every week on this show we like to do the Fugal Question of the Week.
5777000	5784000	We're going to head on over to our Facebook and our Google Plus communities and ask a question that's on our mind this week.
5784000	5787000	And we want to know your answers. And this week it has to do with Kingdom Hearts.
5787000	5790000	You know, we're riding on the high of the Big Hero 6 being announced today.
5790000	5795000	So we want to know, what do you want to see? What land do you want to see in the Kingdom Hearts game next?
5795000	5799000	I was really worried that I asked this question before, but I didn't find it in a search.
5799000	5803000	And many of you answered and nobody said, hey dummy, you already asked this last month.
5803000	5805000	So if I asked it, it's been a long time.
5805000	5811000	Anyhow, William Murderface says, I may be the dissenting voice here, but I don't want any other worlds added.
5811000	5817000	At this point the story is wrapping up and the original Kingdom Hearts lore needs to take center stage otherwise, in my eyes at least.
5817000	5826000	Square Wriste turning one of the best original series into another tired cash cow that they shoved references into for money and fan wank.
5827000	5832000	What's wrong with fan wank though? It's some of the best parts of Final Fantasy XIV or fan wank, just saying.
5832000	5841000	No, but I respect that perspective. Chad B. replied and said, if I could get Treasure Planet or Atlantis, that'd be perfect.
5841000	5847000	Going deep into the Disney library. Those were some movies about 10 years ago that unfortunately didn't do so well.
5847000	5850000	It was a dark period for Disney, but I know those movies have their fans.
5850000	5855000	Silent Tom replied and said, I would love to see the Guardians of the Galaxy in Kingdom Hearts.
5855000	5859000	I would love to see Groot hanging with Donald and Goofy.
5859000	5863000	That would be pretty amazing. Would you be down for that dark soccer, the Guardians of the Galaxy in Kingdom Hearts?
5863000	5864000	Maybe.
5864000	5867000	Maybe? I think so. I like that. Let's see.
5867000	5875000	Nemesis 47 replied and said, I say Toy Story should finally get a world or even just Pixar in general along with Star Wars.
5875000	5876000	Lightsaber Keyblade anyone?
5876000	5877000	That's California Adventure.
5877000	5884000	I'm excited for Kingdom Hearts 3 having a big Hero 6 world. I love that movie a lot and Sora with Baymax sounds awesome to me.
5884000	5887000	One thing Kingdom Hearts 3 must get back to having is Kingdom Hearts 1's difficulty.
5887000	5893000	I felt Kingdom Hearts 2 was too easy. So much I rarely died, but most of those were when I was fighting Sephiroth.
5893000	5899000	Tiger Claw says, I'd love to see some Marvel characters show up in the game. Big Hero 6 was originally a Marvel comic.
5899000	5903000	Rage Nator says, I'll be frank. I don't give two shits about Disney. I was never a fan.
5903000	5910000	That being said, I never bought a game that has Disney properties in it, including Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.
5910000	5916000	That being said, whatever they announced next to be in Kingdom Hearts 3 doesn't apply to me.
5916000	5921000	Well, thank you very much for that very useful and insightful information, Rage Nator.
5926000	5930000	Andy R says, Star Wars or anything related to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
5930000	5934000	Really anything that hasn't already been excessively covered in the previous games.
5934000	5942000	AKA, can we please not go to Aladdin, Hercules, 100 Acre Woods, etc. that have been featured multiple times already.
5942000	5943000	I agree with that.
5943000	5947000	Look, I love Hercules, but we don't need to go back to the Colosseum.
5947000	5952000	Degenerate Johnny says, You know, everyone is talking about Disney's recently acquired fantasies.
5952000	5958000	However, Disney has so many worlds that exist in its library, especially those of its original titles.
5958000	5966000	One world in particular that I wouldn't mind seeing in Kingdom Hearts 3 is, and I'm probably dating myself here, Babes in Toyland.
5967000	5975000	You are dating yourself, but I totally remember the 80s miniseries that they had of Babes in Toyland.
5975000	5978000	Because wasn't Keanu Reeves in that? I'm almost positive he was.
5978000	5982000	You know what I would really love, but we will never have it, because they butchered the movie anyway.
5982000	5983000	The Black Cauldron.
5983000	5986000	Oh, that'd be awesome.
5986000	5991000	Why isn't Dylan Wee a princess at the park? I mean, really.
5992000	5996000	Was the Labyrinth Disney? Or was that some other story?
5996000	6002000	Labyrinth was Jim Henson created that, but I think, I want to say Warner Brothers ultimately owns the rights.
6002000	6009000	Even though, you know, Disney bought Jim Henson. I want to say, I could be wrong, maybe somebody in chat wants to correct me, but I feel like Warner owns the rights to that.
6009000	6011000	Anyhow, more answers on Facebook.
6011000	6015000	Jodastar says, I think it'd be awesome to see some Star Wars in a new Kingdom Hearts.
6015000	6019000	Maybe build a Millennium Falcon gummy ship. How about that?
6019000	6026000	Let's see, and S.H.O. and Hunter Matt says, I'd love to see a Black Cauldron world. It's very dark and creepy, I wouldn't mind seeing that.
6026000	6028000	Probably very toned down now as a world.
6028000	6034000	We have this one other person here on Facebook, replying, totally not Loki.
6034000	6042000	I want a new Tron game, because of Tron and the lack of it in any new movies. Where's the rumored game I've been promised?
6042000	6044000	I totally agree with that guy, he's got great points.
6044000	6048000	Totally not Loki, responding to us there on Facebook.
6049000	6053000	It's Loki, just so you know. That was Loki responding on Facebook.
6053000	6055000	I think they got that.
6055000	6063000	Let's go over to Google Plus at Google.com slash plus orange lounge radio, because we did get a few answers over here as well.
6063000	6076000	And Act F says, Ducktalesland or Duckburg, please. That would be worlds colliding. Maybe that doesn't happen because of the Ducktales game? I don't know, but that would be very interesting.
6076000	6079000	Let's just start digging into the Miramax properties, the clumps.
6079000	6088000	Oh my god, Reddertainment says, Disney owned Miramax. Miramax world, because awesome. Didn't Miramax put out Pulp Fiction?
6088000	6093000	They did. Pulp Fiction world. That would get dark.
6093000	6097000	Mmm, that is a tasty burger.
6097000	6101000	I just want Samuel L. Jackson to shoot, I just want him to shoot Donald.
6101000	6106000	When Donald doesn't heal you, bam. You just shot Donald in the fucking face.
6110000	6114000	Oh, you guys. There it is, the Fugu question of the week.
6114000	6115000	Kill Bill world.
6115000	6118000	Yeah, Miramax has put out all of Quentin Tarantino's movies.
6118000	6121000	Clerks animated world, yes. 100% yes.
6121000	6123000	Oh god, that was on ABC.
6123000	6127000	Oh my god. Fuck, you know what, let's just get a new Clerks animated series.
6127000	6130000	How about just a fucking Clerks video game? That'd be amazing.
6130000	6131000	I just want a new series.
6131000	6132000	I wasn't even supposed to play this game today.
6132000	6133000	There's a new movie coming out.
6133000	6136000	Oh, that's right, there is a Clerks 3 happening, huh? You never know, anything is possible.
6136000	6139000	Isn't that supposed to be Kevin Smith's last movie, or at least he says?
6139000	6142000	Oh, it's always his last movie, whatever, I don't know.
6142000	6145000	He makes Oodles and Noodles podcasting now.
6145000	6147000	Anyway.
6147000	6151000	Alright, that's it for the Fugu question of the week. Let's get back into some news.
6151000	6154000	Add us on Facebook, add us on Google if you're still using Google.
6154000	6155000	Loki.
6156000	6160000	Alright, so I'm kind of disappointed to see that they're still continuing on with this lawsuit,
6160000	6168000	but the whole ZeniMax versus Oculus over, you know, I guess they say misappropriation of trade secrets,
6168000	6170000	that's going to be allowed to continue.
6170000	6176000	So this, of course, was back, got it, it was all the way back from 2014, back in May.
6176000	6182000	Basically, they have denied Oculus's attempt to have it dismissed.
6182000	6184000	So now the case will proceed.
6184000	6191000	In case you weren't aware, it was basically they're alleging that John Carmack, who worked at it,
6191000	6198000	had basically helped Oculus with the information that he received while working at ZeniMax.
6198000	6201000	On, I guess, similar technology or something.
6201000	6202000	Mmm.
6202000	6205000	They're trying to get in on that money.
6205000	6207000	It's going to be a hard thing to prove, though.
6207000	6212000	Probably because of that whole, uh, how this rolls online game sounds.
6212000	6218000	Alright, well, I wonder if it's going to turn into this.
6218000	6220000	Usually these things are settled outside of court.
6220000	6222000	They want that two billion dollars.
6222000	6224000	They're like, we smell some money.
6224000	6227000	If it goes to court, that means all that's going to be public.
6227000	6231000	That's going to be fascinating to see what happens with that, if that does go to court.
6231000	6236000	They even have John Carmack in a white Bronco, and I mean, it's just going to be a media frenzy.
6237000	6240000	And then he'll actually be putting an Oculus on his head.
6240000	6242000	If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.
6242000	6244000	If the headset doesn't fit, you must acquit.
6244000	6247000	Alright, anyway, moving on.
6247000	6253000	Did you know that the PlayStation Plus service is actually rising in price in some parts of the world?
6253000	6256000	Not everywhere, but it is happening in some places.
6256000	6261000	Apparently, though, of course, if you already are locked into a twelve month subscription,
6261000	6266000	you don't have to worry as much, but it is something you should be concerned about still.
6266000	6270000	Could Sony be raising the price in other parts of the world?
6270000	6273000	Because right now this change is only happening in Europe and the UK,
6273000	6277000	but could a price change for everyone else be far behind?
6277000	6280000	It is going up by fifty pence a month,
6280000	6287000	or the three month sub is going from $11.99 to $14.99 in the local currency there.
6288000	6291000	So could this be something that's going to end up happening in the States,
6291000	6293000	where the price of the service could rise?
6293000	6295000	I would say certainly it's not out of the question.
6295000	6297000	It's not out of the question, but people are going to still question,
6297000	6299000	you know, what is it that you're giving to me?
6299000	6305000	Because I understand they could say inflation, but what more are you giving me for my money?
6305000	6311000	Well, kind of judging the way Sony's delivered similar news like this in the past,
6311000	6317000	I think they'll be very good about really softening the blow and burying it under other news.
6317000	6325000	Like, for example, that historic E3 where they basically came out and slapped Microsoft in the face at their press conference,
6325000	6329000	they also said, you're going to have to have PlayStation Plus in order to play online.
6329000	6333000	You didn't need that before, but because everybody was riding the high about,
6333000	6336000	oh, the system's going to be $100 cheaper and all this other stuff, nobody cared.
6336000	6339000	Nobody cared also because you got all these free games along with it.
6340000	6342000	And I still don't care because I get all these free games along with it.
6342000	6348000	I feel like if Sony's going to announce the price is going up, they're going to soften that blow by being like,
6348000	6354000	did you know as a PlayStation Plus subscriber, you now have access to your PlayStation 2 and PlayStation library?
6354000	6355000	I'm pulling something out of thin air.
6355000	6358000	2 and 3 library? Okay, that's fine. Five bucks more a month?
6358000	6359000	Exactly.
6359000	6360000	Or a year or whatever?
6360000	6367000	As a part of our all new PlayStation Plus plan rolling out this year, PlayStation Plus Gold for 14, you know, or whatever they do,
6367000	6371000	they'll, they'll do something to just bury that news a little bit.
6372000	6374000	Just wait. Just wait.
6376000	6378000	Anyhow, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
6380000	6388000	Well, you know what? I accidentally closed the story because I'm stupid.
6388000	6390000	That's all right. You want to reopen it real quick?
6390000	6391000	Yeah.
6391000	6392000	I could just let Loki ran a little longer if you need it.
6392000	6394000	Talk about the story.
6394000	6401000	Okay. Well, I think that Loki would have a very good rant about this.
6401000	6406000	Basically, we've been hearing about it all day. Bobby talked about it on his show.
6406000	6419000	A Nintendo localizing editor, Chris Pranger, is it Pranger or Pranger? Anyway, was on a podcast and he got fired for it.
6419000	6430000	He was on the Part Time Gamers podcast on August 3rd and just kind of, I guess, talked really openly about being at Nintendo.
6430000	6434000	Didn't really say anything terrible and they still fired him for it.
6434000	6439000	And he was pretty gracious about the whole thing.
6439000	6445000	I mean, but still, I guess, got to ask for permission.
6445000	6453000	That's why I don't tell a dang soul where I work unless I know you or have a very significant reason to tell you why.
6453000	6455000	And I still don't tell people what I do.
6455000	6465000	And a good reason why I, you know, and earlier I mentioned this, I was talking about my job changes that I don't really like to talk about my day job just because I'm not like, you know, if it weren't for my day job, I wouldn't have this.
6466000	6468000	So I'm not going to mix those worlds together. I'm just not.
6468000	6478000	And I don't work in the gaming industry and I'm totally OK with that because it allows me to say whatever I want about it, you know, and so I don't have to worry about those types of recourse.
6478000	6481000	That being said, I used to do it all the time.
6481000	6484000	Yeah, I know. But you were in a different scenario.
6484000	6487000	You weren't actually making the games. It was a little different.
6487000	6489000	And on top of that, I am damn proud of my job.
6489000	6494000	And it took a lot of work for me to get there and to get where I am now.
6494000	6496000	And I'm not going to jeopardize it for anything.
6496000	6497000	Right.
6497000	6498000	Not even the cool factor.
6498000	6499000	Right.
6499000	6500000	Because I work somewhere pretty cool.
6500000	6503000	Well, and you have to wonder, like, why?
6503000	6515000	I mean, I don't want to I don't want a dog on this guy because I really believe he was probably helping a friend out, you know, who maybe had this show and was, again, probably just defending a company he really loved.
6515000	6521000	And, you know, saying the things that I think a lot of us are sitting here going, we kind of wish Nintendo would say it.
6521000	6524000	I think there's a lot of us that have been sitting here going.
6524000	6529000	It's kind of a nice change of pace to see somebody from Nintendo defending themselves a little more openly like this.
6529000	6533000	I don't think anybody, you know, dislike this guy or what he said or anything like that.
6533000	6539000	But unfortunately, Nintendo took a huge issue to it because that's not the public face that they choose to put forward.
6539000	6546000	And although a lot of us get frustrated that Nintendo is such a fucking clam sometimes with this stuff, that's their choice to do that.
6546000	6552000	And if they're going to fire an associate for opening their mouth when they didn't have the permission from corporate, then that's their prerogative.
6552000	6558000	But you can tell this guy is crushed and he's like, I made a dumb mistake and I could have ruined.
6558000	6561000	He said he made a stupid mistake is what he said.
6562000	6570000	Now, I'm hoping there'll be another company out there that can maybe, you know, find a good fit for this guy because, you know, he's obviously very passionate about what he does.
6570000	6575000	Maybe Sega, because I want to say the Sonic the Hedgehog account actually tweeted something of this guy.
6575000	6579000	Maybe he'll be able to land in the gaming industry after all and he can kind of learn from this.
6579000	6583000	Maybe he can go to a company where he can talk more openly.
6583000	6585000	Maybe he can go to Microsoft.
6585000	6587000	Microsoft does have public figures out there.
6587000	6592000	They used to have a lot more until they cut a lot of them back, but at least they have Major Nelson out there who talks pretty openly.
6592000	6599000	Maybe he can find a role like that somewhere else and I hope for this guy's sake he does because I just, it's just kind of a bummer.
6599000	6605000	But that's also why, and I just want to mention this, you know, we've been fortunate enough where, you know, I do have friends in the game industry.
6605000	6610000	You live in Northern California, you're going to know somebody that have come on this show.
6610000	6615000	And if they're indie developers, that's why we like interviewing indie developers.
6615000	6620000	Because especially when it's just one guy or a small team, you know, they'll talk about whatever you want to know.
6620000	6623000	Open book, you can ask whatever. We get a lot accomplished with those.
6623000	6630000	But even my friends who work for the larger developers, you know, okay, I respect that they have talking points they have to stick to.
6630000	6639000	And so I try in those interviews not to necessarily ask about, you know, what are the big secrets in the game you can't tell us.
6639000	6642000	Because I don't want to get my friends fired. That's just being an adult.
6642000	6648000	Like I'm not going to, you know, I'm not Barbara Walters or Diane Sawyer who can get a no holds barred interview.
6648000	6655000	So when I get friends in the industry, I usually just kind of like to talk about, you know, don't, you don't have to tell me specifics about your game.
6655000	6659000	Give it a plug. Let us all know that you worked on it and you're proud of it.
6659000	6663000	But then let's talk about like you and the industry and what goes into that.
6663000	6670000	That's the conversation I like to have here is, you know, let's, let's just talk about things in a more general term and so forth.
6670000	6674000	Because, you know, I don't necessarily need to have those sorts of secrets.
6674000	6679000	So I, and I have not heard the interview, just a big disclaimer.
6679000	6688000	But I really hope if this guy was friends with the hosts of this show, I really hope the hosts didn't bait this guy.
6688000	6697000	I hope the hosts took it up. And again, I haven't heard it. So I'm, I'm just saying, I hope when I do hear it, I will see that this is clear.
6697000	6704000	I hope the host talked to this guy in advance about the, what can we and can we not talk about and didn't do it for the ratings.
6704000	6708000	Because if he did it for the ratings, that's a tacky way to treat a friendship.
6708000	6716000	But again, I haven't heard it. Maybe I'm just, I just wanted to throw that out there, though, for anybody with a podcast out there who might have a potential guest like in the future type of thing.
6716000	6724000	Like, talk about the borders. Because I know there's plenty of people out there that are like, well, when you have an interview, you should be able to ask whatever you fucking want.
6724000	6728000	No, no, no, that's not how the world works, people. Because this is what happens.
6728000	6733000	Professionals are professional. End of story.
6733000	6740000	We talked about this a little bit on the Bobby Blackwell show. This is not unique to video games. Tom Cruise is out there promoting Mission Impossible.
6740000	6746000	What the hell is the latest one called? The Rogue Legacy? Isn't that a video game?
6746000	6748000	Rogue I think is just what it is.
6748000	6749000	So anyway.
6749000	6752000	I don't care. It has Simon Pegg in it. The movie.
6752000	6760000	Anyway, if you're going to interview Tom Cruise about Mission Impossible, you're signing a waiver that you will not ask about Scientology.
6760000	6769000	Well, no, seriously, they take all this stuff seriously, and especially if they answer the shareholders and stuff. I remember when I was excited about, what was it?
6769000	6789000	Advanced Warfare, back when they called it. What the fuck was it called? I don't remember what it was. It was, I don't remember the code name for it, but I was talking about what my boss was singing at the PlayStation event or whatever they go to.
6789000	6800000	And yeah, that got some big trouble there. Lawyers contacting our work and stuff like that had the signed stuff basically saying I wouldn't talk any more about it.
6800000	6811000	And they were very cautious about it. I mean, they just have to take all that stuff seriously, so I can understand, even if you didn't say anything bad, they could be taking that very seriously.
6811000	6813000	So you just got to be careful.
6813000	6816000	Thankfully they don't work anymore, so I can do whatever I want now.
6816000	6826000	Some comments from our chat room over at live.vagadetwork.com. Sg100matt saying, we've laid off people at my job for tweeting or sharing things online that may be trivial, but make the company look bad regardless.
6826000	6841000	As much fun as it seems to maybe be an insider, you can't trust the internet. DungeonBuster says, there's a reason there's PR department and handlers. With today's social media, it's not unusual anymore for prospective employers to start looking at your online history as a matter of course.
6841000	6853000	So it's all very true from our comments over there. So in some ways it's a good thing that I keep my day job very separate from this because it allows me to do whatever I want here on this program. I don't have to worry about it.
6853000	6864000	Something something Microsoft employees something something always online something that doesn't matter. I think that's what it comes down to. Remember that whole debacle?
6864000	6871000	Oh yeah when Microsoft was on script that whole E3 and then literally a week later they reversed course because they were able to get an award.
6871000	6877000	No no no I was talking about the guy that like I forget who it was that you know is basically you know getting into arguments with people over Twitter.
6877000	6879000	Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.
6879000	6882000	You know being this isn't being always online and I don't know.
6882000	6883000	I remember that.
6883000	6889000	All right let's move on. Some more stories for you guys before we get to your phone calls. Some people in chat want to call in about this.
6889000	6894000	1877 game OLR username on Skype orange lounge radio. But first a few more stories. Loki.
6894000	6900000	So they're putting out a Star Wars PlayStation 4 bundle. I should say maybe a couple bundles.
6900000	6909000	So there's going to be one I know with Disney infinity with it and then they're also going to be doing one with Battlefront the deluxe edition.
6909000	6918000	And then they also have a Star Wars classic collection which includes four downloadable Star Wars games that are kind of being redone in HD.
6918000	6924000	I'm trying to see which ones they are. It's hard to see it based on.
6925000	6930000	I think it's a Super Star Wars something.
6930000	6936000	Star Wars bounty hunter star fighter and something revenge. I can't.
6936000	6945000	Oh it's right here. Super Star Wars bounty hunter and Jedi star fighter racer revenge.
6945000	6954000	That'd be cool pod racing game on the PlayStation 4. Pretty cool I bet.
6954000	6961000	So yeah you can get that and it's got a cool controller that has like a red d-pad and some of the buttons are red.
6961000	6965000	And Darth Vader is on the actual console.
6965000	6972000	I don't know about this whole the old retro games being available on PS4. That's kind of a neat little twist.
6972000	6977000	I'm sure they're going to be selling them separately because their vouchers that download them so that only makes sense.
6977000	6980000	I guess that's true. It's only a matter of time.
6980000	6985000	I would love to get a Darth Vader PlayStation 4 if I didn't you know already have a PlayStation 4.
6985000	6988000	So anyhow.
6988000	6989000	Just buy the game.
6989000	6996000	Sadly not coming to PlayStation 4 anytime soon. We already knew Guillermo del Toro and that whole PT project he was doing with Kojima.
6996000	7000000	We already knew that was that was pretty much done and that's not going to happen.
7000000	7003000	But Guillermo del Toro this week saying you know what.
7003000	7007000	Peace out. I'm done with video games. 100 percent done.
7007000	7013000	And this is in an interview with Shaq News he said I have proven to be the albatross of video games.
7013000	7016000	I joined THQ and THQ goes broke.
7016000	7018000	I joined Kojima and Kojima leaves Konami.
7018000	7022000	I have decided in order not to destroy anyone else's life.
7022000	7025000	I have decided I will never again get involved in video games.
7025000	7026000	Never say never.
7026000	7030000	Otherwise I'll join someone and his house will explode or something.
7030000	7034000	Hey Guillermo del Toro you ever been interested in making a Skylanders game.
7034000	7035000	Just out of curiosity.
7035000	7037000	Kidding. Kidding.
7037000	7041000	Well I mean who can blame the guy. He's been fucked over how many times now.
7041000	7042000	Twice.
7042000	7043000	Can you blame him.
7043000	7044000	Twice.
7044000	7045000	Two times.
7045000	7046000	Except like.
7046000	7047000	Twice.
7047000	7049000	I'll say fool me once shame on you fool me once.
7049000	7053000	Isn't the story of the albatross that as long as you keep the albatross alive it was good luck.
7053000	7056000	And when they killed the albatross then all the bad luck happened.
7056000	7057000	Perhaps.
7057000	7059000	So don't kill the albatross keep trying.
7059000	7060000	I just don't.
7060000	7061000	Whatever.
7061000	7064000	You know what he just says that now because it's something to say.
7064000	7068000	I mean I think if you know Kojima is like hey let's make a Silent Hill game.
7068000	7069000	I need your help.
7069000	7070000	He's like OK.
7070000	7071000	I also.
7071000	7073000	Yeah I feel like he's 180 on this question.
7073000	7078000	I think he's just like just something to say because he's angry or he's he's frustrated right now.
7078000	7080000	And that's kind of his response.
7080000	7082000	I don't think there's really anything to it.
7082000	7087000	Well Gamut of Toro I know you don't listen to this show but if anyone who knows him happens to listen to this show.
7087000	7088000	Just.
7088000	7089000	You know.
7089000	7090000	We would.
7090000	7091000	Go to Kickstarter.
7091000	7097000	Seriously I know I don't usually embrace the whole Kickstarter thing but I think we all know it's an inevitable conclusion.
7097000	7101000	That if you and Kojima went to Kickstarter and said we want to make a PT inspired game.
7101000	7103000	Millions of dollars would be thrown at you.
7103000	7105000	Just make a Pan's Labyrinth game or something like that.
7105000	7106000	Seriously.
7106000	7109000	Or make a game that has giant mechs fighting the monsters from Pan's Labyrinth.
7109000	7111000	You know that would be cool too.
7111000	7116000	I can say the players definitely want to play a Gamut of Toro game.
7116000	7117000	The corporate culture.
7117000	7118000	Yeah.
7118000	7119000	They're being dumbasses.
7119000	7121000	But if for what it's worth Gamut of Toro.
7121000	7123000	We all hate Konami right now.
7123000	7125000	So just.
7125000	7126000	Hey but you know what.
7126000	7127000	You're not alone.
7127000	7131000	They might want to license one of your properties into a patinko machine or a slot machine or something.
7131000	7133000	Sit down and be quiet.
7133000	7135000	I'm sitting down.
7135000	7136000	Do the other app.
7136000	7137000	Dungeon Buster says.
7138000	7139000	Seriously.
7139000	7142000	Kojima and Del Toro on Kickstarter would probably melt their servers.
7142000	7144000	You guys thought Shenmue 3.
7144000	7147000	Maybe that's what Sony has planned for the Playstation experience.
7147000	7151000	Get Kojima and Del Toro up on the stage.
7151000	7153000	Watch the internet just fucking explode.
7153000	7154000	Offline.
7154000	7155000	Done.
7155000	7156000	We're done.
7156000	7157000	Everybody went to the rapture.
7157000	7158000	No for real.
7158000	7159000	It's done.
7159000	7160000	Everybody's gone.
7163000	7164000	Alright.
7164000	7166000	So Del Toro we hope you'll take another try at the video game industry.
7166000	7171000	Because I think a lot of us would like to check out these things that you had to create.
7171000	7173000	In the meantime you guys create.
7173000	7174000	Sometimes.
7174000	7176000	Emails to send our show.
7182000	7183000	You can email our mailbag.
7183000	7187000	Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com if you want to participate with the show.
7187000	7191000	Again that email address is participate at Orangeloungeradio.com.
7191000	7196000	Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and finds the emails worth reading.
7196000	7197000	Of which I think there is one.
7197000	7198000	There's one.
7198000	7199000	Uno.
7199000	7200000	This one comes from Raginator.
7200000	7203000	Hi OLR it's your friendly neighborhood Raginator.
7203000	7207000	Some of you in the VoG community may already know I've just started playing Final Fantasy
7207000	7209000	XIV on Wednesday the 12th.
7209000	7210000	About damn time right?
7210000	7215000	Anyways naturally I'm not too far into the game only having leveled my Lalafell Thaumaturge
7215000	7217000	to level 3 and did some quests.
7217000	7219000	Granted there's a bit of a learning curve.
7219000	7222000	Especially since my last major MMO was Final Fantasy XI.
7222000	7225000	But nonetheless I'm loving Final Fantasy XIV so far.
7225000	7229000	Next time we're all on game perhaps we can do some game content together.
7229000	7233000	My character's name is Good Something Rage.
7233000	7236000	Named after the Final Fantasy XI character.
7236000	7239000	You'll want to type that in chat it's very difficult to pronounce.
7239000	7240000	Yeah.
7240000	7242000	And he's on our server.
7242000	7246000	This email is brought to you by Loki's Rants and Sky's Epic Diva Fits.
7246000	7248000	What am I known for?
7248000	7251000	Like you had your diva fit.
7251000	7253000	Loki rants.
7253000	7255000	Correcting people's spell.
7255000	7259000	Yelling at emailers who do not use correct punctuation and grammar.
7259000	7261000	See?
7261000	7263000	Sorry you're gonna be the grammar Nazi.
7263000	7266000	No no no no no no no no.
7266000	7269000	Because I'm not gonna like mass murder people for it.
7269000	7273000	Even though you contemplated it maybe one time.
7273000	7275000	No comment.
7275000	7277000	I'm under NDA Rob.
7280000	7282000	I am your English teacher.
7282000	7283000	There you go.
7283000	7285000	You're the professor.
7285000	7287000	Professor Sakura here on the show.
7287000	7289000	My son said something the other day.
7289000	7292000	I don't remember what it was about but it's just so appropriate.
7292000	7296000	It was like he was complaining about something.
7296000	7299000	He's like yeah it's not good when people do that.
7299000	7301000	We should kill them.
7301000	7303000	I'm like that's a bit extreme.
7303000	7309000	It was something like they were walking behind our car or something like that when we were trying to back out or something.
7309000	7311000	Takes after daddy.
7311000	7316000	Something ridiculous like oh they're not driving fast enough on the freeways.
7316000	7318000	We should kill them.
7318000	7324000	I'm like no that's not a good idea.
7324000	7326000	That is a bit much.
7326000	7328000	Figure of speech.
7328000	7330000	I know what you're meant for Dark Sakura.
7330000	7332000	We talked about it earlier in the show.
7332000	7337000	I'm gonna miss yelling out something completely non-sensically related to the topic at hand.
7337000	7338000	What?
7338000	7341000	Exactly.
7341000	7346000	You know what we should have is goat titulater.
7346000	7347000	Rob.
7347000	7348000	What?
7348000	7349000	Rob.
7349000	7350000	What?
7350000	7351000	Rob.
7351000	7352000	What?
7352000	7353000	Exactly.
7353000	7355000	Alright there it is.
7355000	7357000	You're just jealous because my hair is pretty.
7357000	7359000	Your hair is pretty and like I said on your Facebook.
7359000	7360000	It's soft.
7360000	7361000	It feels like my cat.
7361000	7362000	It's on Facebook.
7362000	7364000	I wish I had hair for Moneta Style.
7364000	7366000	We'll get you a wig for Moneta Style.
7366000	7368000	It feels like my cat.
7368000	7370000	It does.
7370000	7374000	So you're over there feeling your pussy?
7374000	7376000	I'm just touching myself.
7376000	7378000	I thought it was a pussy cat.
7378000	7380000	Like the old cartoons I thought I saw a pussy cat.
7380000	7381000	Shut up I'm just touching myself.
7381000	7385000	I'm stroking my hair in a comforting fashion.
7385000	7389000	We need to get on Periscope so we can Periscope you petting yourself.
7389000	7390000	You know what?
7390000	7391000	Fuck the internet.
7391000	7395000	She's doing a lot of heavy petting over there.
7395000	7397000	Can't help it.
7397000	7398000	I love it.
7398000	7401000	Can somebody put that on one of those inspirational posters in quotes?
7401000	7402000	Fuck the internet.
7402000	7403000	Dark Sakura.
7403000	7407000	Like maybe like a little picture of a sunset or a kitten.
7407000	7409000	Like a big thing of kitten.
7409000	7413000	And she used the kitten the one like the I want you to pet me but I sort of want to bite
7413000	7414000	you.
7414000	7415000	That kitten.
7415000	7418000	We'll just get that picture of Midna that looks like she's rolling her eyes.
7418000	7421000	Do we have an image contest on Twitter this week?
7421000	7423000	Can you do a Dark Sakura motivational poster?
7423000	7428000	I want you to take a quote from Dark Sakura and do a motivational poster and tweet it
7428000	7429000	at OLR.
7429000	7430000	With eagles.
7430000	7431000	For sharks.
7431000	7433000	We'll send you a Destiny Red Bull quote.
7433000	7434000	Sharks and eagles.
7434000	7437000	I had a lot of them and I threw them all away.
7437000	7438000	I'll give mine up.
7438000	7439000	We'll send you a Destiny Red Bull quote.
7439000	7440000	I'm sure I will have more.
7440000	7443000	I know I have more because I have at least one more in the car.
7443000	7444000	There it is.
7444000	7445000	Tweet it.
7445000	7446000	We don't do enough on Twitter.
7446000	7452000	Tweet them at OLR and be sure to use the period in front so everybody can see your motivational
7452000	7453000	poster.
7453000	7461000	And they have to be at least make sure there are no artifacting in them.
7461000	7464000	And you have to use the official motivational poster font.
7464000	7466000	Do it in MS Paint for all I fucking care.
7466000	7469000	Don't fucking use Comic Sans or I will murder you in your sleep.
7469000	7474000	There's a quote right there for you to use on a poster.
7474000	7476000	Don't use Comic Sans or I will murder you in your sleep.
7476000	7478000	I won't really murder you in your sleep.
7478000	7479000	But I'll think about it.
7479000	7483000	You know with some of those computers that they have that run Android and stuff like
7483000	7488000	that that are about the size of a USB thumb stick that you can basically attach to your
7488000	7489000	TV.
7489000	7492000	One could insert that into an orifice and literally fuck the internet.
7492000	7497000	So I mean it is technically possible to fuck the internet.
7497000	7500000	You know they have these vibrators that are called the iPod.
7500000	7502000	And they hook up to an iPod.
7502000	7505000	And iPods are internet capable.
7505000	7511000	So imagine if you ran Spotify you would be fucking internet music.
7511000	7514000	Although if you're sticking out sorts of foreign objects up there you may be doing a little
7514000	7516000	bit of Spotify anyways.
7516000	7520000	Akuma JP in chat says this is how I'll introduce OLR from today.
7520000	7523000	You know you should listen to OLR except this episode.
7523000	7527000	Dartitsia can we get a note on the wiki where it says episode 610.
7527000	7530000	Don't just skip this one.
7531000	7534000	You know what you're better off skipping this episode.
7534000	7537000	There's 609 other great episodes for you to listen to.
7537000	7539000	My coworkers are starting to realize that.
7539000	7544000	Well I did post about we have an official like listen to these podcasts forum in our
7544000	7546000	little social network crap.
7546000	7548000	And I did post our show.
7548000	7550000	So like you know they know I do it.
7550000	7552000	Why did you do something so stupid like that?
7552000	7553000	Why?
7553000	7555000	My industry has nothing to do with this show.
7555000	7556000	That's true.
7556000	7557000	That's true.
7557000	7558000	Me too.
7558000	7559000	So that's the good news.
7559000	7563000	Alright if that's it for the mailbag tonight I don't know how Raginators look.
7563000	7564000	I'm playing Final Fantasy 14.
7564000	7568000	Email went to use Comic Sans and I'll murder you in your sleep.
7568000	7571000	But that's what happens here at Orange Lounge Radio.
7571000	7573000	Who came up with Comic Sans?
7573000	7575000	It was from Microsoft Bob wasn't it?
7575000	7577000	It was a fun whimsical font.
7577000	7582000	In part also done because the kerning for it fit their certain text pattern.
7582000	7583000	It was something like that.
7583000	7585000	It actually was to be kerned a certain way.
7585000	7587000	Do you know what kerning is internet?
7587000	7589000	It's the space between your letters.
7589000	7590000	You called me a nerd earlier in the show.
7590000	7591000	You know what I watched today?
7591000	7593000	Or I introduced my son into?
7593000	7594000	Reading Rainbow.
7594000	7596000	And you know what the second or third episode they had?
7596000	7599000	They had people like actually inking and...
7599000	7600000	Calligraphy?
7600000	7603000	No they were inking comic books and doing the lettering and stuff.
7603000	7606000	And I'm like wow this is so relaxing just to watch them do this.
7606000	7613000	Okay if you just want to like sit and chill just like put on enigma and watch people do calligraphy.
7613000	7615000	You just won't move for a few hours.
7615000	7618000	I thought that's what the food network is for in general.
7618000	7622000	No cause then Paula Deen's face will show up and then you'll want to die.
7622000	7623000	It doesn't show her anymore.
7623000	7624000	And Guy Fairey's hair.
7624000	7625000	It's that other chick.
7625000	7626000	What the hell's her name?
7626000	7627000	Oh god.
7627000	7628000	Rachel Ray.
7628000	7629000	At home with...
7629000	7630000	What's her name?
7630000	7631000	What?
7631000	7632000	That's it?
7632000	7633000	Was it Giada De La Cruz?
7633000	7634000	Yes.
7634000	7635000	Or is it the other one?
7635000	7636000	You know what I just thought of?
7636000	7641000	I saw the great meme on tumblr that was like and if you can't summon the fires of hell
7641000	7642000	just go get one at the store.
7642000	7644000	No no no no that's not Giada.
7644000	7651000	That's you're thinking of god damn it's been a while now because she actually has cocktails
7651000	7655000	now too because she does this little thing cocktail time at the end of her show and she
7655000	7657000	actually has cocktails now they're called cocktail time.
7657000	7658000	Barefoot Contessa.
7658000	7659000	Thank you.
7659000	7660000	That's it.
7660000	7661000	Thank you Orange Wright.
7661000	7662000	No it's not the Barefoot Contessa either.
7662000	7663000	That's who I'm thinking of though is Barefoot Contessa.
7663000	7670000	But you know could you just imagine the ultimate evil would be Paula Deen's face and Guy Fairey's
7670000	7671000	hair.
7671000	7674000	There's another motivational poster for you.
7674000	7678000	That is the thing I will see in my nightmares.
7678000	7683000	She should just have a shirt that says butter y'all.
7683000	7689000	But I swear to god Food Network when an unwrapped marathon happens I could just I could just
7689000	7691000	watch that all night with a big bullet.
7691000	7695000	Seriously if you can't get Gene Wilder to play you know the guy in the Ready Player
7695000	7697000	One movie Mark Summers.
7697000	7698000	Let's get Mark Summers.
7698000	7699000	Oh hell yeah.
7700000	7701000	I'll take the physical challenge.
7701000	7703000	All right let's get to the F.U.'s of the week.
7720000	7724000	Big F.U. to having to get up at 6 a.m. done.
7724000	7725000	Loki?
7725000	7730000	I guess F.U. to my new hours because I have to work like 10 to 7 and then I work Saturdays
7730000	7734000	now which is kind of lame and I get Thursday off instead.
7734000	7738000	So F.U. to that and then also kind of just talking about Mark Summers there and just
7738000	7739000	thinking about Food Network.
7739000	7744000	It would be so amazing for them to redo double there like that would make it all grandos
7744000	7750000	like you know Iron Chef like have him just standing up there like take the physical challenge
7750000	7751000	and just like.
7751000	7752000	I volunteer to host.
7752000	7753000	That would be my dream.
7753000	7756000	My dream job is game show host.
7756000	7761000	Anyway my F.U. of the week goes to the fact F.U. to the fact that I am not a game show
7761000	7765000	host but at least I have this show we play games on this show so it's close and F.U.
7765000	7772000	to food because I eat a lot of it and it's really delicious and then I have to do walks
7772000	7777000	and laps and run and stuff to burn said food off and it's really irritating.
7777000	7782000	Anyway by the way Dark Soccer I don't know if you noticed in chat you see that the first
7782000	7784000	motivational poster is in from Dungeon Buster.
7784000	7786000	There it is from our chat room.
7786000	7788000	Little angry cat and it says Internet.
7788000	7789000	Fuck the Internet.
7789000	7790000	There it is.
7790000	7792000	The first Dark Soccer motivational poster is in.
7792000	7794000	Good job Dungeon Buster.
7794000	7795000	Love it.
7795000	7797000	There it is.
7797000	7798000	You like that one.
7798000	7799000	I'm proud.
7799000	7800000	All right.
7800000	7801000	Oh cute little.
7801000	7802000	I want to poke its nose.
7802000	7803000	All right.
7803000	7806000	I'll put that on her Twitter right now while Loki gets into another news story here.
7806000	7807000	Very well done.
7807000	7808000	All right.
7808000	7810000	So this is kind of cool.
7810000	7811000	You know.
7811000	7814000	And funny enough I actually watched the movie again this weekend.
7814000	7818000	But Kung Fury Street Rage is out on PlayStation 4.
7818000	7823000	If you're unaware it was a game that was released around the same time as the Kung Fury movie
7823000	7826000	on YouTube and it was a game that was on Steam.
7826000	7827000	You can check it out now.
7827000	7830000	It's very similar to.
7830000	7833000	God I'm trying to remember the name of the game now.
7833000	7835000	It's another fighting game.
7835000	7836000	It's very similar to it.
7836000	7839000	It's kind of like a rhythm fighting game.
7839000	7841000	And it's only $1.99.
7841000	7845000	So go ahead and check it out.
7845000	7846000	It's pretty fun.
7846000	7849000	How many times have you watched Kung Fury now?
7849000	7851000	At least a dozen times.
7851000	7852000	Probably more than that.
7852000	7854000	I would totally watch more of it.
7854000	7856000	But I've seen it so many times now.
7856000	7858000	I can quote it all.
7858000	7860000	For the most part.
7860000	7863000	I'm waiting for them to screen that on a big screen.
7863000	7865000	All Rocky Horror Pictures in style.
7865000	7867000	I backed it on Kickstarter.
7867000	7870000	So I have a Blu-Ray coming at some point.
7870000	7872000	I don't know what the point is.
7872000	7874000	I've already watched it millions of times with them.
7877000	7879000	Alright. One more story for you guys.
7879000	7883000	We're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7883000	7884000	Or our username on Skype.
7884000	7885000	Orange Lounge Radio.
7885000	7888000	But getting to this story first.
7888000	7891000	And this has to do with Fallout 4.
7891000	7895000	And some footage that showed up on the internet.
7895000	7896000	But you know how it goes.
7896000	7901000	You put footage up on the internet and the copyright holders are going to take it down real fast.
7901000	7905000	So some Gamescom gameplay footage made it onto the internet on YouTube.
7905000	7909000	But Bethesda, they pulled that stuff down real quick.
7909000	7913000	But did you know that folks who want to put this footage on the internet
7913000	7916000	they will sometimes go to other places where Bethesda is not as quick.
7916000	7919000	And I'm not talking about the mail or anything like that.
7919000	7922000	I'm talking about Pornhub.
7922000	7927000	That's right. The Fallout 4 footage was hosted on Pornhub for a little while.
7927000	7929000	It is now finally down.
7929000	7933000	But there were at least 73,000 people that got to view this before they pulled the plug on this.
7933000	7937000	And the greatest thing about it were some of the tags that were on this thing.
7937000	7938000	Yes.
7938000	7939000	Now posted on the Pirate Bay.
7939000	7944000	Point of view. Roleplay. Shooter. Shitty camera. Thanks, Mr. Skeltyl.
7945000	7951000	I love that. That people are turning to places like Pornhub and just like all these random ass places to put the footage.
7951000	7954000	I guess instead of watching that video you're going to have to watch Lesbian Ass Slick.
7954000	7958000	Which is apparently to the left of where the video would be.
7958000	7962000	Fallout 4. Lesbian Ass Slick. What's it going to be today? I don't know.
7962000	7968000	But hey, the thing is though, since it is on the internet, there may be another, they may put it somewhere else.
7969000	7976000	Yes, they may put it somewhere else. That's right. The video, that is.
7976000	7981000	Oh, Jesus. Alright. I thought you were still talking about the lesbians.
7981000	7986000	Anyhow, that is definitely going to do it for the news section of our show.
7986000	7993000	It's time. Skypline time. 1877 Game OLR. Or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.
7993000	7997000	I don't know if you want to call in to tonight's show, but if you want, there it goes.
7997000	8001000	I must sadly depart, because my ass has to be up super early tomorrow.
8001000	8005000	Dark Sakura's on her way out for the night. A final thought from you tonight, Dark Sakura.
8005000	8008000	Um, my hair feels good.
8008000	8011000	Keep petting your hair. Keep stroking that hair.
8011000	8012000	I feel pretty.
8012000	8014000	And witty. And hey, we're getting another phone call.
8014000	8017000	On the line right now by Dark Sakura. Have a great night.
8017000	8021000	Let's get to the phones. We've got a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8021000	8023000	Hey, what's going on? It's Rama.
8023000	8025000	Hey Rama, how you doing?
8026000	8028000	Tired. You're tired? You sound tired.
8028000	8033000	You sound tired. You look tired. We can see the video on our in-studio Skype here. You look tired.
8033000	8035000	You've had it. Yeah.
8035000	8038000	It's also kind of late there on the East Coast. What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8038000	8048000	Um, I'm going to make this quick, because I don't know if y'all have heard about this, but did you hear about the $200 PlayStation 4?
8049000	8054000	Oh, oh god. Is this the whole scheme where people were taking the...
8054000	8059000	It was like Best Buy had the Xbox One and HDTV bundle.
8059000	8062000	But some people were like, well, fuck that. I don't want an Xbox One.
8062000	8067000	So they would return the Xbox One to Play... Oh, no? I thought that was that.
8067000	8069000	All right, well, tell me your version.
8069000	8074000	Kmart marked down the PlayStation 4 to $200.
8074000	8077000	Oh, well, Kmart's got to get business somehow. That's not news.
8078000	8087000	And people went to Target, Best Buy, and Walmart, and pretty much got them to price match it, including the bundles.
8087000	8089000	Ooh. Ooh. Oh, boy.
8089000	8092000	Can they mark down, like, the weird of 50 bucks, please?
8092000	8094000	I'm waiting till it drops to 25.
8094000	8098000	Wait, so was it an accident, or was Kmart serious about that?
8098000	8102000	Kmart's dead serious. They actually marked the price down to $200.
8102000	8103000	Damn.
8104000	8110000	If you go to Kmart's website now and look up PlayStation 4, it'll say $200, but they're sold out.
8110000	8113000	Well, gee, I wonder why. That's a hell of a deal.
8113000	8121000	I bet people are buying them just to take them back to a different store and get, like, a cash card for Walmart or something.
8123000	8126000	Yeah, but there is one problem with that.
8126000	8127000	Uh-oh. What's that?
8127000	8136000	When you buy a console, they also scan the serial code, so if you return it somewhere else and that serial doesn't pop up in the system, they never sold it.
8136000	8144000	Ah. Well, that's a good thing, because people that do that are a little shady, and I don't think people should take advantage like that, because it ruins it for the rest of us.
8144000	8145000	Definitely.
8145000	8147000	They have better intentions.
8148000	8160000	Well, to finish what I was saying, there was a bit about people would buy this Xbox One and TV bundle from Best Buy, and then they sold the Xbox One back to Target and then turned around and bought a PlayStation 4 with it.
8160000	8161000	It was crazy.
8161000	8162000	Wow.
8162000	8169000	But, yeah, surprisingly enough, the thing you're talking about, I guess, didn't work. I guess they weren't scanning the codes or, I don't know, maybe they got away with it somehow.
8169000	8183000	Well, I do know that the people I've spoken to, friends of mine on my Facebook, they have actually gone out and gotten the $200 console, but as always, everybody's price-matching policy is slightly different.
8183000	8192000	Where it's gotta be the exact model, or like Target, I believe, Walmart, they're a little bit lenient, so they're like, okay, here, it's the same price, here you go.
8192000	8203000	Wow. Yeah, Fry's has a price-matching policy as well. I know I've price-matched Amazon a ton of times with them, so I wonder if they were doing it too. Jeez.
8203000	8211000	Well, I've got a friend that works over at Target. I'm gonna find her in the morning. I'm gonna have to make the schlep out to Staten Island to pick one up.
8211000	8220000	Wow, interesting. Well, I don't know what to think about that. That's crazy. I would say go to Kmart and get one. I don't know what they think in pricing that so low.
8220000	8222000	My god, they must really be desperate for business.
8222000	8225000	I didn't see it listed on there anymore when you tried to pull up the system.
8225000	8226000	Yeah, maybe they pulled it.
8226000	8233000	Well, if you're on my personal Facebook, if you go back a little bit, I shared it late last night, early this morning.
8233000	8234000	Gotcha.
8234000	8238000	I was digging up and posted it in the chat.
8238000	8244000	Tigerclaw in chat says the Kmart I go to doesn't have any video games or consoles. They got rid of that stuff. Yeah, I heard some of them did.
8245000	8251000	I'm not surprised by that because don't you remember about a good three, four years ago Kmart had like that blowout sale.
8251000	8252000	Yeah.
8252000	8260000	And they had like the Guitar Hero bundles, all that. Yeah, at that time, a lot of the Kmarts were pretty much closing out their gaming departments.
8260000	8261000	Same thing with Sears.
8261000	8266000	Yeah, because Kmart and Sears are the same company. So, Sears did that same move.
8266000	8275000	And I remember Sears was the place I got my Nintendo years and years ago, when people went to Sears more often.
8275000	8281000	Let's see, bonds006 in chat says this is a perfect example of where the internet does not exactly help.
8281000	8286000	Since when does the internet was able to successfully help?
8286000	8287000	It's very rare.
8287000	8288000	I'm saying.
8288000	8289000	Very rare.
8289000	8292000	All right, Rahm, any other thoughts for us before we let you go?
8293000	8297000	I need more cough drops. Training today killed my voice.
8297000	8302000	Yikes. Well, feel better, okay? I know how that goes. If I'm out of practice, it kills my voice.
8302000	8304000	I will because I got one of these.
8304000	8308000	Oh, look at you show off. He's showing off his brand new, can I say what it is?
8308000	8309000	Yeah, it's a Surface tablet.
8309000	8311000	A brand new Microsoft Surface right there.
8311000	8312000	Yeah.
8312000	8316000	Beautiful. All right. Well, have fun with that. I'm going to let you go so we get more calls.
8316000	8317000	Cool. Awesome. Thanks a lot, guys.
8317000	8319000	Take care, my friends. Bye-bye.
8319000	8320000	Bye.
8320000	8325000	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. I hope Rahm makes it to MAGFest.
8325000	8327000	I would like to be reunited with Rahm once again.
8327000	8331000	Early next year in February or whenever MAGFest is. I forget.
8331000	8337000	1877 Game OLR, username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio. Let's do some last minute stories. Loki.
8337000	8344000	So Fallout Shelter came out on Android and it's been hacked already.
8344000	8350000	Don't bother to try to get a high score in the game because there's a guy, some douchebag named Jake Polley that...
8350000	8352000	I love that you just name him.
8352000	8360000	Yeah, he's in the picture. He hacked the game and he is at the top of the leaderboards with one billion points.
8360000	8361000	One billion happiness.
8361000	8362000	One billion points.
8362000	8365000	And two billion score.
8365000	8371000	How rude. Again, 1877 Game OLR, username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.
8371000	8377000	You know, Brad from Pod Culture sent me this story here in chat, but it's since been updated.
8377000	8379000	So I guess I'll just give this clarification out there.
8379000	8386000	Supposedly the headline says Microsoft can remotely disable pirated games if you run them on Windows 10.
8386000	8390000	And as you can imagine, this made a lot of people go, what? Windows can do that to your software?
8390000	8397000	But an update was just put out that says Microsoft can block your access to services like Bing or Xbox Live,
8397000	8402000	but it cannot remotely disable a copy of a third party software installed on your hard drive.
8402000	8405000	They can block my access to Bing?
8405000	8406000	Oh, no.
8406000	8413000	You can't go to Bing. Oh, no. How will I not use Bing anymore? Oh, wait.
8413000	8421000	So there you go. It sounds like some clarifications there on the Microsoft use policy.
8422000	8432000	I will put one more call out there for calls, and then we'll wrap it up. 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.
8432000	8434000	Loki, any last minute stories that you have?
8434000	8439000	Uh, no.
8439000	8445000	No. All right. ActDeft apparently has just come up with his own motivational poster he wants to share here in chat.
8445000	8450000	And there is a little angry bird, an actual angry bird that says Internet. Fuck it.
8450000	8457000	There it is. More dark soccer motivational posters, courtesy of chat. A plus work, you guys. A plus.
8457000	8463000	All right. Last call for realsies. 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio.
8463000	8467000	Some week we, like last week, didn't we get like 18 calls back to back? We couldn't even take them all this week?
8467000	8468000	Yeah.
8468000	8472000	No, just Rama. Rama wants to say hey. Everybody else being shy.
8472000	8477000	Next week on the show, trying to finalize this, but I'm hoping we're actually going to,
8477000	8481000	and unfortunately I can't tell you exactly who yet until I know for sure we've got them confirmed.
8481000	8485000	But you know our pal Marissa does a lot in the voice acting world right now.
8485000	8489000	She's trying to get some of her friends who've worked on games to come on the show.
8489000	8493000	So we may have some voice actors on the show next week. So I'm looking forward to that.
8493000	8499000	Stay tuned to our Facebook and our Twitter feed for more updates as soon as we know who we've got confirmed for next week's show.
8499000	8503000	We are looking at that. That should be exciting if you want to learn anything about voice acting in video games.
8504000	8509000	So there you go. Alright, well sadly the Skype line is not opening up, so I guess I'm going to shut it down.
8509000	8514000	I guess that's that. I think Dark Sakura leaving just ended the show. How dare she, Loki? She ruined it.
8514000	8518000	I can't believe it. I guess we're just left here to our maple bacon chips.
8518000	8522000	Yeah, I like them, but they don't taste like maple bacon. They just taste like barbecue.
8522000	8528000	They do. They taste like barbecue. They don't taste like maple bacon at all. Maybe just like a little hint, but it's like hardly anything at all.
8528000	8534000	Alright, well as I always say at the end of the show, thank you so much for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8534000	8538000	And if you like the show, please tell a friend or two about the show, because all we have is word of mouth.
8538000	8543000	I'm not Kevin Smith. I didn't direct really funny popular movies that are out there.
8543000	8546000	And also unpopular movies like Geely.
8546000	8549000	That's right. I never had Jennifer Lopez in anything I did.
8549000	8554000	So please tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word.
8554000	8557000	Five star reviews go a long way. We haven't had any in a while.
8557000	8561000	So please consider, you know, on iTunes, just say five stars.
8561000	8566000	And I get so much inspiration from Dark Sakura every week on OLR. It'd be great.
8566000	8571000	Also on Stitcher Radio or wherever it is you heard about this show will go a long way.
8571000	8574000	And we really appreciate all of that.
8574000	8577000	But that's going to do it for this week at Orange Lounge Radio.
8577000	8579000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
8579000	8582000	We already had Dark Sakura's, so I guess me, I'll go next.
8582000	8587000	And my final thought for the night is I kind of miss Final Fantasy XI.
8587000	8590000	I know I'm all about Final Fantasy XIV, but looking at this XI poster on the wall
8590000	8593000	and hearing Rage Nator talk about it earlier, maybe a bit nostalgic.
8593000	8595000	And they're practically giving it away at this point.
8595000	8596000	I keep getting emails from their...
8596000	8597000	Yeah, but they're not giving it away yet.
8597000	8600000	Please come back and play. It was free for like two weeks.
8600000	8602000	I don't know if you saw that, Loki. Maybe you don't get those emails.
8602000	8604000	No, I don't get those emails apparently.
8604000	8607000	Yeah, it was like if you ever had an account you can play for free for like two weeks.
8607000	8608000	Damn it!
8608000	8610000	Damn it. It might still be going on. You have to look into that.
8610000	8611000	Yeah, I don't want to play it.
8611000	8613000	Anyway, Loki, your final thought tonight?
8613000	8615000	I don't know. I got nothing.
8615000	8617000	I got nothing. Alright, that's it.
8617000	8621000	Thank you guys so much for listening to the show. We really appreciate it.
8621000	8626000	We will be back next week to do it all again with the latest in gaming news.
