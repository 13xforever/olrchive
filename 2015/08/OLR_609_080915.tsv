0	17840	This week, Rera unloads a slew of old games for us to enjoy all over again, ranging from
17840	21000	arcade and PC-type classics to games from only one generation ago.
21000	24000	There's sure to be something for everyone in this episode, and it all starts right now
24000	26000	on the show where every gamer has a voice.
26000	35000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35000	41000	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 609 for this
41000	48000	August 9th of 2015. My name is Rob Roberts, you can find me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E,
48000	53000	and joining me here in Studio N7 with me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers.
53000	54000	Word.
54000	55000	How you doing, Jamie?
55000	57000	My stomach hurts.
57000	58000	Oh, I'm sorry.
58000	60000	But it's full of avocado, which makes me happy.
60000	62000	Well, that avocado shouldn't be making you sick, I hope.
62000	66000	No, just life makes me sick.
66000	70000	So we're back at our normal time. Well, I'm sorry to hear that life is making you sick.
70000	71000	Are you allergic to the program?
71000	73000	Well, I'm allergic to air.
73000	77000	I know it doesn't make you sick. So we had the early show last week, so we're back at our normal time tonight.
77000	81000	Hi everybody. We do tape live, I always say this, we do tape live every Sunday night at the
81000	87000	Voice of Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
87000	93000	But we did an early show last week, in part so that our friends in Europe and in the different time zones
93000	96000	could partake in the show, which is always fun, we had some different callers last week,
96000	100000	but also so that you and I could get in the car and go straight out to San Francisco,
100000	104000	which there's no such thing as going straight to San Francisco with all the traffic.
104000	106000	We went curved to San Francisco.
106000	110000	I think a lot of you use this app on the phone called Waze, and I'll just shout it out,
110000	114000	I mean they're not paying me to, but it's a great app because it accounts for traffic.
114000	118000	But man, we took back roads the whole way to San Francisco, it was actually a really pretty drive.
118000	120000	We went down the river and all around.
120000	125000	So we went to San Francisco and you for the first time got to eat at the Brazilian meat place.
125000	127000	What did you think of the meat buffet?
127000	133000	It was amazing. Except it took me like five days to recover from the sugar I had.
133000	137000	That and being sick, because I actually did come back sick on Monday.
137000	141000	Oh no. Well, I definitely had a great time.
141000	144000	I think even for five days of sick it would have been worth it.
144000	147000	Less worth it though is our pal Victoria, who we were seeing off.
147000	150000	She has officially moved to Southern California.
150000	152000	But we appreciate everybody being flexible with the schedule last week.
152000	154000	We're back to being on time this week.
154000	158000	On time with us here in studio, of course, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
158000	159000	Hello.
159000	160000	How you doing, Loki?
160000	161000	Fine.
161000	164000	What are you watching here on YouTube? Call of Duty Black Ops 3 multiplayer.
164000	165000	Oh, this is Gamescom stuff.
165000	167000	Yeah, I was just checking out the video.
167000	171000	Yeah. Is this one of these fancy YouTube videos that runs in the 60 frames a second?
171000	173000	It is one of those fancy YouTube videos.
173000	176000	I was just trying to see, you know, because it looks very similar to Advanced Warfare,
176000	178000	and I just want to see how it looked differently.
178000	184000	And there's a wall running. I don't know. I'll check it out, I guess.
184000	187000	As if you weren't going to be buying this game anyway. Let's be real.
187000	190000	I don't know. See, I bought Advanced Warfare, I played through the campaign,
190000	192000	and then I bought the season pass and everything.
192000	196000	I was like, oh, yeah, all my friends will do it, and then I stopped playing it.
196000	200000	So I have the season pass, and I have all this content waiting for me to play it.
200000	202000	I just need to go play it.
202000	205000	All right. Get on it. Anyway, we have a really busy show tonight.
205000	208000	You know, with Gamescom having gone on this past week,
208000	210000	there's a lot of news coming out from overseas.
210000	213000	So we're going to get into that, of course, tonight.
213000	215000	But I want to get into our kickoff topic here tonight,
215000	219000	and I invite you guys to participate with this topic or anything on the show.
219000	222000	We do, of course, tape live on Sundays, and if you are listening live,
222000	226000	you can head on over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
226000	230000	and have your say on what we're talking about here in studio.
230000	233000	Tonight's kickoff topic, you know, a big game was released this week,
233000	237000	but it wasn't really a new game. It was a game made up of old games.
237000	241000	Of course, I'm talking about Rare Replay, and I'll talk about my personal thoughts
241000	244000	and a little mini review of the game in a little bit when we get into
244000	245000	how is our gaming week.
245000	252000	But I wanted to talk a little bit about kind of the fixation on retro classics,
252000	256000	because, you know, certainly Rare Replay isn't the only retro collection,
256000	258000	you know, that's coming out soon.
258000	262000	I want to give a shout-out to my pals over at SacGamers Unite.
262000	266000	Of course, Gabe and Bree have been on this program before with the SacIGDA.
266000	269000	They were kind enough to have me on their show this past Wednesday,
269000	272000	and they do two guests on their show because it's a two-hour program,
272000	273000	and I was on the first hour.
273000	277000	And the second hour was a gentleman who was involved with the Mega Man update
277000	280000	that's happening, and I think they finally dated that for the end of...
280000	281000	Is it this month?
281000	282000	Is it this month?
282000	283000	It is this month.
283000	285000	Oh, it's coming real soon, so it's within weeks.
285000	289000	And I know there's a lot of people looking forward to that too, although I know...
289000	291000	I don't know. I'm not entirely looking forward to it,
291000	295000	because I'm going to all of a sudden go, man, I'm not as good as I used to be at this.
295000	298000	Well, and that's kind of what I want to get into.
298000	300000	And, you know, I'm not going to talk about a game that's not released.
300000	302000	I haven't got a chance to try.
302000	305000	I definitely am interested to check it out, because, yes,
305000	307000	I realize that GameCube collection is out there,
307000	314000	but I also realize that the GameCube is not going to look on my new high refresh rate.
314000	318000	Television is not going to look the same as PlayStation 4 or Xbox One,
318000	320000	you know, with this Mega Man update.
320000	324000	So I'm still curious to check it out on the online leaderboards and all that stuff too.
324000	325000	But I digress.
325000	328000	I kind of want to go into what you're talking about a little bit, Loki,
328000	332000	with the whole, sometimes these games aren't really as good as I remember them.
332000	337000	And some of the things I'm seeing on Twitter about Rare Replay is,
337000	341000	you know, I'm having fun with Banjo-Kazooie and RC Pro-Am,
341000	344000	but there's a lot of crap in this collection.
344000	348000	There's a lot of filler in this particular collection.
348000	352000	I don't know. For one, certainly I can see where, you know,
352000	354000	one person's trash is another's treasure.
355000	359000	I think there might be some people that are really into a game that maybe you didn't even know about.
359000	361000	For me, that's Cobra Triangle.
361000	363000	And I admit that game is hard as hell.
363000	365000	Oh, I used to play the hell out of it.
365000	369000	See, I have so many memories with that game that it just kind of gives me a warm fuzzy just to even go play it.
369000	371000	But here's my question.
371000	374000	Why do we have this fascination with retro things?
374000	379000	And do they hold up against our imagination sometimes?
379000	383000	Because it seems like, based on some of the vibe I'm seeing about Rare Replay, it doesn't.
383000	385000	What do you guys think in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com?
385000	390000	Do retro games hold up, or is it just we want them to be as good as we remember them 20 years ago?
390000	396000	I think a lot of this collection, it's kind of an easy way for them to make money off of that stuff.
396000	401000	Some of the more well-done collections, I think, have been like those Dreamclass collections
401000	404000	or the Model 2 collections that they had from Sega.
404000	407000	You remember they had that, was it that big Sega collection?
407000	410000	The Sonic retro collection, stuff like that.
410000	412000	I was really well done, too.
412000	414000	So I'm down with those types of things.
414000	421000	Well, to be fair to Rare Replay, despite the oddity about it adding all these Xbox 360 games in your library,
421000	428000	which I'll talk about in a minute, it isn't just a menu with games and click the game.
428000	431000	They really took time to build a little shell around the games.
431000	436000	They have all these interesting kind of remixes of the songs that will play on the menus.
436000	439000	So there's some neat little tracks.
439000	444000	They make a little theme. They sing a little song about Rare games, which I thought was really cute in the beginning.
444000	450000	So they added a lot more than just front-end menu, play the game type of thing.
450000	455000	It's more than what Nintendo has with Virtual Console. Sorry for the shade, but it's true.
455000	460000	Virtual Console could be so awesome. They could just do so much with that.
460000	465000	Imagine, if you would, your virtual living room, and all your games are up on the shelf.
465000	468000	You could pull the boxes out, look at the box.
468000	470000	The Microsoft Game Room was kind of sold out.
470000	474000	Yeah, sort of like that. They could do so much with that, and they just have it.
474000	477000	They're just like, aaaand rum.
477000	483000	I mean, so it's like, I don't know. Just take the extra step, and people will appreciate that much more.
483000	488000	I was reading a tweet or something that called out an amazing fact about Rare Replay,
488000	495000	is that with the release of Rare Replay, there are now more Nintendo 64 games playable on the Xbox One than there are the Wii U.
495000	500000	And I kind of had to do a second take at that fact.
500000	506000	I kind of don't think it's counting that there are Nintendo 64 games on the Wii Virtual Console,
506000	509000	and you can kind of back-end into the Wii on the Wii U.
509000	517000	But still, it is kind of a jarring, like, wow, you would think they'd have a lot of these games available on the Wii U, and they're not.
517000	520000	How hard is it to bring that stuff over? I don't understand.
520000	529000	If it runs natively in the Wii U anyways, are you telling me that the Wii U can't emulate a Nintendo 64 game?
529000	532000	Because my fucking phone can emulate a Nintendo 64 game.
532000	536000	Like, I think the PSP could emulate a phone, you know, one of those games.
536000	544000	You can't tell me that the Wii U does not have the processing power, nor do they have the skills to create an emulator to run a Nintendo 64 game.
544000	547000	Dark Soccer, the queen of the classic game of the week.
547000	554000	I want to get your thoughts on this in a minute about how retro games hold up, but I want to go to some comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
554000	558000	Dungeon Buster says, some retro games do, others just don't.
558000	564000	I played GoldenEye again a while ago after hooking up my N64 back up, and yeah, yay, progress.
564000	568000	You know, speaking specifically of GoldenEye, it's interesting he mentions that one.
568000	569000	VomitEye.
569000	572000	Well, because the motions. You know what's funny?
572000	579000	Even when I was playing Banjo-Kazooie, I don't usually get motion sick, but I was definitely like, whoa, okay, some of those turns and things are way too fast.
579000	588000	Granted, these games were not designed with a 60-inch TV and high refresh rate in mind, but I mean, still, I was like, oh, crap, I gotta look away for a minute.
588000	589000	So, it's like...
589000	594000	Hold on, I just want to call out, the GoldenEye, some people are lamenting about the games that aren't there.
594000	600000	Like, you know, with the Rare Replay, everybody's quick to say, well, there's no GoldenEye, there's no Donkey Kong Country,
600000	602000	there's no anticipation.
602000	604000	There's no jumping in Perfect Dark.
604000	610000	But, I mean, I understand licensing makes that whole thing very, very tricky.
610000	612000	Anyway, Loki, what were you about to say?
612000	620000	I... oh, I was just asking, I didn't realize GoldenEye wasn't in there, I was gonna ask if they had online multiplayer with that.
620000	624000	Perfect Dark, I'm assuming they have online multiplayer since the Xbox Live Arcade version.
624000	628000	Exactly, what they did for some of those games is it's just the Xbox Live Arcade version.
628000	636000	So, when you're getting Perfect Dark, you're not getting the N64 version, you're getting the 360 version, which was basically the N64 version with better textures, things like that.
636000	638000	One other comment here in chat, then I'll go over to Jamie.
638000	643000	Raginator says, I like retro stuff, I have all the Sega stuff on Steam.
643000	648000	Hell, I called y'all two weeks ago complaining that Steam needed more retro stuff.
648000	650000	So, maybe what's out there just isn't enough.
650000	654000	Checking in with our queen of the retro classic game of the week here on OLR.
654000	663000	Darcyra, what do you think? Do retro games hold up, or are some of them better left in our memory and we probably shouldn't go back?
663000	665000	Yes.
665000	667000	To which part?
667000	669000	Both, depends on the game.
669000	677000	Some things that you think are fun when your brain is less developed that ends up not being so much fun once you have an adult brain.
677000	689000	Interesting facts you're delivering there is that your brain is not fully developed when you're a kid, and so maybe there's certain things that you are entertained by a little differently than you are when you're in your 30s.
689000	691000	I'm gonna go into a little bit of neuroscience.
691000	693000	Okay, not too much though.
693000	694000	No, just a little bit.
694000	695000	Don't bore the show.
695000	706000	Basically, your brain hasn't finished creating all of its neural pathways for men until oldest about between 24 and 27, and for women it's a little bit earlier than that.
707000	721000	That means that anything that gives you immediate reward is going to appeal more to a younger mind than it will for something that's gonna take longer to build up to.
721000	731000	So you can play a game that might have been one of those instant reward games, but it's not gonna have the same payoff for you as an adult who's looking for something that wants something more cumulative.
731000	732000	Yeah.
732000	734000	So at that respect, you've got it.
734000	747000	Then again, if you've got something that's gonna combine that immediate result, yay, I passed the level, I'm going on to the next, and build on that, then that's gonna be the type of things that's gonna have, I think, a little bit more staying power.
747000	749000	Do you think our bullshit tolerance was higher when we were kids?
749000	756000	And maybe part of that is the technology, but I feel like there's some games you go back and play and you go, this really wasn't very good.
756000	757000	What was I thinking?
757000	760000	And I'm not saying that with about Rare Replay, but just other retro things.
760000	763000	Raise your hand if you liked the Back to the Future game on the NES.
763000	772000	I, okay, I will raise my hand for this, and I defend this game to this day. I liked Friday the 13th on the NES.
772000	773000	That game was funny.
773000	775000	And I realize a lot of people hate that game.
775000	777000	Well, it's just like Goonies 2.
777000	782000	Goonies 2 was awesome too, but you're right, you go back and you play some of those games, it's a little rough now these days.
782000	783000	Yeah.
783000	789000	You know, look at things that we just instantly put as a classic, like, we have the Guardian Legend.
789000	792000	We're gonna use that one because that is the best game in the universe.
792000	795000	Why do we still like it to this day?
795000	802000	Because it's maintained staying a difficult game, yet you've got the progression through it as you keep going.
802000	808000	It's got great music. It's visually a good game, you know, for an early compile game.
808000	812000	You know, but it's got all of those factors that made it cool for us as kids.
812000	819000	You know, you'd get the instant payoff of finally beating that one boss, but when we go back to it and we can still do it,
819000	825000	or we still have the progressive difficulty, you know, we're not aware of that as kids, we're aware of it as adults.
825000	830000	Yeah, and you know, and certainly I'm definitely not saying that all retro games, none of them hold up,
830000	833000	because like, I still to this day go back, and who doesn't?
833000	835000	Like, there were so many different ways to play it.
835000	840000	Go back to like Mario 3 and be like, I'm gonna just play through all the stages on World 1 just in a sitting,
840000	842000	because I just remember this game and I love it.
842000	845000	Like, you know, and some games like that just are never gonna get old.
845000	849000	Or for me, you know, like the Guardian Legend, like you talk about Kid Icarus.
849000	855000	When I went to Penny Arcade Expo East and I was in the classic game room, I was waiting for Bobby or something.
855000	857000	I don't remember what I was doing, but I was like, you know what?
857000	862000	I'm gonna get a copy of Kid Icarus and play it on an old school Nintendo the way it was meant to be played.
862000	866000	And it was so fun and I still love that game to this day and it holds up amazingly well.
866000	868000	So does any version of Metroid.
868000	870000	Why do you think we still have the collection?
870000	872000	I mean, that's pretty much it.
872000	877000	Um, you know, or here's another one, like playing through Dracula X.
877000	881000	I mean, there's a reason why that game to this day is a hundred plus dollars.
881000	888000	You know, because it is a solid game and it's got everything that's going to appeal no matter what age you are,
888000	891000	or how you remember playing it, it's still gonna be fresh every time you pick it up.
891000	895000	Let me get to some more comments in our chat room over at Live.VogueNetwork.com.
895000	899000	Alan Alchemy says, how many damn trash movies can you watch now as an adult,
899000	903000	only because you first saw it because you were 13 and you know damn well if it wasn't for that,
903000	906000	you couldn't stand it for longer than a few minutes.
906000	908000	I still love Xanadu.
908000	912000	That's a really good analogy, but I have to admit, some of them I love even more as an adult.
912000	915000	Like Clue of the Movie, that was my favorite movie when I was eight years old.
915000	917000	I shoot you not. I watched it every day.
917000	918000	Clue's not bad.
918000	922000	No, it's not. It's cheesy and I think a lot of people look at it and go that movie's so cheesy,
922000	925000	but like that movie just got even better as I got older.
925000	929000	And Pee Wee's Big Adventure, you get more of the jokes when you get older.
929000	931000	You realize how fucked up some of those movies were.
931000	934000	You know, actually it's the same thing for going back and watching Rocky and Bull Eagle.
934000	938000	Yes, or even like the Animaniacs or Tiny Toons, you know,
938000	941000	because when those, at least for you and me and a little bit Loki,
941000	945000	we were right at about that age where all the jokes started to make sense,
945000	947000	you know what I mean, when those shows were new.
947000	950000	Anyway, also comments in our chat room.
950000	953000	Akuma JP says, for me, I think it's imagination.
953000	956000	We had more of that when we were young.
956000	961000	And Dungeon Buster piggybacks on that saying, I agree, imagination filled in a lot of gaps
961000	964000	because the hardware was only capable of so much back then.
964000	968000	Why do you think all the artwork on the Atari 2600 was epic
968000	971000	and so unrepresentative of the final game?
971000	975000	Because when you're playing a game like combat,
975000	979000	they don't want you to see these crappy little boxes on a screen that are firing.
979000	982000	That was all about gameplay. It didn't matter that it looked stupid.
982000	986000	It was just cool. It's a tank game where you get to fight each other.
986000	989000	But you know they're tanks because on the box you see an epic,
989000	993000	and I think with combat it wasn't just tanks because people forget this,
993000	996000	but you had the game switch, which is a huge part of Atari,
996000	999000	and there was like an air battle mode because airplanes and other stuff too.
999000	1001000	It wasn't just tanks.
1001000	1004000	The big plane versus the three planes, that was always fun.
1004000	1008000	And of course, Tiger Claw bringing up the opposite here in our chat room.
1008000	1012000	I'm sure you remember the artwork for Mega Man and then playing the actual game.
1012000	1015000	Mega Man didn't look like the cover art. Well, there's always exceptions.
1015000	1019000	Yes, and I would like to also remind everybody to fuck you Konami,
1019000	1022000	and also fuck you Capcom.
1022000	1025000	I had to add the Konami one in there, but fuck you Capcom for teasing us
1025000	1029000	to the fucking box art Mega Man versus Capcom 3.
1029000	1032000	And fuck you Konami just for the fuck of it.
1032000	1033000	Just while you're at it.
1033000	1035000	Just while I'm at it. I'm mad at you still.
1035000	1039000	Why is everybody in the games industry so angry, Loki?
1039000	1042000	So angry all the time.
1042000	1048000	Because of, what was it, sexual violence or what was that?
1048000	1049000	What?
1049000	1050000	Erotic violence, that's why we're angry.
1050000	1053000	Oh, oh god, you're talking about the, that was in last week's show, right?
1053000	1055000	The pachinko trailer that came up at the end of last week's show?
1055000	1057000	Yes.
1057000	1059000	Alright, anyway.
1059000	1063000	You just took it to an awkward place, talking about erotic violence.
1063000	1068000	Anyway, and Dark Tetsuya said, bad box art Mega Man was taken across Street Fighter.
1068000	1072000	Whatever. It doesn't matter. Still Capcom, still fuck them.
1072000	1077000	Alan Alchemy is talking about Street Fighter 2010, that horrible NES game.
1077000	1080000	I love that game! That's unfortunate.
1080000	1083000	Everybody's got that game. They're gonna stick up for it.
1083000	1085000	I still love that game.
1085000	1089000	You know what? Yeah, it was stupid. It was incredibly stupid.
1089000	1095000	But you know what? That was back in the day where you fucking go and rent your games and shit.
1095000	1100000	And that's, it looked cool, played it, you know, whatever. I played the hell out of that.
1100000	1105000	Alright. I think that's gonna do it for our kickoff topic this week. Lots of good discussion.
1105000	1111000	I think in a future week we need to get into, though, what game do you still defend to this day that everybody else hates?
1111000	1116000	I feel like we might have done it on a previous show. I mean, with 600 previous episodes, it's easy to duplicate things sometimes.
1116000	1118000	Should do it by, like, generation.
1118000	1121000	Yeah, maybe. Maybe that'll be a fun thing to get into one night.
1121000	1128000	Alright, anyhow, we'll do that another week. For now, let's get into our gaming week and talk about the types of games that we've been playing this week.
1128000	1130000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1130000	1135000	It was a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition because of the DLC coming out next week.
1135000	1138000	Which, I couldn't find the story to talk about that, so...
1138000	1141000	DLC coming out next week. It'll be awesome.
1141000	1143000	Now, Jamie, it's not time for the news yet.
1143000	1145000	You know what? I don't care.
1145000	1146000	Rule breaker!
1146000	1152000	I also played some Final Fantasy XIV, just so that my free company didn't think I was dead.
1152000	1159000	Playing a lot of Peach World, honestly enough, because it's been sort of my brain break game.
1159000	1165000	And I got Pillars of Eternity from my Mac. I haven't installed it yet, but I just got it the other day.
1165000	1168000	So I will be giving it a try.
1168000	1174000	Alright. Awesome. So good luck with the Dragon Age DLC this week. I'm curious to hear how that goes.
1174000	1178000	I really need to go back and beat Inquisition. That's still on my list of, like, to-do.
1178000	1183000	But, you know, MMOs, other games, they all fight for my attention.
1183000	1185000	Loki, what got your attention this week? How was your gaming week?
1185000	1187000	I played a bunch of weird stuff this week.
1187000	1191000	So I played a little bit of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes because my son's still playing that game.
1191000	1193000	He's, like, almost 180 hours in it now.
1193000	1194000	Wow.
1194000	1200000	Probably over 250 hours by the time the next game comes out.
1200000	1201000	Unfortunately.
1201000	1209000	You know what? Just on a random side note, when your son's our age, like, you know, we'll say mid-20s, Wink, our age.
1209000	1218000	When your son's mid-20s, I bet he'll say the best PlayStation 4 game was this LEGO game because it's the one that he'll have memories of playing with you.
1218000	1220000	Not to be cheesy, but I bet that'll totally be it.
1220000	1222000	Well, yeah, because, well, here's the thing, though.
1222000	1230000	It won't be frickin' No Man's Sky or Uncharted. It's gonna be LEGO because that's the one he remembers playing with you.
1230000	1237000	Well, here's the funny thing about that, too. It's, like, I've been pointing out, like, all the glitches in the game, and so now that he points out all the glitches in the game.
1237000	1241000	Oh, God! It's a mini Loki!
1241000	1244000	And so, like, he's all, he's all, Dad, look at this glitch! Look at this glitch!
1244000	1249000	And there'll be, like, people walking through the buildings or up in the air or something like that.
1249000	1252000	He found a way to clip under the map the other day on accident.
1252000	1254000	You got a speedrunner in training.
1254000	1261000	And so, um, so then I figured out a way to clip under the map, and so we've been just clipping under the map and just breaking the game.
1261000	1263000	I guess I'm bored. I don't want to play this game anymore.
1263000	1265000	Dad and son cheating together.
1265000	1275000	Like, I don't want to, like, we've been, like, wandering around the city for, like, hundreds of hours now, and I'm just like, okay, I need something else I can do in this game, because you don't want to play any of the levels, so.
1276000	1278000	Alright, I'm going to clip under the map now.
1278000	1285000	And so I clip under the map, and I finally got into the helicarrier, like, because all the internal stuff from, like, the helicarrier is just hidden under the map.
1285000	1291000	And so I clipped into it, and, um, so I was inside the helicarrier while he was outside.
1291000	1296000	Which is weird, because when someone goes into the helicarrier, both players have to go in there.
1296000	1304000	So why the fuck is that limitation in there, since, you know, obviously the game can run just fine with one person in there and not, I don't know, whatever.
1304000	1306000	So, we played a little bit of that.
1306000	1308000	Um, what else did I play this week?
1308000	1315000	I played, um, I played a little bit of Woah Dave, and, woah man, that game is terrible.
1315000	1318000	I deleted that. I do not like Woah Dave.
1318000	1322000	Well, you, okay, but do you like the retro style? Well, speaking of retro-
1322000	1328000	Yeah, I like retro style games, and I understand the point of it, but I just got bored with it really fast.
1328000	1333000	I liked it in a, I see this in an 80s pizza parlor type of way.
1333000	1335000	Like, it's not something I would sit there for an hour and hours, but-
1335000	1340000	Yeah, I get it, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it, because it was a free game, but I just, I removed it off my hard drive after.
1340000	1345000	I gave it a few tries, and I'm like, nope, sorry, I just don't want to play this anymore.
1345000	1350000	Um, Justin in our chat room says, get the fuck out of here with that Woah Dave hate. That game is excellent.
1350000	1352000	Ah, whatever, I mean, it's fine.
1352000	1353000	Thank you, at least somebody agrees with you.
1353000	1359000	I played a little bit more Roundabout. I was trying to show my, because I'm trying to get myself to play something else other than Lego Marvel Super Heroes.
1359000	1363000	I just play anything else. How about Minecraft? How about, how about Roundabout?
1363000	1367000	You know, and so I showed him Roundabout, and he just didn't like that. He thought it was stupid.
1367000	1373000	Um, so I played a little bit of Roundabout, um, and then I played a few games.
1373000	1380000	I was asked by one of our listeners to play through Dream, and I'm such a stupid chicken shit when it comes to these games.
1380000	1387000	Like, because I read the achievements on, it's a Nightmare 1, Nightmare 2, Nightmare 3, I'm like, oh shit, this is gonna be one of those games that's fucking jump scares or something like that.
1387000	1390000	So, like, the first part, you start off in a house, and you're, you're-
1390000	1393000	Wait a minute, do you get really scared of these games? Do you like-
1393000	1396000	No, I just, I don't play them, so, I just don't like those types of games.
1396000	1402000	Am I the wrong person to be broadcasting Five Nights at Freddy's? Should it have been Loki this whole time, doing these games?
1402000	1403000	You want me to buy you a copy?
1403000	1408000	I have, I don't, no, I don't need to buy, have you buy a copy. I have enough games in my library.
1408000	1413000	No, but seriously, um, so I ended up, cause, like, it was a glitchy game, so I heard, like, a door shut.
1413000	1418000	I'm like, oh shit, it's gonna be fucking jump scare time, cause now they're trying to tell me to turn off all the lights and go to bed.
1418000	1423000	I'm like, okay, there's gonna be some, like, ghost or something, like, waiting for it to jump out at me, and so I'm like, okay, off.
1423000	1429000	And then, so I was like, okay, fine. I promised I'd play it, so, I played through all that, and apparently there are no jump scares in that part.
1429000	1437000	But, the game, I guess you explore dreams or something, so, like, this, the first part of it, you're in this, like, desert, and you have to go through these caves,
1437000	1448000	and turn off the lights, and you do that by walking under the lights, and then when you turn off the lights, all of the lights, it traps a smoke monster or something in there.
1448000	1455000	And so, like, it's kind of weird because it's, like, it talks about, like, you know how they do dream interpretation stuff, what that's supposed to mean?
1455000	1460000	So, like, you find, like, a fragment and tells you, okay, a maze means this, and smoke means this.
1460000	1468000	So, yeah, that's the only, like, it's not even scary, it's just like, ooh, I heard, like, something chasing after me, you know, so there's this smoke monster thing I'm running from.
1468000	1469000	Oh, sorry.
1469000	1479000	Oh, I was going to say, it's very similar to, like, um, like, was it the, um, Ether One? Like, it's one of those first person exploration games, I guess.
1479000	1483000	So, it's like a puzzle game. I want to go back and play Ether One, but it's broken.
1483000	1488000	Um, there's an, okay, so Shane has already picked out the next scary game I need to play.
1488000	1489000	Okay.
1489000	1497000	And I forget the name in the moment, I'm hoping he's listening and he'll text it to me, or somebody in chat will just shout it out based on, uh, what my description of the game.
1497000	1504000	But it's, like, a multiplayer scary game. I know we talked about it on the show before, too, which makes the fact that I can't remember the name more frustrating.
1504000	1511000	But, like, some people are the ghosts, and then some people are the ones in the house trying to basically outlive the ghosts.
1511000	1514000	And I know it's something Shane's been playing with Flocko, he's like, we need to play this, we need to play this.
1514000	1518000	But since it's a multiplayer game, Loki, I think it's something we all need to play. I think Jamie needs to play, too.
1518000	1523000	They're saying that I should play Five Nights at Freddy's. I thought I had Five Nights at Freddy's. I swear I played that game.
1523000	1530000	I don't remember, because I played it and, like, I got, you know, one of the things jumped at me and I was like, alright.
1530000	1540000	Like, I don't know, it wasn't like I was scared by it or startled by it, it was just kind of like, eh, I don't really want to play this anymore.
1541000	1548000	It's just, you know, it's going to be too hard to get past these levels, you know, I don't know. I think, I'm pretty sure I have it, I gotta check my Steam library.
1548000	1554000	But, anyway, speaking of Steam library, another game I played was Bionic Commando.
1554000	1564000	And I had bought Bionic Commando when it first came out, because, you know, I'm a huge fan of Bionic Commando, and I even, I don't give a shit, even the 3D one, you know, I'm totally into that.
1564000	1575000	But I tried playing it on Steam, and man, that game is fucking terrible. And I'm not saying that it's a terrible game, as in, you know, the story's terrible, I'm sure the story's terrible, but I don't give a shit about that.
1575000	1586000	The controls are fucking terrible. Like, I'm literally standing two feet away from a soldier and I can't fucking hit him with my gun, because the goddamn controls are all just fucked up.
1587000	1597000	The sensitivity, I could never get it right on the controller, it just felt very delayed, I even dropped, my laptop's not that strong, but shit, it should be able to run fucking Bionic Commando.
1597000	1609000	That game's fucking old, so, I dropped down the resolution, down the 720, and it still was running very choppy and like shit, so, I don't know.
1609000	1619000	I may give it another try, I thought it ran pretty good on Xbox 360, and I know I've played it on that, but, I don't know, maybe I'll go back and play Rearmed or something.
1619000	1634000	So I played that, and then, what else, I don't think I worked on my game this week, I've been trying to figure out, trying to design logos and stuff, because I want to work on my website to go with all that, for like leaderboards and stuff, and I just want to get to look nice first before I get to it.
1635000	1641000	God, I thought I played another game, maybe that was it. Yeah, that was my gaming week.
1641000	1649000	Alright, fair enough. Let's see, let's get into my gaming week, and like I mentioned before, I played Rare Replay.
1649000	1662000	So I picked that game up, and I was checking that out on Xbox One, and reliving some of the old, all the way from the old Spectrum stuff, like I actually enjoy Jetpack, but then there's some other games in there that are really bad.
1662000	1670000	Like Gun Fright, I don't understand what the hell's going on in that game. And I know I can hit a button and read the manual on the side, but I kind of don't like that setup.
1670000	1676000	Like I really think some of these old games could have just benefited from like a splash screen that says, here's how the game plays.
1676000	1686000	And I really can't believe, especially with all the polish that they put on the game, they didn't put something that simple in there to help people who may not have known these games understand a little quicker how to play them.
1686000	1689000	It seems kind of self-explanatory, like it's just like...
1689000	1698000	Not that game. I don't understand why there's a one, I imagine there's one particular guy you're looking for, but I don't know who's good, I don't know who's bad. It's just a weird setup.
1698000	1705000	I mean, yeah, some of them are really easy to pick up, like Slalom, you know, the skiing game on NES, that doesn't really make the game good.
1705000	1715000	But I don't want to sound all negative on Rare Replay, because actually it's a really fantastic deal for $30, and there's enough really, really good stuff in there to justify the purchase.
1715000	1721000	I mean, games like RC Pro-Am are still great today, except for the excessive squeaking noise when you're making corners.
1721000	1723000	That still bugs me to this day, there's too much squeaking.
1723000	1728000	But RC Pro-Am 2, I think I only ever played that game like one time, so it was really cool to see that again.
1728000	1735000	And I even love the games like Cobra Triangle, even Snake Rattle and Roll, even though it can be infuriatingly difficult sometimes,
1735000	1742000	because if you can't control the snake just right, then you fall into the water and it's doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know, just really silly stuff.
1742000	1748000	But I would have no idea what to do in Snake Rattle and Roll if I didn't remember some of the concepts from when I was a kid.
1748000	1756000	By the way, the goal, you're trying to get as many pieces for your snake so that you weigh down the bell at the end, which is what will open the door to the next level.
1756000	1763000	And so you want to eat anything that's circular, but not if it's going to turn into a bomb, or, you know, things that are not pieces of snake.
1763000	1768000	And you actually hit a button when you're over the little trapdoors, and some of them have pieces of snake in them.
1769000	1776000	So that's what that is. If you're wondering what the eff that game is all about, there you go. I gave you a little overview right there.
1776000	1782000	I like Alan's comment. Slalom is a bad name for that game. It should be called Skiing Butthole.
1782000	1789000	Well, the reason why he says that is I was playing the game and your character kind of bends over as he's like skiing down the hill.
1789000	1794000	So Alan walks in the room and kind of goes, that is a giant butthole on the screen right now.
1794000	1798000	And it's because of the slalom. You're just going down and skiing down the mountain. That game's kind of bad though.
1798000	1804000	But like, there's some games that Rare has done that I didn't get to experience the first time.
1804000	1808000	You know, I know we do this podcast, but you all know this isn't how we pay our bills.
1808000	1811000	We don't have time to play every single game that's ever been out.
1811000	1819000	And there was especially a few years in there during the Nintendo 64 era, you know, right at the end of N64 and beginning of PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast and all that.
1819000	1823000	They're like, I missed a lot of games. And one of those games I just never got around to playing before was Banjo-Kazooie.
1823000	1828000	And I know there's a lot of love for that game and especially with the spiritual successor coming out, right?
1828000	1830000	Yooka-Laylee, that whole thing, right?
1830000	1836000	So getting to go back and play Banjo-Kazooie was actually kind of rad because I had not played it before.
1836000	1844000	And yeah, even though the graphics are a little rough and so forth, it was actually a lot of fun kind of playing the game and exploring the first level and getting...
1844000	1848000	It's very Mario 64-esque if you, for whatever reason, have never played it.
1848000	1852000	But obviously with some different mechanics with the fact that you learn like new moves everywhere.
1852000	1856000	So you're putting all these moves together to get through different stages.
1856000	1860000	But yeah, getting to play that for the first time was pretty cool.
1860000	1866000	So for every stinker like Gun Fright, there's some gem in there probably that you haven't experienced before.
1866000	1869000	So I think for 30 bucks Rare Replay is worth it.
1869000	1876000	But I have one more, as much as I enjoy the game and I recommend it, I do have one more thing I gotta be picky about because I don't get it.
1876000	1883000	Okay? So when I put Rare Replay, the disc and the drive, my Xbox goes, I gotta download 5 gigabytes worth of updates.
1883000	1896000	What? 5 gigab... Well, what it's downloading is because it's putting all the 360 games, get their own little entry, thanks to the backwards compatibility thing, get their own little entry in your game library.
1896000	1902000	So the 360 games and the way it interfaces with Rare Replay is kind of clunky.
1902000	1913000	And I guess I understand why they did it because if you already had the game in the past and have achievements and stuff, they wanted to be able to just tap into the old library and so forth, but it's really clunky.
1913000	1920000	And you know, my Xbox 360 wasn't wired and it was taking forever to download things, so I had to go get the wire and plug it into my 360.
1920000	1930000	It was just kind of a hassle. So I don't... And now if I go into my game library, it's filled with all the Xbox 360 Rare Replay stuff.
1930000	1940000	And so I kind of wish... I don't know, I just wish they'd taken a different approach with that because that whole thing felt really clunky to me in what otherwise is a fairly slick interface.
1940000	1946000	So that's my other minor, minor complaint. Otherwise I thought the game was a lot of fun and worth it for $30.
1946000	1956000	Alan Alchemy in chat says, the only thing I disliked about Banjo-Kazooie was it kind of brought in the OMG play the game 20 times to collect all 254 pieces of 40 different tokens mechanic.
1957000	1969000	So, let's see. Tigerclaw wants to know, did the N64 ports fix the framerate issues? Seeing as I hadn't played that game on N64, I couldn't tell you.
1969000	1977000	But what I will tell you is that it's the 360 versions of most of those games. If Rare put it out on the 360, then you're getting that version.
1977000	1984000	So Banjo-Kazooie, 360 version. Perfect Dark, 360 version. So take that for what it's worth.
1985000	1992000	Other than that, I played a lot of the same stuff. I've still been playing a crap load of Final Fantasy XIV because, you know, MMO addiction.
1992000	1998000	What else did I play this week? I felt like there was something else new I wanted to play that I wanted to tell you guys about.
1998000	2004000	And now I'm forgetting into the moment what I was playing. So I guess that'll have to do. More Clicker Heroes.
2004000	2009000	Because I'm still addicted to that game. That's not really a game though. That's just kind of a pastime.
2010000	2017000	You can appreciate this, Loki. Last night, I went out and played Ingress for three hours with friends.
2017000	2022000	We went out on the town. I know you love my Ingress addiction, so...
2022000	2028000	I don't have a problem with it, honestly. In songs you don't have a problem with me cheating like crazy at fucking Clicker Heroes.
2028000	2030000	You do what you want.
2030000	2035000	The game plays itself. I mean, literally plays itself. Because I had an autoclicker on and I didn't want to have to do it.
2035000	2037000	I think a ton of people use an autoclicker.
2037000	2043000	And here's why. It's because I was already so far in the game before the Flash version stopped working.
2043000	2048000	And so I'm like, fuck it. I just want to finish all the achievements on this. I don't even fucking care.
2048000	2050000	I don't just want to play it anymore.
2050000	2055000	If you want to play a single player game like Clicker Heroes and cheat, that's fine. Do your thing. Nobody cares.
2055000	2060000	But as long as you don't cheat in a multiplayer game like Ingress, because everybody hates the people that cheat in Ingress. It's awful.
2060000	2062000	How do you cheat in that?
2062000	2064000	Wow.
2093000	2096000	But I'm hoping we can at least have a little get-together somewhere.
2096000	2102000	You know, maybe an official meet-up spot somewhere. So we'll work that out in the coming days.
2102000	2111000	The other thing I want to mention, I already gave my shout-out to SacGamersUnite, but I did want to just shout them out one more time for having me on their show this week. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.
2111000	2116000	I want to give a shout-out to Anime Jam Session, which is Tuesday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network.
2117000	2124000	They're going to be bringing us a special programming Saturday from noon Eastern to five Eastern, which will be 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Pacific.
2124000	2130000	They are going to be bringing us International Sailor Moon Day. Did you know that Sailor Moon has a day?
2130000	2132000	Everything has a day.
2132000	2137000	Sailor Moon has a day, and it's Saturday, and there's going to be little mini conventions all over the world.
2137000	2140000	I think yesterday was International Cat Day or something.
2140000	2147000	There was National Underwear Day this week as well on Twitter, so I think Twitter invents a lot of shit.
2147000	2156000	But International Sailor Moon Day I think is a little more legit. I think National Sailor Moon Day is up there with Talk Like a Pirate Day.
2156000	2160000	You're not going to see either one officially recognized on a Hallmark calendar.
2160000	2162000	It's up there with Steak and a Blowjob Day, right?
2163000	2166000	We'll have to ask Rama where that all lay.
2166000	2173000	But anyway, tune in on Saturday for Sailor Moon, and everybody will transform magically on cue.
2173000	2177000	And I think Rama's going to call on the show later to talk a little more about that, so we welcome that.
2177000	2179000	So, there you go.
2179000	2183000	That is, I think, all I have for Housekeeping Tonight. I'm probably forgetting something. I'll have to come back to it later.
2183000	2188000	But in the meantime, we need to get into some gaming news, because there is a lot going on.
2188000	2190000	So, Loki, let's get into it.
2190000	2195000	Hey! It's a game, a sequel for a game that we never asked for a sequel for.
2195000	2201000	But Halo Wars, the RTS Halo game, is getting a sequel.
2201000	2205000	And it is coming out on Windows 10.
2205000	2209000	I wonder, probably Xbox One as well. Yeah, Xbox One as well.
2209000	2214000	And, hooray! I don't know.
2214000	2219000	It's also being developed by Creative Assembly, and of course they did the Total War series.
2219000	2227000	Along with that, they were announcing at Gamescom something more towards your mainstream Halo fan.
2227000	2229000	The Halo World Championships.
2229000	2235000	They're going to be doing basically a competition, a multiplayer competition along with that.
2235000	2243000	Around the same time, they will be offering the brand new Halo 5 Guardians limited edition console.
2243000	2248000	That's one terabyte. It has a one terabyte hard drive, and it looks pretty nice.
2248000	2254000	I dig how that is painted with all the blue and silver and... yeah.
2254000	2260000	That did look like a really pretty machine. It almost made me sad I already bought an Xbox One, but not...
2260000	2267000	If only certain games were coming out this year and not being pushed to next year.
2267000	2269000	Crackdown, you say?
2269000	2271000	Yes, crackdown I say.
2271000	2276000	But, yeah. I'll just have to wait for that one, I guess.
2276000	2283000	Well, now, I know a lot of people out there were big fans of Halo Wars, but I wasn't really expecting that game to ever get a sequel.
2283000	2287000	So, it's kind of neat that I guess something is coming, after all, for that.
2287000	2293000	Well, it's also good to see that there's another RTS game, because there's not a whole lot of mainstream RTS games nowadays.
2293000	2294000	True.
2294000	2298000	So, I guess it's good in that sense.
2298000	2304000	I guess it's better than that Gears of War one that they were showing off at one time.
2305000	2309000	So, I don't know. And I guess with Halo 5, they're also kind of trying to...
2309000	2313000	They have that brand new game mode that's supposed to cater more towards the esports thing.
2313000	2320000	So, I think they're really trying to jump on that esports bandwagon to kind of get up there with the Call of Duty's and Dota's and all that stuff.
2320000	2325000	Makes sense. Bobby Blackwolf with a fun fact in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2325000	2333000	Bobby says, the first Halo World Championships were broadcast on G4 before the TechTV acquisition and commentated on by Will Wheaton.
2333000	2337000	Because Will used to do the arena show on G4, right? For at least a short time.
2337000	2343000	I've been listening to lots of Will Wheaton lately, because I started listening to the audiobook version of Armada.
2343000	2351000	Which is not interesting so far, but I'm listening to him talk in my ear for several hours at a time.
2351000	2358000	Well, there you go. So, the Halo World Championship is not exactly new, but I guess, hey, why not?
2358000	2362000	The Nintendo World Championships, 25 years later, all the rage.
2362000	2366000	I bet they do that again at E3 next year, or at some other time.
2366000	2370000	So, why not? Why not? Microsoft wants their World Championships to get people excited about, too.
2370000	2372000	I want more Maker games.
2372000	2375000	You want more Mario Maker games?
2375000	2382000	I want Nintendo Maker. No, seriously, I want to be able to cross Zelda, Metroid, Mario...
2382000	2384000	You want NES Remix Maker?
2384000	2386000	Basically, yeah. I think that would be fucking amazing.
2386000	2391000	Can you imagine doing a Legend of Zelda game skin like Metroid or something?
2391000	2395000	You know, like top-down shit with all the fucking Metroid enemies and graphics and all that stuff?
2395000	2398000	You know Nintendo's afraid of all the sex games people are going to make, though.
2398000	2403000	You know Nintendo's afraid of, well, I don't know if I want to say afraid, but concern.
2403000	2407000	Nintendo's concerned about all the penises that will be drawn out of Mario and Lincoln.
2407000	2409000	Who cares? It's just...
2409000	2412000	Just let people get it out of their system and then done.
2412000	2415000	The more attention you pay to it, the more people are going to do it.
2415000	2420000	Haven't you had kids before? Don't you know if you want to, you know, get rid of a bad behavior?
2420000	2424000	You ignore it. And then unless they keep doing it, then you smack the shit out of them.
2424000	2428000	Or you put them in timeout. Whatever your choice of discipline is.
2428000	2435000	Alright. Before I get into my next story here, which is all side of gamescom, I remember the other thing I wanted to bring up in housekeeping.
2435000	2437000	So I'm going to say it now.
2437000	2441000	So, you know, here at OLR, we do this show for free.
2441000	2444000	And we don't ask for your money. I'm not asking for your money.
2445000	2448000	You know, we say just tell a friend or five about the show.
2448000	2451000	And spread the word. That's all we ask here at OLR.
2451000	2456000	But out of the goodness of their hearts, sometimes listeners will send us gifts.
2456000	2460000	And, you know, I don't just go giving out the shipping address to anybody.
2460000	2462000	I kind of have to know you a little bit, right?
2462000	2467000	But we still have some listeners that, you know, I've known for a while who are good enough to actually send us things once in a while.
2467000	2470000	Like, Dara Sagar, you got booze from a listener, right?
2470000	2477000	Yes. Although I can't have it unless I've been super, super, super vigilant with my healthy stuff.
2477000	2481000	Well, I have to tell you guys, we got a box this week.
2481000	2482000	What?
2482000	2488000	And speaking of stuff you probably can't have, Dara Sagar, I apologize in advance, but you're just going to have to deal with it.
2488000	2493000	We got a box this week from Akuma JP from Japan.
2493000	2497000	And I want to make sure you guys got this because there were some cool things for me.
2497000	2501000	And he was very cool and got me some amiibo, so I was very happy for that.
2501000	2504000	He's only helping your addiction there.
2504000	2507000	But I want to point out, Loki, he got that for you. There's a little Mario.
2507000	2508000	Nice.
2508000	2509000	From Japan.
2509000	2510000	That's cool.
2510000	2514000	And then this is for you, Dara Sagar, a little Kirby.
2514000	2516000	So I'm going to throw that over there.
2516000	2518000	Oh my God, he's so cute.
2518000	2522000	I'm assuming these are for you, Dara Sagar, because I can't read a lick of Japanese.
2522000	2527000	But there's some gaming magazines here, and Dara Sagar, I'm sure you will enjoy that.
2527000	2529000	And then as well as this poster here.
2529000	2531000	Maybe we'll hang that up in the studio.
2531000	2536000	But then remember, do you remember when Akuma sent us all the candy?
2536000	2538000	Yes, it was delicious.
2538000	2540000	And there was one in particular.
2540000	2542000	The green melty kisses.
2542000	2547000	He sent us nine boxes of the pear candy.
2547000	2549000	Oh my God, that's the best stuff.
2550000	2554000	Nine boxes. Look at that right there. Sorry, I know this is radio.
2554000	2560000	But nine boxes of the pear candy because we loved it so much.
2560000	2563000	And all I'm thinking in the back of my mind is Dark Sagar's on a diet.
2563000	2566000	But she's going to have to go on the fuck it diet for a few minutes.
2566000	2571000	You know what? I have totally been excellent and good. Let me read the label.
2574000	2575000	There it is.
2575000	2577000	It's so good.
2577000	2581000	Akuma JP in the chat is apologizing. I'm so sorry. No more amiibo.
2581000	2584000	What are you apologizing for? Don't apologize for anything.
2584000	2587000	Alright, they want a picture in chat of this.
2587000	2590000	So we'll get the magazine and some of this stuff all together.
2590000	2592000	We'll take a little picture. We'll put it on our Twitter account.
2592000	2594000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2594000	2597000	Doesn't it look like he just picked the whole damn thing up off the shelf?
2597000	2598000	I'm just taking a picture of the candy.
2598000	2600000	Just the candy.
2600000	2601000	Alright, so there it is.
2601000	2603000	So I wanted to make sure Akuma JP got a shout out.
2603000	2604000	And thank you so much.
2604000	2607000	Thank you so much. And again, our listeners don't have to do that.
2607000	2612000	And I think that's awesome that, you know, anybody would take the time out to do that.
2612000	2614000	Especially when it's from other places.
2614000	2617000	Because I can't walk into a store and get pear candy.
2617000	2620000	And in the US, I can't walk into a store and get pear candy.
2620000	2622000	You can have it over at the Corianna Plaza or whatever.
2622000	2626000	I've checked at the Corianna Plaza for this. They don't have this candy.
2626000	2628000	They do have green tea KitKats.
2628000	2630000	You know this is weekly Famitsu, right?
2630000	2632000	That is Famitsu. I figured it was Famitsu, yeah.
2632000	2637000	I was gonna say, I found the Melty Kiss that was so good.
2637000	2641000	But I've been asking Oto's to get the pear candy and they haven't gotten it.
2641000	2644000	Well, Akuma JP is actually clarifying in our chat right now.
2644000	2647000	You can't get the pear candy anymore. It's seasonal.
2647000	2649000	Holy crap.
2649000	2652000	This is like pumpkin spice right here.
2652000	2656000	So it's like the pumpkin spice trade. It's like the modern, you know.
2656000	2658000	This is the other seasonal thing then.
2658000	2661000	Because the buffalo sweat, the vanilla bean is seasonal as well.
2661000	2663000	That's what I need to send to Akuma JP.
2663000	2665000	I'm gonna send him just a box full of pumpkin spice stuff.
2665000	2667000	He'll probably be like, I hate pumpkin. What are you doing?
2667000	2672000	I'm gonna have to airdrop the pictures to myself and e-mail to you for the official Twitter.
2672000	2674000	Oh, you don't have the OLR Twitter?
2674000	2676000	Not on my phone.
2676000	2678000	Darsakra, give it the program. Alright.
2678000	2680000	Anyway, more stuff.
2680000	2684000	As I'm sitting here airdropping it to myself because, hello.
2684000	2687000	Alright, back to some gaming news.
2687000	2689000	Speaking of Japan and things that come out of Japan.
2689000	2693000	Obviously the Xbox One kind of starving for some content there.
2693000	2697000	Because I would bet one thing that Akuma JP couldn't send me from Japan.
2697000	2705000	Maybe something I could send Akuma JP that he probably doesn't have in Japan would be like anything that has an Xbox logo on it.
2705000	2709000	Or anything Xbox One really. Like an Xbox Magazine. It's probably unheard of over there.
2709000	2714000	So anyhow, Scalebound though, hoping to make a splash on the Xbox One.
2714000	2718000	They announced more about Scalebound at Gamescom.
2718000	2722000	Including the fact that the gameplay trailer shows four player co-op.
2722000	2726000	And that the game is not out until holiday 2016.
2726000	2729000	So if you were thinking it was this year, you gotta wait a little longer.
2729000	2731000	But the game still does look really cool.
2731000	2737000	And you got a good glimpse at the hero and they actually put out a trailer which you can check out on their YouTubes.
2737000	2741000	So there you go. Platinum Games of course releasing that in holiday 2016.
2741000	2743000	I'm interested in Scalebound.
2744000	2749000	Wait, DarkSakura is freaking out and she doesn't have a mic. So we can't hear her.
2749000	2752000	I just did the barcode scan and it actually is in my fitness palette.
2752000	2755000	And this stuff is called Choco London pear flavor.
2755000	2757000	Well it's delicious.
2757000	2759000	Yeah, and it actually doesn't have a little bit of sugar.
2759000	2761000	Oh, she's rationalizing people.
2761000	2763000	No, it really doesn't. It's only got like 3 grams per piece.
2763000	2766000	Alright. Can I talk about more Microsofts?
2766000	2767000	No pear candies.
2767000	2769000	Well they're both green.
2769000	2777000	Anyhow, for your Pear Box 1, I'm sure a lot of you are looking forward to Backwards Compatibility.
2777000	2782000	Well Backwards Compatibility is coming out for everyone in November.
2782000	2787000	That is what we've learned that Backwards Compatibility will be out for everybody in November.
2787000	2789000	We don't know any more details than that.
2789000	2795000	Although, there was a little bit of a movie thing that they were showing to tease it.
2795000	2798000	And you could see some more box art that's not already there.
2798000	2803000	You could distinctly see Alan Wake as one of the games that would be Backwards Compatible.
2803000	2807000	That's another great 360 game that I think a lot of people might have missed.
2807000	2816000	And on top of that, they were promising to think with that,
2816000	2822000	that upcoming Xbox Games of Gold games that are going to be offered for 360
2822000	2824000	were going to be Backwards Compatible as well.
2824000	2826000	So you can kind of build up your library that way.
2826000	2829000	But how long are they going to keep the Games of Gold thing for 360?
2829000	2833000	Because I would think there's not a lot of 360 games coming out.
2833000	2834000	But maybe that's it.
2834000	2840000	You've got lots of people that have a 360 that don't have an Xbox One.
2840000	2846000	So it would be kind of cool to enhance that Sony.
2846000	2848000	I mean that would be pretty nice.
2848000	2852000	I'd love to play all my PlayStation 3 games on my PlayStation 4.
2852000	2854000	Hey, we're waiting for the Sony response to this.
2855000	2860000	Come on, my PlayStation Portable could play PlayStation 1 games.
2860000	2863000	I think a PlayStation 4 can probably handle that.
2863000	2866000	Same argument goes with Nintendo, like as I mentioned earlier.
2866000	2868000	We're going to wait and see how that...
2868000	2872000	Don't tell me that your fucking processor that can handle so many particles and shit
2872000	2878000	can't render the advanced low-poly engines that were in PlayStation 1 titles.
2878000	2880000	Calm down, we'll see.
2880000	2883000	If they do another one of those PlayStation fan...
2883000	2885000	What did they call that thing they did in Vegas last year?
2885000	2887000	PlayStation Experience, was that it?
2887000	2890000	If they do another one of those this year, that would be a great time for them to just
2890000	2892000	whip out backwards compatibility on stage.
2892000	2895000	That would be cool. Or announce whatever the fuck they have coming for fourth quarter.
2895000	2899000	Because right now it's Zilch, so I don't know what they've got for fourth quarter this year.
2899000	2901000	Alright, third party.
2901000	2903000	The Call of Duty, that's why they bought the Call of Duty exclusive stuff.
2903000	2904000	I'm sorry.
2905000	2908000	You got DLC slightly early in Call of Duty.
2908000	2910000	We're getting on another tangent.
2910000	2912000	At least Microsoft has Halo.
2912000	2915000	And they fucking have, you know, Forza, so we know what they've got coming.
2915000	2917000	Dark Sakura, what's next?
2918000	2920000	Did you get the pictures? Because I sent them to you.
2920000	2922000	I did. I'll get them on Twitter later.
2922000	2923000	Okay.
2923000	2930000	Well, Steam is giving out full unconditional refunds for Journey of the Light.
2930000	2935000	It was a PC puzzler that was supposed to be one of the hardest puzzle games on Steam.
2935000	2938000	And yeah, it's really hard, because you know why?
2938000	2941000	Because eight of the puzzles don't exist.
2941000	2944000	No, seven of the puzzles don't exist.
2944000	2952000	So, yeah, people were trying to open the game, and yeah, there was only the one level, so there's nothing else.
2952000	2955000	So yeah, Steam just like, here's all your money back.
2955000	2963000	So yeah, the game has also been...
2965000	2974000	Yeah, there's actually another note on here that the guy who made the game is not sure why it happened that way,
2974000	2979000	but he said that that's not how it was when he released it, so whatever.
2980000	2984000	He said it was an error in a patch that he released.
2984000	2987000	Yeah, somehow that I copied over all the levels with the same level.
2987000	2994000	But here's the funny thing, apparently the first level is also unbeatable, so I don't know.
2994000	2996000	Interesting.
2996000	2999000	That's why they have the Steam refund policy, so...
2999000	3005000	Well, and I thought there was one interesting thing I caught when I was reading about this before the show,
3005000	3009000	is that, well, Steam will let you refund anything up to two hours, right?
3009000	3013000	But with this game, they're opening it up for, you can play it however long,
3013000	3019000	because, I guess one of the things was, the trading cards don't unlock until you've played it for two hours.
3019000	3020000	Yeah.
3020000	3024000	And I didn't realize that they could set that by the game.
3024000	3028000	I thought they all unlocked every 20 minutes or whatever, I thought that was a Steam standard rule.
3028000	3032000	So I didn't realize that you had to play the game for more than two hours to unlock the cards,
3032000	3038000	and then I was thinking about it, I was like, that's a really wicked way to work around the whole two hour return thing,
3038000	3042000	is that now you're gonna start not getting cards until you've played the game for two hours.
3042000	3043000	Who cares, they're fucking trading cards.
3043000	3044000	I know.
3044000	3046000	But you know some people are super into that.
3046000	3052000	Well cool, then you're dumb enough to buy a broken game and keep playing it for two hours until you get stupid trading cards for that game.
3052000	3055000	Woo.
3055000	3057000	Alright.
3057000	3063000	I hope that when you do finally end up crafting those cards into a badge, you get a giant wallpaper that says,
3064000	3066000	You purchased a broken game, you dumbass.
3066000	3069000	But hey, ha ha, you played it too long, so no refunds for you.
3069000	3071000	No tixie-baxies.
3071000	3075000	Loki, you're in a mood tonight, but why don't you go to the next story, Loki.
3084000	3092000	Alright, so Microsoft is offering a free DVR program, or DVR service, I guess, for over-the-air TV.
3092000	3095000	And apparently they're gonna allow you to record footage.
3095000	3098000	It can be played back on any Windows 10 device.
3098000	3103000	And of course that would include the Xbox One, Windows 10, and Windows phones.
3103000	3108000	They're saying that you can remotely schedule the programs via the One Guide.
3108000	3112000	And then I guess recording, it's done seamlessly.
3112000	3119000	What I'm curious though is, how the fuck do you get over-the-air TV into the Xbox One?
3122000	3127000	Because it doesn't have a cable jack in it.
3127000	3132000	So how's that work? Is it gonna be a separate adapter that's gonna be plugged into it?
3132000	3134000	Doesn't it have an import for HDMI or something?
3134000	3135000	Yeah, it has that HDMI input.
3135000	3139000	Could you do a TV output to the input? Just your TV?
3139000	3144000	I guess, but that would be kind of... I don't know if that would work.
3144000	3149000	I mean, and even still, they're only limiting it to over-the-air.
3149000	3154000	It can't be cable or anything.
3154000	3156000	And a lot of TVs, I'm not sure if they have HDMI out.
3156000	3160000	Justin is pointing out in our chatroom, you can buy an HDTV tuner accessory.
3160000	3162000	I wasn't aware that they even sold an accessory like that.
3162000	3164000	Okay, so that makes a little bit more sense.
3164000	3166000	So it's like the DVD player on the original Xbox.
3166000	3168000	That's kind of cool that they have that.
3168000	3171000	I kind of want to set something up like that on my TV,
3171000	3176000	because I had to put an antenna in the attic and I just...
3176000	3178000	I don't want to go in the attic.
3178000	3180000	Because that means crawling through the attic.
3180000	3185000	And there's like fiberglass up there, and spiders and shit,
3185000	3188000	and it's fucking hot, and I'm going to fall through the ceiling.
3188000	3190000	And it's totally what's going to happen.
3190000	3194000	There's a part of me that thinks this sounds super cool.
3194000	3197000	Obviously, I would be really into this if it could do the cable box.
3197000	3201000	Because, what? Comcast wants to charge an additional $10 a month
3201000	3203000	to literally push a button on the box.
3203000	3211000	It can already do DVR, but they only enable it if you pay the extra $10 a month.
3211000	3214000	Oh my god, I could just put the fucking antenna in my garage.
3214000	3217000	Duh! Stupid! Run the cable outside!
3217000	3219000	Loki's brainstorming in his head right now.
3219000	3220000	Makes sense.
3220000	3224000	So there's a part of me that... I mean, you still can get a lot on over-the-air channels.
3224000	3229000	I mean, not everything, but I could watch the new Heroes.
3229000	3234000	I'm wondering, where's that service that was for $15 where you get cable channels and shit?
3234000	3235000	I'm down with that.
3235000	3238000	Are you talking about Arrow? Didn't they get sued out of existence?
3238000	3242000	No, no, no. Not Arrow. There was another thing that you got, like a beta test.
3242000	3244000	Was it Sling or something like that?
3244000	3249000	Where they were going to have it on the Xbox One, actually, where you can actually get...
3249000	3253000	It wasn't Arrow, because Arrow was all local stations.
3253000	3262000	This was basically TBS, TNT, Comedy Central, MTV, Food Network stuff for like $15 a month.
3262000	3265000	Or it starts at $15 a month, I think.
3265000	3268000	Because I'd be down for those channels for $15.
3268000	3274000	Well, also, maybe Microsoft may be getting into their own cable thing,
3274000	3277000	kind of like we've seen Sony starting to get into in some cities as well.
3277000	3279000	So maybe that's why... I don't know.
3279000	3282000	Maybe there's a reason Microsoft really doesn't want to piss off the cable companies.
3282000	3285000	I mean, maybe that's just a battle they decide isn't worth fighting.
3285000	3291000	I don't know. At least it's free, like over-the-air TV always has been.
3291000	3293000	So it's interesting enough, but I think you're right.
3293000	3298000	It's only going to be in certain circumstances, if I'm willing to run a wire a certain way or what have you,
3298000	3300000	that I'm really going to benefit from it.
3300000	3305000	I've got an over-the-air tuner for my Boxee Box, which I think is fucking old as shit.
3305000	3311000	But maybe it's universal. I mean, it's by Hopage, so...
3311000	3312000	I don't know.
3312000	3316000	There's a lot of channels I can get just through my TV without really an extra accessory.
3316000	3320000	You know, I bet if I bought a cheap little HD antenna, I'd get a lot more.
3320000	3323000	At least the local, like 310 and 1340 and all the local ones.
3323000	3329000	We used to get the fucking... what was it? The over-the... I forgot to call those now.
3329000	3333000	It was the over-the-air stations through your cable line.
3333000	3337000	Normally, if you have cable TV and you can do that...
3337000	3343000	I forget the term for it, but basically you would just plug into that and you would get those without having to have an antenna.
3343000	3344000	And then they caught wise and went,
3344000	3349000	Wait a second, you know, you weren't buying our cable package. Shut off!
3349000	3351000	So they don't have that anymore.
3353000	3355000	Alright, well, moving on to some very different news.
3355000	3361000	You know, Microsoft was not the only ones at Gamescom that were announcing some big updates and changes and what have you.
3361000	3365000	Activision Blizzard, namely the Blizzard part of that equation,
3365000	3367000	was also making some announcements at Gamescom.
3367000	3373000	One of them including that Starcraft 2 Legacy of the Void, it will release within 2015.
3373000	3378000	We've been waiting a long time for this final part of the Starcraft 2 trilogy.
3378000	3383000	Because, you know, Starcraft 2 started a while ago and, you know, we're finally getting to that last part.
3383000	3385000	Then what the fuck are they going to have at Blizzcon?
3385000	3388000	That's a very good question. I'll get to that in a minute.
3388000	3392000	They're saying the final third of the story will be released within 2015.
3392000	3396000	It is currently in closed beta, which you can get if you've pre-ordered the game.
3396000	3399000	This is the version of the game that's going to focus on the protoss.
3399000	3403000	There are, of course, some new modes for casual and competitive play.
3403000	3407000	So, maybe they're going to announce a release date at Blizzcon because they could do that.
3407000	3409000	Or, oh, it's going to be their mob-
3409000	3412000	Don't they have, like, another game coming or something like that?
3412000	3414000	Like some, like, Team Fortress 2 type thing?
3414000	3415000	Yeah, Overwatch.
3415000	3419000	But anyway, one other game that will certainly be playable at Blizzcon, I'm sure,
3419000	3424000	is the newest World of Warcraft expansion. Legion was announced at Gamescom.
3424000	3429000	So, World of Warcraft Legion is the next expansion pack for World of Warcraft.
3429000	3435000	No idea when it's coming out, but I imagine that's something they will give more details on at Blizzcon.
3435000	3440000	Coming in the game for Legion is a new class.
3440000	3444000	Demon Hunter is a new hero class that will be playable within the game.
3444000	3446000	So, you can check out Demon Hunter in the game.
3446000	3450000	I guess it's tank and DPS. No healer. No healieros or anything.
3450000	3453000	Artifact weapons will be a new feature in the game.
3453000	3459000	You get artifact power and you unlock ability and traits and customize the weapon to do what you need it to do.
3459000	3464000	The Broken Isles will be the new zone where you can now level to 110.
3464000	3467000	You can level your character to 110 out in the Broken Isles.
3467000	3473000	There will be a new order hall where NPC members of your class carry out missions at your command.
3473000	3476000	I don't know if that's part of the garrison or what that's all about.
3476000	3479000	And a brand new PvP honor system. This sounds very interesting.
3479000	3484000	They're really going to change PvP with this whole new way you rank up and you can get the points
3484000	3490000	and spend them on accessories and things for PvP and show-offy things.
3490000	3492000	So, all that sounds very interesting.
3492000	3498000	I have to admit, as a former World of Warcraft player who I kind of quit during Pandaria
3498000	3501000	and now I pretty much play Final Fantasy XIV exclusively.
3501000	3505000	I tried to go back to World of Warcraft during Warlord's Draenor, but I don't know.
3505000	3508000	I just wasn't feeling it the same way I used to.
3508000	3513000	And I've got to admit, when I'm watching the trailer, I'm not getting really excited about it.
3513000	3517000	So, I don't know. I guess my time with WoW is all done. I don't know.
3517000	3519000	Dear Blizzard, no incur.
3519000	3525000	Well, no. There's a lot of people that still care, but that number is certainly less than it used to be.
3525000	3529000	You know, I was talking with Twitter earlier this week about where the sub numbers,
3529000	3531000	because, you know, they had taken a dive not that long ago,
3531000	3537000	but when Warlord's Draenor came out, the sub numbers skyrocketed to, what, like 10 million?
3537000	3539000	So, will that happen again with Legion?
3539000	3543000	I don't think it's going to get that high, but there certainly will be a spike.
3543000	3545000	But I kind of think World of Warcraft has peaked.
3545000	3549000	Like, I think we've seen the peak of World of Warcraft.
3549000	3551000	And that's okay. Blizzard has other ways.
3551000	3556000	I mean, a lot of people that left World of Warcraft went to go play Heroes of the Storm.
3556000	3558000	Still a Blizzard game.
3558000	3560000	Probably going to check out Overwatch.
3560000	3561000	Still a Blizzard game.
3561000	3562000	Diablo 3.
3562000	3563000	Starcraft.
3563000	3564000	Hearthstone.
3564000	3566000	A lot of people playing Hearthstone.
3566000	3569000	You know, these are all still Blizzard games, so they're still making money off you one way or another.
3569000	3573000	So, I don't think Blizzard has anything to worry about.
3573000	3576000	As far as what are they going to announce at BlizzCon this year,
3576000	3582000	I kind of suspect it'll be a Diablo 3 expansion pack,
3582000	3585000	because the game's done well on console.
3585000	3590000	It's one of their few games that's console and PC.
3590000	3593000	So, I sort of think they'll squeeze out a little more Diablo 3.
3593000	3595000	That's what I would expect to hear about at BlizzCon.
3595000	3599000	By the way, if you're interested in going to BlizzCon,
3599000	3602000	and you have the money for a ticket, and you want to go,
3602000	3604000	hit me up, A-S-A-P, on Twitter.
3604000	3607000	Twitter.com slash Sky, S-K-I-E.
3607000	3610000	And you want to get a hold of me before the 14th is the last day for name changes.
3610000	3614000	The reason why, due to a personal conflict that has come up,
3614000	3615000	I can no longer go to BlizzCon.
3615000	3620000	I was going to go, and this has nothing to do with the fact that Horde House has been on hiatus.
3620000	3624000	In a couple weeks, I'll tell you guys what's going on.
3624000	3628000	But there's a personal thing that's happening that now I can no longer do BlizzCon.
3628000	3631000	So, I do want to sell those tickets at face value.
3631000	3633000	I'm not going to scalp you. No shenanigans.
3633000	3638000	I think it was 406 for two tickets.
3638000	3640000	So, just 200. 200 pop.
3640000	3643000	I am looking for somebody to buy both, but if I get desperate,
3643000	3646000	we get to like the day before, I will look at breaking them up.
3646000	3649000	Or if I can find two individual buyers, then fine, I'll break them up. I don't care.
3649000	3650000	So, just a heads up.
3650000	3653000	If you're interested in going to BlizzCon and checking that out,
3653000	3655000	swag bags all yours, let me know on Twitter,
3655000	3657000	because I'm trying to unload those tickets.
3657000	3660000	So, there you go.
3660000	3663000	Blizzard updates out of Gamescom.
3663000	3665000	We are going to get to release dates soon,
3665000	3668000	but Dark Soccer has got a quick note for us before we do.
3668000	3671000	That I do.
3671000	3676000	This is kind of a switch up in something EA's been doing.
3676000	3682000	They're basically going to start releasing their games in the UK a day earlier.
3682000	3686000	So, instead of doing it Friday in the UK, they're going to do it Thursday in the UK.
3686000	3691000	So, pretty much, it's going to be, from what I can tell,
3691000	3694000	the equivalent of simultaneous releasing,
3694000	3700000	because, I mean, the day before there is, yeah, it's kind of weird.
3700000	3705000	So, yeah, but basically, they want to make sure that everyone in Europe
3705000	3708000	gets their games at the same time as everyone everywhere else.
3708000	3711000	So, yay.
3711000	3713000	All right.
3713000	3716000	I wonder if this will be a trend that moves on to other companies.
3716000	3721000	Maybe EA starts this and then a whole lot of other companies start releasing their games earlier.
3721000	3722000	Yeah.
3722000	3723000	We'll see.
3723000	3725000	Timey-wimey stuff.
3725000	3726000	All right.
3726000	3731000	Well, before we find out, we've still got many more weeks to get through,
3731000	3735000	including this week and what is coming out in the US, Japan, and the UK.
3735000	3737000	So, Loki, what is coming out in the US this week?
3737000	3740000	Fuck if I know.
3740000	3742000	Is that your official answer?
3742000	3744000	It's my answer currently.
3744000	3746000	I'm just pulling it up real fast.
3746000	3750000	I do apologize.
3750000	3755000	Loki was unprepared for a release date segment that we do every week here on OLR.
3755000	3759000	Well, yeah.
3759000	3764000	Hey, I finally got a text back from Shane on that game that I'm supposed to check out on Steam.
3764000	3765000	Oh, which game was it?
3765000	3767000	Dead Realm is the name of the game.
3767000	3768000	Dead Realm?
3768000	3771000	That's the game I'm supposed to check out on Steam in the scary game.
3771000	3772000	I don't know.
3772000	3774000	Look at it later when you're not looking up release dates.
3774000	3775000	Okay.
3775000	3782000	So, this week, not a whole lot, actually.
3782000	3786000	Basically, it looks like they're doing a, I guess this is an update,
3786000	3792000	Toy Soldiers War Chest Hall of Fame Edition for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
3792000	3799000	Then, for some stupid reason, they have a Paddington Adventures in London game for 3DS.
3799000	3803000	X-Blaze, Lost, and then Memories.
3803000	3805000	That's on PlayStation 3.
3805000	3806000	Oh, that's right.
3806000	3808000	I did remember there was a big game this week.
3808000	3810000	Garfield Kart on 3DS.
3810000	3812000	Oh, yay.
3812000	3817000	X-Blaze, Lost, Memories is also coming out on Vita as well.
3817000	3822000	And not a game you can buy at retail, but everybody's gone to the Rapture
3822000	3824000	or should be coming out on PlayStation 4.
3824000	3827000	I was going to say, I see AndyScout mentioning that in chat right now.
3827000	3829000	Everyone's gone to the Rapture.
3829000	3832000	I know they've been pushing that on PlayStation as well in the digital store,
3832000	3834000	so I want to check that out too.
3834000	3835000	It's like a fun game.
3835000	3836000	That's it.
3836000	3837000	All right.
3837000	3840000	Moving over to Japan and checking out the releases over there.
3840000	3846000	In Japan this week on the PlayStation 4, actually, there's really not a lot on PlayStation 4.
3846000	3849000	Things are kind of quiet in Japan right now until the 27th of August,
3849000	3851000	at least on the PlayStation 4.
3851000	3853000	Looking at some of the other systems, of course, the Wii U.
3853000	3856000	Ain't got nothing until Mario Maker's out.
3856000	3857000	So they're pretty slow there.
3857000	3862000	But, you know, you can always usually count on the Vita in a slow week,
3862000	3865000	but this week on the Vita, nothing as well.
3865000	3870000	There's a Romeo vs. Juliet chapter pack thing coming out on the Vita,
3870000	3872000	but that's not until August 20th.
3872000	3875000	So that just leaves me with the 3DS.
3875000	3881000	The 3DS has one lone game out this week, Atelier Deco La Doll Collection.
3881000	3882000	That's right.
3882000	3886000	A doll dress-up game is your lone release there on the 3DS this week.
3886000	3888000	So a very quiet week in Japan for releases.
3888000	3889000	Dark Sakura?
3889000	3891000	Just a few things.
3891000	3894000	On the 11th, we have Everybody's Gone to the Rapture,
3894000	3899000	Goat Simulator on PS4 and PS3, and Olli Olli 2.
3899000	3900000	Oh, God.
3900000	3901000	Is that coming out over here too?
3901000	3903000	I will have to buy it for a third time.
3903000	3905000	Hasn't Olli Olli 2 been out forever?
3905000	3906000	No, fuck that.
3906000	3907000	I'm talking about Goat Simulator.
3907000	3908000	Oh.
3908000	3909000	Oh, God.
3909000	3912000	Goat Simulator's on PC and Xbox One?
3912000	3914000	Yeah, it's on PC, Xbox One, Xbox 360.
3914000	3915000	Ah, got it.
3915000	3918000	Yes, I want to buy that again.
3918000	3921000	That'll be the game I get my son to play.
3921000	3923000	Goat Simulator.
3923000	3926000	He'll have to stream that shit.
3926000	3928000	Are you a fan of Goat Simulator, Dark Sakura?
3928000	3931000	I liked it for about five minutes.
3931000	3932000	I think it's fun.
3932000	3933000	All right.
3933000	3937000	Just a couple more stories, and then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week.
3937000	3938000	Loki.
3938000	3939000	All right.
3939000	3940000	Let's talk about Konami.
3940000	3941000	I know.
3941000	3942000	It's depressing.
3942000	3948000	Apparently, there's some information coming out from Nikkei's report about the company.
3948000	3951000	I guess from some insiders.
3951000	3954000	Some of the things coming out of the report.
3954000	3962000	Apparently, they have renamed the computers that were originally part of Kojima Productions,
3962000	3966000	now known as Number 8 Production Department, and they're not connected to the internet
3966000	3969000	and only can send messages internally.
3969000	3975000	Employees who leave office during lunchtime are monitored by time cards, and those who
3975000	3979000	take too long have their names announced throughout the company.
3979000	3987000	Developers, including relatively high-ranking ones, who aren't seen as useful, they are
3987000	3993000	being reassigned to different jobs, including sometimes security guards or even cleaning
3993000	3996000	staff of Konami's health clubs.
3996000	4005000	Apparently, also, the company, they've monitored the farewell Facebook post of a soon-to-be-leaving
4005000	4010000	employee, who had gotten a job at another company, and any employees who'd liked the
4010000	4013000	post were reshuffled within the company.
4013000	4017000	That sounds like a pretty hostile work environment, if you ask me.
4017000	4022000	Well, not that I'm gonna say, oh, I agree with all this stuff or necessarily defend.
4022000	4027000	There is a big part of me that says, well, wait a minute, I'm gonna take a huge grain
4027000	4035000	of salt with this, because is some of this being sensationalized for headlines sensationalism
4035000	4036000	in my gaming journalism?
4036000	4037000	Maybe, I don't know.
4037000	4040000	It's more real than you think, Loki.
4040000	4044000	So, I mean, okay, some of it is extreme.
4044000	4047000	The whole thing where people are getting reassigned to be the janitor and stuff, that's a little
4047000	4048000	weird.
4048000	4051000	But, okay, the computers are not on the internet.
4051000	4056000	That does not seem like a crime against humanity, because putting the computers on the internet
4056000	4058000	puts them at risk of getting hacked.
4058000	4063000	The developers of the games probably don't have a need to be on the internet, because
4063000	4065000	all the tools they use are internal.
4065000	4067000	Whatever they need access to are probably on their internal network.
4067000	4072000	Well, I think what they're doing is because maybe they're getting rid of that team that
4072000	4077000	they don't want information being sent out from them externally or something like that.
4077000	4080000	But it's not unheard of for other companies as well.
4080000	4084000	Especially in a lot of non-office environments, you probably don't have access to the internet
4084000	4085000	where you work.
4085000	4089000	Even in my work, the internet, a lot of stuff is blocked.
4089000	4090000	Is it a crime against humanity?
4090000	4091000	No.
4091000	4094000	I understand why I can't play on Facebook during the workday.
4094000	4099000	Which also, again, if people are clicking like on a post or whatever about somebody's
4099000	4103000	work, you've got to be careful what kind of crap you post on Facebook about the workplace.
4103000	4104000	You really, really do.
4105000	4115000	Again, it's not that I agree, but I question how much of this is a little bit like the
4115000	4116000	movie version.
4116000	4117000	I don't know.
4117000	4118000	This is Konami, though.
4118000	4121000	I'm willing to believe a lot of it, because look at what they did.
4121000	4124000	They literally scrubbed Kojima off of his game.
4124000	4127000	I mean, who does that?
4127000	4129000	That's just bullshit.
4129000	4133000	I think that's why a lot of this is believable.
4134000	4138000	I'm sure morale is in the toilet at Konami.
4138000	4141000	I'm sure morale is absolutely in the toilet.
4141000	4146000	There's no arguing that, really, based on everything we're seeing and hearing.
4146000	4153000	Again, the urge to kick them while they're down, you've got to put that in check with,
4153000	4154000	but what's the reality?
4154000	4155000	But that's okay, though.
4155000	4156000	I've got good news for you.
4156000	4157000	Oh, goodie.
4157000	4161000	Because I know that everybody was so disappointed that PT came up there and they took it down
4161000	4165000	off the internet and you're like, ah, damn, what about a new Silent Hill game?
4165000	4168000	There's a brand new Silent Hill game coming.
4168000	4169000	They just announced it.
4169000	4171000	Get excited for mobile games.
4171000	4173000	It's a slot machine.
4176000	4178000	It's really happening.
4178000	4183000	We were joking about that on the show a couple months ago when all this fuckery was hitting
4183000	4184000	its peak.
4184000	4187000	There really is a Silent Hill slot machine happening.
4187000	4188000	Yes.
4188000	4189000	God.
4190000	4191000	All right.
4191000	4192000	Okay.
4193000	4194000	Whatever.
4194000	4198000	Dr. Sakura's making a motion with her hand that's not safe for work.
4198000	4204000	But really, the best news out of all this probably is completely unrelated, but I've
4204000	4209000	been kind of watching some of their coverage of the test locations of the new DDR machine,
4209000	4211000	but BomaniStyle's back.
4211000	4212000	BomaniStyle.com.
4212000	4213000	Check it out.
4213000	4214000	It's back.
4214000	4215000	Oh, yeah.
4215000	4217000	Our pals at BomaniStyle are back after this.
4217000	4224000	So to show there are still some good and some fans and stuff of Konami and, well, music
4224000	4228000	gaming in general, because they're running a lot of stuff on Guitar Hero and other stuff
4228000	4229000	too.
4229000	4231000	But yeah, it's good that they're back.
4231000	4232000	So welcome back.
4232000	4234000	Rolling out the red carpet.
4234000	4235000	Ticker tape parade.
4237000	4239000	I'll have to get Eddie back on the show at some point.
4239000	4240000	It's a lot of fun to have him on.
4240000	4244000	Especially in light of everything that's been going on, I'd really like to hear because
4244000	4246000	he probably follows them even more closely than we do.
4246000	4250000	So when are we going to start seeing the Silent Hill machines like at Red Hawk or something
4250000	4251000	like that?
4251000	4255000	I don't know if they would ever bring the Silent Hill machines here because I don't
4255000	4259000	think it really fits in with the old grandmas who fill up the arcade.
4259000	4261000	Oh my heart!
4264000	4268000	You know, you look at the slot machines in Reno and it's more like, you know, the Ellen
4268000	4271000	show and the Hangover movie.
4271000	4274000	They have an Ellen show slot machine.
4275000	4278000	I won 40 bucks off a Dolly Parton slot machine.
4278000	4279000	It was awesome.
4279000	4281000	But they also had a Dungeons and Dragons.
4281000	4283000	That's what makes me understand.
4283000	4284000	I don't understand.
4284000	4286000	Maybe this is bigger in Japan or something.
4286000	4289000	They have a really healthy gambling scene in Japan.
4289000	4291000	I mean, where are these slot machines going?
4291000	4296000	Because I know over here in the states that do allow slot machines, I just don't see this
4296000	4298000	type of slot machine being a draw.
4298000	4300000	It's probably other Asian regions.
4300000	4302000	It may not even necessarily be Japan.
4302000	4303000	It could be Macau.
4303000	4306000	It could be, you know, other parts of the world where there's gambling.
4306000	4308000	I just don't know.
4308000	4310000	Whatever, that's the direction you want to take the company in.
4310000	4313000	I guess I can only...
4313000	4316000	No, I can mock you as long as I want, I guess.
4316000	4319000	So I will continue to do so.
4319000	4320000	All right.
4320000	4323000	Anyhow, let's move on.
4323000	4325000	I got to give a shout out to this real quick.
4325000	4326000	It's on my mind.
4326000	4327000	I got to say it.
4327000	4328000	So our pal, Dekeman.
4328000	4329000	You know, Dekeman?
4329000	4330000	We owe Dekeman a lot.
4330000	4332000	We would have a website right now if it wasn't for Dekeman.
4332000	4335000	I know it's very old, and one of these days we'll get it updated.
4335000	4339000	But Dekeman, he has a Tumblr, and I still keep in touch with him on Tumblr,
4339000	4341000	and he posted a picture.
4341000	4344000	He was behind a Konami car.
4344000	4347000	And remember, Dekeman lives like in the middle of nowhere Canada.
4347000	4349000	With all due respect, you know, Dekeman, you're great,
4349000	4351000	but you live in the middle of nowhere Canada, right?
4351000	4352000	He knows that.
4352000	4356000	So he's behind this Konami car in the middle of nowhere Canada
4356000	4359000	at a McDonald's drive-through.
4359000	4363000	And so he took a picture of him flipping the car off in the McDonald's drive-through.
4363000	4366000	And on Tumblr, I couldn't help but add the line.
4366000	4374000	I said, how apropro that Konami is now resorting to buying from the dollar menu at McDonald's.
4374000	4377000	But apparently he's got casinos, because he's in a remote part of Canada,
4377000	4379000	he's got casinos where he's at.
4379000	4382000	I think it's a touristy area, because without giving away his home address,
4382000	4385000	I think he's in like a lake, which a lot of Canada is by a lake.
4385000	4390000	Would the dollar menu be considered microtransactions at McDonald's?
4390000	4392000	Fuck off.
4392000	4395000	Or is really any transaction a microtransaction at McDonald's?
4395000	4398000	I mean, especially when you look at calories, I guess.
4398000	4401000	So next time you go to, I can just see Loki.
4401000	4404000	This is angry old man Loki driving to the McDonald's.
4404000	4410000	Yeah, I want a hamburger and a large diet coke.
4410000	4411000	You want fries with that?
4411000	4413000	Fuck your microtransactions!
4415000	4418000	First off, I have to question my sanity ordering a diet coke,
4418000	4423000	because that's like, I'd rather drink water than diet coke.
4423000	4425000	That shit is nasty.
4426000	4430000	Although, like, my wife had like some, I don't know what it is,
4430000	4432000	like hipster green coke or something like that.
4432000	4434000	It's something like green canned shit that has like,
4434000	4436000	something that's not sugar, it's unnatural.
4436000	4437000	Oh, it's the stevia coke.
4437000	4440000	Oh yeah, it's okay, I guess.
4440000	4441000	It's coke life.
4441000	4445000	I got one of those once before they even had a price on it at the store.
4445000	4447000	They basically rolled it out a month early.
4447000	4450000	I'm sorry, you just said hipster soda and Dark Sakura says,
4450000	4453000	well, I got it a month before everybody else did.
4453000	4457000	No, no, no, my grocery store actually put it out on the shelves
4457000	4460000	before they were supposed to, so they didn't have a skew for it.
4460000	4463000	You know, it's just, you're being hipster about hipster soda, but I love it.
4463000	4465000	Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.
4465000	4466000	Arts.
4466000	4468000	I mean, one of those things.
4468000	4469000	You want, you want some parakeet?
4469000	4470000	You want, you want a whole box?
4470000	4471000	Cause we got nine boxes.
4471000	4472000	I'll take a box home.
4472000	4473000	Take a box home.
4473000	4474000	Give me one now.
4474000	4475000	Take two boxes home.
4475000	4476000	Get it out of my house.
4476000	4477000	Thank you.
4477000	4480000	I'll just give some as a housewarming thing when people come over.
4480000	4481000	I only went to my wife.
4481000	4483000	She always wants exotic candy.
4483000	4484000	There you go, exotic candy.
4484000	4486000	Pear candy for, there you go.
4486000	4487000	I'll give, make sure Alan eats a box.
4487000	4489000	I just don't want to open the box.
4489000	4490000	What is it?
4490000	4491000	It's like a chocolate.
4491000	4493000	It's like pear peanut brittle stuff.
4493000	4494000	It looks like what it does on the front there.
4494000	4495000	Anyway.
4495000	4497000	It's pear nut brittle with chocolate.
4497000	4498000	This is great radio.
4498000	4502000	So let's move on and talk about Killer Instinct season three.
4502000	4506000	Yeah, Killer Instinct's still going and Killer Instinct announced that season three is going
4506000	4511000	to be coming to Xbox One and of course, as mentioned at E3, Windows 10.
4511000	4513000	The date will be March of 2016.
4513000	4516000	There is no gameplay footage available.
4516000	4522000	However, Killer Instinct is apparently going to feature guest characters from Rare Replay.
4522000	4524000	Imagine that crossover.
4524000	4529000	Rash from Battletoads will be a character in Killer Instinct.
4529000	4531000	Actually, not even will be.
4531000	4534000	He is a character available in Killer Instinct right now.
4534000	4538000	So you can check out Rash, a preview character from Killer Instinct season three.
4538000	4542000	And a cute little tie in there for Rare Replay.
4542000	4545000	So if you want to know if GameStop has Battletoads, yes they do.
4545000	4548000	And it's available even on the Xbox One as well.
4548000	4550000	Battletoads everywhere.
4550000	4553000	Now just, how about just a new Battletoads game?
4553000	4558000	I feel like that's the thing that Microsoft's been dancing around for ever since they picked up Rare.
4558000	4560000	How about a new Battletoads game? How about it?
4560000	4565000	Microsoft is to Battletoads as Nintendo is to F-Zero.
4567000	4569000	It is kind of irritating, isn't it?
4569000	4573000	Alright, let's go back to a more classic time.
4573000	4576000	Let's go back to a time when Battletoads was new and relevant.
4576000	4579000	Well, maybe a little past that actually.
4579000	4581000	Still pissed us off.
4581000	4583000	It's the classic game of the week.
4583000	4585000	Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
4585000	4588000	hey, this is worthy of your attention.
4588000	4590000	A classic game that you ought to be playing.
4590000	4591000	And the rule is...
4591000	4592000	It's so old.
4592000	4594000	Ten years old or more.
4594000	4596000	Because I think tonight's is like right on the line, right?
4596000	4599000	It's like April, 2005.
4599000	4602000	So if you can believe it, this game is ten years old.
4602000	4603000	Get ready to feel old.
4603000	4606000	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4606000	4608000	Psychonauts.
4609000	4611000	Yes, Psychonauts.
4611000	4614000	It came out in 2005.
4614000	4619000	Released by Double Fine Productions through Majesco.
4619000	4624000	So basically you play as a boy who has psychic powers.
4624000	4628000	Who runs away from the circus to sneak into summer camp for other people who are psycho.
4628000	4630000	I mean, have psychic powers.
4630000	4632000	So you can be a Psychonaut.
4632000	4634000	And there is a plot going on at the camp.
4634000	4636000	The only he can stop.
4637000	4644000	So he basically also works with a few of the other characters in the game.
4644000	4645000	Solves puzzles.
4645000	4648000	And one of the things about this one that made it really...
4648000	4651000	I'd say a special, special snowflake.
4651000	4658000	Is that not only is it a platforming game or has platforming elements to it.
4658000	4664000	But it also sort of throws in the type of dialogue options that you get from an adventure game.
4664000	4670000	You have to find hidden items you can use to buy items at the camp.
4670000	4673000	Or get psy cards that boost your ranking.
4673000	4678000	You have to do like little levels within the game.
4678000	4682000	And then you have the quote real world that's the camp that you're in.
4682000	4684000	You also have an insane asylum in the game.
4684000	4686000	And every game needs an insane asylum.
4686000	4692000	One of the other things that I thought was fun is finding the tags to match to emotional baggage.
4692000	4697000	Which is how you unlock different things in the game.
4697000	4703000	And break mental vaults to get slideshows that let you know a little bit more about the character and whatnot.
4703000	4706000	So it's just really a fun little quirky game.
4706000	4713000	He's got powers like telekinesis, pyrokinesis which is great.
4713000	4720000	Clairvoyance, PsyShield, PsyBlast, confusion, levitation, and invisibility.
4720000	4722000	So pretty, pretty fun stuff.
4722000	4732000	And I'm not going to go too much into that because honestly I think most of you have played this already since it's not, you know, it's just ten years ago, you know.
4732000	4735000	Loki was just telling me he was playing it yesterday. Isn't that right, Loki?
4735000	4740000	No, I have never played this game. It's in my library. I have not played it.
4740000	4742000	Ten years.
4742000	4747000	I have a feeling, unfortunately, there's a lot of people who picked up Psychonauts and let it rot in their library.
4747000	4750000	So this might be a gentle reminder to go check it out.
4750000	4755000	Well, at any rate, it got a really good score when it came out.
4755000	4766000	It actually was, one of the best descriptions is actually one of GameSpot's sources.
4766000	4770000	The whole look of the game feels like an unholy love child of Tim Burton and a Pixar animation team.
4770000	4771000	Yeah, I can see that.
4771000	4773000	It's pretty accurate.
4773000	4781000	Well, and it's funny because we're talking about the whole, like, I was talking about Banjo-Kazooie earlier and it's almost kind of like this is that type of game evolves a little bit.
4781000	4783000	I mean, obviously there's a lot of differences. It's not tit for tat.
4783000	4787000	But, you know, the whole, like, platformer, you know, what that looked like years later.
4787000	4793000	Well, it also won, like, a bajillion awards in 2005.
4793000	4802000	2006 it won Best Screenplay, Games Magazine, Electronic Game of the Year, Best Writing.
4802000	4808000	It got Top Hero, 10 out of 10 for certain magazines.
4808000	4810000	So it basically won all of these awards.
4810000	4816000	But despite winning all of that, it actually was a commercial bomb.
4816000	4817000	It failed.
4818000	4823000	So, however, it's got a huge, like, cult following.
4823000	4826000	So it's remained popular even after that.
4826000	4829000	You know, just sort of like Xanadu, you know?
4829000	4831000	Or the Rocky Horror Picture Show.
4831000	4832000	Or Xanadu.
4832000	4834000	That's what this is. Or the Rocky Horror Xanadu Show.
4834000	4836000	Or with showgirls.
4839000	4844000	In fact, I heard that coming to the Castro, Peach is Christ and Jinx Monsoon are doing Psychonauts.
4844000	4845000	Believe it or not.
4845000	4847000	I think that's the thing that's happening.
4847000	4848000	Maybe not.
4848000	4851000	Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.
4851000	4852000	Psychonauts.
4852000	4854000	It's probably in your Steam library.
4854000	4856000	Go check it out already.
4856000	4857000	Dig it up.
4857000	4859000	I think they were giving it away for free at one point.
4859000	4860000	I swear, like, they were.
4860000	4862000	It was like a Humble Bundle or something.
4862000	4863000	Yeah, Humble. It's been Humble.
4863000	4864000	One of the earliest ones had it.
4864000	4865000	Yeah.
4865000	4867000	So there you go. Classic game of the week.
4867000	4869000	Hey, we've got plenty more show coming up.
4869000	4871000	We still have some more news out of Gamescom.
4871000	4874000	We're going to get to the foogle question of the week as well.
4874000	4876000	And, of course, your emails.
4876000	4878000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
4878000	4880000	It's the place to send your emails.
4880000	4881000	And we're going to read some of those.
4881000	4883000	I think we actually got some this week.
4883000	4884000	So we'll get to those.
4884000	4888000	FUs of the week and your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
4888000	4890000	Or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
4890000	4893000	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4893000	4896000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
4896000	4899000	Episode number 609 already in progress.
4899000	4904000	This is part B. Live on this August 9th of 2015.
4904000	4907000	I just realized the episode number is 609.
4907000	4909000	It's almost 69.
4909000	4911000	But there's, like, a zero in the middle.
4911000	4912000	There just comes a certain...
4912000	4913000	It's for the threesome.
4913000	4914000	That's right.
4914000	4915000	They just put an O.
4915000	4917000	The giant fat man.
4917000	4918000	Yeah.
4918000	4919000	Yeah.
4919000	4920000	Yeah.
4920000	4921000	That's right.
4921000	4922000	They just put an O.
4922000	4925000	The giant fat man that's just sitting there doing nothing.
4925000	4926000	Or an O face in the middle.
4926000	4927000	Nope.
4927000	4928000	It's the cat.
4930000	4931000	Hey, what are you doing?
4931000	4932000	Are you cuddling?
4932000	4933000	I want to cuddle.
4933000	4934000	Purr, purr, purr, purr, purr.
4934000	4935000	Wouldn't that be 63?
4935000	4937000	Because the cat face is colon 3.
4937000	4940000	Yeah, but if it's, like, Shermie-sized, it's no.
4940000	4941000	Okay.
4942000	4943000	All right.
4943000	4945000	Well, believe it or not, it's not a total perverted show.
4945000	4946000	Just sometimes.
4946000	4948000	We talk about video games here on the program.
4948000	4951000	And we're going to get back into rapid-fire news here, but I wanted to mention this, because
4951000	4953720	Loki, you were talking during the break, you were mentioning you had to get this new Humble
4953720	4954720	Bundle.
4954720	4957280	And it does sound pretty awesome, actually.
4957280	4961720	You know, they put together some really good deals over at Humble Bundle, I got to say.
4961720	4964040	So what is it that people can catch up on this week?
4964040	4965040	It's all Namco games, right?
4965040	4966340	It's all Bandai Namco stuff.
4966340	4970280	So they've got Pac-Man Championship Edition DX.
4970280	4971280	That's the version with all the DLC.
4971280	4972600	Do you know how much I paid for that?
4972600	4973600	Yeah, though.
4973600	4974600	And now they're just giving it away.
4974600	4975600	The all-you-can-eat bundle.
4975600	4976600	That's true.
4976600	4977600	For a dollar.
4978200	4983800	That's Platform Mines, Dead Core, and then for, if you beat the average, you get Ridge
4983800	4990400	Racer Unbounded Bundle, Enslaved Odyssey to the West, Ace Combat and Assault Horizon,
4990400	4994120	and then for $10, Dark Souls Prepared to Die Edition.
4994120	4996800	Plus more games that they'll announce all later today.
4996800	4998520	Yet to be announced!
4998520	5000840	Maybe one of the Pac-Man Ghostly Adventure games.
5000840	5002760	I haven't played Ridge Racer Unbounded too much.
5002760	5005680	I played just a very little bit of it.
5005680	5009640	And, I don't know, it's Bugbear, so it's not too terrible.
5009640	5010640	It's just not...
5010640	5014160	Damn, it's about time for a new Ridge Racer game, Namco.
5014160	5015160	I mean, seriously.
5015160	5019920	Well, I'm telling you, that whole thing is worth it for Pac-Man DX alone.
5019920	5020920	I love that game.
5020920	5026040	That's a great update of the Pac-Man series, so, I mean, just get that, even if nothing
5026040	5027040	else.
5027040	5028040	Drop the dollar.
5028040	5029040	Although there's a lot of other good stuff in there, too.
5029040	5030440	I'm just saying, the Pac-Man one just really jumps out at me.
5030440	5031440	I was like, wow, what a deal.
5031440	5037240	If Namco really wanted to do right by Ridge Racer fans, it would get reskinned R4.
5037240	5042480	Now, going back to the whole retro glasses thing we were talking about at the very beginning
5042480	5043480	of the show.
5043480	5044480	That's for nothing.
5044480	5045480	R4 was the best Ridge Racer game.
5045480	5047200	It's the best Ridge Racer game there was.
5047200	5049880	Okay, so you would take it just a reskinned HD R4?
5049880	5051880	I would just take R4, period.
5051880	5053080	I mean, I've got R4.
5053080	5054560	R4 for PS4?
5054560	5055760	R4 was amazing.
5055760	5058200	With JotCon compatibility.
5058200	5061120	The JotCon was not very good.
5061120	5063760	It was actually pretty fun.
5063760	5065460	That was playing Wipeout with the NegCon.
5065460	5066460	That was pretty fun.
5066460	5071200	ActDeft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, I would kill for the Ridge Racer 5 HD
5071200	5072200	remaster.
5072200	5075620	Let's see, Ragenator says, I got the Namco Bandai bundle.
5075620	5076620	Everything minus the Dark Souls.
5076620	5080880	I ended up giving Pac-Man CEDX Plus away since I already had it.
5080880	5085320	I imagine a lot of folks out there probably already have it, but if you don't, this is
5085320	5086960	a great time to jump on that.
5086960	5087960	Just saying.
5087960	5092200	Alright, let's go around and check out some other quick news and little quick bites we
5092200	5093840	call rapid fire news.
5093840	5094840	Loki.
5094840	5099780	We seriously need to play the R4 theme at some point, like maybe break next week or
5099780	5100780	something like that.
5100780	5101780	It's amazing.
5101780	5102780	Remind me, we'll do that.
5102780	5104880	I'm pretty sure I have it from old OLR rotation.
5104880	5106960	It might even be in VOG rotation right now.
5106960	5109680	It is absolutely amazing.
5109680	5116920	Anywho, so as I mentioned, I was back into reading, or well, I started reading, but then
5116920	5121960	I got lazy, and actually I like listening to the audiobook version better, but Armada.
5121960	5127520	And of course, Armada is by Ernest Cline, who also wrote Ready Player One, which as
5127520	5133680	you may know is getting adapted into a feature length movie by Steven Spielberg.
5133680	5134680	That is amazing.
5134680	5138440	And no, it's even more amazing, we have a release date for it.
5138440	5144320	That's right, Steven Spielberg's adaption of Ready Player One should be out December
5144320	5147160	17th, 2017.
5147160	5150960	It's two years away, but I can't wait.
5150960	5154160	It's gonna be awesome.
5154160	5157440	That's a little bit of a wait, but considering they haven't even casted one yet.
5157440	5158440	I don't care.
5158440	5160520	I will be waiting and hyped.
5160520	5163200	Go get in line right now, like those Star Wars people.
5163200	5164200	They're crazy.
5164200	5167880	It's gonna be amazing.
5167880	5173460	Along with that though, Uncharted, and there's a brand new Resident Evil movie.
5173460	5175500	Those also have release dates.
5175500	5181020	So Uncharted's supposed to be scheduled to come out June 30th, 2017.
5181020	5188200	Also the new Resident Evil movie, slated, called Resident Evil The Final Chapter.
5188200	5190420	The search for even more money.
5190420	5191420	Scheduled to be coming out January.
5191420	5193380	Is it really gonna be the final chapter?
5193380	5195100	Yeah, I don't know, we'll see.
5195100	5196580	Is Mila Jovovich finally done with this shit?
5196580	5199100	It's the final chapter until they reboot that shit.
5199100	5207020	And then so, that's gonna be coming to theaters January 27th, and then non-gaming related.
5207020	5210500	Bad Boys 3, February 17th, 2017.
5210500	5215980	Ghostbusters, they rebooted that July 7th, 2016.
5215980	5217540	Which apparently Bill Murray is in now.
5217540	5219220	I just heard that today.
5219220	5220220	Cool.
5220220	5222020	Is he gonna be a ghost in that one?
5222020	5224140	It's a cameo, so maybe.
5224140	5226980	Jumanji, they're rebooting that.
5226980	5236540	That's Christmas 2016, Magnificent Seven September 23rd, 2016, and Underworld 5, yet
5236540	5241040	another series of movies that really should end.
5241040	5244300	That's gonna be October 21st, 2016.
5244300	5246300	Alright.
5246300	5251220	Embryon in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, Resident Evil, the really honestly final
5251220	5253260	chapter, we swear for reals.
5253260	5255380	I am seriously, I caught a movie.
5255380	5256860	Like Five Nights at Freddy's?
5256860	5261740	Didn't the final chapter suddenly disappear from all the Five Nights at Freddy's 4 stuff?
5261740	5265260	I bet the reason why we got Five Nights at Freddy's 4 early is because he took his final
5265260	5266860	game and split it into two.
5266860	5270220	I bet he took some of his ideas and split them.
5270220	5271220	Just saying.
5271220	5272220	Just saying.
5272220	5273220	Five Nights at Freddy's 5.
5273220	5276740	I know, you would think there's gotta be a fifth Five Nights at Freddy's game.
5276740	5277740	Then you end it.
5277740	5278740	The fifth night.
5278740	5279740	There you go.
5279740	5280740	At Freddy's.
5280740	5281740	There you go.
5281740	5282740	Anyway.
5282740	5287300	Yeah I caught like one of the Resident Evil movies in the middle and like, I think that
5287300	5290100	series stopped being Resident Evil quite a long time ago.
5290100	5293500	Like I was like, this is like the fucking Matrix shit.
5293500	5294740	And I'm okay with that.
5294740	5300700	Cause I'm not like a huge fan of Resident Evil but I'm pretty sure from what I know
5300700	5303480	of Resident Evil, that was not Resident Evil.
5303480	5306340	That was some crazy Matrix bullshit that I watched but.
5306340	5307340	Those movies are gross.
5307340	5308700	I'm okay with that.
5308700	5309900	I don't need all that gore.
5309900	5310900	I'm not into that stuff.
5310900	5311900	No it wasn't very gory.
5312060	5314060	It was just ridiculous.
5314060	5316380	Like why are there all these clones of you?
5316380	5320060	And why are they jumping off of a building and skydiving in slow mo?
5320060	5322460	I don't understand what the fuck is going on here.
5322460	5324180	Wesker is cool.
5324180	5325940	But I didn't understand what the hell was going on.
5325940	5326940	Alright moving on.
5326940	5330580	And of course Ally Larter is in that.
5330580	5331580	Yeah.
5331580	5333180	I'm sick of her after Heroes.
5333180	5335180	Anyway sorry.
5335180	5336260	This is pretty exciting though.
5336260	5339660	They're gonna be doing an Attack on Titan game for the Playstation 4.
5339660	5346460	It's gonna be developed by Omega Force behind the Dynasty Warriors series.
5346460	5354900	That's supposed to be coming out sometime, I don't know, 2016 sometime?
5354900	5355900	Something like that.
5355900	5358020	I'll play that.
5358020	5367540	And then along with that there's gonna be a VR game based on John Wick.
5367540	5376140	So this is gonna be done by, I guess, the studio behind the Darkness, Payday 2, and
5376140	5378820	the Chronicles of Riddick, Escape from Butcher Bay.
5378820	5382380	So Starbreeze, I mean Payday 2 is fucking amazing.
5382380	5386580	So I think that'll be awesome.
5386580	5393500	It's apparently, they're saying right now that they have like a promo experience version
5393500	5397340	of the game that's on the HTC Vive world tour.
5397340	5403500	So if you happen to come across that, you can check out a demo that's gonna be on the
5403500	5406620	HTC Vive through SteamVR.
5406620	5407940	Alright.
5407940	5413100	Well, traveling around for some other rapid fire news, out of Gamescom this week, I know
5413100	5417940	a lot of you are looking forward to Street Fighter 5, and Vega was confirmed.
5417940	5420260	That's our Vega, or Claw.
5420260	5422900	He was confirmed for the game.
5422900	5427220	And not everybody a fan of what's hiding under the mask though.
5427220	5429260	Vega and Ken could possibly be brothers.
5429260	5431180	Maybe that'll be a plot twist, I don't know.
5431180	5432660	Re-imagine Ken.
5432660	5433660	But I don't know.
5433660	5434660	You know what?
5434660	5435740	I'm still hyped about Street Fighter 5.
5435740	5436740	I don't care.
5436740	5437740	I'll still play it.
5437740	5438900	So will you.
5438900	5440660	Who cares if they look a little weird?
5440660	5445040	They're gonna have reskins anyway available for, you know, $1.99 in the store.
5445040	5446040	Let's be real.
5446040	5447040	So there you go.
5447040	5449660	Vega happening for Street Fighter 5.
5449660	5454220	Final Fantasy XV also got a new trailer out of Gamescom.
5454220	5456860	I gotta admit, didn't care for it.
5456860	5461860	And I'm hyped about Final Fantasy XV, but considering how much they hyped up that trailer,
5461860	5466300	I wasn't, like, then it came out, you know, I was like, that's really pretty.
5466300	5467860	That's very artistic.
5467860	5469260	But it tells me nothing about the game.
5469260	5471420	It's just like, oh, pretty pictures.
5471420	5474800	Which, to be fair, I guess is a lot of Final Fantasy, but I wasn't, I don't know, I guess
5474800	5475800	I was just expecting a little more.
5475800	5478580	I still haven't gone back to play that, like, updated demo that they have.
5478580	5479580	Episode Disque, yeah?
5479580	5480580	Yeah.
5480580	5481580	No, you should.
5481580	5482580	I haven't.
5482580	5483580	No.
5483580	5484580	You know what else I haven't gone back to?
5484580	5486740	That's what I kind of thought we would see out of Gamescom is other scenes from the game
5486740	5488060	besides what we saw in Disque.
5488060	5489060	Yeah.
5489060	5490060	I thought that's what we'd get.
5490060	5491060	Yeah, I kind of regret buying that.
5491060	5492060	Maybe Tokyo Game Show.
5492060	5494340	Kind of regret buying the other Final Fantasy game for that demo.
5494340	5496340	You didn't like it?
5496340	5500460	That's what you get.
5500460	5501460	They knew a lot of people.
5501460	5502460	It was okay.
5502460	5503980	They knew a lot of people would buy the game just for that demo.
5503980	5511620	I thought it looked good, like, the trailer looked good for that game, but not so much.
5511620	5517180	Well, anyhow, you know, it's only, like, a couple minutes, and it is pretty, so you might
5517180	5520900	as well go watch the damn trailer, so it's out there if you haven't seen it yet.
5520900	5526820	Now, by the way, also, regarding Final Fantasy XV, there was a little update that was going
5526820	5527820	on.
5527820	5531500	Apparently, they actually showed off the Marlboro enemy and what it looks like now, and then
5531500	5535060	they were talking a little bit about the big villain in the game, and they're actually
5535060	5540900	talking about that the villain in Final Fantasy XV is going to top all of the previous Final
5540900	5543900	Fantasy villains.
5543900	5547220	They also said that there is the girl with the black hair that you see in some of the
5547220	5548220	previews.
5548220	5553160	The girl with the black hair is mysterious, but integral to the story.
5553160	5558820	They're also saying a playable city demo will be released soon, but no idea when that will
5558820	5559820	launch.
5559820	5560820	Probably just like the game.
5560820	5563200	They have no idea when that is actually going to launch.
5563200	5568140	Speaking of Final Fantasy series in a game I was very hyped about, you might have heard
5568140	5574380	throughout the past week that Arnie Roth, who is the Distant Worlds Final Fantasy composer,
5574380	5579460	he kind of slipped up at a concert and talked about a Final Fantasy XII Remake, to which
5579460	5584300	I said, yes, I was so excited for Final Fantasy XII Remake.
5584300	5589140	Like, look, I get not everybody was into the story, but Final Fantasy XII probably had
5589140	5593780	the best battle system out of any of the Final Fantasy games, and it brought us Balthier
5593780	5594780	and Fran to the world.
5594780	5598940	So we have things to be thankful for, and you know you want some Balthier and Fran in
5598940	5599940	HD.
5599940	5600940	Let's be real.
5600940	5605660	You will put up with the van scene, you will put up with that shit so you can see Balthier
5605660	5611220	and Fran in HD, especially if they're still keeping the same voice act, anyway.
5611220	5618260	But, well, Arnie Roth put out a statement and retracted the word remake, saying it was
5618260	5620700	used in error.
5620700	5625180	Following conversations with composer Hitoshi Sakamoto regarding new concert arrangements
5625180	5630420	of music from Final Fantasy XII, regrettably, the term remake was used in error during one
5630420	5633900	of the announcements that took place from the stage during the concert.
5633900	5637260	Maybe they meant they remade the song or remade the arrangement.
5637260	5638260	I don't know.
5638260	5641380	Maybe they're gonna HDify the game.
5641380	5645980	Hopefully they're just covering their ass for a Tokyo game show reveal.
5645980	5650460	That is my hope, but, uh, I guess I won't hold my breath, but I just, I really want
5650460	5652620	a Final Fantasy XII HD.
5652620	5654500	Why won't you give it to me square?
5654500	5656620	Why won't you?
5656620	5659220	Dark Sakura, save me.
5659220	5661940	There's no saving you from fandom, Rob.
5661940	5664540	No saving.
5664540	5670580	Real quick from chat, sorry, live.vognetwork.com, Embreon in chat says, the world deserves Bosh's
5670580	5672980	chest and Fran's butt in HD.
5672980	5675860	Eye candy for everyone.
5675860	5682940	So, um, we've been talking off and on about Guitar Hero Live and what, uh, we had some
5682940	5686140	thought for it, but they actually have confirmed there's going to be singing in it.
5686140	5691980	So you get to belt out, you know, the, the greatest hits involved in it.
5691980	5696940	Hopefully in key, they should put in like a auto-tune for stuff.
5696940	5699940	Or we get Loki to sing it in the key of funny.
5700660	5707140	So moving on, um, Lego, uh, Marvel Avengers have been delayed to 2016.
5707140	5708140	Boo!
5708140	5710140	Big, fat, boo.
5710140	5711940	And I know why they're doing it too.
5711940	5714340	It's for that fucking Lego Dimensions bullshit.
5714340	5718540	Yeah, let's sell us our $30 fucking expansion packs for that game.
5718540	5720540	Jamie, I think you pushed a button.
5720540	5722540	No, no, we'll push a button.
5722540	5724540	I didn't do shit.
5724540	5729540	No, I read the article too.
5730140	5732140	They even bring up Lego Dimensions, so.
5732140	5734140	Yeah, it's fucking $100 for the base.
5734140	5735140	It's Lego.
5735140	5736140	Okay.
5736140	5737140	It's Lego.
5737140	5738140	It's the Lego premium.
5738140	5742940	You know, $100 for the fucking base set and $30 for fucking expansions.
5742940	5747740	Dark Sakura again, making back and forth, not safe for work signs with her hand.
5747740	5748740	Thank God.
5748740	5750740	This is why it's not a video show, people.
5750740	5751740	Yep.
5751740	5756740	So speaking of delays, of course, some Mighty No. 9 has been delayed until 2016.
5756940	5758940	No!
5758940	5761940	Sorry, I just felt after what Lowkey did.
5761940	5765940	Comcept posted about this, saying, and I'm just going to read the quote.
5765940	5768940	We can acknowledge that the game will no longer meet its current release.
5768940	5772940	Bad use of an apostrophe, geez.
5772940	5779940	Will no longer meet its current release date and will now, in fact, appear in Q1 2016.
5779940	5783940	We will announce a firm release date and further details once we have it later.
5784140	5789140	Basically, they say it's for bugs and quality assurance.
5789140	5795140	I think it might have a little bit more to do with Red Ash failing.
5795140	5796140	A little bit to do with it.
5796140	5802140	By the way, Red Ash has a investor now, so it's going to have its releases after all.
5802140	5805140	I don't know if it has anything to do with Red Ash.
5805140	5808140	I just think they, you know, video games are hard, people.
5808140	5810140	They're not easy things to make.
5810140	5813140	And I think sometimes people are too aggressive with how long it's really going to take to make them.
5813340	5816340	They heard that 2016 was going to be the year that everyone was going to be releasing their game,
5816340	5818340	so they're like, hey, you know what, let's do it too.
5818340	5823340	We want to be in with that action, so let's do that.
5823340	5827340	Maybe it's punishment for Red Ash not meeting its Kickstarter.
5827340	5828340	It's because they really...
5828340	5829340	We'll get them.
5829340	5835340	It's because, just like LEGO Marvel Avengers, they really wanted to highlight another game
5835340	5838340	that was coming out, and that being the Mega Man collection.
5838340	5842340	They didn't want to steal any thunder away from them, so that's why it's coming out later on.
5842540	5844540	And they're going to bug fix the hell out of it.
5846540	5849540	All I'm saying, every little thing that goes wrong with this Kickstarter
5849540	5852540	is going to affect future Kickstarters, just saying.
5852540	5854540	Bloodstained better do it right.
5854540	5856540	Whatever, what Kickstarter has come out on time?
5856540	5858540	Like, hardly any, so...
5858540	5862540	I got my Exploding Kittens in the timeframe they said it would come out.
5862540	5864540	I mean, granted, that's a card game, but...
5864540	5866540	And it's sitting there in a box, unopened,
5866540	5869540	and everything I hear is about how the box is amazing,
5869740	5871740	but I'm not going to open it until I have people over.
5871740	5872740	We have a party.
5872740	5874740	Play some Exploding Kittens.
5874740	5875740	Open it.
5875740	5877740	No, I'm not going to open it now, because...
5877740	5878740	The box is amazing.
5878740	5880740	Don't you want to see how amazing it is?
5880740	5882740	Maybe we'll do a YouTube thing or something,
5882740	5885740	because apparently I have to have Sanrio in the room when I do it.
5885740	5887740	So...
5887740	5888740	Alright, anyhow...
5888740	5894740	It doesn't shoot out like some sort of compressed catnip or something.
5894740	5897740	It's just a catnip bomb goes off in the room.
5897940	5900940	It's like someone dropped a flashbang, but catnip bang.
5900940	5902940	DungeonBuster in chat says,
5902940	5905940	The new Hong Kong sequel is on target for this month, actually,
5905940	5907940	even with the expanded content due to the Kickstarter.
5907940	5911940	DungeonBuster saying Shadowrun Returns was a month or so off target,
5911940	5913940	but it came out relatively close.
5913940	5915940	Once again, another game that I backed by Kickstarter
5915940	5918940	and have the content and haven't played it.
5918940	5921940	And I was super hyped about that, and I really need to go back and play it,
5921940	5922940	but, you know...
5922940	5924940	That and Shadowrun Online, yeah,
5924940	5926940	I'm going to dedicate myself to an MMO.
5927140	5928140	Have that as well.
5928140	5929140	I think.
5929140	5930140	Do I have it?
5930140	5933140	This is a comment on a story that Jamie read a little earlier,
5933140	5934140	but it's good, so I'm going to read it.
5934140	5937140	Andy Scout in our chatroom over at live.voguenetwork.com says,
5937140	5940140	Guitar Hero Live is going back to basics.
5940140	5942140	Now we added singing.
5942140	5944140	How long until drums?
5944140	5946140	That's a good point, though.
5946140	5947140	They said they're going back to basics,
5947140	5949140	then all of a sudden here comes the whole band.
5949140	5952140	I'm hoping it's just because singing is easy,
5952140	5954140	and maybe can be done through the iPhone,
5954140	5955140	like SingStar is now.
5955140	5956140	You don't even need a microphone.
5956340	5959340	Like, by the way, if you weren't aware about that with SingStar,
5959340	5962340	all you need is the mobile phone and the PlayStation 4,
5962340	5963340	and it's magic.
5963340	5964340	The whole Bluetooth magic.
5964340	5966340	You don't even need a mic now.
5966340	5967340	Sing into your phone.
5967340	5968340	Like, I was almost...
5968340	5973340	Because my one son's super into Let It Go from the Frozen movie.
5973340	5975340	What child isn't into that song?
5975340	5976340	I don't understand it.
5976340	5981340	I mean, I think it's the daycare they play it.
5981340	5983340	Like, he is obsessed with that fucking video.
5983340	5985340	We played that for about an hour today.
5985540	5986540	But I was almost like...
5986540	5987540	Because they like dancing, too.
5987540	5988540	So I was like, okay, well, maybe...
5988540	5990540	Let's see if this is in Just Dance.
5990540	5991540	It's got to be in Just Dance.
5991540	5992540	And sure enough, it is.
5993540	5996540	But now they have in Just Dance was the Angry Birds theme,
5996540	6000540	and there's people dressed up like angry birds,
6000540	6002540	and it's kind of creepy.
6003540	6007540	Seeing the angry birds with people feet and arms.
6007540	6011540	It's like the Reddit forum where they've got...
6011540	6014540	Or the subreddit where birds with human arms or whatever it is.
6015540	6018540	Yeah, some of those Just Dance videos are very, very creepy.
6018540	6021540	But, you know, they got some really awesome songs in that game, too,
6021540	6022540	so I can't complain.
6022540	6026540	Anyhow, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
6026540	6030540	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
6030540	6033540	You put Facebook and Google together, you get FUGL.
6041540	6043540	And yes, Google Plus is still a thing, as far as I know.
6043540	6046540	It's still running, so until it isn't running...
6046540	6049540	If people stop answering all together on Google Plus,
6049540	6051540	then I'll stop asking it there.
6051540	6053540	But we're still getting one or two answers a week.
6053540	6055540	That's something.
6055540	6057540	That's more phone calls than we got last week.
6058540	6062540	So might as well run the Google Plus page as well as the Facebook.
6062540	6064540	So we're an equal opportunity here at OLR.
6064540	6067540	Actually, we got four answers on Google Plus this week.
6067540	6069540	So here's the question this week.
6069540	6072540	It is about the news about the DVR service.
6073540	6076540	We want to ask you guys about something not directly related to games.
6076540	6080540	Microsoft announced that they will roll out a subscription-free DVR service for the Xbox One.
6080540	6083540	This will allow you to record TV over the air, not cable.
6083540	6086540	They can be played back on any Windows 10 device,
6086540	6088540	meaning the Xbox One or your PC.
6088540	6090540	Are you interested in a feature like that?
6090540	6094540	Or do you think Microsoft needs to keep the message about the games?
6094540	6097540	Let's start on Google Plus tonight, since four is a lot on Google Plus.
6097540	6099540	We'll start with Redertainment, who says,
6099540	6102540	As I'm considering my options as far as TV is concerned,
6102540	6108540	what keeps me going back to satellite is being able to watch WWE, ESPN, and local channels via a DVR.
6108540	6113540	If I can get the local channels on my Xbox One and can get ESPN on Sling TV,
6113540	6118540	the only thing keeping me on satellite is being able to watch full complete episodes of WWE Raw,
6118540	6122540	which isn't currently possible via any legal online platform.
6122540	6126540	So yes, DVR on Xbox One is very appealing to me.
6126540	6128540	Josh Wye replied and said,
6128540	6131540	No, I think that Microsoft has muddled the message already.
6131540	6134540	You either walk on the side of the street or the other.
6134540	6137540	If you try to walk in the middle, you get run over.
6137540	6140540	Also where I live, Sony tried DVR with their PlayStation TV.
6140540	6142540	That didn't go anywhere.
6142540	6144540	Anyway, I thought the future is streaming.
6144540	6146540	Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they shouldn't do this,
6146540	6148540	it's just that they shouldn't lead with it.
6148540	6153540	You know, interesting in that comment, the part about the smartphone,
6153540	6156540	it's interesting in that comment, the part about the streaming,
6156540	6159540	because I think he does make a very good point there,
6159540	6164540	is that it's interesting that NBC and CBS and Fox and all of them
6164540	6168540	haven't really answered with full on streaming.
6168540	6170540	I guess in a way they have, because somebody is going to jump in and say,
6170540	6173540	Hulu, Hulu is an NBC thing and Fox partnership.
6173540	6176540	So I guess in some way they have and CBS has their own thing.
6176540	6179540	But again, then you all know how we feel about the fragmented
6179540	6181540	when you got one guy over here, one guy over here,
6181540	6183540	like you don't want to pay ten bucks each for all that stuff.
6183540	6187540	So I think it is interesting that the whole part about streaming,
6187540	6191540	where maybe some of these shows just need to be more accessible in streaming.
6191540	6194540	And some of these companies need to wake up to the reality that,
6194540	6196540	you know, the game has changed and over the air TV
6196540	6198540	isn't how everybody is watching their TV anymore.
6198540	6202540	Anyway, ActDeft says on Google+, it's free.
6202540	6205540	Unless it's utter crap and useless, I don't mind.
6205540	6208540	Extra Futures do sell a console for lots of people.
6208540	6212540	Brozame replies and says, for me a console is about games,
6212540	6215540	so adding in features that don't add value for everyone buying an Xbox One
6215540	6217540	seems like a huge waste to me.
6217540	6220540	I'd much rather see games that make me want to buy the console,
6220540	6222540	instead of just waiting for the PC version,
6222540	6224540	since there's maybe two games I'm missing out on
6224540	6227540	between both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6227540	6231540	Over on Facebook, we had Fabrice A who said,
6231540	6233540	this would be very interesting for cable,
6233540	6236540	but no use to me since I only get four channels over the air.
6236540	6241540	Tigerclaw says, it's great that Microsoft is offering a free DVR service,
6241540	6243540	but the fact it's only over the air isn't good enough.
6243540	6245540	Not many people can get a good quality signal
6245540	6247540	for over the air channels on their TV.
6247540	6250540	If they just allowed the functionality to control your cable box,
6250540	6251540	it would make the service better.
6251540	6254540	Andy R said, I don't even have cable, so not really.
6254540	6257540	In the days of Hulu and such, DVR seems less and less relevant.
6257540	6261540	The few cable shows I do watch, like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter,
6261540	6264540	are up on the studio's website the night of airing for cable subscribers
6264540	6266540	and a week later for non-subscribers.
6266540	6269540	Why bother setting up something to record if they're going to do it for you?
6269540	6271540	I'd rather focus on games.
6271540	6273540	I already have a PlayStation 4, Wii U, and both handhelds,
6273540	6275540	and not enough time to play everything on those.
6275540	6277540	If they want me to buy an Xbox One,
6277540	6281540	I need games I want to play that I can't already get elsewhere.
6281540	6282540	Well, to be fair to Microsoft,
6282540	6285540	I do feel like a big part of their campaign this year has been,
6285540	6290540	you know, these are the games you're going to play on Microsoft only this fall.
6290540	6293540	They're running the Rise of the Tomb Raider and the Halo 5
6293540	6297540	and the Rare Replay and all the stuff that's on their console.
6297540	6301540	Silent Tom says, I think that it will be forgotten and underused,
6301540	6303540	just like Nintendo's TV.
6303540	6307540	They just need to focus on games and not weird bells and whistles.
6307540	6310540	Rageinator says, I'd use a free DVR service.
6310540	6312540	Okay, so it's not games related. So what?
6312540	6318540	We all may be gamers, but we all don't live, breathe, and shit games 24-7-365.
6318540	6322540	Well, I don't know about you, Rageinator, but we have other interests, too,
6322540	6327540	and it would be nice to consolidate devices that enable us to enjoy our non-gaming interests.
6327540	6329540	Alan H. replied and said,
6329540	6334540	Consoles have been a household multimedia appliance since the 360 and Netflix integration,
6334540	6339540	arguably easier for those who watch DVDs via their PlayStation 2.
6339540	6341540	I understand why Microsoft, a giant in their own right,
6341540	6346540	would absolutely not want to go near negotiations with Comcast or Time Warner Cable,
6346540	6349540	two companies with reputations for not playing fair.
6349540	6352540	They have little reason to view Microsoft as a competitor,
6352540	6354540	and Microsoft is too smart to start giving them one.
6354540	6360540	That said, obviously, that limitation is going to make it useless to the vast majority of consumers.
6360540	6362540	And lastly, sj100matt says,
6362540	6368540	I may be in the minority, but I love these TV, TV sports, TV features that consoles roll out.
6368540	6373540	I think it broadens and enhances the experiences that you can have with a console, but I digress.
6373540	6378540	I think the hot item about this DVR feature is that you should be able to stream your saved shows on your Windows 10 tablets.
6378540	6380540	People will eat that up.
6380540	6384540	Yeah, I got to admit, part of it that does seem really interesting to me
6384540	6389540	is the fact that it's not just the fact that it DVRs to the same TV that your Xbox is on anyway,
6389540	6394540	but you could then, with the streaming, you could then watch that same show on your computer
6394540	6397540	or watch it on your Windows tablet or whatever.
6397540	6399540	That part is kind of interesting to me.
6399540	6404540	So that is definitely an enhanced feature there, so I'm keeping that in mind.
6404540	6406540	Anyway, some really great answers tonight, you guys.
6406540	6407540	Thanks for participating.
6407540	6413540	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
6413540	6415540	Be our friend on social networking.
6415540	6417540	Darn it, be our friend.
6417540	6419540	Let's get back into some other news. Loki.
6419540	6426540	Alright, I was just checking out my friend who used to work at a, well, he still runs a game store
6426540	6430540	and he's an actor and stuff, and he's going to be in some Disney film.
6430540	6431540	Good for him.
6431540	6432540	Oh yeah, you were talking about that.
6432540	6435540	He also got sued by Pepsi, so he lives a strange life.
6435540	6437540	Alright.
6437540	6440540	Anyways, so this is kind of cool.
6440540	6448540	Cities Skylines, you know, kind of the SimCity, but not SimCity, at least not shitty as the last SimCity game was.
6448540	6454540	It'll be coming to consoles, and of course, it'll be coming to the Xbox One first.
6454540	6462540	That is scheduled to be coming out, I'm not sure, doesn't really mention yet when, but soon.
6462540	6470540	And then of course, you know, hopefully other consoles after the Xbox One at a later date.
6470540	6481540	Also, Crackdown 3, the game that was going to get me to buy an Xbox One, not coming out until 2016.
6482540	6485540	But they did show off some development footage.
6485540	6493540	Now, one of the things that they were touting about the series was that it was going to be using that Microsoft cloud server stuff
6493540	6498540	to allow for this really crazy destruction in the game.
6498540	6505540	However, that destruction is only going to be available in multiplayer, but it's 100% destruction,
6505540	6511540	so you can blow up any building that you see in the game, and it will dynamically be destroyed.
6511540	6514540	And that is amazing, so I'll have to check that out.
6514540	6519540	But yeah, unfortunately, Crackdown 3, not coming out until summer 2016.
6519540	6522540	So, got a year away.
6522540	6524540	Alright.
6524540	6527540	I'm excited to try that new Crackdown game, too.
6527540	6531540	I wasn't as huge on the series as you were, but you know I gotta go collect orbs.
6531540	6532540	You do.
6532540	6534540	That's what everybody was into, right?
6534540	6536540	Hey, I'm excited about this.
6536540	6540540	You know, with the whole talk we've had tonight about retro being new again and all this,
6540540	6546540	I think this is a retro series that is really long overdue for reimagining.
6546540	6552540	And I realize it already had one, but anyway, the series I'm talking about is A Boy and His Blob.
6552540	6554540	Remember that game on the NES? I love that game.
6554540	6555540	Yes.
6555540	6556540	It's a great little puzzle game.
6556540	6559540	You feed the jelly beans and it turns the blob into these different things.
6559540	6561540	Very cool little NES game.
6561540	6565540	And I know they had the 3DS, it was like 3DS or a Wii?
6565540	6566540	It was both, yeah.
6566540	6567540	Yeah, it was on both.
6567540	6569540	Did it ever actually come out?
6569540	6570540	No, it did.
6570540	6573540	Okay, because I remember playing it at E3 and then it seemed like it disappeared.
6573540	6580540	But anyway, apparently Majesco Entertainment has appointed a new CEO,
6580540	6584540	and they're actually going to be focusing on digital games, not just the retail games.
6584540	6587540	The company Majesco is working on Glue,
6587540	6592540	and it's also working on a new entry for the Boy and His Blob series.
6592540	6596540	Sometime in the next two fiscal quarters is when we'll see this game,
6596540	6601540	and it's going to be across all next generation consoles, and in some cases, PC.
6601540	6606540	So who knows, The Boy and His Blob will be very logical to show up on the PC as well.
6606540	6611540	David Rector, by the way, now taking over as Majesco's new CEO and Chairman of the Board.
6611540	6614540	So yeah, very cool that's been worked on.
6614540	6620540	I hope it's not treated like shovelware, because I could really see where this just gets thrown into a kid's game.
6620540	6625540	But yeah, that was a game I remember really loving in the NES days.
6625540	6628540	So we'll be looking forward to that reboot.
6628540	6630540	Meanwhile, Dark Sakura.
6630540	6632540	Stuff. The end.
6632540	6634540	No, really.
6634540	6636540	That's going to do it for tonight, Solr.
6636540	6641540	If you want an alternative to Mighty No. 9 and you're tired of waiting,
6641540	6647540	there is a game that's actually under Steam Early Access right now called 20XX.
6647540	6650540	And it looks like it's pretty good.
6650540	6653540	It's $12 right now through Steam Early Access.
6653540	6655540	It keeps getting updated.
6655540	6660540	It's in beta right now, but it's got really, really good ratings.
6660540	6668540	And it actually originally was named as Echoes of Eridu, but got renamed to 20XX.
6669540	6673540	Raised over $20,000 from backers on Kickstarter, so hey.
6677540	6681540	And I thought Mighty No. 9 ripped off Mega Man. Holy crap.
6681540	6685540	What's funny isn't the 20XX, isn't that the opening of Mega Man 2?
6685540	6686540	Yeah, that's the Mega Man thing.
6686540	6689540	Where it goes in the year 20XX.
6689540	6694540	So it's like, not even is the game biting a little bit of Mega Man there,
6694540	6698540	but the name is, at least I kind of see it as a Mega Man reference.
6698540	6701540	A very subtle one, but it's there.
6701540	6703540	In the art world, it's called a quote.
6703540	6705540	A quote.
6705540	6712540	Meaning if you see remnants of another painter's style from an earlier era, it's called a quote.
6712540	6714540	So this is a quote.
6714540	6718540	So when I make a happy little cloud in Mario Paint, I'm quoting Bob Ross.
6718540	6719540	You sure are.
6719540	6720540	Hey, there you go.
6720540	6723540	It sounds like a roguelike Mega Man game.
6723540	6728540	Alan Alchemy in chat says, that reminds me of Homestar Runner when it made fun of Mega Man.
6728540	6731540	In the year XDXD6.
6731540	6733540	20XD6.
6733540	6735540	Yeah.
6735540	6737540	Hey, Stickley Man, what are you doing?
6737540	6741540	Wasn't there a new Homestar Runner this week that was talking about how Flash is dead?
6741540	6744540	Like, and then there was a part of me that was like, wow, they're still making Homestar Runner?
6744540	6745540	That's awesome.
6745540	6748540	Like, it came back after like a huge break.
6749540	6751540	Alright, anyhow, Loki.
6751540	6760540	Alright, so Bethesda has released some more information about Fallout 4, including a little bit of endgame stuff for Fallout.
6760540	6766540	With that, there is going to be no end to the game after the main story is done.
6766540	6770540	You know, I think that's pretty similar to the other games that Bethesda has released.
6770540	6773540	And also, no level cap for Fallout 4.
6773540	6776540	So you can level, level, level, level some more.
6778540	6779540	And more.
6779540	6782540	The level cap is 20XDX.
6782540	6784540	20XDX.
6785540	6786540	Yes.
6786540	6788540	Are you excited for Fallout 4, Loki?
6788540	6791540	I am, even though I've not really played a Fallout game.
6791540	6795540	And I, you know, I have Fallout 3 and I bought it and it made a big deal of it.
6795540	6798540	But it's such a pain in the ass to get it to work.
6798540	6800540	Because of the stupid games for Windows shit.
6800540	6806540	It just, update your shit so I don't have to do all this work around crap to get your fucking game to work.
6807540	6811540	Well, this is funny because after E3, I seem to remember.
6811540	6815540	I don't know if this was a conversation Bobby and I were having or if Bobby said it on his show.
6815540	6817540	Probably both, honestly.
6817540	6821540	But we were talking about, or he was saying on his show about how,
6821540	6826540	now that Shenmue 3 has showed up on the Sony stage,
6826540	6830540	how much longer until Kickstarters on stage at conferences become the norm?
6830540	6833540	Well, guess what happened at Gamescom?
6833540	6835540	Microsoft had a Kickstarter on their stage.
6835540	6838540	This one was a little different though because it was already funded.
6838540	6843540	Koji Igarashi got up on the Microsoft stage to talk about Bloodstained.
6843540	6847540	And so, yeah, they give a little update on Bloodstained.
6847540	6851540	Talking about a new character in the game, they showed some models and art.
6851540	6855540	Didn't really say if this character is playable or not, but he sure looks it, so we'll see.
6855540	6864540	Also, Bloodstained is given a release window of March 2017 for PlayStation 4, Vita, Xbox One, Wii U, and PC.
6864540	6872540	They also mentioned on the stage there that the game will feature cross-play between Windows 10 and Xbox One.
6872540	6875540	So that is something else a little bit Microsoft-centric there.
6875540	6877540	So, pretty cool.
6877540	6879540	I'm looking forward to Bloodstained.
6879540	6885540	I hope just because they're saying March 2017 now doesn't mean it actually gets delayed to February 2018.
6885540	6887540	But be prepared for anything.
6887540	6889540	Games always get delayed.
6890540	6893540	I got reminded when I was talking about Shadowrun and everything.
6893540	6895540	Oh yeah, Shadowrun Online. Yeah, I backed that.
6895540	6898540	That was supposed to be out in 2013.
6898540	6899540	Really?
6899540	6903540	The last update that I just read because I don't follow it too closely.
6903540	6906540	The company is filing for bankruptcy.
6906540	6909540	I don't think I'm going to be playing that game apparently.
6909540	6910540	Sorry to hear that.
6910540	6912540	Thankfully I didn't back it for too much money.
6912540	6913540	Alright.
6913540	6916540	Well, every week we like to take a trip to our mailbag.
6916540	6920540	Participate at Orangelauntrader.com is the place to send us emails.
6926540	6932540	Dark Soccer is going to suit up and head on into the mailbag and find some emails worthy of reading on tonight's show.
6932540	6935540	And after a very slow response past few weeks, we actually got a few tonight.
6935540	6936540	Two?
6936540	6937540	Two.
6937540	6938540	I'll take them.
6938540	6939540	Two emails.
6939540	6941540	So the first one comes from Robert M.
6942540	6944540	And it's disjointed.
6944540	6946540	Apparently comes the warning.
6946540	6950540	Briefly Loki, yes there's at least one unofficial LEGO Loot Crate type service.
6950540	6953540	Look up Brick Builders Club for one.
6953540	6961540	Secondly, I saw some developers Twitter post showing the two dozen or so games Scott Cawthorne did before the Five Nights series.
6961540	6965540	I wonder if the games have any easter eggs that call back to his previous games.
6966540	6972540	Third, I imagine we'll have an Angry Birds the Movie the Game, still not sure about the characters having bodies.
6972540	6974540	That is so true though about Angry Birds the Movie the Game.
6974540	6982540	For the record, when I was in Illustrator class, one of our assignments was to make a CD or, you know, a game cover.
6982540	6985540	So I did Silent Hill of the Movie the Game.
6985540	6988540	So I did, anyway.
6988540	6994540	I've recommended OLR slash VOG to a few others and gotten recommendations for other indie casts.
6994540	7001540	The Slash Films Toboloski Files with poignant stories from the character actor.
7001540	7011540	The St. Louis based Geekly Podcast and BCX Beyond Comics Radio with DJ Jacob Riles whose style reminds me a bit of Travis's.
7011540	7015540	Does he also orbit around the earth when doing his show?
7015540	7020540	Because you know Travis broadcasts from the satellite of VOG so we'll have to look into that.
7020540	7022540	Last email?
7022540	7023540	Yes.
7024540	7027540	God, this is long. Holy!
7027540	7028540	It's from Raw Steel UT.
7028540	7029540	Yeah, I get that a lot.
7029540	7030540	Oh, Raw Steel UT.
7033540	7035540	Balking at the size of the email there.
7035540	7036540	You're gonna read parts.
7036540	7037540	Okay.
7037540	7039540	Dear Raw Steel UT.
7039540	7041540	And anybody sending long emails.
7041540	7044540	Don't send a novel.
7046540	7050540	I don't want it annotated with footnotes.
7050540	7052540	I want the cliff notes.
7054540	7056540	Or put it up on the forums.
7058540	7062540	Yes, you can write novels on our forums all you want because nobody's loving those forums.
7062540	7066540	Although, I will say, Ray Genator posted a Final Fantasy XIV question so I was like, yay, forums.
7066540	7070540	Hey guys, I just bought Rare Replay in part due to the mostly positive buzz it's been receiving.
7070540	7076540	And it is here once more that I learned to avoid buying based mostly on positive buzz.
7076540	7078540	See, the game does something rather odd.
7078540	7081540	It installs the base menus and the menu of the game straight away.
7081540	7091540	However, anything that received Xbox Live Arcade or on-disk 360 releases is running rather ghetto on the clearly experimental Xbox 360 emulation software.
7091540	7094540	This is where the issue begins for me.
7094540	7096540	See, the games install off the disk just fine.
7096540	7100540	Although, they're all their own separate entries in the apps list.
7100540	7103540	However, this is a big fucking deal.
7103540	7107540	Each of them requires a separate update in the hundreds of megs.
7107540	7119540	And seeing that this is an Xbox One title, those updates not only take longer to download than they would on literally any other piece of hardware, but also fuck up bandwidth on any network the Xbone is on.
7119540	7123540	I kinda referenced this when I mentioned that I put in the disk and it wanted to do like 5 gigs of updates.
7123540	7127540	I think he's talking about this just using more colorful language.
7127540	7130540	Ray Genator, don't you fucking dare.
7130540	7132540	What was Ray Genator threatening?
7132540	7134540	A War and Peace sized email.
7134540	7137540	Just, ooh, it fell in the trash. Imagine that.
7137540	7139540	We accidentally lost your email, Ray Genator.
7139540	7141540	This is a long email and I want to get it read.
7141540	7142540	Alright.
7142540	7149540	Not only that, but while 360 titles start fine without the updates, you can't play them because for some weird reason you have to download your profile.
7149540	7154540	That's right, there's no option for profile creation or simply using the Xbone profiles.
7154540	7157540	I'm just saying Xbone because it's funny.
7157540	7164540	Nope, and a separate X360 profile needs to be downloaded in order to play the games, meaning there's no real option to play your games.
7164540	7169540	Or use the Xbone at all until a few extra gigs of data have been downloaded onto the system.
7169540	7173540	Can I just quickly say, I did not have that problem, so I actually don't know what he's talking about here.
7173540	7178540	And I don't know if that's because I was in the emulation thing already, but I don't even remember ever going through that.
7178540	7186540	So, my question is, where it's downloading all the games and stuff like that, do you get those, like the Xbox 360 ones, do you get those on the Xbox 360?
7187540	7193540	I don't think so, because these specifically say Rare Replay at the top. So, anyway.
7193540	7202540	This, mind you, for games that are almost a decade old at minimum, and for a compilation being re-released in mid-August, that has no real reason to be rushed.
7202540	7209540	This brings me to the real issue, most likely the massive downloads are for updates to the emulators being written for each and every game.
7209540	7217540	The fact that I got Banjo-Kazooie to start suggests that the games themselves are on disc, but as the backward compatibility is clearly being cobbled together desperately,
7217540	7226540	they're probably being worked on for each game, casting further doubt on the future of much ever coming out on Xbone's backwards compatibility initiative,
7226540	7232540	simply due to the apparent effort that is being exerted to get each game a decent emulator.
7233540	7240540	Now, that's entirely possible that the coming OS update for the Xbone will have an emulator. Okay, it's going way into it, okay.
7243540	7249540	Okay, complaint, complaint, complaint. Okay, I'm really not trying to be...
7250540	7252540	It's long your editing, it's fine.
7252540	7254540	I'm trying not to be rude about it.
7255540	7257540	Okay, so I'll just skip down to the last.
7257540	7263540	If you're buying the collection for the games that haven't been seen Xbox 360 released before, then you'll likely have a good time.
7263540	7271540	If you're buying the game for the games that have seen 360 released before, you're better off dusting your 360 off and playing those games there,
7271540	7278540	unless, of course, you're among the very elite who can afford and have access to Google Fiber or similar highly expensive internet speeds,
7278540	7281540	at least if the emulator issue isn't resolved soon.
7281540	7286540	And that has been today's warning from the Office of the OLR Minister of Unpopular Opinions. Have a great day.
7286540	7288540	Regards, Ross Steel UT.
7288540	7295540	Actually, I don't know who gave you that title, Ross Steel UT, but it should actually be the OLR Minister of Long and Unpopular Opinions.
7295540	7297540	Just, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
7297540	7300540	Well, you know, he goes into the missing games, which...
7300540	7308540	Which we talked about a little bit earlier in the show, and then I did notice the complaint about, like, Conker's Bad Fur Day and Grabbed by the Ghoulies.
7308540	7315540	I guess they did something a little different there, and to be honest, I haven't really dipped into both those games yet, so I didn't catch the same thing.
7315540	7323540	But I guess they did the N64 version of Conker's Bad Fur Day for some reason, but then they did the Xbox version of Grabbed by the fucking Ghoulies.
7323540	7327540	He says he was not a fan of that, so, interesting.
7327540	7330540	Thank you for the paraphrasing for me, because my...
7330540	7336540	I'm trying, I'm hoping I didn't screw that up, but seeing as I haven't played either of those games yet, I may be fucking up his opinions, I apologize.
7336540	7343540	And I, sometimes, I mean, actually more often than not, I tend to agree with some of his stuff.
7343540	7352540	I mean, I haven't played the game, so I can't make a judgement on it, and I'm probably not gonna get it, because, honestly, I think I own all of those games.
7352540	7355540	On their original consoles.
7355540	7359540	Well, a Spectrum, though, but yeah, I mean, you're not gonna go back and collect Spectrum.
7359540	7361540	There's other emulators for the Spectrum.
7362540	7368540	You know what? Sometimes you have to hear unpopular opinions, and I think that's one thing I want this show to bring.
7368540	7375540	But it works both ways, too, is that, you know, I want the people, like, and I'm just picking on RustyOuT, because he happens to be the current emailer.
7375540	7378540	I want him to be able to hear the other side as well.
7378540	7388540	So I think as long as we can have a respectful, underlined, italicized, bolded dialogue about, you know, things that we like and we don't like, and, you know, have a...
7388540	7394540	I think that's a great thing that we can do on this show, is make people think differently. Put ourselves in other people's shoes for a little while.
7394540	7399540	Even if it doesn't change your opinion, at least respecting that another opinion exists and is just as valid.
7399540	7400540	Yes.
7400540	7401540	And keep in mind...
7401540	7405540	And sometimes it can strengthen your own opinion to understand why another person thinks the way they do.
7405540	7408540	And keep in mind, don't confuse opinion for fact.
7408540	7411540	And I actually don't think anything he's saying in this email is actually unpopular.
7412540	7416540	I've heard a lot of people complaining about the Xbox 360 load times and some of the other stuff with the game.
7416540	7418540	And to be honest, I felt the same way, so...
7418540	7421540	Yeah, we're probably not getting it. Like I said, we've got most of the games. There's no point.
7421540	7422540	Yep.
7422540	7430540	Okay, well, regardless, it is time, after the email bag, to get into our FUs of the week.
7430540	7431540	Here we go.
7441540	7447540	Dark Sakura.
7447540	7450540	FU to the weekend being too damn short.
7450540	7452540	And me for sleeping most of it.
7452540	7454540	That's it.
7454540	7455540	Loki.
7455540	7459540	FU to my wife and kids for...
7459540	7464540	Well, mainly my wife for yesterday when the kids went to sleep.
7464540	7467540	She takes a nap on the couch and took up the entire couch.
7468540	7473540	So I couldn't nap on the couch, so I ended up just because I was exhausted laying on the floor.
7473540	7475540	Well, the floor is cement.
7475540	7480540	And so now my back has been fucking hurting for the last two days because I was laying on that hard fucking floor.
7480540	7485540	I would have slept in our bedroom, but the baby wasn't yet asleep yet.
7485540	7488540	So I had to wait for him to go to sleep before I could go in there.
7488540	7490540	And I was too tired for that.
7490540	7493540	And FU having to work on Saturdays until the other day.
7494540	7500540	That's going to be a tough change, but like I said before the show, having the weekday off for appointments.
7500540	7502540	And working until 7 o'clock at night.
7502540	7508540	That's weird too because I'm used to going in at 7 or 8 and it's going to be like 10 or 30.
7508540	7511540	But that means you can stay up until 3 AM and it's justified.
7511540	7514540	No, I still have to wake up early to get the kids off from school.
7514540	7515540	No.
7515540	7516540	So no it's not.
7516540	7520540	But I get a little bit... I'm easy to work I guess.
7520540	7521540	Alright.
7522540	7529540	My FU of the week goes to the fact that I cannot get over the mental block that change is scary.
7529540	7533540	Because you know, change usually ends up a good thing.
7533540	7538540	If you do the same thing every single day for your life, you're always going to get the same end result.
7538540	7540540	So change kind of has to happen.
7540540	7543540	But yet, all that being said, I still...
7543540	7550540	There's still a big part of me that is very nervous about a big change that's happening very soon.
7550540	7554540	And so of course I'm a little scared about that.
7554540	7556540	But it'll all work out kids.
7556540	7558540	It'll all work out.
7558540	7559540	Alright.
7559540	7561540	Let's get to a couple more stories.
7561540	7565540	And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
7565540	7567540	And our user name on Skype.
7567540	7568540	Orange Lounge Radio.
7568540	7570540	All one word.
7570540	7572540	Alan Alchemy in chat says,
7572540	7573540	Stop vague blogging.
7573540	7574540	This isn't Facebook.
7574540	7575540	Hey, you know what?
7575540	7577540	It isn't Facebook.
7577540	7578540	It's OLR.
7578540	7581540	The vagueness is sometimes even worse on this show.
7581540	7582540	You must be new here.
7582540	7584540	Alright.
7584540	7586540	Let's get to a couple more stories for you guys.
7586540	7588540	And then the Skype line.
7588540	7589540	Loki.
7589540	7592540	So, take note Nintendo and Sony.
7592540	7596540	This is how you should really do your pre-order bonuses and stuff like that for games.
7596540	7597540	Just Cause 3.
7597540	7602540	If you happen to order that on the Xbox One,
7603540	7610540	you also get a backwards compatible version of Just Cause 2 on the Xbox 360 to play as well.
7610540	7612540	I think that's pretty awesome.
7612540	7618540	And, of course, Just Cause 3 is coming out December 1st on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
7618540	7622540	But you'll only be able to get that free game on the Xbox One version.
7622540	7625540	Now, I want to say this isn't the first game they're doing this with, too.
7625540	7627540	They had, I think...
7627540	7629540	There were some other ones, too.
7629540	7631540	Among that, of course, would be Gears of War.
7631540	7636540	The Gears of War Ultimate Edition, which is actually coming out in a couple weeks here.
7636540	7641540	If you do happen to purchase that game, you'll get access to Gears of War,
7641540	7648540	Gears of War 2, Gears of War 3, and Gears of War Judgment all for free via backwards compatibility.
7648540	7653540	So, the Ultimate Edition, that'll be coming out August 25th.
7653540	7657540	And then you're going to have that offer until the end of 2015.
7658540	7663540	This seems like a very interesting trend, where buy the game and get the old game free.
7663540	7665540	Yeah, now...
7665540	7667540	Maybe that's how they enhanced the digital...
7667540	7673540	However, with at least this version of it, that's not necessarily...
7673540	7678540	Not the same with Just Cause, but in this one, you don't actually get those games for free.
7678540	7681540	You get them for free until the end of the year.
7681540	7683540	And then they're not free anymore.
7683540	7687540	Oh, interesting. It's a way to raise hype, I guess.
7687540	7692540	All they want you to do, they want you to push A and pre-order digitally.
7692540	7695540	And if they have to throw games at you to do it, that's what they're going to do.
7695540	7697540	Old games to get you to press A.
7697540	7703540	Well, I liked how they did it with the PlayStation versions of...
7703540	7709540	For example, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare did this, where you had your PlayStation 4 version.
7710540	7713540	You got the other version for free. It was cross-buy.
7713540	7718540	And I thought that was awesome, because my friends don't have that version of the game.
7718540	7721540	And thankfully, my PlayStation 4 had broken.
7721540	7725540	And so I was still able to play a version of the game while it was being fixed.
7725540	7728540	And that was awesome that they offered that.
7728540	7730540	And I think more they should do that.
7730540	7734540	Especially Nintendo! Hello! You have all these fucking virtual console games!
7734540	7737540	Start throwing that shit in like crazy!
7737540	7739540	Give it away like pear candy!
7739540	7742540	You buy the Wii U, guess what? You get 20 virtual console games.
7742540	7745540	I mean, that would totally sweeten the deal, I think, for a lot of people.
7745540	7747540	That's what they did with the 3DS, remember?
7747540	7749540	Yeah, do that again!
7749540	7754540	It's not helping that you have one game that released a few weeks ago,
7754540	7757540	and then the next game's not releasing for a few weeks from now.
7757540	7760540	Fucking fill in that shit in the middle.
7760540	7763540	Alright, AndyScout in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com points out,
7763540	7766540	Sword Art Online, Lost Song does it too.
7766540	7770540	If you pre-order on PlayStation 4, you get re-Holo Fragment free.
7770540	7774540	So, I think you'll be seeing that a lot more with sequels and series,
7774540	7779540	where the old stuff is bundled in to get you to buy the new stuff.
7779540	7784540	Anyhow, just a couple other quick little tidbits here before we open up the Skype line.
7784540	7788540	One of them about Rare Replay, because it's kind of all the rage this week.
7788540	7791540	Rare has announced that they are teaming up with iam8bit,
7791540	7796540	and they're going to be releasing limited edition vinyls for some of their classic titles.
7796540	7800540	It's in vinyl records, so that's pretty rad.
7800540	7803540	These soundtracks will be around $25 to $35,
7803540	7807540	and you can see there's some for Perfect Dark and Battletoads and Banjo-Kazooie.
7807540	7810540	So that's pretty rad, especially if you're into vinyl collecting,
7810540	7812540	and especially some of the art that goes with those vinyls.
7812540	7816540	I think you might be interested in this, so very cool.
7816540	7819540	And lastly, speaking of music,
7819540	7824540	Nintendo will be releasing a Super Mario 30th Anniversary soundtrack.
7824540	7827540	It's for Japan, but it will be coming out on September 30th,
7827540	7830540	and thanks to the internet, I'm sure once it comes out in Japan,
7830540	7832540	it's going to be on piracy websites anywhere.
7832540	7838540	Not that I'm saying that's okay, but you would think they would just bundle this in with pre-orders of Super Mario Maker.
7838540	7843540	But I digress. 3,240 yen, two discs full of classic songs,
7843540	7850540	from Super Mario Bros., 2, 3, Land, World, USA, as they call it in Japan,
7850540	7852540	which was our Mario Bros. 2,
7852540	7859540	Super Mario Land 2, 6 Golden Coins, 64, Sunshine, Galaxy, New on the Wii,
7859540	7866540	Galaxy 2, 3D Land, New 2, New You, Mario 3D World, and Mario Maker, the bonus track.
7866540	7870540	So much Mario. You probably know all the songs by heart already,
7870540	7875540	but there you go. You have a soundtrack to blast in your car, if you so desire.
7875540	7880540	Anyhow, that is it. We are to the end of the show,
7880540	7883540	and this is the part where we open it up for your feedback.
7883540	7885540	If you want to talk about anything you've heard on the show tonight,
7885540	7888540	or maybe something you haven't heard, or you just want to say,
7888540	7891540	hey, at least talk to us about something gaming, give us a call.
7891540	7896540	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
7896540	7899540	The Skype line is open now, and it's lighting up.
7899540	7902540	We're already getting calls. This is crazy.
7902540	7903540	Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7903540	7905540	Hey, guys. It's Jason.
7905540	7906540	Hey, Jason. How you doing?
7906540	7907540	I'm doing pretty good.
7907540	7909540	Great. Great to hear from you. What's up?
7909540	7919540	I need to talk about a rare replay game that nobody else has mentioned tonight, as far as I'm aware.
7919540	7926540	It's kind of right in the middle, but it's been one of my, I would openly call it obsession,
7926540	7935540	but it's been one of my favorites since the first time I played it back in 97, and that would be Blast Corps.
7935540	7938540	I was trying to think which one of them is from 97.
7938540	7939540	It's got to be one of the later games.
7939540	7943540	Definitely one of the N64 games, and it's really interesting,
7943540	7950540	because I never had an N64, and Blast Corps is one of those games that just doesn't emulate well.
7950540	7959540	For about a year, a buddy of mine runs stores in New Mexico, Albuquerque and Rio Rancho,
7959540	7965540	that does mostly game trade-ins on a lot of classic games,
7965540	7970540	but still gets his own fair share of shipments of new games and that kind of stuff.
7970540	7973540	It's a game store, period.
7973540	7978540	Great guy. I've known him for, wow, if not two decades now,
7978540	7982540	pretty damn close to it, even though I never went to school with him or anything like that.
7982540	7987540	But I've been talking to him for a while and various other friends,
7987540	7990540	and I've been planning on getting an N64 for a while.
7990540	7996540	I never had one when I was younger, so any time I played it, I was either renting it from Blockbuster,
7996540	8001540	borrowing it from a friend, or just over at a friend's house and playing it.
8001540	8006540	Something really interesting when I've been talking to people about Rare Replay and Blast Corps
8006540	8011540	is there was a question earlier about whether or not frame rate bugs were fixed.
8011540	8016540	You made the comment about if there was a 360 release and it's a 360 version.
8016540	8021540	There was a bug in Blast Corps where you could...
8021540	8025540	I don't know the specific details, so it's kind of hard to explain it,
8025540	8029540	but Blast Corps has a mechanic that there are multiple vehicles in the level,
8029540	8033540	so you can get out of a vehicle, get into another one, that kind of thing.
8033540	8035540	It's a puzzle element, so on and so forth.
8035540	8043540	There was a bug where if you just held down the leave button, the disembark button,
8043540	8047540	that it would overwhelm the game's engine or something like that,
8047540	8052540	and it would just destroy the building in front of you after about five seconds or something like that
8052540	8056540	after just holding down the button.
8056540	8063540	I've never legitimately beaten that game until Rare Replay,
8063540	8067540	until I actually streamed the vast majority of it over this week when I saw it,
8067540	8071540	and I was jumping up and down and flipping out because there are certain levels in that game
8071540	8074540	that are fucking difficult, and I was so happy to have cleared it.
8074540	8083540	But I assume just because of the speed of the N64, the frame rate issues that are suffered,
8083540	8090540	how many calculations happen in the game even when nothing is being drawn?
8090540	8092540	I need to find a better way to explain this.
8092540	8098540	Do you remember the old DDR glitch that let people access the hidden challenge charts
8098540	8106540	for Last Message, Blue Impulse, Love Shine, and the fourth one I can't remember?
8106540	8108540	Yeah, so long ago, yeah, yeah.
8108540	8113540	The trick where you would go, you would rig the popular courses and switch between,
8113540	8116540	I think it was Naoki standard and popular one.
8116540	8121540	It's a similar kind of thing, and if you listen to any speedruns,
8121540	8125540	if you watch speedrun streams or listen to speedrunners talk about the details,
8125540	8131540	I can only assume that it has something to do with the rendering power of the N64
8131540	8137540	and the slowdown that happens when there's this input calculation physics massacre
8137540	8142540	compared to the Xbox One that can emulate it more reliably,
8142540	8146540	that building destruction spam trick doesn't work anymore.
8146540	8153540	So in my classic fashion, I get to this one towards the last level of the game.
8153540	8158540	I get through a very obnoxiously long, like 15, 20-minute level.
8158540	8164540	I get to the very end of it, and I didn't actually know how to beat the level legitimately,
8164540	8169540	so I just fell back on my old spam the exit button trick,
8169540	8172540	and I do that for like 30 seconds and nothing happens.
8172540	8176540	So I'm sitting here. This is streamed. It should be in my past broadcast
8176540	8178540	if anybody wants to look it up on Twitch.
8178540	8184540	I'm just standing there with this unable to leave the vehicle sound playing repeatedly
8184540	8188540	over and over and over and over, and so I finally have to give up
8188540	8193540	and replay the level a couple times to figure out how to actually do it legitimately.
8194540	8199540	The long story short of this game is that Blast Corps is amazing,
8199540	8206540	and I'm working through the rest of Rare Replay because I have played very, very few of those games,
8206540	8212540	but Blast Corps is a game I have been dying to own, like I said, since 97 or 98,
8212540	8216540	whenever it originally came out, and now I do, and it's more faithful.
8216540	8222540	It's forced me to actually be able to play the game legitimately, and it is so much fun.
8222540	8226540	Thank God. I've already decimated the game, but I had such a fun time doing it.
8226540	8231540	That's so interesting that they fixed the bug like that, because that makes me think like,
8231540	8237540	what if they were to release, let's say, Blaster Master, which, God, I'd love to see that come back,
8237540	8243540	but then they fixed the bug where pausing will no longer kill the bosses in an instant, right?
8243540	8247540	Remember that trick where you would pause the boss and the grenade would just fire over and over again?
8247540	8250540	You could kill the boss super easy that way? What if they got rid of that?
8250540	8254540	We would all be screwed, because that game was hard to begin with.
8254540	8258540	So, I mean, this is funny, because when you're talking about this bug in Blast Corps,
8258540	8262540	that's the scene that's running through my mind, is like, what if they took out the pause glitch?
8262540	8267540	Because there are certain glitches in old games. We've been talking a little bit about old games and glitches.
8267540	8276540	There are certain ones that we all did as kids. Not really a glitch, but very few people can get through Contra
8276540	8281540	without some up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA, start. Same thing with Gradius, right?
8281540	8282540	Absolutely.
8282540	8285540	Anyway, it's just funny. Like, what if they got rid of that? We'd be hosed.
8285540	8291540	And I don't think they explicitly fixed it. I think it's just a quirk of emulation
8291540	8295540	and just what the difference in hardware and software rendering is.
8295540	8301540	And the comment especially about the frame rate issues, Blast Corps was a pretty intensive game,
8301540	8309540	because it was all about a vehicle running into buildings, sometimes like pushing TNT into it, what have you.
8309540	8315540	But it was all about physics and collisions in an N64 game and explosions and everything else.
8315540	8319540	So there was a lot of calculation and madness and that kind of stuff going on.
8319540	8328540	And if I vaguely recall slowdowns playing it on the N64 back in the day, I would not be at all surprised.
8328540	8332540	I would just be willing to wager that I definitely came across them.
8332540	8340540	But it played stunningly on the Xbox One. It was such a grand and smooth and clean experience.
8340540	8346540	And I really just got to enjoy the game all over again in my hands-on my time from start to finish.
8346540	8351540	It is so weird seeing these old-ass games really cleaned up for HDTV and high refresh rate
8351540	8356540	and the HDMI cables and things that just weren't a factor in the 80s and 90s.
8357540	8363540	And I'm pretty curious. Banjo-Kazooie is on my shortlist as well. I played a fair amount of that as well.
8363540	8369540	And I'm kind of curious. I don't think I'm any bit motion sick. I don't get any kind of motion sickness.
8369540	8375540	But I'm pretty curious to see the difference in camera interactivity like you were talking about as well.
8375540	8379540	Yeah, neither do I. And that game was like setting something off.
8379540	8382540	So anyway, Jason, I gotta let you go so we can fit in some more calls.
8382540	8383540	But thank you so much for the call.
8383540	8384540	Of course.
8384540	8385540	Great to hear about. Take care, my friend.
8385540	8386540	You too.
8386540	8392540	There it is. Orange Lounge Radio. Jason, the voice of the show. If you listen to the intro carefully, you hear Jason.
8392540	8398540	If you check in to the show, you know, those of you who listen to the podcast feed, you hear that little do-do-do-do-do-do.
8398540	8402540	If you want to check in, use this passphrase at vognetwork.com. Jason does that as well.
8402540	8406540	And you should check in. Get your VoG network points. Participate with the show already.
8406540	8409540	All right. It is lighting up on the phone lines. I gotta get to another call.
8409540	8411540	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
8411540	8413540	Hey, what's up, everyone? It's Ranma.
8413540	8415540	Hey, Ranma. Good to hear from you, buddy. How you doing?
8415540	8416540	Good to hear from all of y'all.
8416540	8417540	What's that?
8417540	8419540	It's good to hear from all of y'all.
8419540	8423540	Yeah. I mean, we missed you. You weren't here for the early show last week, right? Because we were in a winter time.
8423540	8428540	No. I was doing a Love Live school idol project photo shoot when I got back.
8428540	8434540	I'm listening and I'm making comments in the chat. I'm like, wait a minute. This was pre-recorded already.
8434540	8438540	I know. And you know what? I forgot to run chat last week during the show.
8438540	8444540	I should ask Darktitsou here, somebody that was probably here, to send me a chat log, see if there's any really good comments during last week's show.
8444540	8446540	I usually try to run it. I forgot last week.
8446540	8448540	I can hook you up with that.
8448540	8451540	Yes. Nice. Appreciate it. So, what's in your mind tonight?
8451540	8456540	Well, I wanted to call in and talk briefly about International Sailor Moon Day, if I can.
8456540	8461540	I was gonna ask you about it anyway at the end of the call, so why not? Yeah, let's talk about it. What's going on on the stream Saturday?
8461540	8471540	Well, let me give you a brief, a quick history. We started this about, I'd say, two years ago about the announcing of Sailor Moon Crystal.
8471540	8480540	And we have a large Sailor Moon cosplay, non-cosplay fan group here in New York City, so we decided to do something to celebrate that.
8480540	8487540	It was originally held by another group, which had the event, and then they were not able to do it last year.
8487540	8494540	So, Sailor Moon Meetup decided to go ahead and do this, and we did this at a local studio, and we were streaming it online.
8494540	8506540	Pretty much, we were talking to people such as Ms. Dream, who does fan scanlations of the manga and translations of the various Sara Miu musicals online.
8506540	8519540	And there is a local group, I forget their name, they're based out of the area, they do Sailor Moon slash K-pop style videos and dance routines.
8519540	8526540	Fun. Yeah. So, this year we decided, you know, let's do it again and do things slightly different.
8526540	8537540	So, part of this is that we're celebrating, like, the resurgence of Sailor Moon, as well as, if you notice, there are other classic animes that are making a big comeback in recent years.
8537540	8547540	That is very true. Well, now, and I noticed when I was looking this up on Facebook, trying to get some more information on it, I noticed that there is, like, international Sailor Moon stuff all over.
8547540	8552540	Like, they're doing something in San Francisco. This is not a New York-centric thing. It's everywhere.
8552540	8559540	It started out in a New York event, and then there were other people that said they wanted to hold their own event.
8559540	8567540	So, we have people across the country, around the world, that are having their own versions of International Sailor Moon Day.
8567540	8573540	Some of them are doing, like, a Skype get-together. Some of them are actually having events in their local cities.
8573540	8575540	That's fun. Are you going to dress up?
8575540	8581540	I am staffed, so most likely that's not going to happen, but I will most likely be wearing my Artemis hat.
8581540	8587540	That's awesome. You know, I know we're not the anime show on the network. You guys are. We're the video game show.
8587540	8593540	But, you know, fandom, those lines blur a lot, and there's a lot of people who are into games who are into these other things.
8593540	8596540	And certainly, I have a lot of Twitter followers who love their Sailor Moon.
8596540	8603540	I can't profess personally to following it very closely, but I have seen some of the old 90s anime, and it is awesome.
8603540	8605540	I'm a big fan of Tuxedo Mask, so...
8605540	8609540	Who does the least amount of work out of all of them at all together?
8609540	8612540	I know, I know. But, you know, can't help it.
8612540	8614540	He one-time cosplayed Santa Claus.
8617540	8623540	So, you're streaming from one of the live events with all these routines and things and tribute performances.
8623540	8631540	This year, what we're doing is we're going to have different guests who have been part of the Sailor Moon community from, like,
8631540	8635540	scanlations, cosplay, performances. We're going to have that.
8635540	8638540	We're also going to do a Sailor Moon-themed match game.
8638540	8640540	Oh, my favorite!
8640540	8649540	Yep, karaoke contests. We're going to have the Jubon Fashion Show, which is pretty much everybody in cosplay gets up on the stage and strut their stuff.
8649540	8653540	And we're going to have a special guest.
8653540	8656540	Oh, are you going to tell us who it is? We've got to wait.
8656540	8662540	Absolutely. You might not know the name, but you'll know the commercials that she has done.
8662540	8668540	She's sang various songs for the English version of Sailor Moon. Her name is Jennifer Sehe.
8668540	8675540	Now, the name may not sound familiar, but do you remember Hot Pockets commercials?
8675540	8678540	She sings the Hot Pockets song?
8678540	8681540	She does the Hot Pockets? That's her.
8682540	8694540	With all due respect, Rama, you know I'm a fan of things that you're a fan of. With all due respect, that's a way bigger deal than Sailor Moon.
8694540	8700540	You want to know something? A bunch of people are like, wait a minute, that's her? That's her?
8700540	8704540	What are you going to eat? Hot Pockets. Oh, my God, it's the Hot Pockets lady.
8705540	8710540	Why don't I just change the banner on the site to a giant Hot Pocket?
8710540	8716540	See, if you're going to do that, it's got to show Usagi eating a Hot Pocket because that's the only way it would work.
8716540	8722540	Get me the picture and I'll make it happen. The whole chat is lighting up. Hot Pockets!
8725540	8731540	No, we do need a new intro for the show. That would be an amazing...
8732540	8740540	SSJ100 Man Chat says, come for the Sailor Moon, but stay for the Hot Pockets jingle. That is amazing.
8740540	8744540	So she's going to be on your stream. We're going to have the Hot Pockets lady on VoG?
8744540	8749540	Yes, she will be coming via Skype online and you'll be seeing her as part of the livestream.
8749540	8754540	Oh, my God, we're going to have the Hot Pockets lady on VoG. We are huge, you guys. So excited.
8754540	8755540	We made it.
8755540	8762540	All laughing and silliness aside because I think this is amazing, but that's so awesome, the Sailor Moon fandom and everything you guys are doing.
8762540	8766540	So glad we could be a part of it. Just a quick programming note because I know some people may be curious
8766540	8770540	because you guys are going to be on at the same time the Critical Myth marathon is usually on.
8770540	8776540	Critical Myth actually ends up coincidentally having the week off, so there's no new shows to air on Saturday anyway.
8776540	8782540	We will still rerun their reruns. We're going to do reruns of the reruns on Sunday instead at 9 a.m.
8782540	8787540	So if you usually listen to the Critical Myth marathon, we're going to see this once in a year Sailor Moon event happening
8787540	8791540	and then Critical Myth will be on Sunday, which, by the way, speaking of those boys over at Critical Myth,
8791540	8794540	I mean, they're taking a lot of weeks off right now because it's summer programming anyway.
8794540	8800540	There's not as much to talk about during the summer, but they are hitting episode 600.
8800540	8805540	Now, granted, they do three shows a week, so it's a little different. It didn't take them as long to get there as it did us,
8805540	8810540	but it's still a huge accomplishment. So they're going to hit episode 600 on the Monday when they return.
8810540	8811540	So there you go.
8811540	8812540	Amazing.
8812540	8819540	Amazing. So International Sailor Moon Day this Saturday, 12 to 5 Eastern. Check it out.
8819540	8823540	Transform into a giant Hot Pocket with us here at VOG.
8823540	8826540	Form of Hot Pocket.
8826540	8830540	All right. Rama, thanks so much for the call, and good luck on Saturday.
8830540	8833540	Hey, no problem. All right. Before I go, Rama, I just want to say one thing.
8833540	8837540	I meant to say it before. You talked about doing cosplay at Dragon Con. I just want to say...
8837540	8838540	Oh, it's happening.
8838540	8847540	It's awesome. And to answer your questions before, as long as you give credit to whoever you got it commissioned from or whatever, nobody's going to care.
8847540	8852540	All right. Awesome. Yeah. I gave her a shout on Twitter. My good friend Victoria, she goes by VicKnives on Twitter.
8852540	8859540	She's putting it all together. We did the shopping. We shopped for the material this week, and I've seen her sketches and everything,
8859540	8862540	and we did the fitting. Well, I'm sorry. We did the measurements, and then the fitting comes out.
8862540	8864540	So what is it? What's your costume?
8864540	8866540	Well, I was going to keep it a secret.
8866540	8867540	All right. That's fine. No, that's cool.
8867540	8872540	No, it's the worst kept secret ever. I put the sketches on Twitter. I'm going to do Joker from Mass Effect 3.
8872540	8874540	I helped.
8874540	8880540	Yes, you did, because Dark Sakura actually started the whole thing. She gave me a hat, a gamer X.
8880540	8883540	She gave me her old SR2 hat, which is the perfect...
8883540	8885540	My unworn SR2 hat.
8885540	8891540	But it's the perfect Joker from Mass Effect 3, so we went out and bought the stuff it's going to take to make the top and everything.
8891540	8892540	I'm really excited about it.
8892540	8895540	I need to talk to you about what your friend's charging you.
8895540	8900540	Yeah, we'll talk about that. So, yeah, she's great. So, yes, full credit. I would not try to take credit for the costume myself.
8900540	8903540	I've decided I want to do a Grey Warden mage for gamer X.
8903540	8908540	Oh, and I will. Yeah, and that's the great thing is that I can reuse this costume.
8908540	8912540	I will definitely use it at gamer X as well for those of you that are going to be there in December.
8912540	8919540	And trying to firm up the plans for MAGFest. Tickets and hotel aren't available for MAGFest yet, because it's still like six months out.
8919540	8926540	Still waiting. Normally by now, with both conventions, hotel information is already up, so I'm just like waiting, you know?
8926540	8930540	Yeah, I think a lot of people are, but I will say that is definitely in my plan.
8930540	8934540	And I can't imagine people don't do cosplay at MAGFest, so assuming I can get away with...
8934540	8935540	Oh, trust me.
8935540	8937540	Yeah, I'll do cosplay there too.
8937540	8946540	Well, I think I told Jamie this, but me and a friend, GBT for cosplay, we are putting together a rival school's cosplay group for MAGFest.
8946540	8948540	Oh my god. That's going to be awesome.
8948540	8950540	You didn't mention this to me, but that's cool.
8950540	8952540	Wait, you're going to be at MAGFest too?
8952540	8962540	Yeah, I'm shooting, even though Catsicon's the weekend before, I'm trying to do both, because two of my favorite cosplay friends are coming from the Midwest for Catsicon.
8962540	8968540	And your very favorite sassy gay friend is coming out from the West Coast for it, so I think that's a good reason.
8969540	8975540	Well, yeah, I'm trying to do both. If they don't come from Katsu, I'm skipping Katsu, you'll see me at MAGFest.
8975540	8980540	You'll probably see me passed out, drunk as Luigi, in front of the Ninja Turtle machine with a 40 in my hand.
8980540	8985540	Alright, sounds good. Just look for the drunken joker that's clinging to a Burger Time machine.
8985540	8987540	You got it, dude.
8987540	8989540	Alright, take care of my friend. We've got to let you go to get more calls.
8989540	8990540	Awesome. No problem. Okay.
8990540	8991540	Bye.
8991540	8995540	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8995540	9001540	Quickly, I want to make sure Loki has a minute to get in some last minute stories here while I wait on another call to come in.
9001540	9003540	I don't know if you have anything to share with us, Loki.
9003540	9005540	No, sadly I don't, and I've been looking.
9005540	9006540	What?
9006540	9008540	I've been looking, there's just nothing.
9008540	9010540	I guess we had such a busy show in other parts.
9010540	9014540	Killer7's celebrating 10 years, like two months ago, so there's that.
9014540	9018540	There's that. Oh my god, there's like 17 million calls coming in right now.
9018540	9020540	Did you know that this is the 35th anniversary of Xanadu?
9020540	9021540	Nope.
9021540	9022540	I did not.
9022540	9024540	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9024540	9026540	Ah, you're breaking up. Oh no.
9026540	9028540	My internet connection bad?
9028540	9030540	No, we can hear you just fine if you can hear us. Who's this?
9030540	9032540	This is Andy.
9032540	9033540	Andy, what's up?
9033540	9035540	He's on the chat, or AndyR on Twitter, or on Facebook.
9035540	9039540	I don't, I hear your name a lot, obviously, on Facebook and so forth.
9039540	9042540	I don't think I've ever heard you on the show. Is this your first call?
9042540	9044540	Yeah, I usually listen to the podcast, so.
9044540	9046540	Well, welcome.
9046540	9049540	And I see you brought your bird friend, he's on video, so I can actually see him and we're looking at his studio.
9049540	9051540	Aww, pretty birdie.
9051540	9053540	Little birdie Fran. What's birdie's name?
9053540	9055540	Yeah, she's been listening to the show with me.
9055540	9057540	Well, I hope she doesn't start repeating what Loki says.
9057540	9059540	So, what's on your mind, buddy?
9059540	9064540	Just calling to say hi and thank you for the podcast all the time, and yeah.
9064540	9067540	Thank you for listening all the time. We appreciate it. What kind of games do you play?
9067540	9069540	I work week, so.
9069540	9071540	Do you listen to us on your commute usually, or at work?
9071540	9073540	At work, at my desk.
9073540	9076540	Gotcha. Awesome. What kind of games are you playing right now?
9077540	9079540	A whole lot of Vita, actually.
9079540	9086540	Really? It's nice to hear some Vita love out there, because it sure seems like everybody in the U.S. forgot about the Vita.
9086540	9088540	So, what are you playing on Vita?
9088540	9092540	Well, I guess they're all Japanese games, so maybe the U.S. did forget about it.
9092540	9096540	But I imported three rhythm games for it recently and I've been playing those.
9096540	9100540	Let me guess. Tycoon no Tatujin's got to be one, because that just came out.
9100540	9101540	Yep.
9101540	9105540	Let me think. Probably one of the Hatsune Miku knockoffs.
9105540	9108540	Yes, I.A.V.T. Colorful. It's another one of the Vocaloid games.
9108540	9112540	Yes, we had a story on that a couple weeks ago, I remember. So, yeah. And then what else?
9112540	9113540	Persona.
9113540	9117540	Oh, Persona Dancing All Night. Of course. Of course. How are you enjoying?
9117540	9123540	Which, if you had to rank the three, Sophie's Choice, if you had to rank the three, which one's your favorite?
9123540	9129540	I only just got Colorful, like, two days ago, but that might be that one.
9129540	9134540	Really? Okay. Interesting. Usually, a lot of fans of Persona that I know are, like, rabid foaming at the mouth.
9134540	9137540	But maybe that's just hanging out with Shane too much, because he's kind of like that.
9137540	9142540	I absolutely love Persona Dancing. My biggest issue is it's only got 27 songs.
9142540	9146540	And, like, seven of them are remixes of songs that are already in the game.
9146540	9150540	So, I kind of plat in the game in, like, ten hours.
9150540	9154540	Okay. All right. Well, that makes sense. I can see where that string is.
9154540	9158540	It's a good game, though. And if I could get the DLC on my Vita, then that would probably make it better.
9158540	9162540	Awesome. Well, that's cool. I'm glad to see the Vita getting a little love.
9162540	9168540	And this is why systems should be region-free. So, I love that. I love that.
9168540	9170540	Well, Andy, thanks so much for listening to the show. Really appreciate it.
9170540	9174540	And glad you could get in and say hello and introduce us to your bird.
9174540	9175540	Yep.
9175540	9178540	All right. Well, take care, my friend. I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.
9178540	9179540	All right. Sounds good.
9179540	9180540	All right. Take care.
9180540	9181540	Bye.
9181540	9182540	Bye.
9182540	9186540	I should have also mentioned that Andy R. was wearing a Giants shirt. So, clearly a fan of the correct team.
9186540	9188540	I want a bird, but Midna won't let me.
9188540	9194540	All right. 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
9194540	9200540	AkumaJP in chat saying, every time I hear Hot Pockets, my brain goes non-compute.
9200540	9205540	Okay. The phones are lighting up. Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?
9205540	9210540	I must be one crazy motherfucker because it's nearly 5 a.m. for me.
9210540	9212540	Oh, my God. This is Obi Wan Jabroni.
9212540	9217540	Obi Wan Jabroni. And I was going to say, where you're at, you're like, oh, my God.
9217540	9218540	5 a.m.
9218540	9220540	I love your icon.
9220540	9223540	I'll be saying daylight soon, actually.
9223540	9225540	Wow. You are dedicated.
9225540	9227540	You guys can hear me okay, right?
9227540	9228540	Oh, yeah. You sound great.
9228540	9233540	We're checking out your Skype icon where you have the little PlayStation, keep calm and defeat Psycho Mantis.
9233540	9234540	Love it.
9234540	9240540	Yeah, Dark Sakura mentioned that last time, but yeah, I'm calling you from bed. Holy shit.
9240540	9243540	Wait a minute. Are we all in bed with you right now?
9243540	9244540	Yes.
9244540	9246540	I'm not in a bed, but I am reclining.
9246540	9249540	But we're in bed with Obi Wan Jabroni.
9249540	9252540	I'm lounging.
9252540	9256540	Lounging in bed, all three of you, all four of us in bed.
9256540	9258540	Is there a soft duvet?
9258540	9264540	There is. There is a memory foam mattress, pillows, and a duvet.
9264540	9267540	Squish.
9267540	9271540	I only want listeners to call us from bed.
9271540	9273540	You know, we can do some.
9274540	9279540	SSG 100 Man Chat says someone's got top bunk.
9279540	9281540	Oh, you crazy kids.
9281540	9283540	All right. Well, what did you, what, you stayed?
9283540	9286540	Well, first off, we did the early show last week.
9286540	9288540	I know. I'm making up for this.
9288540	9289540	All right.
9289540	9291540	I've been, I've been drinking. That's why.
9291540	9292540	Oh, great.
9292540	9293540	That's why I'm up.
9293540	9296540	Great. He's calling us in bed and drunk.
9296540	9298540	So, what's the beverage of the evening?
9298540	9300540	Budweiser.
9300540	9302540	Budweiser.
9302540	9304540	All right.
9304540	9305540	I'm sorry.
9305540	9306540	Well, I'm sorry to hear.
9306540	9308540	It's from a bottle though.
9308540	9310540	All right. Well, it's a little better.
9310540	9312540	All right. What's on your mind tonight, my friend?
9312540	9314540	What did you stay up late for?
9314540	9316540	I always stay up late to listen to this show.
9316540	9318540	I'm crazy.
9318540	9324540	Listen, if I, if I fall asleep during the show, which happens probably about 80% of the time,
9324540	9326540	I'll listen back to the podcast.
9326540	9327540	I'm dedicated to this.
9327540	9331540	I appreciate that. I mean, you, you listeners that are so dedicated to this show are so-
9331540	9333540	And I'm always in the comments.
9333540	9337540	You always see, you always see me post some sarcastic shit in the comments.
9337540	9338540	So-
9338540	9342540	I read all the comments. I don't always reply, but I always read them because there's not a lot of them.
9342540	9343540	So, it's enough to be-
9343540	9344540	That's cool.
9344540	9348540	Act Deft in chat, drunk at 5 a.m. on a Monday.
9348540	9349540	Awesome.
9349540	9354540	And Embryon in chat saying, oh my God, the total rejection of Budweiser.
9354540	9355540	Anyway.
9355540	9357540	So, what's up? What's on your mind tonight?
9357540	9365540	Well, I wanted to call in and extend the F for you to Capcom because I didn't get into the Street Fighter V beta,
9365540	9367540	or beta, wherever you live.
9367540	9373540	The funny thing about that whole thing with us in Europe was we had to fill out a form.
9373540	9376540	So, we didn't actually have to pre-order the game.
9376540	9378540	So, we had to fill out some form.
9378540	9382540	And there was a question on it and it said, how many BPD are Battle Points?
9382540	9388540	And because I play on Xbox mostly, I have zero on PlayStation.
9388540	9389540	Oh.
9389540	9393540	So, maybe- I don't know. Maybe that's because I didn't get in.
9393540	9395540	No idea.
9395540	9396540	I would still think-
9396540	9398540	Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
9398540	9401540	To accurately test a game, you need people at all levels.
9401540	9404540	So, you do need some people with zero Battle Points.
9404540	9406540	You need some people who don't know what the F they're doing.
9406540	9411540	So, I would actually think that shouldn't solely disqualify you, but that's my thought.
9411540	9412540	Yeah.
9412540	9419540	Second thing was, just a PSA on this whole Xbox One thing, the PVR feature.
9419540	9425540	There's a couple of small points they haven't mentioned.
9425540	9429540	If you have a hard drive connected because you ran out of storage,
9429540	9435540	you need to attach a second hard drive because all that stuff lives separately.
9435540	9439540	It can't live on the hard drive that you plugged in the first one.
9439540	9440540	You know what I mean?
9440540	9441540	Interesting, yeah.
9441540	9442540	Yeah.
9442540	9444540	I wonder if they're different formats. They're probably formatted differently.
9444540	9449540	Yeah, because, I mean, Devia hard drives are standard, but I don't know.
9449540	9451540	They use a different system.
9451540	9458540	So, you'd have to purchase a separate hard drive as well as the tuner, I guess.
9458540	9460540	No, that's good to know. I had no idea.
9460540	9461540	Yeah.
9461540	9463540	I wonder if you- this is just a crazy thought.
9463540	9467540	Could you take one hard drive and do two partitions?
9468540	9469540	I-
9469540	9471540	I don't know. Just throwing it out there, maybe.
9471540	9473540	The tech master might be able to- I don't know.
9473540	9474540	I don't know.
9474540	9475540	If the tech master could answer that one.
9475540	9477540	But, no, I have no idea on that one.
9477540	9484540	But, yeah, you have to purchase two hard drives if one's full and if you've extended it.
9484540	9491540	It's unfortunate because PlayStation has given us accessible hard drives and Xbox hasn't.
9491540	9492540	You know?
9492540	9493540	Right.
9493540	9494540	And it sucks. It really does.
9494540	9498540	I wish you could access it and just, you know, put your own hard drive in.
9498540	9500540	And the Xbox drive fills up fast.
9500540	9501540	It does.
9501540	9503540	I think the game installs are just so much bigger.
9503540	9510540	And I have the terabyte system and it's- I've owned the terabyte system for like a month and it's already up to like 22% full.
9510540	9511540	Really?
9511540	9515540	I have my 500 gigabyte PlayStation 4 and I was actually looking at the storage of it.
9515540	9518540	I still have room and I've been buying everything digitally.
9518540	9520540	I've filled up the PlayStation 4.
9520540	9521540	I have finally filled that up.
9521540	9527540	I think with all of the PlayStation Plus games I've had to go through and actually finally delete some of the PlayStation Plus things that I'm just not playing.
9527540	9529540	Because I know that at least it's in my library.
9529540	9530540	I can grab it later.
9530540	9531540	Yeah.
9531540	9533540	I mean I use my Xbox one more.
9533540	9535540	I do have a PS4 as well.
9535540	9538540	But, you know, I'm not favoring any of the system.
9538540	9542540	That's my go-to system, the Xbox.
9542540	9544540	Mine was full and I had to go through-
9544540	9550540	Because I was downloading the gold games, you know, for every month.
9550540	9551540	Right.
9551540	9552540	And those can be huge.
9552540	9555540	I mean, especially when you get one and then it has to update.
9555540	9559540	So, you know, there's always that.
9559540	9561540	So I had to go through it the other day and kind of delete stuff.
9561540	9566540	And it's kind of- I still think that interface is pretty cumbersome, you know?
9566540	9567540	Yeah.
9567540	9570540	I am really looking forward to the redo of the interface.
9570540	9572540	Especially because I don't have Kinect.
9572540	9573540	Do you have Kinect?
9573540	9574540	Because I don't.
9574540	9575540	And so it's-
9575540	9576540	Yes.
9576540	9577540	I got the day one edition.
9577540	9578540	Oh wow.
9578540	9579540	I was a sucker.
9579540	9581540	No, a lot of people were really into it.
9581540	9586540	And I got FIFA 10, which I'm not a FIFA player.
9586540	9588540	Which is probably shocking to you guys.
9588540	9591540	I'm more of a PES person.
9591540	9593540	So yeah, I got FIFA whatever it was.
9593540	9596540	FIFA 13, I believe, I think.
9596540	9601540	So I went through it and I deleted that because I'm not going to play it.
9601540	9605540	But yeah, the menu system on that is terrible.
9605540	9608540	I mean, I've unplugged my Kinect, actually, speaking of Kinect.
9608540	9609540	Wow.
9609540	9613540	The only feature I used was Xbox User Code.
9613540	9616540	And I'm sorry if anyone's Xboxes went off there.
9616540	9619540	But yeah, that's all I used it for.
9619540	9624540	Yeah, I think I would use it for live streaming and then maybe playing Dance Central a few times.
9624540	9625540	And that's probably it.
9625540	9626540	Oh, and the Fantasia game.
9626540	9627540	I want to check that out too.
9627540	9628540	That's probably it.
9628540	9633540	But I've got Rare Replay coming as well.
9633540	9634540	I'm looking forward to it.
9634540	9638540	Not looking forward to this whole drama of the installs, though.
9638540	9640540	That's going to be a nightmare.
9640540	9641540	You get over it.
9641540	9642540	It's going to clutter.
9642540	9646540	See, the thing is, I think a big problem about it is the interface as well.
9646540	9652540	And so when you take the clunky interface and then you're just suddenly going to blow up your library with ten more games, it's a little bit irritating.
9652540	9653540	That's the only thing.
9653540	9657540	That's more going through your shit and deleting crap, isn't it, after you're finished with it.
9657540	9659540	So a couple more quick things.
9659540	9662540	Yeah, very quickly because then I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls.
9662540	9663540	Yeah, sorry, sorry.
9663540	9664540	That's okay.
9664540	9665540	I've dragged on.
9665540	9666540	When's Dan coming back?
9666540	9670540	I want to talk to Dan about Sega because I know he's a big Sega guy.
9670540	9671540	When's Dan coming back?
9671540	9672540	I don't know.
9672540	9678540	Tell him the fans, fans from their beds, drunken fans in their beds are demanding he return to the show.
9678540	9682540	Dan says that he likes to come by when no one expects it.
9682540	9685540	Something like the Spanish Inquisition.
9685540	9686540	Alright, well there it is.
9686540	9687540	No one expects it.
9687540	9688540	There it is.
9688540	9690540	Dan will be back when you least expect it.
9690540	9692540	I will keep listening.
9692540	9694540	Doctor Who, how is the Apple Watch?
9694540	9695540	I love it.
9695540	9698540	It reminds me to get off my butt.
9698540	9706540	I'm waiting for Gen 2 because the one I wanted was like a grand.
9706540	9707540	I'm not even joking.
9707540	9714540	You know the space black one and it was black and stainless steel.
9714540	9717540	That's the one I wanted but it was way too expensive.
9717540	9722540	I got the space grey aluminum with the black sports band because I have certain problems with steel.
9722540	9725540	You got the sport one.
9725540	9726540	I did.
9726540	9727540	It's been just fine.
9727540	9730540	It hasn't felt like that weird sweaty band feeling.
9730540	9736540	The thing I really like best is that I have a bad habit of getting way too wrapped up in what I'm doing.
9736540	9742540	So I get that little tap on the wrist when it's time to stand up even though I will fuss at my watch and tell it not to tell me what to do.
9742540	9746540	I like that it tracks my activity.
9746540	9747540	I can get texts.
9747540	9749540	I do directions on it when I'm driving.
9749540	9756540	In fact, this morning that was funny, I was texting my mom but I used my voice to text with my watch.
9756540	9758540	Dan's like, what?
9758540	9760540	I'm like, I'm talking to my mom.
9760540	9763540	It's the whole Dick Tracy thing.
9763540	9764540	He just sounded so confused.
9764540	9766540	I've made calls to him from Target.
9766540	9773540	I am also very curious to see what they do to kind of push it further because Apple does kind of do that a lot with their products.
9773540	9776540	Where the first one is, okay, it's the first one and here's the new idea.
9776540	9779540	But then the second one is always, here's how we're going to take it a step further.
9779540	9784540	Read up about the beta for watchOS 2.0.
9784540	9786540	It's in beta right now and there's reviews out around it.
9786540	9790540	You're supposed to have a bunch more local apps.
9790540	9800540	The reason I'm waiting for Gen 2 is that I'm still on this fence because I got burnt with the iPad 1.
9801540	9803540	And I still have the iPad 1.
9803540	9806540	I'm looking at it right now.
9806540	9812540	That's why I'm kind of like just on that fence, on that Apple fence.
9812540	9815540	I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Apple.
9815540	9818540	We should start an Apple show, by the way.
9818540	9820540	Well, here's the thing.
9820540	9824540	Well, first off, I'd love to get more nerdy shows.
9824540	9825540	No.
9825540	9829540	I'm scared of chat rooms because someone's going to ask me ASL and I'm such a sad person.
9829540	9831540	No, not in the vog chat room. Not in the vog chat room.
9831540	9833540	ASL.
9833540	9836540	I'm such a sarcastic cunt and I'm sorry to say that word.
9836540	9841540	But I'm going to reply after sex leave because that's the kind of asshole I am.
9841540	9848540	Send me an email to participate at orangeandradio.com
9848540	9852540	and I will send you my actual email and we will have a talk.
9852540	9854540	All right.
9854540	9857540	They're going to talk while Obi-Wan and Jabroni is done.
9857540	9859540	We're going to have a pillow talk.
9859540	9861540	About watches.
9861540	9866540	We should get me, you, and the smooth-talking Jason.
9866540	9868540	There you go.
9868540	9870540	He's got a dream line up in his head.
9870540	9872540	All right, Obi-Wan, Jabroni, I've got to let you go, but have a good night.
9872540	9874540	Thank you so much for calling and staying up late. I appreciate it.
9874540	9876540	Hey, no problem. Take care.
9876540	9878540	I'll start my Nintendo podcast.
9878540	9880540	I can't wait for that.
9880540	9882540	You know what? I know it's 9 o'clock, but dang it.
9882540	9884540	Let's try to squeeze in one more call.
9884540	9887540	1-877-GAMO-L-R, our username on Skype, orange loungerio.
9887540	9891540	Just because it's been lighting up tonight and there it goes again.
9891540	9896540	You guys, some weeks we get no calls and then some weeks it just floods.
9896540	9898540	So I'm loving it.
9898540	9900540	Thank you guys for blowing up our phones tonight.
9900540	9902540	We've got another call on the line, though. Let's get to it.
9902540	9904540	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9904540	9906540	Hey, Rob. It's Embryon.
9906540	9908540	Hey, Embryon. How you doing?
9908540	9910540	I am super great.
9910540	9912540	This is your first time calling into the show, isn't it?
9912540	9913540	It is.
9913540	9916540	All of a sudden we have all these longtime listeners, first time caller.
9916540	9918540	Well, how you doing?
9918540	9920540	I'm super well.
9920540	9925540	I'm enjoying some wine and I'm playing Mother 3 for the second time,
9925540	9929540	but I've never actually beaten it before, so it's all kind of fresh still for me.
9929540	9932540	So I'm enjoying that and listening to the show.
9932540	9935540	And I couldn't very well let Obi-Wan be the only person to call in who had been drinking.
9935540	9939540	I was going to say, what is the theme tonight with people there drinking and listening to OLR?
9939540	9941540	Are you in bed?
9941540	9943540	Maybe.
9943540	9947540	I would do this show drunk every day if I could.
9947540	9950540	I mean, let's see. I think my mic reached it far enough.
9950540	9952540	I mean, can you still hear me from bed?
9952540	9954540	Yes, we can. There it is.
9954540	9957540	It's official. There is a second phone call from bed. I love it.
9957540	9959540	Very temporarily from bed.
9959540	9963540	Mother 3. Why Mother 3 of all the games to attack?
9963540	9965540	Because it's fantastic.
9965540	9969540	I live in Tucson, Arizona, and recently we had Camp Fangamer,
9969540	9971540	which was a little Earthbound convention.
9971540	9973540	I remember talking about that on the show, and I went,
9973540	9977540	how adorable is that? Because it's Tucson.
9977540	9979540	Yeah, I know, right?
9979540	9981540	That is so cute.
9981540	9983540	So I went to that a few weeks ago when it happened, and it was super cool.
9983540	9985540	And I've always been an Earthbound fan.
9985540	9987540	I have a Starman tattoo on my chest.
9987540	9991540	And so it kind of reinvigorated my excitement for the series.
9991540	9993540	And since I had never beaten Mother 3, I figured,
9993540	9997540	now is the time right before the college semester starts.
9997540	10000540	I'm going to my last semester, so I'm going to be super swamped,
10000540	10003540	and I wanted to actually just get into it and dig deep.
10003540	10007540	So there I am right now, and yeah, it's been great so far.
10007540	10010540	Wow, Andy in chat saying, apparently Arizona is a theme too.
10010540	10012540	I called from Phoenix.
10012540	10013540	Oh, okay.
10013540	10014540	I had no idea.
10014540	10016540	Hello. Sorry you live in Phoenix. It's terrible.
10016540	10020540	I've been to Phoenix. It's a hot ass mess.
10020540	10022540	I can say that. It's a hot ass mess.
10022540	10024540	It is a hot ass mess. Tucson's not that much better.
10024540	10028540	But I went to the, oh my God, why can't I remember his name all of a sudden?
10028540	10030540	Alice Cooper. I went to his restaurant. That was pretty awesome.
10030540	10031540	Okay.
10031540	10032540	Anyway, what was I going to say?
10032540	10037540	Oh, now I want to make sure you get a chance to plug your stuff,
10037540	10039540	because our listeners may not know, but you do your own show,
10039540	10041540	and I want to make sure you get your shout out here.
10041540	10043540	So tell us a little bit about the show that you do.
10043540	10045540	Well, that's not why I called, Rob. Come on.
10045540	10048540	I know, but I want to make sure you get your shout out.
10048540	10050540	Okay, well, that's very nice of you.
10050540	10055540	I write and podcast for rpgfan.com, so we run a couple of podcasts,
10055540	10058540	and the primary one is Random Encounter.
10058540	10062540	It's on iTunes, and we have an RSS feed, and it's all there.
10062540	10065540	It's a video game talk show, obviously, focusing on RPGs.
10065540	10068540	We just talk about news and what we've been playing and blah, blah, blah.
10068540	10071540	And if you're a big video game music fan like I am,
10071540	10074540	we also run Rhythm Encounter, which is like a video game music show.
10074540	10078540	And most recently, Retro Encounter started up, which is like a video game book club.
10079540	10082540	So if you want to listen to people talk about RPGs,
10082540	10084540	then we have many options for you.
10084540	10086540	It sounds like you have a competing network going on.
10086540	10088540	No, I'm just kidding. I think that's great.
10088540	10090540	I'm all about supporting the indie podcast.
10090540	10092540	Well, the reason why I want to make sure you plug that
10092540	10095540	and knowing that you do the work with rpgfan is because
10095540	10097540	then I could ask you this question,
10097540	10099540	and maybe you can speak with a little bit of authority
10099540	10103540	because you've at least been following these games for forever and so forth.
10103540	10106540	But why do you think Nintendo is so effing stubborn
10106540	10108540	about bringing Mother 3 out to America?
10108540	10109540	My God, I don't know!
10109540	10112540	I wish they'd just licensed the fan translation already.
10112540	10116540	I mean, obviously they're aware that the demand is there, right?
10116540	10120540	Because they just released Earthbound Beginnings on Virtual Console
10120540	10126540	and they continue to work with Sakurai to put Earthbound characters into Smash.
10126540	10129540	I wish I had a good answer for you.
10129540	10131540	I don't have any kind of super insider info.
10131540	10134540	I just think they're being stubborn as shit for no reason.
10134540	10136540	And it's about time they do something about it.
10136540	10139540	It is one of the most frustrating things in gaming,
10139540	10143540	but then at least at E3 they threw us a frickin' bone with the Earthbound Zero
10143540	10145540	and I was like, this is leading up to something.
10145540	10147540	Right, exactly. I was like, okay, here it comes.
10147540	10149540	Here's the real announcement, it's on the way.
10149540	10154540	It's Lucas in Smash Brothers is the thing they're ramping up to, I don't know.
10154540	10159540	And that also could be its own lead-in, but I don't know.
10159540	10160540	I don't know.
10160540	10162540	Was there something else you wanted to call in and talk about tonight?
10162540	10164540	No, I just wanted to say hi.
10164540	10167540	I thought I heard you hinting in another topic. Well, that's all right.
10167540	10170540	I appreciate the phone call nonetheless and being able to talk about Earthbound.
10170540	10174540	I love Earthbound as well, but I'm going to tell you a secret.
10174540	10176540	I have never played Mother 3.
10176540	10178540	I mean, I'm not that far behind you.
10178540	10182540	I got about halfway through it last time I tried it and that was, I don't know, five years ago.
10182540	10186540	So, it's okay, Rob. You can still do it.
10186540	10188540	Okay, I'm glad I could vent that and not be judged for it.
10188540	10190540	I'm glad this is a safe space.
10190540	10194540	But time is running short because if you haven't played it within the next six months, I'm going to judge you.
10194540	10197540	All right, I'll work on it. I promise.
10197540	10198540	Okay.
10198540	10200540	All right. Well, thank you so much, Embryon, for the phone call.
10200540	10203540	I really appreciate it and good luck with everything on your own show.
10203540	10204540	Yeah, thanks for having me.
10204540	10205540	Hey, you're welcome. Anytime. Take care, buddy.
10205540	10206540	You too.
10206540	10207540	All right, bye.
10207540	10211540	All right, sadly, I'm going to shut the Skype line down at this time
10211540	10213540	and I know there are still people trying to get through.
10213540	10215540	There's multiple people still trying to get through.
10216540	10217540	Please consider sending the show an e-mail.
10217540	10220540	Participate at orangewonstrategy.com or a tweet.
10220540	10224540	Or you can always go to our forums at thevognetwork.com and click on forums
10224540	10226540	and you can still participate with the show.
10226540	10228540	You can leave a comment on a past episode of the show.
10228540	10230540	Whatever. Send smoke signals.
10230540	10233540	We'll get you on the show one way or another.
10233540	10237540	But for now, it is well after midnight on the East Coast, after 9 p.m. on the West Coast,
10237540	10240540	so we have to start to wrap up the show tonight.
10240540	10243540	So, before I go around and get everybody's final thoughts,
10243540	10245540	we did run out of last minute stories, right, Loki? We're good?
10245540	10248540	Yes, and I've been watching videos of Grand Theft Auto 5.
10248540	10249540	Oh, good times. Good times.
10249540	10252540	Well, before we wrap up, for realsies, we've got to go around
10252540	10255540	and get everybody's final thought for the night.
10255540	10257540	But I do want to say, of course, as always,
10257540	10260540	thank you so much for downloading our show or listening live
10260540	10262540	or however you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio.
10262540	10265540	Just thanks for being here for the past three hours,
10265540	10268540	two and a half, maybe, on the podcast feed,
10268540	10271540	to listen and participate with our show. We really appreciate it.
10271540	10275540	We don't ask for your money. All we ask, help spread the word about the show.
10275540	10278540	Tell a friend or five about the show because word of mouth
10278540	10280540	is all we have here at Orange Lounge Radio,
10280540	10283540	and that's the only way our show grows is for you to tell a friend.
10283540	10287540	If you didn't like Orange Lounge Radio, well, you still made it to the end of the show,
10287540	10289540	so I'm hoping there's something you liked about it.
10289540	10293540	But I always say, even if you didn't like OLR, support indie broadcasting.
10293540	10298540	You heard our buddy there from RPG Fan. Maybe you'd like one of their podcasts.
10298540	10301540	Maybe you'd like one of the other podcasts on the Voice of Geeks Network,
10301540	10303540	vognetwork.com, or just something out there.
10303540	10305540	Just support hard-working, independent broadcasters
10305540	10308540	because there's so many people out there who don't get paid to do this,
10308540	10312540	who also don't get advertised on big podcasting networks and stuff
10312540	10315540	because they don't have money, so I really appreciate your support.
10315540	10319540	So go find, and you heard some shout-outs in an e-mail there as well,
10319540	10322540	so lots of suggestions for you guys this week.
10322540	10325540	So, all right, all that being said, now it is time to go around
10325540	10328540	and get everybody's final thought for the night.
10328540	10330540	And I guess I'll start tonight. I don't usually go first.
10330540	10332540	So my final thought tonight is...
10332540	10336540	Ahh! Ahh!
10336540	10338540	Darsakra, your final thought tonight?
10338540	10340540	I really like cheese.
10340540	10343540	And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10343540	10347540	Uh, I need to work more on my game this week.
10347540	10348540	Yes, you do.
10348540	10353540	And if anybody out there makes logos, I know, I know you do.
10353540	10355540	I know I need to send you information, Jamie.
10355540	10360540	But anybody else out there too, you know, I need one for my game,
10360540	10363540	for my company that I haven't formed yet, but I will,
10363540	10366540	because I have a website already that's been sitting there for, like, six months.
10366540	10369540	All right, Loki, get on that. I'm excited to play your game.
10369540	10371540	You know, I still have a couple more VoG Jam games to play,
10371540	10375540	and I'm hoping for the very last one, I could do, like, the quote-unquote
10375540	10379540	world premiere, even though you've already premiered it on your own YouTube channel.
10379540	10382540	But that doesn't stop other websites from saying exclusive and premiere,
10382540	10387540	so I'm going to use that word here at VoG Network to show your stinking VoG Jam game already.
10387540	10388540	All right.
10388540	10389540	So I'm excited.
10389540	10393540	All right, well, that is going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
10393540	10397540	We will be back next week to talk about whatever should happen in the gaming world
10397540	10400540	in the next seven days in whatever games you're playing.
10400540	10403540	Have a great time playing video games out there.
10403540	10406540	Remember, treat each other with respect online, for God's sake.
10406540	10407540	Don't be rude to people.
10407540	10410540	And that's it.
10410540	10413540	Maybe I'll see you on the battlefield in Splatoon,
10413540	10416540	because I've got to level my character up so I can join a squad.
10416540	10418540	So I think that's on my to-do list for the week.
10418540	10420540	So have a great week, everybody.
10420540	10424540	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10424540	10428540	Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
