00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,280
This week Summer Games Done Quick has come and gone and congratulations to the group

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,920
for raising $1.2 million dollars benefitting Doctors Without Borders.

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,800
There's plenty more to talk about in the week's news and it all starts right now

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
in the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,800
The DarkSakura Show is brought to you by DarkSakura Productions.

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,560
Listen up there, Techmaster Loki joining me every week.

7
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
What time were you up today?

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,880
The kids probably got you up at 5 a.m.

9
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,320
Actually, they slept in because we wore them out last night because they went to Josh's

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,320
birthday party.

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,840
Now that's good planning.

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,960
Just convenient planning.

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
Just convenient planning.

14
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,320
I see how it is.

15
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,360
And also joining us in studio, of course, as she does every single week, say hello to

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,320
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Hi.

18
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
Hi.

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,840
And we had a birthday party of our own yesterday, or at least Cheesecake was involved.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,360
We had a scary party.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,120
And Freddy Fazbear was involved.

22
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Yeah.

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Poor Rob.

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
Poor me.

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:38,840
So if you were listening to last week's show live, DarkSakura and I came up with this big

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,560
plan where I was going to finish some VOGJAM videos.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,280
So you know, I was making good on the promise there.

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
And then we were going to do some live streaming, bring that back because I haven't done that

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,920
since like January, which ironically, the last live stream I did was Five Nights at

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,200
Freddy's one.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,320
So we did a live stream of Five Nights at Freddy's four, and it lasted maybe 25 minutes.

32
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,560
I could not get past night two.

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,560
And that is, that is the ugliest scream I've ever let out on a live thing.

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,100
So it was a beautiful thing.

35
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,440
It's all on YouTube for everyone to see now.

36
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,380
I think I jumped a few times.

37
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,380
You did.

38
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,480
You got scared at the same point I did.

39
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
You did.

40
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
You did.

41
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,480
You did more of the lady gasp.

42
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
You did more of that.

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,480
And then I started giggling like I was five.

44
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,480
I screamed.

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
It was awful.

46
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,920
I did not publish the picture of you fanning your face.

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Fanning the flames.

48
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,560
And of course, my name is Rob Roberts.

49
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,000
Since we're introducing in reverse order tonight, everything is upside down today when we are

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,180
taping early.

51
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,520
But if you are, it's not like this is for Australia, Rob, although we love our friends

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
friends in Australia.

53
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,320
We do love them over there, but I think it's actually like three in the morning over there.

54
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
I don't know.

55
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,680
chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,560
We do have some people joining us that aren't usually here.

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,000
It's a smaller crowd because, you know, I'm sure not everybody got the memo and many people

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,360
have the 6 p.m. thing worked into their routine, which if you're listening after Bobby Black

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,920
Wolf tonight, because usually we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network,

60
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,240
vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black

61
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Wolf show.

62
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,720
We're going to repeat this at that usual time for those that, you know, forgot what we said

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,880
last week about the early show or what have you can't make it because I'm sure like people

64
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,420
like Akuma JP or in Japan.

65
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,420
It's like three or 4 a.m.

66
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,920
There's no way he's listening right now.

67
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,600
So we'll repeat it at six o'clock for that crowd.

68
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:35,040
But I notice over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Fabrice from Belgium in chat saying it's 8

69
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
p.m. in Belgium here.

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,320
Finally OLR at a decent hour, not 3 a.m. in the morning.

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,160
Well, I'm glad I could work out for you.

72
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,920
And I saw somebody else saying it was only seven o'clock where they were, Kitten Poker

73
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,000
says it's just gone 7 p.m. here.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,080
So that's really cool that we get some people from overseas who don't usually get to participate

75
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
in the show.

76
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,840
So Dark Soccer and I have a personal engagement this evening with a friend of ours who's who's

77
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,060
moving out of town is having like her her going away shindig tonight.

78
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,840
So we decided to rearrange things so we could do it.

79
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,240
So appreciate you guys working with us.

80
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,920
But anyway, we are here to talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.

81
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,860
We will take your calls live.

82
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,920
If anybody wants to give us a call later on in the show, 1-877-GAME-OLR, remember that's

83
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,620
a toll free number in only the U.S. and Canada, but the world can use Skype and you can call

84
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,600
us Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, all one word.

85
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,680
So let's get into game chat.

86
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,580
And starting off here, you know, you heard that in the intro and big congratulations

87
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,600
to the Games Done Quick crew with their Summer Games Done Quick event.

88
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,140
And they raised over one point two million dollars at the end of the day for Doctors

89
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,400
Without Borders.

90
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
And I know there were some I didn't get to watch a lot a lot because I don't I just don't

91
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,260
usually end up watching a lot of the game stream stuff, whatever it is.

92
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,580
But I actually did sit down and watch some of this.

93
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,280
I saw some of the run they were doing for Twilight Princess.

94
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,160
I saw a little bit of that and I saw another one they were doing later.

95
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,120
Somebody told me to tune in and watch the Hello Kitty stuff.

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,840
So I was watching that for a little bit.

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,840
And then I heard.

98
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
Yes, they did.

99
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,160
They did like the Hello Kitty game for the week.

100
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,560
It was like an awful game segment or something.

101
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Yeah.

102
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
Yeah.

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
What?

104
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
How could you call Hello Kitty awful?

105
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,280
I was watching Chrono Trigger last night.

106
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Yeah, I was.

107
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,680
I heard the finale was like a like was it multiple people doing Chrono Trigger?

108
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Yeah, it was the co-op.

109
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Yeah.

110
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,360
And then there was Super Metroid.

111
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,360
They did like a big race.

112
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Yeah.

113
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,020
It was a big deal because they they had the whole and they always do this to save the

114
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,660
animals or what do they call the other option?

115
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,660
Fuck the animals.

116
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
Fuck them.

117
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,660
Yeah.

118
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,660
No, not literally.

119
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,660
Not literally.

120
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
You don't literally.

121
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,660
I think it's kill the animals.

122
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
Kill the animals.

123
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
Yeah.

124
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,660
There it is.

125
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
Awesome.

126
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,780
And then like they take extra donations to name the characters.

127
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,460
It's like every main character that you can name was always Iwata.

128
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,980
Oh, that's really cool.

129
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,980
Yeah, I heard.

130
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,740
I think I heard about that because they did on the Chrono Trigger thing, right?

131
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,540
They did it also in Earthbound because I was watching the Earthbound speed run.

132
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,540
Of course.

133
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
Of course.

134
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,540
That makes sense.

135
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,540
Well, big props to those guys.

136
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,740
I was going to ask, though, just in general, what do you think?

137
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,940
I mean, obviously the charity element is is great, but what do you think really draws

138
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,180
people to watch those sorts of streams?

139
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,580
What is it that people love about the games done quick in particular?

140
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,380
Because there's lots of charity streams on Twitch.

141
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,460
There's a lot of people doing good out there.

142
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,940
And I'm not trying to turn it into a contest, but I'm curious what draws people to this

143
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,220
one specifically.

144
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,820
What is it about the games being done quickly that that draws people in, you guys think?

145
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,540
And I open that up to our chat room as well as live.vognetwork.com.

146
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,660
I think some of it's just watching how you can break the games.

147
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,260
I mean, most speed running really relies on glitches, I think, for more modern games.

148
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,780
But I like it better for older games, because then you find methods and different changes

149
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,580
and, you know, things you can skip and what's actually essential to the story and whatnot.

150
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,940
So sort of that element of discovery, because I could certainly you know, I think that's

151
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,180
a big part of what I was interested in when I was watching the Twilight Princess thing

152
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,820
is like, I never knew you could do that before.

153
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,820
What?

154
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,100
To break the game like that?

155
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,260
There definitely is that kind of element of surprise for a game that's years and years

156
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,260
old.

157
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,980
It was nice too, as they're able, they're so comfortable in doing it, they're able to

158
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,660
commentate over, you know, the gameplay and stuff to talk about different things.

159
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,720
And it's kind of hilarious, like, especially like, I remember watching one from last year

160
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,580
for I Wanna Be The Guy, or one of the, I think it's like one of the newer ones that they

161
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,580
had.

162
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,060
And he was talking about like, you know, the different, like the spiders and silly the

163
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,180
jump scares that they have in the game and stuff like that.

164
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,740
And it was just, he's run it so many times that it was just funny, you know, talking

165
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,180
about the game as he goes and stuff.

166
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,100
So are there Five Nights at Freddy's speedruns?

167
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,540
Because I can see how maybe people finally, I don't think you can speedrun that game.

168
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,660
Finally get immune to that.

169
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,620
Maybe for four, if you do the little mini games, right?

170
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,700
I was gonna say for four, you could do the little mini games just right and maybe get

171
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,700
through that.

172
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,740
But yeah, I only say that because man, that game scared the hell out of me yesterday.

173
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,940
But of course, I'm playing it on the giant TV.

174
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,220
We did this whole little thing where we hooked a computer up to the TV and yeah, anyway,

175
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,420
going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Joda Star is in chat saying, this has been

176
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:18,060
my first chance to participate and I'm doing it on an airplane on the way to Vegas.

177
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,220
Wow.

178
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,220
That's pretty cool.

179
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,940
Does that mean we're officially a part of the Mile High Club now?

180
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,940
Are we being fucked?

181
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,660
No, just the animals.

182
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,260
That was the goal there.

183
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
Let's see.

184
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,220
Well, thank you for tuning in from Way Up High.

185
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,780
Good luck in Vegas, by the way.

186
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Let's see.

187
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,860
Tiger Claw says, that Super Metroid race, the fourth player died 13 minutes into it

188
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,540
and the third player died during the Mother Brain battle.

189
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,260
Yeah, I heard that somebody got knocked out of that contest a little early because of

190
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,800
death, but that's part of the risk.

191
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,940
When you are doing the speedruns, you're usually skipping a bunch of items that most

192
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,440
people would need to keep them alive.

193
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,680
Because I'm imagining it was not a 100% completion speedrun, the only thing that...

194
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,280
And most people would usually skip the animals to get the better time, but that element has

195
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,780
just become a thing.

196
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
Now that's a thing.

197
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:17,320
And when something becomes a thing, you just bend the rules to accommodate it, right?

198
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,820
Dan watches these four guys all the time who just will randomly race each other in Mega

199
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:29,020
Man games and all kinds of different stuff and they will have all of them chatting with

200
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,300
each other while they're doing it and I need to find out who they are again, but they're

201
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
really cool to watch.

202
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,980
They'll just do different games.

203
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,200
Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom says, I think the closest thing to speedruns for me is doing

204
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,620
the gauntlet near the end of Mega Man 2 where you fight the robot masters again.

205
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,380
So I bet you could run through that real quick, especially if you knew exactly what weapon

206
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,500
to use and what boss.

207
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:57,340
You could probably get all sorts of times on that gauntlet at the end of Mega Man 2.

208
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:04,660
But yeah, you know, I find that I will challenge myself to speedrun games when the game encourages

209
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
you to do it.

210
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:09,940
And what I mean by that is like, one game I've been playing a lot this week is Velocity

211
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,880
2X, you know, and that's a game that's on PlayStation 4 and I'm pretty sure it's on

212
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,460
Steam and all the other consoles too.

213
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,180
But it was free during the PlayStation Plus a while ago.

214
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,780
And I really like this game because it's like part shooter, part platformer, so it's

215
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:26,020
got like that Guardian Legend bit to it.

216
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,060
And the music in the game is fantastic.

217
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:34,820
Well, the game gives you medals based on how many crystals did you get, how many survivors

218
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,180
did you rescue, and how fast did you do it.

219
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,680
So you get a gold medal when you get through the level real quick.

220
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,140
And if you can get all the survivors, all the crystals, all the points, and fast, you

221
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,200
get like a perfect.

222
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,880
So what I mean is like the game kind of encourages you to run it faster and faster.

223
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,640
So when I beat a level, if I only get a silver medal for time, I'm usually encouraged to

224
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:01,020
go right back and get a gold medal in the round.

225
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,960
So I know that some games kind of encourage the speedrunning in that regard.

226
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,600
Let's see.

227
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,800
Tigerclaw says, I'm not really into using glitches to beat a game.

228
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,720
I'd rather they play by the rules set in the game.

229
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,280
No clipping through walls and things of that nature.

230
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,680
And Tigerclaw continues, they literally skipped a lot of levels and even boss battles by going

231
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
out of bounds.

232
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,420
I'm not a fan of doing speedruns without a bounce.

233
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,840
But they do mix it up a little bit, right?

234
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,320
They also have no glitch runs as well.

235
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,680
Yeah, they have like no glitch runs and they do like 100% item runs and things like that,

236
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
right?

237
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,680
So they do a little bit that fosters to other people's styles.

238
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,960
And maybe that's part of the secret of how they're so successful is that they don't just

239
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,440
cater to one audience.

240
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,760
They cater to people that are looking for all sorts of things in speedruns.

241
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
So that's kind of cool.

242
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,120
I'd rather they have a Grand Theft Auto speedrun.

243
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
That'd be cool to watch.

244
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
You think?

245
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,600
It would be too long though, I think, because it's hard to complete the game within like

246
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,000
30 hours.

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,320
Do you think there's a game that you would want to get really good at someday and be

248
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,600
a speedrunner for?

249
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
No.

250
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
No?

251
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,280
Maybe when I get old and like I have a lot of free time, but right now I don't have time

252
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,280
to do it.

253
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
In your retirement?

254
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,480
When the rest of you starts to slow down, you'll speedrun to try to keep current?

255
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,000
I like that.

256
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,560
Sure, I guess.

257
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Nice.

258
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,800
Fifth Dream in chat says speedrun Final Fantasy 14.

259
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,680
I'm not sure that's a game.

260
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,840
Maybe you could speedrun from levels 1 to 10 or so.

261
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,680
I know they had, they used to have things like that in World of Warcraft.

262
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,240
Not official, but just like fan sponsored, like either like level one races to get from

263
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,160
this town to this town or who can level up to 15 the fastest or something like that.

264
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,600
You could do something like that in Final Fantasy 14.

265
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
So.

266
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Eleven.

267
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
Quick.

268
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,080
Kill all the rabbits.

269
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
And now the worms.

270
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,400
The Final Fantasy 11 speedrun would take the entire week.

271
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,600
It would take the entire week just to get to level 10.

272
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I'm kidding.

273
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Alright.

274
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Anyway.

275
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,640
Tiger Kong in chat says imagine if you were a developer who made a game that people are

276
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
breaking.

277
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
How do you react to that?

278
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,960
I'm glad that people are playing your game.

279
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
I know.

280
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,600
I think some people like don't even realize that the bug existed in their own game.

281
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,320
Weren't the Shovel Knight folks, the Yacht Club games, weren't they participating with

282
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
their own speedrun?

283
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,400
Like kind of, I don't want to say it was like official, but I know I saw some of their tweets.

284
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,440
The ones who did, um, god I can't remember the name, but it was the ones like, you're

285
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,800
just like the little guy that's got all the spinning wheels and everything kind of outliney.

286
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
I was watching that one.

287
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
You mean Super Meat Boy?

288
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,000
Not Super Meat Boy.

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,420
It was one of those really difficult games though.

290
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Like N++?

291
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,420
It almost sounds like?

292
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
No.

293
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,720
It was, you play like a little stick figure person, but anyway.

294
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Yeah, that's N++.

295
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
It sounds like N+.

296
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Anyway.

297
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
I don't think that was it.

298
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
I think it was something else.

299
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,960
But anyway, they went all the way through that one really quick while the developers

300
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
were watching.

301
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,360
And they were like, hey, that's pretty cool.

302
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
Hey, we knew about that.

303
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,280
We just didn't think anyone would figure it out.

304
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Yeah.

305
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,080
No, I think a lot of developers like to watch those sorts of live stream things, you know,

306
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,200
and kind of are flattered when people go to such great lengths to break the games.

307
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,960
At least any developer I've ever talked to kind of likes that.

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,520
Especially when you talk about a lot of these older games have kind of been, I don't want

309
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:20,000
to say they've been forgotten, but you know, it's kind of nice to still have them acknowledged

310
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,360
here in the year 2015, some of these old classic games.

311
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,320
I think a lot of developers kind of like that.

312
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,280
And I know, you know, not necessarily with speed running, but since somebody mentioned

313
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,360
Final Fantasy XIV a minute ago, and I've been following that and read a lot of interviews

314
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,360
and went to the Fan Fest last year, I know that those developers, Naoki Yoshida, who's

315
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,160
been the producer of the game has actually said when that game first went live on PlayStation

316
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,200
4, they started watching a bunch of live streams to see how people were consuming the content,

317
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,440
what people were doing and what people were enjoying.

318
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,520
And so they actually watch live streams to see how people are playing the game, which

319
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,120
I think is fascinating.

320
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,120
So I think there's a lot of developers out there that kind of get a kick out of that.

321
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:11,080
So anyway, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Fifth Dream in chat says,

322
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,480
I made a level of N++ that one of the devs of it called Beautiful, and she likes the

323
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
name of it.

324
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,920
They retweeted my video stream I posted in YouTube too.

325
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Well, there you go.

326
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
That's really cool.

327
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
I need to check out N++ by the way.

328
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,600
I know that came out on PlayStation 4 this week, but I was distracted by, you know, all

329
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,400
these other games and things, but I meant to check out N++.

330
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,120
I know that's on my list of things to do.

331
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,440
So there was something else I played this week, and we'll get to that in just a moment

332
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,680
because it is time for How Was Your Gaming Week?

333
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,400
But ladies first, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

334
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,160
I had a very enjoyable experience with Five Nights at Freddy's 4.

335
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,880
I'm glad somebody did.

336
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,440
Dragon Age Inquisition, Dragon Age Origins, Final Fantasy XIV, and Bejeweled.

337
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,760
In that order, all at the same time.

338
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,040
I'm a talented lady, let me tell you.

339
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Awesome.

340
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,000
Loki, how about your gaming week?

341
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,840
I just tried to get to some stuff that I haven't played in a while.

342
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,960
So I played a little bit of Battlefield 4 because I had purchased that like, god, months

343
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,620
ago when it was down to 10 bucks.

344
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,200
And so I played through the first level of that, and it's pretty good.

345
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
I enjoy it.

346
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,480
You know, because I'm used to playing just through the campaigns on Call of Duty, and

347
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,960
it's just, I don't know, similar, I guess.

348
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,560
It looks prettier though, so I give them that.

349
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,160
And then, the other thing that kind of stood out to me that was kind of silly was like,

350
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,160
every time I'd kill somebody, I'd hear one of my team members go, good job, man!

351
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,000
It was just like, they're like trying to hide in cover, it could be like a stealth mission

352
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,080
or something, I shoot somebody and they're like, yeah, good job!

353
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,060
You're doing a terrible job of being stealthy right now, I'm just saying.

354
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,060
So I thought that was a little silly.

355
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:57,400
And then I tried last night a roundabout that had purchased, do you remember roundabout?

356
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,440
The game about the spinning limousine.

357
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,120
Oh yeah, because that was like on the Ouya, right?

358
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
Wasn't it?

359
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,920
Is that the one where you park the cars?

360
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,920
No, no, no, this is about, it's a game that has full motion video cutscenes.

361
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,160
That's right, okay, we had a new thing, it's like a purposefully bad type of video game.

362
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,680
It's really silly.

363
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,360
So I played a little bit of that, and it's okay, you basically have to get through obstacles

364
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,200
and stuff and your limousine is spinning the entire time, and so you just have to go

365
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
through that.

366
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,800
And apparently it's this, um, Chick Georgio's, like, it's her technique is she just drives

367
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:43,480
the spinning limousine, and um, I don't know, it's also uber violent because you can crush

368
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,040
everybody and they just explode in the blood, but I think it's pretty funny.

369
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,900
And the cutscenes are really bad, they're really bad, but that's what makes it kind

370
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:53,900
of good.

371
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,640
It's so bad it's good.

372
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
So I played a little bit of that.

373
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,040
I played Minecraft on Playstation 4, because I bought that a while ago, and I was very

374
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,360
bored with it.

375
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,800
I was playing by myself, to be fair, so I just didn't feel the excitement that I used

376
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
to have with Minecraft.

377
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,480
It just kind of like, eh, here we go again.

378
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,120
Is it one of those things where the thrill is starting to run out a little bit?

379
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,480
Yeah, kind of, like, and I don't know, it's just maybe, maybe you need more of the PC

380
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,280
version with mods on it, like, where there's actual content that I can consume aside from,

381
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,600
okay, let's go find some diamonds, I mean, it's just, it's kind of a drag.

382
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,280
But you don't want to pay $4.99 for the Skyrim pack, or the, what else did they just, they

383
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
just added something to Minecraft on Playstation 4 too?

384
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
Like, Ancient Greece pack.

385
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Yeah, the Ancient Greece stuff.

386
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,080
No, I don't, because it's just a level, and then I'll get bored with that as well, and

387
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
skins.

388
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,640
Um, so I, I don't know, I played a little bit of that, but I may go back a little later,

389
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,760
I don't know.

390
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,160
And then, uh, what else did I play?

391
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:57,560
Oh, I played a little bit of Clicker Heroes, and I think I'm almost done with that game.

392
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,400
And what else did I play?

393
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:09,160
Um, I worked on my game, mostly, put some new footage up on YouTube of that, and I think

394
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
that's it.

395
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,480
Oh, my son played a lot more of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, and he actually managed to glitch

396
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,200
under the map, which was kind of funny, so.

397
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
Nice.

398
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,760
Speaking of your game, Loki, when I was doing the, uh, VoG Jam videos yesterday, which,

399
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,000
by the way, if you want to see these, and I, I encourage you to go check them out, they

400
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,960
are on the VoG Network YouTube channel, so just check out YouTube.com slash VoG Network,

401
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,560
and you can see me playing the games that are available at VoG Network dot com.

402
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,240
So I was actually playing Bobby's, uh, Moonbuggy game yesterday, um, along with, um, Hitstun's,

403
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,640
um, Skeleton Game and Skeleton Hunter.

404
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,820
And then I also did a little bit of Flappy VoG, and I finally spilled the secret on the

405
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,020
hidden character, cause, I thought that was, everybody knew about that.

406
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,840
No, I don't think everybody, I think, like, a couple people found it, but no, like, nobody

407
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,300
knew, like, how to unlock it, I think, so I finally spilled the beans on that, cause

408
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,260
it's been, like, a year, I was like, Bobby can't get mad.

409
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,380
I thought that, like, a dev is supposed to appreciate it when he was an old dude.

410
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,260
I thought they figured that out, like, immediately.

411
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,860
No, only a couple people found that, so, so you want to get all the details, go check

412
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:16,140
it out on the, um, uh, VoG Jam playthrough, um, but I, anyway, the point I was making

413
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,980
was tied into your game, Loki.

414
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,460
I was playing, uh, Bobby's Moon Buggy game, and I don't know if you've played it, but

415
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:28,020
it's kinda like, you, you have, uh, Moon Buggy that you're accelerating and de-accelerating,

416
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,460
and you're trying to get over, like, jumps and things like that, but there's that physics

417
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,460
engine where sometimes the damn thing will flip upside down, and whatever.

418
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,420
So there was one level where I, like, flew over a ramp, and my thing was, like, spinning

419
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,740
like crazy, and I went through the finish line like that, and so I still beat it, and

420
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,700
I went, nailed it, and it just reminded me of that sequence in your game.

421
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,500
Yes, awesome.

422
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,780
Anyway, uh, so there, I, I played some VoG Jam games yesterday, that was, uh, part of

423
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,460
my gaming week, uh, and then I also played Five Nights at Freddy's 4, which we talked

424
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,580
about, um, and you can see me, like, seriously, I let out a hideous scream, I don't know why

425
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,340
I let that out on the internet, things we will do for subscribers, but that's on my

426
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,540
personal channel, Rob Roberts Plays on YouTube, that's Rob Roberts Plays, all one word, about

427
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,420
halfway through that video, you can, uh, see me ugly scream and then ugly cry, um,

428
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,780
and I will say this, as much as I always sit here and say, I hate Five Nights at Freddy's,

429
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,540
that game is so fucking mean, and stuff like, I hate what it does to me, but I actually

430
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:32,220
think as a game itself, it's pretty brilliant, you know, because it's one of those very simple,

431
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,740
it's a simple concept, and most people will say, there's barely any game to Five Nights

432
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:41,940
at Freddy's, eh, eh, look at old Atari 2600 games, there was a lot of very simple concepts

433
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,740
there, and I think what, what, um, the creator of Five Nights at Freddy's has done, you know,

434
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:51,100
is taken this great, simple concept, and created a universe around it, that, like, people are,

435
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,980
like, super into lore, that don't even necessarily play the games, they just, right, Jamie? Like,

436
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,940
super lore nuts about all this stuff that goes into Five Nights at Freddy's, so, I,

437
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,500
I think it's an indie game, specifically, it's an, it's an incredible piece of work,

438
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,940
and the guy, you know, deserves a lot of credit for that game, so when I sit here and say,

439
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,780
I hate the game, I don't really hate the game, I just hate what it does to me, I actually

440
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,980
respect it an awful lot, so. Have you seen the, the Twitter pics about, like, them building

441
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,260
the actual, um, animatronics that are gonna be for the movie? Oh, God. It's all practical

442
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,160
effects, too. Oh, no. And it's been, I think it was Jim Henson's Creature Workshop, they're

443
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,540
doing it? Oh, no. Yeah, it's gonna be awesome. I think we have a story on the movie coming

444
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,260
up later, so, I don't know, it's gonna be scary, alright. Uh, Fifth Dream in Chat, over

445
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,500
at Live.Vocanilwork.com, says Five Nights at Freddy's equals twenty-six haunted house,

446
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:46,940
twenty-six hundred haunted house. I don't know, haunted house on the Atari 2600 was

447
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,500
pretty fucking scary, I'm just saying. But Atari 2600 also didn't have the breathing

448
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,500
noises that you had to react to, so there, there is that, I will give it that. So what

449
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,300
was it, I mean, I guess I'll have to watch the video, but what was it that made you jump?

450
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:07,060
Okay, so, the way that part four plays is very different than part one, and I, here's

451
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,140
the funny thing, and I even say this in video, I never played part two and three, I, I sorta

452
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,640
know, like, how those games go, but I never play them. But, um, instead of just, like,

453
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,180
clicking on different, like, you would actually, you, you do this weird thing with a mouse

454
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,040
where you swipe it down and it causes your child to run to the door, and so when you're

455
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:31,980
at the door, you either shine the flashlight to scare the monster back, or if you hear

456
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,860
the breathing noise, that means they're right there, and if you shine the flashlight, they're

457
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,700
gonna get you. So if you hear the breathing noise, you shut the door. So you have a door

458
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,140
on the left, a door on the right, a closet, and then behind you, you have to keep checking

459
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,620
the bed, right? So, you know, I'm running to the door, shine the light, running to the

460
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,740
door, shine the light, so I keep running to the doors, and then finally, I run to one

461
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,420
of the doors and I shine the light, and it goes, BAAAAH! And it's like, there's a big

462
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:00,980
monster right there, and I just, I just... You were taking, you were shining it too quickly.

463
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,660
I was, I wasn't, I guess I wasn't listening enough for the breathing noise. I don't think

464
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,180
it was loud enough. Yeah, but to be fair, the volume was kind of down, and you guys

465
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,760
were talking, so it would be hard for me to hear the breathing anyway, so I just kind

466
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,540
of got in a routine, and then I got the pants scared off of me, so. But it was, it was very

467
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:21,760
good at jump scares, very effective. Fifth Dreamin's chat says, sounds like this game

468
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,500
would give me a heart attack. It might, it very well might, so be careful. Alright, other

469
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,540
games I played this week, because there were others. Again, you know, more Final Fantasy

470
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:35,020
XIV, I mentioned Velocity 2X earlier, but there was a new game I played this week that

471
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,300
I want to mention and give a shout out to, because I don't think there's enough people

472
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,980
talking about this game, and I think, I think it's definitely worth a look. And the game

473
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:52,220
is King's Quest Episode 1, which is a reimagining of the classic PC series of King's Quest.

474
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:58,160
There's even some, it's not a sequel or anything like that, it's more of a reimagining, a retelling,

475
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,060
but it doesn't necessarily follow the plot of the first game word for word. But there

476
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:09,000
are elements of the first game, like the whole fact that you go into a cave to get a mirror

477
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,480
from a dragon, there's elements of that in the new game, but it's like a completely different

478
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,840
way of telling the story, because you have old Graham, who's voiced by Christopher Lloyd

479
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,040
by the way, which I thought was awesome, you have old Graham kind of telling the story

480
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:29,240
to his granddaughter, who has aspirations of her own, and I thought that was a really

481
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,960
neat way to do it, and that's why a lot of people are calling it Princess Bride style

482
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,340
King's Quest, which actually kind of fits. And here's the crazy thing, Wallace Shawn,

483
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:42,580
you know that name? He's the guy, inconceivable, that guy? He's a fucking voice in the game,

484
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,760
so no wonder everybody's calling it like a Princess Bride type of game, because he plays

485
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,480
an important character in the game. So I just, here's the thing about King's Quest, I was

486
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,080
very nervous about it, because the old games are point and click, sometimes type, it's

487
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,240
a very kind of open thing, so when I was moving to PlayStation 4, I was a little worried,

488
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,040
like how is that going to translate, like I'm kind of worried about that, but it actually

489
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,680
works really well, like they took elements of the old interface and kind of made it work

490
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,380
with a controller, and I was worried that it was going to be a lot of platforming stuff,

491
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,500
and there's a little bit of that, but the platforming sequences feel more like I'm playing

492
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:29,260
Dragon's Lair or something, like it's hard to explain, it's not like crazy action based,

493
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,180
and I still feel like it definitely has the element of the old games. And what's great

494
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:38,180
is that the writing is also very well done, because there's all these stupid puns, there's

495
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,820
these silly death sequences that would immediately be followed by commentary, like what's the

496
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:48,020
very first one, there's one room where you have two levers, there's one on the left and

497
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:51,300
one on the right, and they say that you have to pull one of the levers to continue, so

498
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,700
if you pull the one on the left, you're going to get smushed by something, and it gets flattened

499
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,620
against the wall, and so you have this silly death sequence, cartoony stuff, just like

500
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,560
in the old games, and then Christopher Lloyd pops in and says, and that's what of what

501
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,580
happened if I pulled the lever on the left, good thing I pulled the one on the right,

502
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:12,180
and then you hit continue, like it's just, I don't know, it's like silly self referential

503
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,340
like that, so yeah, and one other thing I have to point out that I really liked about

504
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:23,340
the game were some of the animations of Graham are hilarious, because there's like one scene

505
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,960
where he's running away from the dragon real quick, and the way he's running is like with

506
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,820
his arms flailing around and up in the air, and it's just like that silly humor that made

507
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,340
the old games great, so I really have to hand it to Odd Gentlemen, because I feel like they

508
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:43,300
really did capture the essence of the old games in this new type of format, the only

509
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:49,040
really complaint I can think of is that you can't skip any voice acting scenes, which

510
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,900
can be frustrating if you're like looking at the same thing over and over, but that's,

511
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,180
usually the scenes are pretty short, so it's not a big deal, and then like especially in

512
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:04,180
the beginning, it's really easy, it's really easy, but I figure, A, it's the beginning,

513
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:11,300
B, King's Quest was a game that I was playing when I was like 10 to 12 years old, so I do

514
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,980
have to kind of realize that this King's Quest probably isn't totally designed with me in

515
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:23,540
mind, like the audience of the original games, it's probably designed for the 10 to 12 year

516
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:28,460
olds of today, which is an interesting parallel to the way the whole story is framed anyway,

517
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,860
with grandpa telling the granddaughter about his adventures, I don't know if maybe that's

518
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,660
an intentional little wink and a nod to the re-imagining itself, but, so if you're willing

519
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,980
to forgive that, to get some of the humor and things like that, I think you'll enjoy

520
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:47,580
King's Quest, I know I'm really enjoying it, and I picked up the whole complete collection

521
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:52,780
or what it's called, so, very cool. Fifth Dream in chat says, oh I need this King's

522
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:58,260
Quest now, the first one was probably the first home computer game I ever played. Alex

523
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:02,060
P. Carson in our chat room saying, I want to play the Stanley Parable now, I guess,

524
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:06,280
I have to admit, I've only played like a little bit of Stanley Parable, but there's a lot

525
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:13,280
of that same tongue and cheek kind of humor, cheeky humor, right? Very cheeky. Alright,

526
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,860
so anyway, that's it for our gaming week, so let's get into housekeeping and then we'll

527
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,520
get into the news for tonight, so, for tonight's housekeeping, just quickly, please follow

528
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,860
us on Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, we're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange

529
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,300
lounge radio, we're also on YouTube, since we've been talking about YouTube today, don't

530
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:34,100
forget youtube.com slash orange lounge radio, where old episodes of our show are available

531
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,340
wherever you can get YouTube, which is pretty much everywhere. We will be back to our normal

532
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:45,340
time live at 6 o'clock pacific, 9 o'clock eastern, next week on the 9th, and that is

533
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,580
pretty much all I can think of for now, so let's get into some news. Loki.

534
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:57,580
So, Ouya has had a rough life, I guess. It started off pretty strong with Kickstarter

535
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:04,700
being one of the most backed, you know, game-related Kickstarters or technology-related Kickstarters,

536
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:10,060
and just never really kind of got its momentum after that. You know, the system wasn't that

537
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:17,060
great and there was just a whole lot of, I don't know, broken promises, I guess, you

538
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:22,380
know, it took forever to get stuff out to them. Well, finally, you know, back a few

539
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,900
weeks ago, you know, they were trying to sell the company, and they managed to do that,

540
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:34,900
so Razer actually acquired Ouya, and along with that, Julie Ehrman has basically left

541
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,420
the company. Now, what Razer is going to be doing with Ouya is actually using it as a

542
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:46,180
brand, so they're not going to be making any more Ouya consoles or anything like that,

543
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,980
instead they're playing on rebranding the Ouya store. It's going to be now Cortex for

544
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,980
Android TV, as part of, I guess, of their Forge TV Android microconsole platform, which

545
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:06,020
I've never heard of, but okay, cool. And then, along with that, you know, originally when

546
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,260
this whole deal took place, I believe Ouya had contacted the developers that are part

547
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:17,820
of that program where, basically, if you put stuff on the Ouya, they would kind of

548
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,620
help you with your funding, they would match your backers up to a certain amount, or your

549
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,660
backing, and they were basically saying, well, because of this deal, we're just not going

550
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:32,700
to pay you any more. Thankfully, though, Razer did step in, and they are going to be paying

551
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:39,700
the developers for that initiative, so that's good news, at least. Yeah, because I was going

552
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:48,260
to say, a lot of game developers were really counting on that money, so I'm glad to see

553
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:53,740
that they're going to be actually offering that to the developers, as kind of a sign

554
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:59,600
of goodwill. So, why do we think, and I open this question up to the chatroom as well,

555
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:06,180
why didn't Ouya make it? You know, I guess, you know, getting acquired isn't the same

556
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:10,680
as going under, so it's not like Ouya's completely dead, but why is Ouya having to basically

557
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,760
sell off when, you know, in the beginning, they were talking about it being a competitor

558
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,680
to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, like the cheap console, essentially. What happened? I open

559
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,720
this up to chat as well. I have a controversial opinion, but, Logie, go ahead. I think this

560
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,080
technology moved too fast. Their idea was a neat idea at first, but then now, any device

561
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,080
you can hook it up to, TV, and it's way more powerful. Like, by the time that Ouya came

562
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,800
out, it was just underpowered. They're like, well, it's okay, you know, because this processor

563
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,920
that's in there, you know, now that you don't have to actually have, like, a phone OS in

564
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,600
there, and it'll be wired, you know, plugged in, you know, we can unlock the extra processing

565
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,480
power, and it just didn't matter. It just didn't matter, and people weren't buying the

566
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,160
games on their platform, they were using it for an emulator. Yeah, and honestly, that's

567
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,920
where my thought process goes, and I know this is not going to be a popular opinion,

568
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,540
especially among indie developer friends of mine, but I honest to God think this is what's

569
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:14,380
going on with Ouya, and I'm just going to tell it to you, honestly, how I think it is.

570
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:20,200
I think most people kickstarted the Ouya under the pretenses that it was going to be an easy

571
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,700
emulator for their television, that it was going to be an easy way to get all these Nintendo

572
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,300
games and Super Nintendo and Genesis games on your television, and I think that's what

573
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:34,940
most people ordered, not all, but most people ordered the Ouya under those pretenses, and

574
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:40,180
so, you know, you've got this box that does this questionably legal thing, you know, emulators

575
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:46,260
are in this extremely gray area when it comes to legality, right? So, you know, the Ouya

576
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:52,380
sells all these Kickstarter units based on those pretenses, you know, again, I believe

577
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:58,940
the majority, not everything, but then, because, well, an emulator gray area legally is not

578
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,140
going to sustain your business, it's not going to keep things moving, you know, they're trying

579
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:08,340
to legitimize it with this store and all these indie efforts that they're doing, but I don't

580
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,220
think most people were interested in the legitimate things the console could do, which is sad.

581
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:18,140
It was just the way that they kind of handled everything, because even the people that backed

582
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,700
in on Kickstarter, a lot of them didn't get their units right away, they were hitting

583
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,940
store shelves before they were getting their units, and even when it did come out, like,

584
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,580
the controller was shit, and it was just like all these ideas that they had, they're like,

585
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:34,540
yeah, it's going to be this, and it just wasn't very good, and I just think it just

586
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,100
over well, overall underwhelmed everybody.

587
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,500
Which is kind of a shame, because I do applaud some of the things that Ouya was doing for

588
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,620
the indie community there towards, you know, in the last year or so, and I like that they

589
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,340
were trying to kind of carve themselves a niche for that, and when you go to things

590
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,460
like, you know, indie mega boosts at different shows like PAX and so forth, you see a lot

591
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:01,300
of games, or have seen a lot of games, that are PC and Ouya, because Ouya's really embraced

592
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,060
that, but unfortunately, there just weren't enough people interested in buying console

593
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,060
for that.

594
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,340
That's what's also disappointing about the PlayStation TV, is that could have potentially

595
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:15,580
been like the Ouya, as a sense, you know, where you would have this PlayStation mobile

596
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,100
platform that you could develop games for, and let's be honest, you probably develop

597
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,460
games that are pretty similar to Ouya, maybe, I'm not sure power-wise versus the Vita and

598
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,460
the Ouya.

599
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:29,060
I think the Vita was more powerful, but, you know, you could develop games for the Vita,

600
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,660
and still have it being able to be played on the TV.

601
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:35,420
I thought that was an excellent idea, and they just shut it down immediately.

602
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
Now what?

603
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,860
Now, what good is that?

604
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,860
Yeah.

605
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,860
Well, we'll see.

606
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,380
I mean, we're eulogizing Ouya, but that's not really what's happening, because Razer's

607
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,620
picked it up.

608
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:51,580
Maybe they're gonna transform it into something, you know, maybe this product that's out there

609
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,460
the more legitimate, not that you necessarily won't be able to put emulators on it, but

610
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,300
maybe they'll try to transform it into something like, I don't know, like look at Raspberry

611
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,640
Pi, and, you know, something like that does very well, so maybe they'll kind of approach

612
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,140
it a different way, maybe, rebrand it.

613
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,020
Well, and that was the other thing too, with the Ouya, they're like, oh well, it's gonna

614
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,300
be completely open, you'll be able to jailbreak it once you get it.

615
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,180
No, that never was a thing.

616
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,220
That never happened.

617
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:20,740
You could sideload things into it, and I'm sorry, but even like with whatever Razer's

618
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:25,500
putting out, if it runs Android, and you can sideload shit into it, it's gonna be playing

619
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,500
emulator games.

620
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,580
I mean, seriously, that's what people are gonna do with it.

621
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,580
And porn.

622
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,580
And porn, right?

623
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,620
Well, if it has an internet connection, it's gonna have porn on it, so there's that.

624
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,620
That is true.

625
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:43,540
Alright, well anyhow, let's move on from something indie to something very, very big budget,

626
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,740
and I get excited about this series, and I know a lot of you out there as well, Dragon

627
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,580
Quest XI has been announced.

628
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:56,300
Dragon Quest XI will be coming out for, and this is a very interesting combo here of platforms,

629
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:02,100
Dragon Quest XI is coming out for the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation 4.

630
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:07,140
That was revealed this week at basically a press conference at Square held in Japan,

631
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,580
totally dedicated to this effort.

632
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:15,500
What's also interesting is that the Nintendo NX has already been announced as under consideration

633
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:21,020
for this game as well, which is interesting, you know, that even though Nintendo hasn't

634
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:26,120
officially unveiled the platform, we all know it's coming, so people are talking about it

635
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,460
like it's a thing, so I kind of find that interesting.

636
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,460
So...

637
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,460
I just hope it's a good thing.

638
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,380
Yeah, well, me too, obviously.

639
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:37,900
They also apparently said Dragon Quest X, which was the MMO, would also be under consideration

640
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,700
for the NX.

641
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:45,860
There are apparently two different games with the same story, which Nino Cooney kind of

642
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:49,580
did that as well, so even though you have 3DS and PlayStation 4, I guess they're actually

643
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,340
different games.

644
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:56,940
They're slated for a 2016 release to coincide with the 30th birthday of the Dragon Quest

645
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:04,940
series, and so PlayStation 4's runs on Unreal Engine 4, and it's open-ish, sort of like

646
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:10,380
Dragon Quest VIII was, and then 3DS, and this was really cool, a lot of people were commenting

647
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,640
on this.

648
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:19,800
The 3DS version has 2D on the bottom, and then on the top, it has the 3D sort of view.

649
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,900
And they were kind of quick to clarify, the entire game doesn't run like that, but the

650
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,620
little sequences you could see in the preview looked really cool, where it was like old

651
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:30,140
school on the bottom and new school on the top, and I thought that was really neat, that

652
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,140
kind of effect.

653
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,340
So we'll see how much of that is in the game.

654
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:40,100
Alright, also, now we get excited about a title like this, but that doesn't mean it's

655
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:46,020
coming out in the States, because we never did get Dragon Quest X, so obviously people

656
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,900
over here in the States want to know, when do we get our turn for, you know, not just

657
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:57,960
Dragon Quest X, but Dragon Quest XI specifically, and of course there was a comment on this.

658
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,060
The Japanese publisher stated, it understandably doesn't have a concrete plan at the moment,

659
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:07,740
but it'll consider it as it has done in the past for other Dragon Quest titles.

660
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,940
So that's a big fat maybe.

661
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,940
And I'm assuming...

662
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,660
Well, consider it if you fund our million dollar Kickstarter.

663
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,980
Or Dragon Quest Heroes sells a million copies or whatever, because, you know, I don't...

664
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,580
See, and I don't understand, why does Dragon Quest Heroes come out over here when we can't

665
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,820
get Dragon Quest XI?

666
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,180
No shade to Dragon Quest Heroes.

667
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,860
I'm assuming it's because there's less to translate or what have you, but it's still

668
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:36,060
kind of frustrating that, you know, the game we really want isn't being announced at the

669
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
same time.

670
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
But whatever.

671
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,560
I'm sure there'll be a lot of people that will import Dragon Quest XI anyway, and make

672
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,980
their way, crash and burn their way through all the heavy Japanese in the game, and enjoy

673
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,780
the 2D and 3D sequences.

674
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,780
We'll see.

675
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,780
Anyhow.

676
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,780
Moving on.

677
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:54,820
Well, you remember Zombie U, Rob?

678
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,420
I do!

679
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,340
That was one of the great games that was launched with the console.

680
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:06,300
Well, it's going to be re-released on PC, PS4, and Xbox One as just Zombie, with an

681
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:13,820
I at the end and no E. It's basically going to be out on August 18th, so we don't have

682
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,780
too long to wait for it.

683
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:23,580
It will, basically it's got Permadeath as a feature in the game where, when you get

684
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:28,820
eaten by zombies, you leave a survival pack with your gear in it, and you have the choice

685
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:38,660
as a new survivor to go retrieve your pack from your previous, now zombified, uh, self.

686
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,900
Yeah, it's a very Dark Souls, and the Wii U version of this too is a very Dark Souls

687
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,300
element to it.

688
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,140
It'll be digital download only.

689
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,020
Oh, that I didn't realize.

690
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,020
Yep.

691
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,020
So if you want to find out more, go to zombiegame.com.

692
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,020
Interesting.

693
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,020
Z-O-M-B-I.

694
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,540
I think it comes out in a few weeks too.

695
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,540
That's what I just said.

696
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,540
That's what I just said.

697
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,540
August 18th or whatever.

698
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,540
But, uh, yeah, I know we had a rumor on this a couple weeks ago, so it's interesting that

699
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:07,020
now it's been confirmed, and that it's, I didn't, I kind of assumed they would do a

700
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,320
physical release for the holidays, so that's very interesting that they're unloading it

701
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,320
as a digital game.

702
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,260
I get a feeling they're really trying to make some money back that they might have lost

703
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,260
on the Wii U version, and maybe there was some sort of agreement.

704
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:24,340
I don't, maybe because Nintendo, Nintendo did do some marketing with ZombiU, right?

705
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,060
Because wasn't there an actual ZombiU Wii U in the very beginning?

706
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,340
I feel like Nintendo actually had a bundle that came with it, so maybe there was some

707
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:37,400
sort of agreement, things, that's finally expired, because we're, what, three years

708
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,500
since the launch of the Wii U now, so.

709
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,340
Maybe they will have made improvements since it's coming out on more advanced systems.

710
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,340
Yeah.

711
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:50,020
Although, you know, the gamepad really did have a unique element in ZombiU, so it'll

712
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,740
be interesting to see how they kind of accommodate for that, but I bet it's the type of thing

713
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,820
where you press select or something, and it just, it pops up like your person's going

714
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,100
to hold a fake gamepad or something, like, and it'll just kind of do something.

715
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
That's probably what happened.

716
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:10,100
There was a ZombiU Deluxe Wii U console, and they're still selling it on Amazon.

717
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
Interesting.

718
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,980
So, yeah, I would think because of that, that Nintendo and Ubisoft had some type of arrangement

719
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:19,020
there, so maybe that's why it's taken three years for this to happen, but Ubisoft probably

720
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,540
wants to make some of their money back.

721
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,820
And if this game does really, really well, maybe that's why they'll be a sequel, but

722
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,820
I don't know.

723
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,180
When you're unloading it digitally like that, who knows?

724
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,580
I'm not sure.

725
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,580
All right.

726
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,780
Well, I don't know if I'll buy the game again.

727
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:37,380
I already had it on Wii U, and I'm a little disappointed that Ubisoft just decided to

728
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,700
fuck off on the Wii U, so I don't know if I'll be supporting this on other platforms,

729
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,220
but props to those without a Wii U that want to try it.

730
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,220
Moving on.

731
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:55,100
So it appears that the Mighty No. 9 may be quietly delayed past its September 15th release,

732
00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:00,260
and this is coming from Game Informer, which, of course, is associated with GameStop, who

733
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,260
basically says, hey, guess what?

734
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:09,140
That apparently this delay is being initiated by the publisher, and this includes different

735
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:14,500
placeholder dates that are being put into place that indicates a 2016 release by Deep

736
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,500
Silver.

737
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:22,220
Oh, concept right now isn't confirming that if it's been delayed or not, but it probably

738
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,300
has been.

739
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,580
This is very interesting in light of what we were saying about the Red Ash Kickstarter,

740
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,260
where they were asking for more money before the first game was even out, which if you

741
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:38,660
really sit down and think about rationally how long it takes to make a game make sense,

742
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,140
but you know the general population and the perception is going to be, why are you asking

743
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,180
for money when your first game isn't even out?

744
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:48,260
And now it's going to take even longer for that first game to come out, which is fine.

745
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,620
If that's what they've got to do to make sure it's a good game, then do it, but you know.

746
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:56,420
And then that Red Ash Kickstarter, man, then what happened?

747
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,380
Didn't somebody else come in at the end, like a company out of China or something came in

748
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,660
and ended up funding the whole thing, and then now they're saying the Kickstarter is

749
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:10,540
just a stretch goal Kickstarter, and it just got really weird towards the end there.

750
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,040
I honestly don't care.

751
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,040
I didn't back it.

752
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,040
I didn't either.

753
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
I'll play it when it comes out.

754
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:16,040
But I didn't back my Mighty No. 9 either.

755
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,040
Same thing.

756
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,040
I'll play that when it comes out.

757
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,040
I'm just not backing it.

758
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,040
Yeah.

759
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,040
I'll play Mighty No. 9 when it comes out.

760
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,160
I really want to try it, but by the time I was like, maybe I will kick in the money.

761
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,160
They didn't need it.

762
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,160
I mean, Mighty No. 9 had like millions and millions of dollars, so I was like, eh, I'll

763
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
just wait.

764
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,160
I'll wait.

765
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,720
Anyhow, we'll see what happens with that.

766
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,720
All right.

767
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,360
Well, this week I'm sure a lot of you were checking out Windows 10 because the Windows

768
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,520
10 rollout began this week.

769
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,840
And of course, I'm sure as many of you know, Windows 10 is a free upgrade for those of

770
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,200
you running Windows 7 and Windows 8.

771
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,200
8.1.

772
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,200
Oh, sorry.

773
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,200
8.1.

774
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,960
Or it has to be Windows 7, I think, Service Pack 1 for whatever that's worth.

775
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,540
But Windows is now having to compete, I suppose, on a level with iOS where those upgrades have

776
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,000
been free for a while.

777
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,200
And I think the operating systems on the MacBooks and stuff are free now, too, right?

778
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,480
So this is why Windows is probably having to do something more.

779
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,840
I guess it makes sense because when you think about it, unless you're trying to install

780
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:26,440
Linux on one of those devices, you're not really, like on PCs, at least you have a little

781
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,400
bit of competition and choice where you can put Linux or you can put Windows.

782
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
True.

783
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:37,080
Well, also, and then you see that Microsoft really integrates its store into things.

784
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,960
You know, if you've used Windows 10 at all and that default, you know, they have their

785
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:41,960
store.

786
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:48,140
I have attempted to remove Candy Crush Saga a few times, and it's sticky.

787
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,400
It doesn't want to leave my computer.

788
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,400
Really?

789
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,400
Mine didn't have Candy Crush Saga.

790
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,380
Oh, all of them have Candy Crush Saga.

791
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,920
You just haven't looked yet.

792
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,920
I guess not.

793
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:57,920
I guess he's never upgrading.

794
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,920
I know, right?

795
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,640
But no, there's got to be a way.

796
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,000
Surely there's a mod to scrape it from your system.

797
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,120
No, you can undelete it, or you can delete it, but I attempted it once, and I thought

798
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,520
it removed it, but then it came, it was still there.

799
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,520
And so then I went back.

800
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,000
Cat came back the very next day.

801
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,060
Yeah, I went ahead and removed it, and then now it's gone, but it's like, you know, remember

802
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,040
we had that story a while ago where they were going to offer it for free because people

803
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,040
love that game.

804
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,040
Oh, people love Candy Crush.

805
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,040
People love it.

806
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,040
Yes, yes.

807
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,800
As the progress bar was going by, you know, undeleting it, I was flipping off the computer

808
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,800
the entire time.

809
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,800
I was like, fuck you, King.

810
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,680
The candy came back the very next day.

811
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,520
Oh my God.

812
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,240
So anyway, so a lot of you were upgrading to Windows 10, I'm sure.

813
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
I know I did.

814
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,160
I actually was still running Windows 7.

815
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,760
I just ended up staying away from Windows 8 because a lot of people I talked to didn't

816
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,840
really like it, but I was like, what the hell?

817
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,840
Windows 10 is free.

818
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,840
Let's do it.

819
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,160
So I upgraded, and yeah, I think it's fine.

820
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,160
It's all right.

821
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:01,000
It didn't, like, change my world or anything, but the only real big, big difference I noticed

822
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,520
is the start menu.

823
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,120
You know, it kind of has some of the eight elements in it, and you see this on the Xbox

824
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,080
too with the different tiles, but I don't know.

825
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,080
I was able to unpin all the graphics.

826
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,080
Yeah, most of those tiles are useless.

827
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,840
Let me just pull mine up here real quick.

828
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,040
Okay, it has some photos that apparently I have on my computer.

829
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:21,220
It has, oh, my tweets are finally there now.

830
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:26,780
It's asking me to buy Microsoft's Solitaire collection.

831
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:32,180
Oh, did you get in on the Minecraft Windows 10 beta edition because that's free as well

832
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:33,180
if you own Minecraft.

833
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,180
Oh, no, I didn't check that out yet.

834
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:35,180
Yeah, you should register for that.

835
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:40,020
You know what game comes installed on OS X?

836
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,020
The Dark Castle.

837
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,020
Chess.

838
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,980
I was going to say no games because...

839
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:45,980
That's it.

840
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:46,980
Stop.

841
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,980
That's it.

842
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:54,060
I finally uninstalled Borderlands, but I've got Diablo on here, so I've had no problems

843
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,060
playing games.

844
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,060
Yeah.

845
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,060
Fun.

846
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:03,300
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade at vognetwork.com,

847
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,060
use the passphrase, Friday.

848
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:11,340
But anyway, back to Windows 10, the thing I really wanted to talk about, of course,

849
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:16,100
is that now you can stream Xbox One games to your PC.

850
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,100
That's a whole big thing in it.

851
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,060
And I have to admit, I didn't really try this.

852
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:23,380
I thought it would just be magic and would happen if my Xbox was on and I had the Xbox

853
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:27,540
app open, but I guess you have to actually have a controller plugged in, and I didn't

854
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,540
have that.

855
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,820
So I was like, why doesn't a streaming button show up?

856
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,060
But I guess you have to actually have the Xbox One controller plugged in, and then it,

857
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,620
I guess, opens up those extra features or whatever.

858
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:40,560
But I did think the Xbox app within Windows 10 was kind of interesting.

859
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,980
And it also kind of goes to show why they might have chosen to make Windows 10 free

860
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,980
as they're trying to have you in this ecosystem.

861
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:54,180
They want you in the Microsoft ecosystem where you have an Xbox One and it chats with that.

862
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:58,580
And I'm sure they want you to get a Windows phone as well, although I noticed their phone

863
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,540
app would work with Android and iPhone.

864
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,540
So I thought that was kind of interesting.

865
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:07,980
I mean, they kind of know that not as many people have a Windows phone.

866
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,940
Tigercall on chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, if you don't like the Windows 10 start

867
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,460
menu, you can download a program called Classic Shell, which will replace the start menu with

868
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:19,020
the Windows 7 start menu.

869
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,500
Fabrice from Belgium says, the start menu isn't bad at all.

870
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,780
In fact, things got a lot less complicated.

871
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,180
I think if there's like, you know, just a handful of programs you use on a regular basis,

872
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:35,260
it makes it like I pinned Google Chrome and Final Fantasy 14 and Steam all to my little

873
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,260
thing.

874
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:37,260
And it's right there.

875
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:38,260
It's nice.

876
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:42,300
I'm not entirely a huge fan of like searching for programs through the all apps.

877
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:47,100
I know it's everything's alphabetical, but sometimes, you know, I just need to use the

878
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:49,260
search bar to find it.

879
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,440
Hey, I launched MIRC today with my voice thanks to Cortana.

880
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:56,220
So I tested that out just for the fuck of it.

881
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,220
Yeah.

882
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,220
And it worked.

883
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:02,180
I just wish it would be always listening because, you know, I have to click this little listen

884
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:04,580
button for it to do something.

885
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:05,580
Do something.

886
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,140
It says, ask me anything.

887
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,900
What is the weather like?

888
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:15,420
Ask it to divide by zero and see if she reads you like Siri does.

889
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:22,180
Divide by zero.

890
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:26,060
Why did it launch Microsoft Edge when you told it to divide by zero?

891
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:29,580
It just did a search for Bing for divide by zero.

892
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,240
That's what happens when you divide by zero.

893
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,500
You get Microsoft Edge.

894
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,020
It's just Internet Explorer divided by zero.

895
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,060
It pretty much is.

896
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,740
I mean, they even use the same logo.

897
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,020
There's nothing edgy about that other than the E has an edge.

898
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:45,260
The E's got a razor sharp edge.

899
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:47,260
It's what the kids love, Loki.

900
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,260
It's edgy.

901
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:49,260
All right.

902
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,980
Anyhow, all the other people are using Chrome and Firefox.

903
00:50:53,980 --> 00:51:00,260
I'm just going to be different and I'm going to use Edge because I'm cool.

904
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,260
Yeah.

905
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,140
I use this browser called Microsoft Edge.

906
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,180
You probably never heard of it.

907
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,980
Anyhow, moving on, Dark Sakura, save us from this hipster talk.

908
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,260
Sorry, I was busy playing Minesweeper on my Mac.

909
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,260
Anyway.

910
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,700
That's an abomination right there.

911
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:23,940
Did you divide mines by zero?

912
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,740
Did I just divide Jamie by zero?

913
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,500
Blink, blink, blink, blink.

914
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,020
So how about some Sony stuff?

915
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:38,900
They released their earnings report and said that they have shipped I think over three

916
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:44,900
million PlayStation 4 consoles worldwide as of June 30th.

917
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:52,860
And so that's twenty five point three million as of that date.

918
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:56,460
I mean, it's considering that it started shipping as of the end of 2013.

919
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,380
So that's pretty good, I would say.

920
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:05,000
They are still outselling the Xbox One, though we haven't heard anything from Microsoft officially

921
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:11,020
on their numbers, but yeah.

922
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,940
Let's talk about their install base of Windows 10 and like pimp that out.

923
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:17,540
I'll just sit back and roll my eyes really hard.

924
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:22,620
I know Xbox One's been doing better, especially ever since the price drop and some of that

925
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,620
other stuff.

926
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:28,140
Ever since they announced that Tomb Raider is going to be absolutely exclusive to Xbox,

927
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,940
there is no way you're going to be able to play that in anything other than Xbox when

928
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,260
it's originally launched.

929
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,220
I don't think Xbox One is bad or anything at all.

930
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,700
I'm having a good time with mine.

931
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:44,480
So I think I think they're closing the gap, but they're like much more slowly than they

932
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,480
need to be.

933
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:49,940
And the gap is just like the Sony generation.

934
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,060
Actually that's not a bad way to put it.

935
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:56,400
I think what's happening to Microsoft this generation is exactly what happened to Sony

936
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,460
last generation.

937
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,460
It's like the tables have turned completely and it all goes, and for the same fucking

938
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,900
reasons too.

939
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,900
You know, PlayStation was a laughing stock in 2006 during that press conference with

940
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,220
the giant enemy crabs and all that stuff when they originally announced the PlayStation

941
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:13,220
3.

942
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:18,100
And then I wouldn't say Microsoft was necessarily a laughing stock, but the internet definitely

943
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:22,980
rebelled against those policies that Microsoft originally had in place.

944
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,740
And you know, PlayStation tore him a new asshole at that E3.

945
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:27,420
We all know about that.

946
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:34,900
And even though Microsoft went back and changed things, which they needed to do, perception

947
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,800
is a huge part of things.

948
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:42,180
And by that point, Sony had already opened the wound too much and the Kinect thing still

949
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,420
made the Xbox more expensive, yada, yada, yada.

950
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:49,700
So I think these are things that Microsoft is slowly recovering from.

951
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:53,940
But when we looked at the end of last generation, you know, the PlayStation 3 closed the gap

952
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,060
quite a bit.

953
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:59,300
You know, everybody appreciated PlayStation 3 and it wasn't, you know, a laughing stock

954
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:00,300
anymore.

955
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,660
And I really think that's where Xbox One's going to be in another couple of years.

956
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,580
And it's making progress towards that now.

957
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,360
Yeah, I don't think it's going to take that long either.

958
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:12,340
And looking at what they potentially are going to be announcing here soon, they could have

959
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:18,700
a really strong lineup as compared to Sony, which, God, what the fuck do they have coming

960
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,700
out?

961
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,700
And that's sad.

962
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:25,020
It's the last few years it's been just like, what the fuck is coming out on Sony's platforms

963
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,300
I mean, they got Uncharted 4.

964
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,300
Cool.

965
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:31,380
I mean, but what other first party titles?

966
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,460
They're really lacking in the first party title area, which is kind of weird.

967
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,460
Yeah.

968
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,820
Well, anyway, I will say this one other thing I want to say about Xbox, because I truly

969
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:44,580
believe this to be true, is that ever since Phil Spencer took over is when things got

970
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,460
better over at Microsoft.

971
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,820
Like honestly, Don Mattrick ruined the Xbox One launch.

972
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:54,300
Like just, I'm just going to call it like it is the minute they got rid of Don Mattrick

973
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,540
and brought Phil Spencer and things started getting better.

974
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,780
So just, just calling it like it is.

975
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,020
I mean, right.

976
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,580
That's what happened, is it not?

977
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:08,740
The minute Don Mattrick went away, they finally started selling Xboxes and where did he end

978
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,740
up?

979
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,740
Zynga.

980
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,740
Anyway.

981
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,740
He's done wonders for them.

982
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:14,740
Right?

983
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:20,820
I mean, we haven't even mentioned the word Zynga in quite a long time.

984
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,820
In a whole week.

985
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,820
All right.

986
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,140
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

987
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,700
Let's see what games you can get for these consoles.

988
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,700
Coming soon.

989
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:33,180
Well, this is the week that you'll be able to pick up Rare Replay on Xbox One, so that'll

990
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,180
be coming out.

991
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:41,140
And then Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold, the Fatinear Knight.

992
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,740
Or Fatinear Knight.

993
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,860
I don't know how to pronounce that.

994
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:48,860
That's it?

995
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:49,860
That's it.

996
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:55,380
I'm super excited, though, about the following week, because Garfield Kart will be coming

997
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,380
out.

998
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,380
Really?

999
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:58,380
Yeah, it's on the 3DS.

1000
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,420
Does Garfield sit in a plate of lasagna that goes around the track?

1001
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,700
Is that what it is?

1002
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,900
You know, you laugh.

1003
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,940
Does he get chased by Nermal?

1004
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:15,020
I don't know if he gets chased by Nermal, but no, he does not have a plate of lasagna

1005
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,020
that he's sitting in.

1006
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,020
Wow.

1007
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,580
Jason Chat says, Hello Kitty Racing greater than Garfield Kart.

1008
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,580
That's probably true.

1009
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,300
It's probably the exact same game, to be honest.

1010
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:25,300
It probably is.

1011
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:29,540
It's probably the exact same game, just, you know, reskinned.

1012
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:35,260
Alright, let's travel around the world and move on to Japan, where on the 6th of August

1013
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:41,660
on the PlayStation 4, Gal Gun Double Piece comes out in regular and limited edition on

1014
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,220
the PlayStation 4.

1015
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,700
That is almost worth me picking that up.

1016
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,700
region free.

1017
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,100
Gal Gun is pretty fun.

1018
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:54,780
The PlayStation 3 has Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate and Shin Sangoko Musou 7 getting price reductions.

1019
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:58,880
They go into the best series with those releases.

1020
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,220
On the Wii U, haha, nothing until September.

1021
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,540
There is nothing in the entire month of August on the Wii U.

1022
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:09,380
But PlayStation Vita, man, that is still kicking over in Japan.

1023
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:15,140
Gal Gun Double Piece out there as well as Luminous Arc Infinity and Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate

1024
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,580
gets a price reduction on the Vita this week.

1025
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:24,420
At first when he said Luminous Arc Infinity, I was like, this is another Luminous game?

1026
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,420
Not the puzzle game.

1027
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,420
Not to be confused with the puzzle game.

1028
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:28,100
Thank you for making me clarify that.

1029
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:32,660
On the Nintendo 3DS this week, there's some accessories, like you can get some new stretchy

1030
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:38,380
touch pens and new pouches, but as far as actual games go, there's Nobunaga no Yabu

1031
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:45,060
2 comes out in a regular and premium box and Sango Kushi 2 comes out in regular and

1032
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:46,060
premium box.

1033
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:54,020
There's also one other game, Banban Ribbon Tokimeki Korede Kira Kira Dance comes out

1034
00:57:54,020 --> 00:58:01,260
and I shit you not, this appears to be a game with fuzzy, cute, pink animals and bunnies

1035
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:08,260
that you dress up and they dance, like Hakune Mitsu style or something like that.

1036
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:24,060
This game looks like a birthday cake threw up all over a video game and that's what

1037
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:27,860
you have here in this.

1038
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,860
But it looks cute.

1039
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,700
I kind of want it.

1040
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,420
I don't know.

1041
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,980
Anyway, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game.

1042
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:36,980
How about Europe?

1043
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,500
Oh I'm sorry, of course Europe!

1044
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,260
One of those being what's coming out in Europe.

1045
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,740
One game, Rare Replay for Xbone.

1046
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,340
Oh they get it early over there, lucky.

1047
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,300
Oh no, that's next week for us too.

1048
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,860
That's on the 4th.

1049
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,860
Yeah.

1050
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,260
Well that's an important game.

1051
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,260
Yes.

1052
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,260
Alright.

1053
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:59,500
Now, a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.

1054
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:00,500
Loki.

1055
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:04,780
It's just seriously the week of games being delayed from Kickstarter.

1056
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,500
And the next one, Amplitude.

1057
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,240
Yes, that's being delayed as well.

1058
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,300
But they're adding more stuff to it.

1059
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:16,460
It's just going to be coming out now at the end of 2015.

1060
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:21,220
So now, instead of the original 16 tracks it was going to have, they're going to have

1061
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:24,620
30 plus additional songs for backers.

1062
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,340
That's a lot of music.

1063
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,620
And it's going to be coming out on Playstation 4 this year and I guess there is a Playstation

1064
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:38,660
3 version coming out later and they said that also a wide release will be happening

1065
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,520
early 2016.

1066
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:44,060
So the backers are going to get the Playstation 4 this year?

1067
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,180
Yeah, I guess so.

1068
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,420
But the rest of us have to wait until 2016.

1069
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,420
Yeah, that's stupid.

1070
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,500
Ok, well, whatever.

1071
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,880
That was part of the perks for kickstarting the game.

1072
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,880
So whatever.

1073
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,880
Alright, cool.

1074
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,820
Hope it's not buggy or anything like that.

1075
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,300
There you go.

1076
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:03,260
Alright and if you are interested in this, I don't know how many of you guys like LootCrate.

1077
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,380
I know some folks, that's a big thing for unboxing videos and stuff.

1078
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,940
People like to get their loot and then unbox it.

1079
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,980
But apparently Nintendo is going to be following suit with something similar.

1080
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:19,400
Nintendo over in the UK is going to be offering a special subscription service that is kind

1081
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:22,100
of a response in some ways to LootCrate.

1082
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:29,440
This will be called the N-Box and will have Nintendo themed toys, clothes, and other accessories.

1083
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:36,860
You can just buy the N-Box by itself or you can subscribe to a 3, 6, or 12 month plan.

1084
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:41,360
Now I guess right now this is considered a rumor status but it does come from a source

1085
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,220
that tends to get these things right.

1086
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:48,900
So no comment from the official Nintendo UK store as of yet.

1087
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,100
The N-Box.

1088
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,720
The N-Box.

1089
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,920
So is the first shipment going to be the N-Box one?

1090
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,360
No.

1091
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:01,520
I think what will happen with the N-Box is that they're only going to have 10 of them.

1092
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:06,320
And so you'll have to show up at 7am to collect tickets and hope that you are one of the lucky

1093
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:07,320
ones that gets to buy one of the N-Boxes.

1094
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,880
You open up an empty box.

1095
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,880
Sorry.

1096
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:10,880
This is hell of a custom.

1097
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,120
It's a rain check in the box is what it is.

1098
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,400
Sorry we couldn't make enough of them.

1099
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,400
Sorry about that.

1100
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,600
Artetsuya in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm hyped for this.

1101
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,160
I hope they bring it out over here.

1102
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,400
Hell, I have my Mario characters, enemies, items shirt on right now.

1103
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,320
So let me get this straight.

1104
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,240
Let's just assume that this rumor is true.

1105
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:38,120
Instead of you purchasing Nintendo products and redeeming a code to go online to get something

1106
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:42,100
for free that's a tchotchke, they're like, you know what?

1107
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,960
We could fuck these people over even more and make money doing it by offering these

1108
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:49,400
tchotchkes instead of as a free reward for purchasing their products because none of

1109
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,400
the people do that.

1110
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:55,200
We're instead going to have you buy these products and we'll give you these tchotchkes

1111
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,600
instead through that by paying us more money.

1112
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,600
Good job.

1113
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,840
Well you never know, to be fair, and this would be kind of interesting, since you can

1114
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:08,820
buy these N-Boxes apparently by themselves, wouldn't it be interesting if whatever future

1115
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:13,120
reward program Nintendo has incorporates these little boxes?

1116
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:18,800
I am really surprised, instead of an N-Box, it's not a question mark block like they have

1117
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,800
in games, right?

1118
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,120
Where you open it and there's coins.

1119
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:22,120
Anyway, forget it.

1120
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,560
One of the things that we got arrived in a question mark box.

1121
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,560
Oh really?

1122
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:29,920
From one of the last Club Nintendo registration deals.

1123
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,800
We have a big group of Mario characters.

1124
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,440
Well okay, since that was part of Club Nintendo, maybe whatever the successor is, maybe we'll

1125
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,360
have the N-Box and maybe instead of things selling out so quick on the store, it'll just

1126
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,360
be a random company.

1127
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,040
When are we going to hear about the successor of Club Nintendo?

1128
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,880
I don't know.

1129
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,480
Maybe they're waiting for the NX or Mobile or something.

1130
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,640
It would either be Tokyo Game Show or, you know, Nintendo can do the direct whenever

1131
01:02:58,640 --> 01:02:59,640
they want.

1132
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:00,640
Nintendo thing and just keep waiting.

1133
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,280
Keep waiting for those good games to come, keep waiting for everything to come out.

1134
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,360
Alright, well I'm sure Loki can't wait for this also.

1135
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,920
One other quick little thing on products here.

1136
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:13,920
Loki, I'm sure, can't wait for Super Mario themed Hot Wheels cars.

1137
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,960
That's right, Nintendo and Mattel teaming up for Super Mario themed Hot Wheels cars.

1138
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:24,600
There is a Super Mario World car, a Super Mario Brothers, Dr. Mario, Super Mario Kart,

1139
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,520
Super Mario Brothers 2, and Super Mario Brothers 3.

1140
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:31,800
As someone pointed out, it was kind of funny, but apparently the Dr. Mario car is a hearse?

1141
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:32,800
Actually it is.

1142
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,880
It does appear to be a hearse.

1143
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,640
That is actually hilarious.

1144
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:39,200
And the Mario Kart car, though, it's an old T-Bird.

1145
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,000
It's one of the cars we saw driving down the road yesterday, Dark Soccer.

1146
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,440
It's not an actual kart.

1147
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,440
You mean Model T?

1148
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,040
Yeah, Model T. It's crazy.

1149
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,600
We saw like, what, five of them in a row?

1150
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,280
Yeah, there was definitely some classic car show going on, wasn't there?

1151
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:59,360
So anyway, also, I should point this out, is that I have seen the Atari 2600 Hot Wheels.

1152
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:04,000
So Hot Wheels doing video game related things is not unheard of.

1153
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,920
So this is kind of interesting that they moved on from their 2600 license to now they're

1154
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,800
doing these Super Mario cars.

1155
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,840
So that's kind of neat, though.

1156
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:17,040
Now I just need one of those sets that, you know, you pull back the spring or whatever

1157
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,520
and it launches your car around a loop.

1158
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,520
That's what I need.

1159
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,520
Just go to any toy store.

1160
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,520
Remember that cool shit from when we were kids?

1161
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,200
Oh yeah, they sell a piece mail now.

1162
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,200
It's super expensive.

1163
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,200
Of course they do.

1164
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,840
Of course they do.

1165
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:36,320
All right, well before back in the day, before they were putting video games on Hot Wheels,

1166
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:43,760
they were putting video games on t-shirts and posters and there was no Hot Wheels.

1167
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,360
But there was classic games and every week Dark Sakura steps into the vault and finds

1168
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:53,920
a classic game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful little shits, stop playing with your Hot Wheels

1169
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:55,480
and play a real game.

1170
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,820
Damn it.

1171
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:59,540
Play this M-rated game instead.

1172
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:04,840
Dark Sakura is going to step into the gaming vault and find a classic game of the week.

1173
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:09,860
Dark Sakura, what have you picked for this week's classic game of the week?

1174
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:17,300
Resident Evil Code Veronica, which was Biohazard Code Veronica.

1175
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,540
Basically this was the one that came out on Dreamcast.

1176
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:27,140
It was released in 2000 and it was the first Resident Evil title to show up on anything

1177
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,860
that Sony did not make.

1178
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:31,500
So this was cool.

1179
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:38,740
It focused on Claire, Chris and Steve, who we called Mini DiCaprio back in the day.

1180
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:43,100
Yeah, because he looked like a floppy haired Leonardo DiCaprio.

1181
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,780
And I also will say I am cheating because the only video I could find was the PlayStation

1182
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:47,780
2 version.

1183
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:50,140
So sorry, I am cheating a little bit.

1184
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:57,300
Well, that was the updated version.

1185
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:03,780
Came out, which was Code Veronica X, which had new cut scenes, a few graphical changes.

1186
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:09,220
It came out on the Dreamcast in Japan and PlayStation 2 worldwide.

1187
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:14,180
It also came out on GameCube and there's a high death remaster on Xbox 360 and PlayStation

1188
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:15,180
3.

1189
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:18,580
And that came out in 2011.

1190
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:26,780
Sony basically, it's really just more Resident Evil goodness.

1191
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:30,700
The camera is a little bit different instead of just following you around.

1192
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:36,220
It swings between different angles.

1193
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:43,220
And then you've got a couple weapons you can fire from a first person point of view, like

1194
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:46,380
the sniper rifle and the linear launcher.

1195
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:54,460
You can also play in first person mode using a minigame, you can unlock it.

1196
01:06:54,460 --> 01:07:03,980
One of the things that I liked is that this particular one also came out on Arcade as

1197
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:07,700
Gun Survivor 2, which I've gotten to play.

1198
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,620
It always made me think that the Dreamcast should have let you use the controller on

1199
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,740
the gun to play this one.

1200
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:18,860
And then shoot on screen in the first person mode, that would have been so much fun.

1201
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:23,700
But yeah, in this one you play as Claire Redfield and Chris Redfield, and you control them at

1202
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,540
different points of times.

1203
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:29,140
You start Claire for the first half and Chris for the second half.

1204
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:32,460
And Chris can use all of Claire's weapons and all that.

1205
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:37,200
It actually plays a lot more like, I'd say, Nemesis did.

1206
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,920
You can also unlock different secret characters too.

1207
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:45,880
You can play as Wesker, or you can play as Steve.

1208
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:51,040
And there's the battle game mode and all kinds of different stuff.

1209
01:07:51,040 --> 01:08:00,840
So as far as this one, there were, like I said, multiple rereleases.

1210
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:07,040
We had the Code Veronica X, we had the rereleases later.

1211
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:12,560
And then there was also Gun Survivor 2, which oddly enough my article here does not reference

1212
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,560
at all.

1213
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,560
It was great.

1214
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,480
Oh yeah, there is actually one about it.

1215
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,480
Okay.

1216
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:21,680
So it was adapted into Resident Evil Survivor 2 Code Veronica, which is Biohazard Gun Survivor

1217
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:26,680
2 Code Veronica in Japan, which is a first person shooter that you could play with the

1218
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:31,040
giant gun and it ran on the NAOMI hardware.

1219
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:37,140
It didn't really have much to do with the plot, but a lot of it played the same way.

1220
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:45,880
You could play it with the gun con on the Playstation 2, and it was just kind of a different

1221
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:46,880
interesting one.

1222
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,880
It was really fun.

1223
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:52,860
And then you got Resident Evil Dark Side Chronicles, which is a rail shooter game on Wii that was

1224
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:56,760
based off of Resident Evil 2 and Code Veronica.

1225
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:59,280
So overall it was a really good game.

1226
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:04,380
It really showed off the Dreamcast nicely and had one of the best intros in it.

1227
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:09,720
So I'd say this one's definitely a solid release for the Dreamcast.

1228
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,200
All right.

1229
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:15,240
And then of course if you missed it on Dreamcast, it's like everywhere else because the 360...

1230
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:20,340
I remember the 360 one and there's lots of videos out there of that one too, very, very

1231
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:23,920
crisp and high def for the last generation.

1232
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,520
There's no excuse to not check this game out.

1233
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,520
Not at all.

1234
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:35,040
Here it is, Resident Evil Code Veronica, the Dreamcast, Playstation 2, Xbox 360, classic

1235
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,960
game of the week.

1236
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,780
All right, we're going to take a quick break folks, but when we come back, there is plenty

1237
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,080
more show to come.

1238
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:45,840
Rapid fire news, your answers to the FUCL Question of the Week and more news, your phone

1239
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:50,320
calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1240
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:53,760
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1241
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:07,200
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday afternoon with episode

1242
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:12,040
number 608 of our show, August the 2nd of 2015, In Progress.

1243
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:16,280
Again, this is an early show, so you're turning into VOG Network thinking I was going to hear

1244
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:17,280
music right now.

1245
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:22,580
No, OLR is on a little bit early today, so Dark Soccer and I can indulge in a meat buffet

1246
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:27,620
later this evening with our dear friend, Victoria, who is moving on to sunnier adventures as

1247
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:30,420
if things could get any sunnier in Southern California.

1248
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:33,940
So I don't know about you, Dark Soccer, are you looking forward to meat, tasty, tasty

1249
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:34,940
meat?

1250
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:35,940
Mm, meata.

1251
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:40,520
We're talking about where we go to, there's this Brazilian place we love to go to where

1252
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:41,520
they have the big...

1253
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:42,520
Never been.

1254
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,740
Oh, that's right, you've never been.

1255
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:47,220
I've heard about the elusive creature known as Espituse.

1256
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:53,100
Well, then that's kind of a double great thing, is that not only do we get a chance

1257
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:56,940
to say goodbye to Victoria, who's texting me right now wondering if we're going to hang

1258
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:57,940
out before.

1259
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:02,100
I like how it all came down though, because I texted Victoria going, I'm sad that you're

1260
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,100
leaving, we should hang out.

1261
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:07,500
Because I was going to try to go yesterday, but she had to work or something.

1262
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:11,220
And so we talked about Sunday and she's like, well, if Rob does my move in the show, then

1263
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,220
we should hang out.

1264
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,820
I was like, we should go get dinner.

1265
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:15,780
And next thing I know, there's an event up.

1266
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:16,780
Yeah.

1267
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:20,220
Well, and I certainly wanted a chance to hang out with her too, so I'm kind of glad it worked

1268
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:21,220
out this way.

1269
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:24,620
And I'm sure the listeners understand once in a while, there's going to be a personal

1270
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:25,620
engagement.

1271
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,660
Once in a time, Victoria trumps OLR.

1272
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,660
Exactly.

1273
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:30,660
Exactly.

1274
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:34,140
And well, I mean, it's a dual win thing because we get asked once in a while from our overseas

1275
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:37,320
fans, when are you going to do a show that I don't have to stay up till 3 a.m. to listen

1276
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:38,320
to?

1277
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,660
So it's a win-win situation.

1278
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:44,700
So everybody wins, except those who forgot we were taping early today.

1279
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,500
So there you go.

1280
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:52,220
Uh, anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news after all we are here to talk about video

1281
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:53,220
gaming.

1282
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:56,860
Who knows Dark Soccer, if we have time today, maybe you and I, it would just depend on time.

1283
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:00,660
Maybe you and I will end up over in Japantown and we can go to that arcade and play the

1284
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,060
table flipping game.

1285
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,060
You know what?

1286
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:06,020
If we go there, I'd be playing, um, pop and music.

1287
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:07,020
Yeah.

1288
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,020
Pop and music is really fun.

1289
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:10,840
I like Taiko No Tachi- or Taiko No Tachi- so I can, I can beat the drum.

1290
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,840
You want to beat on the drum all day?

1291
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,840
Yeah.

1292
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,840
I don't want to work.

1293
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:18,000
I have some, a legitimate reason to go there because we need cutting boards since I have

1294
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,480
to go to Daiso for a bit.

1295
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,480
Nice.

1296
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,480
If we go.

1297
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,040
And hey, I need games for my Japanese PlayStation Vita.

1298
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,040
Remember that?

1299
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,040
My Heavensward Vita I got a couple?

1300
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,040
Oh yeah.

1301
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,040
I wanted to look.

1302
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,040
There's a movie.

1303
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,040
I was telling you about it.

1304
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,040
Except you can just go out to any store to pick up any game.

1305
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,440
Yeah, no, I know it's region free.

1306
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:35,320
But still, I feel like I need a Japanese game in my Japanese Vita.

1307
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:39,640
Well, I was also mentioning to you that like one of my favorite old, um, Japanese revenge

1308
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,080
movies is an actor's revenge.

1309
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:48,120
It was Yukino Joe Henge and, um, it's like seriously one of the best movies ever.

1310
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,980
And I want to see if I can find it on, uh, Blu-ray.

1311
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:53,320
So instead of going to Amazon for it.

1312
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:57,160
Even though it's probably way overpriced because this is exactly where you'd expect to find

1313
01:12:57,160 --> 01:12:58,160
something like this.

1314
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,040
I still need to get a copy of Spirited Away on Blu-ray because I guess a lot of the Miyazaki

1315
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,420
stuff got re-released on Blu-ray.

1316
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,200
So Spirited Away is one of my very favorites.

1317
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:08,760
I like looking around at, uh, Japan Video though.

1318
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:09,760
Yeah.

1319
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,760
So.

1320
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,760
Excellent.

1321
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,100
We could talk about travels and adventures all day long, but we'll spare you and get

1322
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:18,120
back into some video game chat.

1323
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,440
So let's do some rapid fire news.

1324
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,640
News that just, we just don't have time to talk about a long time, but we'll spend a

1325
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,640
little time on this.

1326
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:25,640
One last thing.

1327
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:26,900
Awesome news stories done quick.

1328
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,440
This is your trivia for the day.

1329
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,960
Apparently the announcer for Smash Brothers was the announcer for Bill Nye the Science

1330
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:33,960
Guy.

1331
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:34,960
I did not know that.

1332
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:35,960
Now you know.

1333
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:37,160
The more you know.

1334
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,160
All right.

1335
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,160
Anyway.

1336
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,160
Uh, news stories.

1337
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,160
Loki.

1338
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:46,680
Fallout 4 is not going to have mod support when it's launched, which is like a duh because

1339
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:52,440
most games when they're released don't have mod support because the tools aren't out there.

1340
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:56,880
And that is exactly why it's not going to be available when Fallout 4 is launched.

1341
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:57,880
Because guess what?

1342
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,780
They're not going to have the tools available to make mods.

1343
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:03,900
That doesn't mean I don't think you wouldn't see those on PC because people don't like

1344
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:04,900
to wait for tools.

1345
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,860
They'll just do whatever the fuck they want.

1346
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:11,980
But the official tools won't be made available until later on.

1347
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,280
So don't be disappointed.

1348
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,820
They will come eventually.

1349
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:21,940
And along with that, we've also got a pretty cool expansion coming out for Don't Starve.

1350
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,880
Shipwrecked.

1351
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,480
And I really need to play this game.

1352
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,000
I have it installed on my Playstation 4 and I just haven't gotten around to it yet.

1353
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,100
It's fun.

1354
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,700
But it is coming out later this fall.

1355
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:40,260
It's going to have new playable areas, characters, seasonal effects, creatures, and they said

1356
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,600
it's described as a sea-bound journey.

1357
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,540
So I guess I'll have to check it out when it comes out.

1358
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:54,580
And then last but not least, Terraria is going to be coming out to the Wii U.

1359
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:55,580
And guess what?

1360
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:58,180
It's got local and online multiplayer.

1361
01:14:58,180 --> 01:14:59,180
Online multiplayer?

1362
01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:02,620
Well, not a Wii U game.

1363
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:05,500
It's only something you would see from a third party.

1364
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,580
Oh, it is a third party.

1365
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:12,700
Also the 3DS version of the game will be coming out shortly as well.

1366
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:20,140
And that one though only supports up to four player local multiplayer.

1367
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,140
That's kind of cool though.

1368
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:22,540
At least it has some multiplayer.

1369
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:26,700
Hopefully they'll be getting all those nice free updates that they do for the game.

1370
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:30,380
Well, let's move on and talk about Rare Replay.

1371
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:34,380
I am very excited about this collection that's coming out because there's so many great games

1372
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:35,380
in it.

1373
01:15:35,380 --> 01:15:38,100
Although really all I need is Snake, Rattle, and Roll.

1374
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:41,460
Is there anything else that anybody actually wants to play in this collection?

1375
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,780
It's Snake, Rattle, and Roll and a bunch of other shit.

1376
01:15:43,780 --> 01:15:48,580
Well, Rare Replay is coming out and of course it has 30 games from Rare's history in it.

1377
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,180
I suppose RC Pro-Am.

1378
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:53,140
I would understand if that's one that you're looking forward to as well.

1379
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:57,040
However, you know some games got left out because Rare made more than 30 games and some

1380
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:58,060
games got left out.

1381
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,660
You know, like Wizards and Warriors for example.

1382
01:16:00,660 --> 01:16:02,900
So you never know though.

1383
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:07,660
During a Twitch live stream, James Thomas from Rare said that cutting down the list

1384
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:09,540
to just 30 was pretty hard.

1385
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,300
And there's a chance that DLC could happen for more.

1386
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,580
Which of course, you would think of course something like that's going to happen.

1387
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:17,580
But here's the quote.

1388
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,340
There's a wealth of titles that we could dip into.

1389
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:22,020
A huge heritage beyond the 30 that we chose.

1390
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:24,860
But that's what made choosing the 30 so hard in the first place.

1391
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:27,260
We had to put aside our personal preferences.

1392
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,260
We hope we've done that.

1393
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,300
But you never know.

1394
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,500
There could be space for more.

1395
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:33,700
Dun dun dun.

1396
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:36,700
Anyhow on a serious note, Diablo 3.

1397
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,620
You know I love that game.

1398
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:41,180
I haven't played it in a little while.

1399
01:16:41,180 --> 01:16:43,840
But I know there's a new big patch on its way for it.

1400
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,760
But this was really cool in Diablo 3 what they did.

1401
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:52,500
There's an update for Diablo 3 that's going to be paying tribute to Kevin Kani Griffith

1402
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:55,460
who was an artist at Blizzard who passed away.

1403
01:16:55,460 --> 01:17:02,580
Unfortunately in October of 2014, Kevin Griffith passed away from a rare form of cancer known

1404
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,980
as ASPS.

1405
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:10,780
So Kani's cube is actually, I did not realize that, the big cube that is going to be in

1406
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:12,400
the game is actually named after him.

1407
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,300
So I knew that this was a huge part of the patch.

1408
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,000
I did not realize that it was actually in memory of this guy.

1409
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
That's pretty cool.

1410
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,040
And it's going to be like the horror dick cube in Diablo 2.

1411
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,420
This is going to be a game changer.

1412
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:31,700
So that's a very great way to memorialize someone that they all respected there at Blizzard.

1413
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,700
Last but not least, a new Splatfest.

1414
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:37,500
I know a lot of you guys love Splatfest.

1415
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:39,340
And of course, what teams?

1416
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:42,140
You have to know what teams are going to face off against each other because what?

1417
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,660
We had cats and dogs, right?

1418
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:44,820
That was a huge one.

1419
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:48,860
And then of course we had water slides and roller coasters, right?

1420
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,860
Who won that one?

1421
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:50,860
Roller coasters of course.

1422
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:51,860
They had to win.

1423
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:52,860
Of course.

1424
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:53,860
They had to win that one.

1425
01:17:53,860 --> 01:17:55,100
Well, this one's interesting.

1426
01:17:55,100 --> 01:18:02,260
Coming up Nintendo of America on 8-7 from 9 p.m. Pacific through 8-8 at 9 p.m. Pacific

1427
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:06,620
we'll be doing marshmallows versus hot dogs.

1428
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:07,620
Of course hot dogs.

1429
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:08,620
Hot dogs.

1430
01:18:08,620 --> 01:18:10,900
Because marshmallows are disgusting.

1431
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:11,900
Here's the thing though.

1432
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,780
My favorite flavor of...

1433
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,460
Try not to get sick, Darkseidro, but I have to say it.

1434
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:19,060
My favorite flavor of Jelly Belly is the toast of marshmallow.

1435
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:21,060
I love it.

1436
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,780
There's no accounting for taste.

1437
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:23,780
So good.

1438
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:24,780
I'll tell you what.

1439
01:18:24,780 --> 01:18:31,140
I really don't mind that flavor, but I think marshmallows themselves, the texture and the

1440
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:37,860
gooey and it's like eating someone's body refuse.

1441
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:42,420
Not to be triggering, but can you stand it if it's melted like cream?

1442
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:43,420
Is that okay?

1443
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:44,420
No.

1444
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,420
I hate the taste.

1445
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:46,420
I hate the texture.

1446
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:50,620
The only time I can eat them is when they've been burned to a crisp and all of the gooeyness

1447
01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:53,460
is now this crispy vanilla flavored goodness.

1448
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:57,420
Well, to be fair, the whole reason they chose these two, of course, is they want to know

1449
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:00,380
what you'd rather roast over a campfire.

1450
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,380
My enemies.

1451
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:03,860
Well, you can do that in Splatoon.

1452
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:04,940
There you go.

1453
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:09,740
You can, you can splatter them with the blood of your enemies.

1454
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,740
Oh boy.

1455
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:13,460
I thought I heard about other...

1456
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:19,900
They should have just done, you know, which would you rather have, you know, cannibalism

1457
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:20,900
or calamari?

1458
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:21,900
Oh, Lord.

1459
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:28,020
Um, oh yeah, there are different ones too.

1460
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:30,140
So Europe gets a completely different one.

1461
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,860
So you know what Europe gets?

1462
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,580
This one's, this was kind of stupid.

1463
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:34,580
I'm sorry, Europe.

1464
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:35,940
I know this is your day today.

1465
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:39,900
Well damn, if that's stupid compared to, you know, marshmallows and hot dogs.

1466
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,060
This is even worse than marshmallows versus hot dogs.

1467
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,380
You ready for this?

1468
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:46,220
North pole versus South pole.

1469
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:47,540
Really?

1470
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:52,700
I would pick South pole because that's the only one that actually exists.

1471
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:57,580
You know, which I think would be a fun one would be Marmite versus Vegemite.

1472
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:58,980
Maybe they're both gross.

1473
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:02,380
Why don't you send that over to Nintendo of Australia?

1474
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,060
It could be very international.

1475
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:08,780
I vote for option three stripper pole.

1476
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:10,940
I believe stripper pole versus lap dance.

1477
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:14,540
Japan was having one as well that I'm saying this off the top of my head.

1478
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:18,740
I think it was milk tea and lemon tea.

1479
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:19,740
Milk tea.

1480
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:20,740
I see.

1481
01:20:20,740 --> 01:20:21,740
But I like, I like lemon tea.

1482
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:24,180
Milk tea is milk tea makes me gassy.

1483
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:30,540
I'm sensing, I'm sensing a listless perhaps.

1484
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:31,540
What do we do?

1485
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:32,540
We did that.

1486
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:33,540
Didn't we?

1487
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,000
Oh no, it was a match game question.

1488
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,180
Remember when we did match game because, uh, uh, Alan said something really nasty for one

1489
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:40,180
of his answers.

1490
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:46,340
Something like cream pie versus bukkake or something really nasty.

1491
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,700
All out versus cow pie.

1492
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:54,900
Uh, remember I did, um, Cylon occupied Caprica versus non-silon occupied Caprica.

1493
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:55,900
Remember?

1494
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:58,540
Oh, now that that's what I want to see.

1495
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:00,020
Humans versus Cylons.

1496
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:01,020
Get on it, Nintendo.

1497
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:04,940
I just don't think it's relevant anymore.

1498
01:21:04,940 --> 01:21:05,940
What?

1499
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:06,940
How dare you?

1500
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:07,940
Yes.

1501
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:09,260
Dark Galactica will always be relevant.

1502
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:17,620
I don't care if it's been 10 years, always, anyway, moving on, so much for rapid fire

1503
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:18,620
news.

1504
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:21,820
Uh, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us for rapid fire news?

1505
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:24,980
Well, um, we have some news about Five Nights at Freddy's movie.

1506
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:28,220
I just keep looking at this picture and I think I want it for my desktop.

1507
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:31,580
Um, but oh, there's a nice picture of Chica's teeth.

1508
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:33,660
Are you going to drag me to see the Five Nights movie?

1509
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:34,660
Hell yeah.

1510
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:39,860
I kind of want to see it and I just, you know, I'm not a huge, so they have, um, Gil

1511
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:45,060
Keenan who is actually, um, on the Poltergeist remake is a director and co-writer, which

1512
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:49,620
honestly enough, the, um, I'm very interested in the Poltergeist remake because Poltergeist

1513
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:52,140
is like my favorite movie is my favorite kids movie.

1514
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:55,180
I heard it wasn't offensively bad as far as remakes go.

1515
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,300
Did it already come out?

1516
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:57,300
That's kind of a compliment.

1517
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:58,300
Yeah.

1518
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,300
Didn't it?

1519
01:21:59,300 --> 01:22:00,300
I thought, I thought it did.

1520
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,300
Cause I didn't hear anything about it.

1521
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:02,300
I could be wrong.

1522
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,300
Chatters, do you know?

1523
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,300
Cause I don't follow movies as well.

1524
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:11,380
Anyway, um, it's going to be something that's supposed to be loyal to, you know, loyal to

1525
01:22:11,380 --> 01:22:17,820
the story for the fans, but not like, you know, Wes Craven, you know, quality.

1526
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:25,700
And then, um, there's a story about, uh, Squeenix going out with Yasunori Mitsuda, um, to, uh,

1527
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:29,220
do a 20th anniversary Chrono Trigger, uh, album.

1528
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,940
So, uh, I'm actually super excited about that.

1529
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,740
And now the name of it, and I'm going to have to read it a little slowly cause it's really

1530
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:43,460
is, um, Haruka Naruto Kinoka Nata He is really long.

1531
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:50,460
The far beyond the distant time anyway, or which would be too far away times.

1532
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:55,700
So, uh, albums with new arrangements, um, for Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross.

1533
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:59,660
So very excited about that.

1534
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:02,220
I wonder if I could actually say that fast, but I'm not going to try.

1535
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:07,740
Um, also Final Fantasy Explorers is going to be coming out to the 3DS, um, on January

1536
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:18,420
26th, 2016, which is basically Crystals and War and Planet Power and Monster Hunting.

1537
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:21,420
So all the Final Fantasies.

1538
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:27,140
Well it's, I say that because it's Final Fantasies franchise's answer to Monster Hunter.

1539
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:28,940
It plays a lot like a Monster Hunter game.

1540
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:33,100
Uh, Shane has it on the Japanese 3DS cause it's been out in Japan and I wondered where

1541
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,980
the hell it was at E3, but I guess that answers that.

1542
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:38,060
They were just sitting on it as a January game.

1543
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,340
So that's cool.

1544
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,620
I'm happy we're getting it.

1545
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:44,140
So all right, there it is.

1546
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:46,180
Your rapid fire news.

1547
01:23:46,180 --> 01:23:50,020
Fifth Dream says the Blu-ray is out already for Poltergeist.

1548
01:23:50,020 --> 01:23:51,020
I had no idea.

1549
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:53,540
I knew it was out in theaters or I was pretty convinced.

1550
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:58,580
I kind of forgot about keeping up with it cause I mean, I loved the first one.

1551
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:01,060
But I guess it means I have to get the Blu-ray and watch it.

1552
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:03,540
Oh no, Fifth Dream says he was looking at the wrong one, but soon.

1553
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:06,140
Well yeah, I have the Blu-ray of the original.

1554
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:10,460
The third one used to give me freaking nightmares because of the mirrors.

1555
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:12,180
I just like the little gypsy lady.

1556
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:13,180
She's my favorite.

1557
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,620
That was Zelda Rubinstein.

1558
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:15,660
That's it, yeah.

1559
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:21,620
And Zelda Rubinstein was also in the Teen Witch, which was a fun, bad movie.

1560
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:25,900
Fifth Dream says September 20th for the Blu-ray.

1561
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:27,820
So it's already out of the theaters then, well shit.

1562
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:29,860
Check the second run theaters.

1563
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:33,460
I was gonna say, yeah, check Sunrise or something like that.

1564
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,460
You never know.

1565
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:35,460
Movie day!

1566
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:36,460
OLR movie day.

1567
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:37,460
We're gonna go see Poltergeist.

1568
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,020
Wait, why am I volunteering to see a scary movie?

1569
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:40,020
Nevermind.

1570
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:41,020
Yay, Rob!

1571
01:24:41,020 --> 01:24:42,900
Dark Soccer and Loki could go without Rob.

1572
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,260
Oh yeah, I only go if there's cheesecake involved.

1573
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:46,900
Okay, there'll be cheesecake involved.

1574
01:24:46,900 --> 01:24:47,900
Yes!

1575
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,020
Can you like sneak cheesecake into the theater?

1576
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:52,060
I think they sell cheesecake bites.

1577
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,620
I'm pretty sure is like a movie smell.

1578
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:55,060
Oh, it came out May 22nd.

1579
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:56,460
This should still be running.

1580
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,100
Yeah, you never know.

1581
01:24:58,100 --> 01:24:59,100
Oh.

1582
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,100
Alright.

1583
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:03,220
Speaking of Poltergeist, no I've got nothing.

1584
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:06,740
We're gonna go to the Fookle Question of the Week.

1585
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:10,340
Every week we check our Facebook and our Google Plus fan communities.

1586
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:13,580
We ask a question and we read some of our favorite answers here on the show.

1587
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:27,460
This week we asked our listeners about the Loot Crate thing, the End Box.

1588
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:31,900
It looks as though Nintendo may launch a Loot Crate rival of sorts.

1589
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:35,660
Would you be interested in a mystery box full of gaming-related surprises from Nintendo

1590
01:25:35,660 --> 01:25:36,660
every month?

1591
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:42,220
If not Nintendo, is there another gaming company or franchise you'd like to get random treats

1592
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:43,940
from every month?

1593
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:46,660
So let's go to Facebook and see who answered us over there.

1594
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:48,460
We have a few answers.

1595
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:51,180
The off hour worked out for getting more answers this week.

1596
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:57,980
Fabrice from Belgium I think is starting us off tonight saying a Sega Loot Crate naturally,

1597
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:01,300
although the Loot Crates really seem hit or miss.

1598
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:05,700
Every month you would just get a recycled Master System game over and over again because

1599
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,460
that's what Sega's business is these days.

1600
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:08,980
That was a little bit of reading.

1601
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:11,860
Sonic with legs that keep getting longer and longer and longer.

1602
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:15,100
And more bandages.

1603
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,780
Are you ready to make some crazy money?

1604
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:22,620
Tech 2030 says if this was a few years ago I would have jumped on something like this.

1605
01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:25,900
Lately I've been pretty minimalistic when it comes to video games.

1606
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:31,580
Hardly any physical games, no memorabilia, only one home console and one handheld.

1607
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:37,020
Cutting back, that's like an Amish gamer's lifestyle right there.

1608
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,580
Andy R says I'm not into Loot Crate in general.

1609
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:43,980
I love physical goods like figures and physical games but I barely have enough room for the

1610
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:44,980
stuff I buy.

1611
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:50,180
I don't need what seems like a mess of overstocked junk to add even more clutter and that'll

1612
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:53,900
probably extend to anything Nintendo tries in this space.

1613
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:57,780
Silent Tom says I would love to get random goodies every month from the Street Fighter

1614
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:01,180
franchise and would love to get monthly for The Legend of Zelda.

1615
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:04,220
I would be so broke but it would be so worth it.

1616
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:08,260
You know a fucking amiibo is going to be in these fucking end boxes.

1617
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,740
There's going to be a random fucking amiibo or those Animal Crossing cards.

1618
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:14,300
There's going to be things like that in these stinking boxes.

1619
01:27:14,300 --> 01:27:18,500
Hey anyway, Critical Myth says it depends on whether the service sticks to the original

1620
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:24,100
randomness of Loot Crate or takes after the newer services that have taken it a step further

1621
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:27,460
into more targeted, better selections.

1622
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:31,860
Dark Tetsuya says I've lost count of the number of Nintendo themed t-shirts I own so sure,

1623
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:32,860
sign me up.

1624
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:36,700
I do agree there ought to be a favorite franchises option somewhere so you're guaranteed the

1625
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:38,780
stuff you like most.

1626
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:43,180
Joda Star replied and said I think of all these subscription boxes are a cool idea but

1627
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:45,940
I prefer to find my own memorabilia.

1628
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:49,060
I would maybe consider a Star Wars box.

1629
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:53,020
Well with the movie coming out you never know, everybody's going to want to get in on Star

1630
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,020
Wars fever.

1631
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:57,900
It's that hype, that hype train is going to roll all the way through December and on into

1632
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,100
the following movies.

1633
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:04,620
William Murderface says I would like to see a blizzard service where you could get physical

1634
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:05,620
memorabilia.

1635
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:09,660
A plushy battle cruiser would be awesome and digital goodies, maybe even some skins or

1636
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:10,660
some mounts.

1637
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:11,660
That's a really good idea.

1638
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:15,340
You know Blizzard has a whole cult of fans, that's something they could start, give a

1639
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:21,380
little bit of that bag that you get at Blizzcon throughout the year.

1640
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:25,380
And lastly on Facebook, Justin H says if I could pick a specific developer it would have

1641
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,120
to be BioWare.

1642
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:30,900
Star Wars, Mass Effect and Dragon Age would be all I ever need.

1643
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:35,100
Unfortunately space for goodies is starting to get limited after having my first child

1644
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:39,860
and I would hate to end up as the Lego movie dad who has so much awesome stuff and won't

1645
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:43,900
let his kid play with any of it.

1646
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:44,900
I love it.

1647
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:49,820
Although I think Dark Soccer might agree with you there, just a hunch on the BioWare loot

1648
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:51,060
crate might be something.

1649
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,460
I'd be down for that.

1650
01:28:52,460 --> 01:28:53,900
I think so too.

1651
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:57,860
That was not something I realized I wanted until just now.

1652
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:01,700
I would love a Lego loot crate if it wasn't so expensive.

1653
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:02,700
Right?

1654
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,660
Because that shit is expensive.

1655
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:09,340
Well we have a couple, sorry Fifth Dream in chat I have to read this, Fifth Dream in chat

1656
01:29:09,340 --> 01:29:16,020
says Star Wars box, 1 Vader eraser, 14 Jar Jar stickers, and a piece of hairy Chewbacca

1657
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,020
gum.

1658
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:21,160
Love it.

1659
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:25,260
We do have some answers over on Google Plus though, hey despite the news that apparently

1660
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:30,740
Google Plus is, everybody is saying rest in peace you're dead, buy Google Plus, I still

1661
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,460
see people using it and maybe that's because I play Ingress and that's how Ingress players

1662
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,500
talk to each other is all through Google Plus.

1663
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:41,540
It's really only for YouTube that they're not going to force you to make a Google Plus

1664
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:42,540
account for.

1665
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:49,180
Yeah so I don't know but hey until people stop using it I can plan on continuing to

1666
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:51,140
post the question on Google Plus.

1667
01:29:51,140 --> 01:29:54,460
It's an easy copy paste job.

1668
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:58,220
Redertainment says there's an independent record store out here called Gray Whale that

1669
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:03,140
buys, sells, and trades video games, music, DVDs, vinyl, and other sort of things.

1670
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:05,980
I'd like to see a Gray Whale loot crate type of thing.

1671
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:07,940
So it sounds like Dimple for us locally.

1672
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:10,140
They are exactly like Dimple.

1673
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:15,180
It would be a great way for them to get rid of all the wrestling DVDs people trade in.

1674
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:20,420
Oh god that's how they could get rid of like the 20,000 copies of you know old Madden games

1675
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:21,420
that come through the store.

1676
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:23,260
That would be garbage then.

1677
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:26,420
Just give people random garbage when they purchase them.

1678
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:29,460
But when it's in a mystery box and you can put it on YouTube locally.

1679
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:33,460
I remember like there was one time there was a guy that was buying a bunch of junk that

1680
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:38,660
was in our warehouse and one of the things he ended up buying was it was literally like

1681
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:44,540
49 copies of like the original Xbox like Madden, it's like a old ass Madden game.

1682
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:47,580
Madden like 2005 or I don't even remember what it was.

1683
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:50,940
It's just some old ass Madden game that there was just a ton of copies of.

1684
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:54,780
I feel like as an art project because those things have only got to cost like what one

1685
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:56,120
or two bucks a pop.

1686
01:30:56,120 --> 01:31:00,620
As an art project we should buy like a bunch of them and build a sculpture out of old Madden

1687
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:01,620
games.

1688
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:02,620
I don't know.

1689
01:31:02,620 --> 01:31:03,620
Maybe it's...

1690
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:04,620
Create Madden out of Madden.

1691
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:05,620
Yes.

1692
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:07,420
Create Madden out of Madden.

1693
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:08,420
I love it.

1694
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:09,420
All right.

1695
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:14,100
And then lastly, Act Def says this sounds like a cool thing though I would also be down

1696
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:16,280
with having a Pokemon Center loot crate.

1697
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:18,420
They have a lot of cool merchandise.

1698
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:20,300
So something maybe targeted a little bit.

1699
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:23,460
Well don't worry when they release all of those Pokemon amiibo because there's going

1700
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:24,500
to be hundreds of them.

1701
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,660
I'm sure that they can include a few in the loot crates.

1702
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:27,980
There you go.

1703
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:30,120
All those extra boxes.

1704
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:33,260
All the little like Pokemon that nobody wants.

1705
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:34,640
All the little like...

1706
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:37,840
I can't even think of the names off the top of my head but like I remember when Burger

1707
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,920
King did the Pokemon toys and like half of them were that little thing.

1708
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,660
It looked like a turd and it was like a cave thing.

1709
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:45,660
It looked like a poop.

1710
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:46,660
It was a poop-ymon.

1711
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:47,660
Aw dookie.

1712
01:31:47,660 --> 01:31:55,340
Dookie you stench.

1713
01:31:55,340 --> 01:31:56,340
It's super offensive.

1714
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:57,340
All right.

1715
01:31:57,340 --> 01:31:58,340
Anyway.

1716
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:59,340
There you go.

1717
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:02,180
That's it for the Frugal Question of the Week.

1718
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:05,420
So let's get back into some more news and of course in just a little while your phone

1719
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:10,260
calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1720
01:32:10,260 --> 01:32:11,260
All one word.

1721
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:12,260
Loki.

1722
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:13,260
All right.

1723
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:17,860
So you know PlayStation Plus has been a pretty good program they've had going where you get

1724
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:22,420
lots of nice games and stuff for free and now you may have a little bit of a say in

1725
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:23,420
that.

1726
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:30,100
Apparently they are going to be opening up voting for members to pick maybe the next

1727
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:33,900
games that will be part of the instant game collection.

1728
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:40,620
I guess they will be once the game has been support or whatever game gets the most support

1729
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:46,300
it will be automatically added to the future month's lineup.

1730
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:53,820
So apparently it says for the first vote the titles that aren't selected will be available

1731
01:32:53,820 --> 01:32:54,820
at a member's discount.

1732
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:59,060
That's kind of neat I guess.

1733
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:00,940
Where are the titles though is what I want to know.

1734
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:04,660
Yeah I want to know what are we all talking about like which ones are we going to get

1735
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,420
to really vote for.

1736
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:08,780
Aw man, Knack.

1737
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:12,860
Well actually I'm surprised Knack still hasn't shown up as a PlayStation Plus game.

1738
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:18,460
I kind of assumed that would have happened by now but it still hasn't so kind of interesting.

1739
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:22,420
But you know I mean PlayStation Plus as it is is already a great deal.

1740
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:27,500
I mean there's so many games I really think maybe wouldn't have been as big if it wasn't

1741
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:30,660
for PlayStation Plus and I think Rocket League is a great example of that.

1742
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:36,860
I still need to try out Injustice Gods Among Us which I downloaded like ages ago.

1743
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:40,780
Yeah that was a lot of fun that's a good one.

1744
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:46,980
Well get this I mean this is the game that refuses to die and you can take that in many

1745
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:47,980
different ways.

1746
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:55,820
P.T. that's right Silent Hills the playable trailer P.T. is back sort of.

1747
01:33:55,820 --> 01:34:02,100
Well here's the thing Konami might have erased it from the store but this developer and I'm

1748
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:08,940
sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name but Farhan Qureshi recreated P.T. in Unity for

1749
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:13,380
the PC and he's releasing it for free.

1750
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:17,860
Qureshi is an aspiring game developer living in Calgary, Alberta.

1751
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:21,320
Well I don't know if Konami is going to necessarily throw you a job but hopefully somebody else

1752
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:23,220
will because it's pretty impressive.

1753
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:29,140
Qureshi recreated P.T. to showcase it at a workshop that he's going to be teaching.

1754
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:32,980
It's called Punity with the P and the T capitalized.

1755
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:33,980
For the record.

1756
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:34,980
Get it?

1757
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:35,980
P.Unity.

1758
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:36,980
Not just PC.

1759
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:37,980
Oh.

1760
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:38,980
Mac and Linux as well.

1761
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:39,980
Nice.

1762
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:40,980
Oh it's only mentioned here on PC that's great.

1763
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:44,020
Well that makes sense too because it's Unity it could be easily ported to other platforms

1764
01:34:44,020 --> 01:34:45,140
so hooray.

1765
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:50,140
You can actually download that for free and apparently the internet pretty happy with

1766
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:51,140
that.

1767
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:56,540
It's not apparently a 100% recreation but you know it's obviously probably doesn't have

1768
01:34:56,540 --> 01:35:00,700
the trailer at the end or any of that stuff but still that's pretty awesome.

1769
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:01,700
Get it while you can.

1770
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:05,720
I mean it's on the internet so it's never going to disappear now but I'm sure come Monday

1771
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:10,980
Konami will be sending a cease and desist but at the same time what does the company

1772
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:11,980
have to lose?

1773
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:13,980
I mean they're not putting it out there anymore.

1774
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:15,760
The game's out there for free.

1775
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:21,760
This guy's not trying to charge for it so I say let it be but I have a feeling Konami

1776
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,800
will sue.

1777
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:24,800
Download it before.

1778
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,920
So I mean it's on the internet now.

1779
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:30,040
It's on torrent sites every I mean it's it's a done deal.

1780
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:32,220
Konami cannot erase this at this point.

1781
01:35:32,220 --> 01:35:33,880
So there you go.

1782
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:34,880
Check that out.

1783
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:35,880
I think that's really cool.

1784
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:38,520
I would like to just check it out just to see maybe like what the differences are.

1785
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,120
Oh God is that going to have to be a live stream.

1786
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:41,120
Oh God oh God oh God.

1787
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,360
That would be awesome.

1788
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,240
I'm downloading it from my Mac right now.

1789
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,160
Nice nice.

1790
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:47,160
All right.

1791
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:51,920
Well while you download check out the next news story as well there Sakura.

1792
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,680
Well you know we've been going on for what is it now a couple of years now about the

1793
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:57,680
whole net neutrality thing.

1794
01:35:57,680 --> 01:36:03,640
Well ISPs are now saying that their information service and not telecommunications services.

1795
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:10,960
They've filed a 95 page brief at the U.S. Court of Appeals to try to make see that they're

1796
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:17,740
not a I would say included with any of the legislation gone against them for right now.

1797
01:36:17,740 --> 01:36:23,680
So one of the things that it says on there is that no matter how many computer mediated

1798
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:28,820
features the FCC may sweep under the rug the inescapable core of the Internet access is

1799
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:34,020
a service that uses computer processing to enable consumers to retrieve files from the

1800
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:35,380
World Wide Web.

1801
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:41,780
People still use that word and browse their contents and thus offers the capability for

1802
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:45,860
acquiring retrieving and utilizing information.

1803
01:36:45,860 --> 01:36:49,180
Yeah I think they're just trying to still stiff people for money.

1804
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:54,220
So let's wait for that one to fail shall we.

1805
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:57,740
This here's the thing that's kind of ironic though where you know they're trying to call

1806
01:36:57,740 --> 01:37:04,640
themselves an information service but doesn't Comcast actually sell a phone line that uses

1807
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:08,300
your Internet like and that's part of their whole bundle thing and I hate because like

1808
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:11,060
I mean sorry but who needs a landline anymore.

1809
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:14,920
Like at least from my perspective maybe other people you need home security now because

1810
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:17,480
that's the next thing that they're including with it.

1811
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:21,660
OK but at least that sounds like so and again that uses the Internet right.

1812
01:37:21,660 --> 01:37:26,160
It just sends you it takes all the video is the information service beams it through.

1813
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:28,920
Yeah it's it's it's telecommunications.

1814
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:32,680
It seems weird to me because they're using a phone line through the Internet and trying

1815
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:33,680
to say that it's not it.

1816
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:36,160
Well I'm picking on Comcast but a lot of companies do this.

1817
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:37,160
It's stupid.

1818
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:38,160
Do you have a PC.

1819
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:39,160
Yes.

1820
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:41,760
Is there a PC that's remotely somewhere out there in another part of the world.

1821
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:42,760
Yes.

1822
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:43,760
Are they communicating with each other.

1823
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,640
It's fucking communication.

1824
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:49,200
It's communicating over you.

1825
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,480
You should be a lawyer like a stupid.

1826
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,480
It's stupid.

1827
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:57,640
It's just like this is about as dumb as when fucking Sony said hey guess what the PlayStation

1828
01:37:57,640 --> 01:37:58,640
3.

1829
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,640
It's a computer.

1830
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,440
It's not a game console.

1831
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:06,320
It's a computer because we don't play pair taxes or some shit like that.

1832
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:12,040
It's a fucking game console is because you can put Linux on it doesn't make it anymore.

1833
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:17,120
So it's definitely not a computer now just like rumble isn't a feature.

1834
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,120
That's last gen.

1835
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:19,120
Who needs rumble.

1836
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:22,960
Entertainment and chat over at live.vog network dot com says Loki should be a judge.

1837
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,360
I think I kind of agree with that.

1838
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:34,600
Loki I would watch a judge Loki show well I want to see receipts and that I've seen

1839
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:35,600
those receipts.

1840
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,600
I don't give a shit.

1841
01:38:36,600 --> 01:38:43,560
I'm still filing the answer dark dark Tetsuya in our chat room says Loki O.L.R.'s ace attorney.

1842
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:47,640
There you go objection anyway.

1843
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:51,520
Now quickly before we get into Loki's next story I did want to mention the chat room

1844
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:55,720
was saying where can they get that punity demo demo because I didn't even give out the

1845
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,720
URL.

1846
01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:00,480
I'm sorry I didn't give it out because it's a long URL so I can't really read it but you

1847
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,920
can check out the guy's website.

1848
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:08,640
It's the dash outline dot com and then there's slash portfolio slash punity dash p t dash

1849
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:09,800
hallway dash recreation.

1850
01:39:09,800 --> 01:39:15,800
I really think you should probably just Google p t hallway recreation PC unity or punity

1851
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,480
although well I don't know you might get a lot of other stuff with that word but hopefully

1852
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:23,480
put a link in the chat room and probably yes I did put a link in chat.

1853
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:27,340
So hopefully if you're listening to this on the podcast feed I'm sure it's it's on a lot

1854
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:32,420
of gaming news sites out there because obviously people love p t and wanted to play Silent

1855
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:37,460
Hills but L.O.L. oops anyhow back in some other news Loki.

1856
01:39:37,460 --> 01:39:42,420
So you may remember we talked about a story about harebrained schemes the company that

1857
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:48,540
brought out shadow run out for PC not too long ago they're talking about hey you know

1858
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:55,560
what we're thinking about going back into some of the older I.P.s that Jordan Weisman

1859
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:59,800
owns and maybe bringing those back and everyone's like oh my goodness what could that be could

1860
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:03,880
it be cringe of the skies or battle tech well it's going to be battle tech and they're going

1861
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:06,360
to be launching a new kickstarter for battle tech.

1862
01:40:06,360 --> 01:40:11,960
It's going to be a turn based game and that's going to be coming to kickstarter later this

1863
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:19,840
year I am looking forward to that ironically I did back shadow run I have shadow run and

1864
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:23,320
much like about ninety nine percent of the games on my steam library I have not played

1865
01:40:23,320 --> 01:40:30,560
shadowrun I mean I even have the expansion I also have shadowrun online and I still have

1866
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:36,240
not played that either so I am a terrible consumer no you're a great consumer great

1867
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:40,240
you buy shit and then you don't even use it well no they would probably have a gym membership

1868
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:44,720
because that's exactly the type of customer they want yeah I don't have a gym membership

1869
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:52,080
you know don't get one all right Loki maybe this is another game you'll add to your library

1870
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:56,120
although knowing you you probably won't even let this touch your computer it is finally

1871
01:40:56,120 --> 01:41:02,560
happening you guys angry birds 2 is coming and here's the thing you're probably thinking

1872
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:07,140
to yourself hasn't there already been angry birds 2 believe it or not no there's been

1873
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:13,680
angry birds star wars transformers Rio apparently there was even a mario kart angry bird yeah

1874
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:17,960
there was Rio because wasn't that a movie or something yes Rio was a movie I don't know

1875
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:25,600
but now angry birds 2 I think the game would have been much better if Duran Duran had done

1876
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:30,240
the soundtrack I think so too Duran Duran makes everything better well maybe Duran Duran

1877
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:35,920
will lend the reflex to angry birds 2 well all I need to know is this game is not by

1878
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:40,480
King good okay cool then I don't know it's Rovio oh I have no problem with Rovio there

1879
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:44,880
it is Rovio is not evil here's the thing you're still doing you're still flinging the birds

1880
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:52,400
the pigs but now we've got multi-stage levels boss piggy battles and so on Rovio by the

1881
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:57,280
way they've had some financial difficulties lately so kind of not a surprise that angry

1882
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:01,520
birds 2 is coming but here's here's my question are people going to care because I really

1883
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:06,120
think with a lot of these phone games a lot of them are very flash-in-the-pan sorts of

1884
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:11,200
things that lightning doesn't tend to strike twice glad you asked that what the what's

1885
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:14,960
the flappy bird guy doing now well probably rolling in his piles of money that he never

1886
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:20,080
expected to make but I mean I mean and then what Zinga spent all that money to buy draw

1887
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:26,240
something and nobody fucking plays that anymore so it's like really I was thinking for a little

1888
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:30,640
I'm back to words with friends though most people I know quit when Zinga bought them

1889
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:34,640
like everybody was like I'm out what were you gonna say Logie I said I'm glad you were

1890
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:39,560
asking about how how they would respond to that well boy anger birds 2 was downloaded

1891
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:49,280
one million times in the half a day wow so apparently pretty well I guess so so much

1892
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:57,080
for what I was thinking so I guess Dark Sakura is suggesting that perhaps for Angry Birds

1893
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:06,960
2 Rio they could have Duran Duran you know who doesn't want to knock over some pigs to

1894
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:13,440
this this would be like the best this is like boss battle music right here well Angry Birds

1895
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:18,400
2 does feature boss pigs exactly that's what I'm singing you know it's funny though Dan didn't

1896
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:23,840
realize that Duran Duran was named after the Barbarella movie oh yeah because of dr. Duran

1897
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:29,640
Duran yeah didn't they actually have a song called Barbara electro Barbarella later on it's like one

1898
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:34,520
of the later songs that came out was like their comeback song or something like that no in the 90

1899
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:44,680
they did well that wasn't the same album in the 90s that did come undone and no let your

1900
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:50,520
Barbarella was before that and then they did the the whole revival in the 90s but anyway 80s 90s

1901
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:56,520
whatever fifth dream in chat says this is like the erasure song in robot unicorn attack it makes the

1902
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:02,600
game yes it does there you go always needs to be in everything and fifth dream says the song you

1903
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:08,480
forgot was ordinary world how could a DDR player forget that song but come undone was also on the

1904
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:13,280
same album is what I love that song is my favorite Duran Duran song yeah on my favorite Duran Duran

1905
01:44:13,280 --> 01:44:19,360
song would probably be hungry like the wolf I like the didn't they do a James Bond they did James

1906
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:25,460
one they yeah they did you know yeah if you don't like it was also a good one not a great Bond movie

1907
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:31,880
but it did have um grace she had grace Jones it's a great Bond movie it was just not the good Bond

1908
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:38,320
actor but it had no Jones in it no and I like I actually really super love like James Bond movies

1909
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:42,440
it's kind of one of those things I don't really talk about Dan yeah but he was funny is like it

1910
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:48,800
had the most cheeseball line in it oh what if you to a kill yeah they always have to work in the

1911
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:58,400
title Oh 80s yeah so which I am so I remember it's the bond no one liked um not as a Dalton

1912
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:04,880
no it wasn't Dalton it was pre Dalton anyway I'm gonna have to look at him now but um I cannot

1913
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:12,560
wait for specter I am so excited and I love that they cast what's your name for the matrix Monica

1914
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:17,280
Bellucci is that her name she's now 50 Roger Moore Roger Moore that's it's Roger Moore but

1915
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:21,360
um Monica Bellucci she's what now 50 and they cast her as the Bond girl I think that's rad

1916
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:28,240
freaking gorgeous she's gorgeous good for her so that's amazing anyway if you know I kill came out

1917
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:33,640
in 1985 I know it's it was kind of in that I was nine there was a real dead period cuz there's one

1918
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:39,040
more after that in 88 right and then there was like a huge gap before golden I golden I was so

1919
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:48,160
good golden I was like fucking Tina Turner Switzerland's best citizen I actually think I

1920
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:53,280
need to see now I just need to see a bad movie with Tina Turner in it so I say let's watch Mad

1921
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:57,320
Max Beyond the Thunderdome I was just gonna say Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdome bad movies with

1922
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:08,000
Tina Turner but it has an awesome theme song it does favorite Bond movie oh fuck um I think I'd

1923
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:16,080
have to go with dr. no hmm or maybe octopussy hmm I would say see you know I like cheesy ones right

1924
01:46:16,080 --> 01:46:20,840
so which one which which is like the cheesiest Bond film they ever did you wouldn't go with a

1925
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:25,400
view to a kill we know I mean cuz Grace Jones is awesome I do love Grace Jones but live and let

1926
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:33,400
die is my favorite Paul McCartney doing the guy that gets blown up at the end it's yeah Paul

1927
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:40,400
McCartney did that and then it got covered by Gunther Rogers that's right Loki what's your favorite

1928
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:44,520
Bob movie you know I can't remember too many of them I've watched a few I remember watching

1929
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:53,360
GoldenEye and I know I've watched a lot of the Roger Moore ones and Sean Connery ones I I don't

1930
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:59,160
really have any favorites I mean I don't know I really like die another day I know most people

1931
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:04,080
didn't care for that one but I was on the Halle Berry and I really I thought like the one with

1932
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:09,400
Michelle Yeoh mmm that was yeah that one was good but I love Michelle Yeoh I love everything I've

1933
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:14,320
ever seen God but that was one with Denise Richards I forget about her it hadn't had Michelle Yeoh in

1934
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:19,000
it all right anyway and she was in Wing Chun and that was great my favorite Bond movie is if looks

1935
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:25,720
could kill and I think I think these new Daniel Craig ones are so fucking good I think I just

1936
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:31,680
want him to look at me like casino those eyes casino Royale and Skyfall Skyfall especially was

1937
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:37,560
like that's like honestly probably the best like movie they've done through the whole thing quick

1938
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:42,480
time out hmm the lady that played Evelyn in Masters of the Universe and him could you imagine the eyes

1939
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:48,040
their child would have all right just saying all right we could we could just talk about James Bond

1940
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:51,960
the rest of the night and hell Goldeneye was probably one of the best video games they ever

1941
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:58,440
did make the first video game that made me throw up really you couldn't handle the awesome this is

1942
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:05,280
so awesome no I didn't I when I moved out here Dan had a Nintendo 64 because he was like recording

1943
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:09,520
me like the music for Killer Instinct and whatnot and so I was trying to watch him play Goldeneye

1944
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:16,200
and I got so freaking motion sick I had to run to the bathroom and hurl and then like he was still

1945
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:20,360
playing the game he's like are you okay it's like motion sick so I just laid over in the couch and

1946
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:27,920
passed out that's how I knew that some 3d games will make me super sick there you go Wow the more

1947
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:33,000
and more real they got all right well anyhow we just we just fell into minutes and minutes of

1948
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,960
James Bond chat but I think that's okay that we had to fill a little time with that because usually

1949
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:44,000
we have no mail we would get it in the mail bag right now but you guys have sent no mail oh there's

1950
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:49,840
one actually is there okay well part here participate at orange long trainee calm dark

1951
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:53,160
soccer is gonna dive into the mail bag headfirst and pull out an email that she thinks is worth

1952
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:58,040
sharing with you all today dear dark Sakura you should do all the things ever you should have a

1953
01:48:58,040 --> 01:49:04,400
solo career as a podcaster you should do the dark Sakura show and have it themed to Clarissa

1954
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:13,080
explains it all dark Sakura will tell you some shit which I'm actually kind of can say you

1955
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:17,320
actually need a show called dark soccer will tell you some shit I'm actually can I've been

1956
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:24,960
considering doing this for a while I really have the Clarissa explains it all there's my theme

1957
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:35,680
music if someone will remix this for me I'll make a podcast I'm sure there's a remix out there

1958
01:49:35,680 --> 01:49:53,080
already dark soccer explains shit listen up that show was the best yes it was but I think if I

1959
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:59,080
Melissa Joan did you know that they tried to do a spin-off from it hmm that was like where Clarissa

1960
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:03,640
grows up to be a reporter yes there's a pilot out there somewhere was on ABC Family or something

1961
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:08,640
right yeah it didn't take off which would have been sad Alex person says I'm on it right now on

1962
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:29,680
the remix now if I were to have if I were to have a solo podcast anybody all that anybody but like

1963
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:36,920
sure I don't know they don't green like that but Oh Melissa Joey that sounds like a fucking great

1964
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:41,280
idea well she was she was huge in Sabrina the Teenage Witch so it made sense that they wanted

1965
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:47,000
to do something with her why they give show you guys solo show should be all sass they did they

1966
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:53,080
uh it was Melissa and Joey had this whole thing on ABC exactly it's I'm saying why the fuck is

1967
01:50:53,080 --> 01:51:06,940
Melissa and Joey a thing why not why did they watch episodes of that show that would be Loki

1968
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:14,120
so that's all he's good for that's just Loki sitting there whoa Oh entertainment has a

1969
01:51:14,120 --> 01:51:18,600
suggestion for a letter huh dear dark Sakura you are awesome you should do awesome things

1970
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:25,000
thank you signed not dark Sakura Alex P Carson and Chad says Lori Beth flashbacks Oh God and what

1971
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,960
is wrong with Lori Beth like can we can we talk about Lori Beth Thunberg for a minute because she

1972
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:34,040
hasn't really done anything since all that like I know she had like a minor role in dodgeball right

1973
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:38,400
and then she showed up in workaholics which was a hilarious scene that's one of those shows that's

1974
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:42,320
so fucking stupid but you can't help but laugh oh my god she's like two months older than me yeah

1975
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:47,320
so Lori Beth Thunberg but I'm not gonna tell you why I was looking into this but I was she'll

1976
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:55,640
actually officiate weddings if you want and so believe me I'm giving it some thought come on

1977
01:51:55,640 --> 01:52:02,920
would that not be like the best wedding ever just saying just saying all right anyhow let's move on

1978
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:09,720
since there is no mail this week you have allowed this show to spiral into seven minutes of nonsense

1979
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:13,960
chat so we hope you enjoyed that and I will continue to threaten you with nonsense chat

1980
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:19,880
if you do not send us emails so save the show from nonsense chat participate at orange lounge

1981
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:41,880
radio.com all right let's get into the F use of the week my if he goes to the internet for like

1982
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:48,000
tugging on everyone's heartstrings by saying Jericho the lion was dead too we'll just use

1983
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,000
a little line for when it's not true they even got me because it was on freakin CNN I thought

1984
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:59,040
maybe CNN would check their sources no so more like F you to sensationalized news I'm just gonna

1985
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:09,240
stick with the BBC I like my news dry and British thank you appropriate for today yes I actually do

1986
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:14,680
the BBC website for most of my news by the way I I love British news too but I prefer the Daily

1987
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:21,520
Mail just kidding girl by the way my mom sent me this thing on Facebook says a poem for mornings

1988
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:29,120
coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee everyone shut up coffee that's like a haiku yes Loki here

1989
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:34,800
I've used the week um my only F used really to Windows 10 just for some reason after I've

1990
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:40,440
updated my touchpad isn't quite right like especially when I try to right-click stuff

1991
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:45,400
it keeps you moving the pointer and then doing a little left-click and it's just kind of it's

1992
01:53:45,400 --> 01:53:51,120
annoying because they'll launch stuff without you know me wanting it to be launched or you know I'm

1993
01:53:51,120 --> 01:53:57,360
just trying to copy and paste something and it's just not working out for me so I'm still trying

1994
01:53:57,360 --> 01:54:04,280
to tweak the settings to get it right but it's no luck so far all right my F you goes to my back

1995
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:08,080
I don't know what the fuck I did yesterday but I really heard I don't know if it's moving the

1996
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:11,600
computer around I know it was the way I was sitting against the couch and maybe when I

1997
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:16,520
jumped during one of those five-night scares I somehow like really fucked up my back so F you

1998
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:20,720
to that because getting old sucks so if you did that as well I could give you some of my horse

1999
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:25,240
pills and then lastly well I've got to drive tonight you don't want me on meds and then my

2000
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:33,360
last F you my last if you goes to lays potato chips and I'm gonna tell you why because we make

2001
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:37,600
a thing out of the flavor contest every year since the first year we try all the different flavors

2002
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:41,600
so the first year chicken waffles best thing ever I don't care if you disagree with me you're wrong

2003
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:47,480
you're super wrong you're wrong or they're long just like when you all pick team dog you're that

2004
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:54,480
wrong the second year the best flavor that they had was actually they were all pretty good last

2005
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:59,160
year I gotta say they were all really strong contenders last year I really like the mango

2006
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:06,400
one but it grew on me and I even like the cappuccino chips this year all the flavors suck they are bad

2007
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:12,640
um and I cannot stand that southern biscuits and gravies one and apparently everybody is loving

2008
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:17,040
that one and I thought it tasted like bark now granted I'm not a big gravy fan to begin with I

2009
01:55:17,040 --> 01:55:23,120
like biscuits okay if the chips had been cheddar bay biscuits I have not heard oh my god right

2010
01:55:23,120 --> 01:55:28,200
that's that that's the fucking that was a million dollar idea right there right Jesus you know they

2011
01:55:28,200 --> 01:55:33,520
sell those at the store now huh can just yes I heard him they're amazing so amazing but here's

2012
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:38,680
the thing so and then we also bought the truffle fries one which that was okay but the one I

2013
01:55:38,680 --> 01:55:43,800
actually liked the best was the euro the sandwich I haven't tried that was really good have leave

2014
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:47,800
the chips are all gone we ate them all cuz we're fat but yeah they're out there they're out there

2015
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:52,400
in stores apparently Alan got the Reuben one which is the only one I haven't had yet but I

2016
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:56,000
am not interested in trying that one because somebody told me it has like a mayonnaise taste

2017
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:01,720
to it and you know how if you know how I feel about mayonnaise it's not gonna happen so anyway

2018
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:05,200
I just say a few delays because I don't think the chips are as strong this year as they've been in

2019
01:56:05,200 --> 01:56:08,560
previous years even though I like I thought truffle fries would be hella good but it's like

2020
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:13,000
french fries are already a potato so it's redundant you're eating a potato flavored

2021
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:19,200
potato chip no shit french fry well what and why don't we have ketchup chips in the States

2022
01:56:19,240 --> 01:56:25,200
like I know that's a Canadian thing but we don't have them here stupid ketchup chips

2023
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:32,160
make sense you put french fries in ketchup anyway yeah going to our chatroom over at

2024
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:38,240
live dot vog network comm fifth dream says I still say the coolest weird chip is cheeseburger

2025
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:44,440
Pringles I didn't even know that was a thing mm-hmm I'm so hungry now yeah Alex P Carson says they

2026
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:48,900
had a mac and cheese flavor that could have been way better you know and that's weird is that I can

2027
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:55,520
find even though last year the wasabi one won the contest the cheddar mac and cheese bacon one that

2028
01:56:55,520 --> 01:57:00,300
I would have thought would have won is like I can that's in our work vending machine like it's a huge

2029
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:06,900
flavor so I don't know it's weird anyway enough about potato chips more about video games we have

2030
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:11,740
a couple more stories for you guys and then your phone calls at 1 8 7 7 game olr or a username on

2031
01:57:11,740 --> 01:57:20,300
skype orange lounge radio but first Loki color me so surprised that Sega's first quarter fiscal

2032
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:28,860
year is not doing well I mean that is just shocking apparently there's been dramatic decreases in sales

2033
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:36,780
and the operating and in net income I haven't been doing too well kind of negative not too well

2034
01:57:36,780 --> 01:57:45,620
they're saying that the net sales dropped 41.2% to 52.9 billion yen or about 426 million dollars

2035
01:57:45,620 --> 01:57:55,140
and their losses for operating with 9.5 billion yen or 76 million total net losses 9 7.9 billion

2036
01:57:55,140 --> 01:58:03,700
or 63.8 million so yeah they're gonna what do they have coming that's gonna help them get out of that

2037
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:09,820
slump I mean I don't know if that really counts Atlas stuff but then again Atlas you know props

2038
01:58:09,820 --> 01:58:13,700
to them for being a great company and putting out good games but I don't think that's enough to lift

2039
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:21,060
up Sega I don't know how about fucking Phantasy Star Online 2 oh that's not coming out though but

2040
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:27,940
and yes I did hear about the English like apparently there's a server now that they took

2041
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:31,580
away the region restrictions so you can get on but it's like a year behind or something like that

2042
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:38,180
like and it's not like officially so I mean I think that you know I don't they have like a new

2043
01:58:38,180 --> 01:58:42,820
Sonic game coming out this year or something or I know that there's the new Mario and Sonic at the

2044
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:49,780
Olympics it's anek and danky Kang Santa Santa danky Kang which is actually a fake meme that's a total

2045
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:55,560
that's not a true somebody photoshopped that jeopardy thing but anyway I still would buy

2046
01:58:55,560 --> 01:59:01,320
Sanic and danky Kang I thought I thought it was that they spelled it wrong wasn't that it that

2047
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:15,680
like you know is danky Kang and Zordla princess Zordla Zordla all right well sorry Sega just not

2048
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:23,280
bringing in the money you once were there it is anyhow last but not least I should probably keep

2049
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:29,760
that Price is Right horn ready for this one did we fucking see this coming or did we see this

2050
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:39,480
coming guess what there is a new Castlevania themed pachinko machine coming yep Konami is

2051
01:59:39,480 --> 01:59:47,640
putting out a Castlevania pachinko machine somehow it is featuring erotic violence that is in the

2052
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:51,800
title of it erotic you really do need to watch the trailer it's hilarious and if you watch the

2053
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:56,440
trailer I haven't actually watched the trailer let's watch the trailer cuz it's only 51 seconds

2054
01:59:56,440 --> 02:00:00,920

2055
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:05,760

that's way too many boops I paused it sorry

2059
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:59,920
now here's the thing that could have been amazingly like bad video game in a rumble

2060
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:05,440
roses kind of way that could have been like a showgirls bad video game because I did get

2061
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:10,360
okay so like I'm watching that and I'm like I should be the trailer for like it's a little

2062
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:18,240
bit Bayonetta like I still feel like Bayonetta itself is better at making the joke but it does

2063
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:23,320
feel like when the feather was flying between her breasts come on that is fucking stupid like it's

2064
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:28,400
it's it's excessive but yeah that's that's hilarious that it's not even like a fucking

2065
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:33,720
actual game it's just a pachinko machine which is nowhere near as exciting as that video is

2066
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:40,400
like the entertainment and chat says erotic violence is this WWE zappy in chat says how

2067
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:45,440
about just new Castlevania act-deaf in chat says we all joked about it we knew it was coming but

2068
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:50,880
why do I still feel sad from this why do you need Konami originals Alan alchemy and chat says

2069
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:56,400
Konami says not only will we drive by in a big-ass truck and splash you with gutter water as you

2070
02:01:56,400 --> 02:02:02,840
stand in the rain waiting for your fave we'll spit at you and flip you off while doing it and

2071
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:13,160
be glad they don't turn that truck around and run you over when not their target audience anymore

2072
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:19,960
some beautiful insight from our chat room over at live vog that's gonna get some now speaking of

2073
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:24,040
chatter I don't know we get chatters real quick it's your turn if you want to give us a call

2074
02:02:24,040 --> 02:02:29,520
one eight seven seven game olr or in our Skype orange lounge radio all one word here's your

2075
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:35,640
chance what is the target demographic for pachinko machine gamblers I don't and I'm just assuming

2076
02:02:35,640 --> 02:02:39,520
like cuz I know gamblers over here most of them tend to be elderly is this supposed to like drive

2077
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:46,320
through the elderlies like whoa I got bring me some of that I don't know if the same stereotype

2078
02:02:46,320 --> 02:02:51,480
is true overseas is it is gambling just for the elderly overseas dark soccer that you've seen I

2079
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:58,160
think people of all ages are businessmen yeah that's yeah I've seen that too so I I don't know

2080
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:03,880
what the stereotype is over there but you also notice over here they try to do things to lure in

2081
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:09,080
not just the elderly like they like remember there was like a Dungeons & Dragons machine and they try

2082
02:03:09,080 --> 02:03:14,260
to do things like the hangover and things that like you know younger folks are into but they

2083
02:03:14,260 --> 02:03:19,320
definitely have the machines that target the older audiences as well like there's an Ellen

2084
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:23,240
show slot machine I mean that's not really older audience everybody loves Ellen but I thought that

2085
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:28,080
was interesting when I was in Reno I won $40 from a Dolly Parton slot machine thank you very much

2086
02:03:28,520 --> 02:03:33,760
blasted nine to five while I was playing that was a good time but the best slot machine I ever

2087
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:39,640
played in Reno Queen it was a queen slot machine that was awesome and I'm so sad it's not there

a.m. in the morning you know I have to get to work at 5 a.m. so it's a little hard to listen in oh my

2106
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:34,440
what would also motivate us is some Belgian chocolate I'm just saying that could also be

2107
02:05:34,440 --> 02:05:40,760
right are sorry I'm all right so anyway I'm just joking oh well I'll send some over just giving

visit over there someday there's lots of lots of beautiful architecture and things over there

2110
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:54,520
I think it'd be worth seeing and then I could hoard up on all the junk food over there so what

2111
02:05:54,520 --> 02:06:01,120
video games you playing lately well not that much actually I've been playing Metal Gear Solid 5

2112
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:08,400
yesterday because it was with the games with gold and I really like it oh yeah the whole the preview

2113
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:12,880
what does what the hell was it called I can't remember now the solid the phantom I know it's

2114
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:17,760
the Phantom pain what was the what was the demo called the Metal Gear Solid ground zero ground

2115
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:22,960
zeros that's it so yeah yeah I have that downloaded I haven't checked it out yet though but I kind of

2116
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:28,560
I don't know I kind of fell out of the Metal Gear Solid series I never played I didn't play four even

2117
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:34,660
though I have it on PlayStation 3 I barely played three at all so but I just I love the series on

2118
02:06:34,660 --> 02:06:40,360
the NES I never was able to make the hop to 3d like I love the story in Metal Gear Solid later

2119
02:06:40,360 --> 02:06:44,920
on but I just couldn't get into the gameplay like everybody else did on the PlayStation and so forth

2120
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:51,240
but I understand why people are really into it but that's cool I'm glad you enjoyed that so a

2121
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:56,520
little perk of PlayStation Plus is there are there any other games that you're waiting to go free on

2122
02:06:56,520 --> 02:07:03,600
PlayStation Plus no it's on Xbox one oh you're playing it on Xbox one I got with the games with

2123
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:11,640
gold thingy I forgot the games with gold got that yeah they just got it this month ah okay so okay

2124
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:15,640
I assumed it was PlayStation 4 because I knew they got it as part of their program I see well then

2125
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:24,520
I'll flip it is there is there an Xbox game you want them to put out on games of gold actually

2126
02:07:24,520 --> 02:07:32,960
rice I like I hope I like it but I don't know I read a lot of mixed reviews yeah I don't know

2127
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:39,240
if it's really worth to buy it that's that's a good call that's almost very much like knack on

2128
02:07:39,240 --> 02:07:42,280
the PlayStation 4 is like it's kind of one of those things you're curious about but it didn't

2129
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:47,080
get very good reviews but rise that's that's a good one cuz yeah wasn't that the one that

2130
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:50,800
originally was gonna be like a Kinect game and then they kind of like changed it and then it

2131
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:55,200
kind of got the mediocre reviews yeah I'd still be curious to check that out though for sure for

2132
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:59,400

2144
02:09:20,120 --> 02:09:25,640
the part about the chips but try to ask if you ask your question in chat over at live dot vog

2145

network comm because I know you hang out in chat I'll be happy to answer whatever that is there so

2146
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:34,440
watch check that out of live dog network comm sorry Skype was acting weird I don't know why

2147
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:39,160
it does that I guess they don't have a lot of bandwidth up in Buffalo either usually it's only

2148
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:43,520
during the snow storms that he cuts out but I know it's not snowing today all right one eight seven

2149
02:09:43,720 --> 02:09:49,440
game olr or username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word I'm checking with Loki again I heard

2150
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:55,800
you about to read another yes I do have another story I know which game you're waiting for forum

2151
02:09:55,800 --> 02:10:02,360
for this generation of games dead or alive extreme three is in development is it yes yes can you

2152
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:09,080
imagine the physics calculations that are possible by these new systems I am very excited although I

2153
02:10:09,200 --> 02:10:15,360
am also just be clear I am all for equal opportunity offensiveness so if they want to have package

2154
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:23,320
physics that's completely fine as well but I'll take boob jiggles too I'll take all of it all

2155
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:33,040
right I want everything to be shaking just just give me jello the game that's all is that it

2156
02:10:33,040 --> 02:10:41,600
that's it and then apparently though it's getting released exclusively though in Asia

2157
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:49,160
oh come on something like that can't stay exclusive to Asia we need that so that dev says in our chat

2158
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:53,920
room over at live dog network comm we need that I agree we need it all right well it looks like

2159
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:58,720
nobody else is taking advantage of the Skype line today but I know it is a weird time so we probably

2160
02:10:58,720 --> 02:11:02,560
don't have a lot of our usual audience listening right now probably will have a bunch of people

2161
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:06,160

2172
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:56,800
fun of it and and they need your support so bad really appreciate it before we get to final

2173
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:02,320
thoughts Raginator got his question out in chat so I'll go ahead and entertain this here so summing

2174
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:07,320
up my call here Raginator says one that free magic game is out on Steam now we need to set up a vog

2175
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:15,600
game night two do you know if upgrading a PC's OS will fuck up miscellaneous files DRM Loki do you

2176
02:12:15,600 --> 02:12:22,200
know about that I it can it depends sometimes you like I know for like unity we had the revoked the

2177
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:29,240
license if you had a pro version and then redo it for the most of my other stuff no so it depends

2178
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:33,400
yeah for everything I had it transferred over pretty cleanly I didn't have a problem and I

2179
02:12:33,400 --> 02:12:38,200
would imagine if that license is through Microsoft you're not gonna have a problem at all but what

2180
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:43,280
I'd encourage you to do first whatever the license is through whatever the DRM is through just Google

2181
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:48,440
it and try to see if other people have been having problems just Google it followed by Windows 10 or

2182
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:53,960
whatever most people have been ready to send for a while now they didn't just upgrade they've been

2183
02:12:53,960 --> 02:12:58,240
running preview builds and stuff so they should be aware of any issues that are out there yeah so

2184
02:12:58,240 --> 02:13:03,000
you'll know so do your research like you know I did not upgrade till Windows 10 until I verified

2185
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:08,320
Final Fantasy 14 has no problems on Windows 10 you know so those types of issues you definitely

2186
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:11,800
want to Google and just do your research upfront and just make sure nobody else is having problems

2187
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:16,800
and there's no problem like Windows 10 is gonna be free for what a year so you don't have to I'm

2188
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:21,480
assuming that's the OS your win upgrade do you don't have to necessarily jump in right now you

2189
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:26,400
can wait a week or two it's not gonna kill you in fact a lot of people are saying wait a week or two

2190
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:30,480
so Microsoft can work out some of these bugs although I'm not getting a very buggy experience

2191
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:34,800
I guess some other people are one last thing I'll say about the Windows 10 upgrade that I didn't

2192
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:40,960
know about but made me feel better about doing it is that it actually keeps your old Windows

2193
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:46,240
installation for a month so if you decide you don't like Windows 10 you can go into the settings

2194
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:50,280
and you can bring back your old installation of Windows 7 or whatever it was you have before so

2195
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:54,720
that that kind of made me go okay knowing that I feel better and I'll take the plunge that I can

2196
02:13:54,720 --> 02:14:00,280
always recover from that so there's some things to think about and then the last part there with

2197
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:04,760
with rage nators saying about the magic the free magic game out on Steam now we need to set up a

2198
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:08,840
vog game night I agree and now that I'm doing a little more of the live streaming and so forth

I'd be super open to that so you can check that out we do have a community on Steam so you can

2200
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:18,520

for the early show East Coast listeners are forever grateful and F you to Loki for not working

2205
02:14:41,120 --> 02:14:45,760
as my lawyer or working for my cable company well no you're probably it's probably good I don't work

2206
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:50,320
as a lawyer it's probably for the best thank you guys for tuning in and listening I'm happy we could

2207
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:56,000
do a show at a different time usually the reality is this time doesn't usually work for us it's kind

2208
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,760
of better to have this at the very end of our weekend but once in a while when we're able to

2209
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:05,200
make it work we're glad that we can do something at a different time to help some different people

2210
02:15:05,200 --> 02:15:09,840
get the live experience happy to share that with you guys so that's gonna do it for another week

2211
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:14,200
here at orange lounge radio before we officially closed down though we have to go around and get

2212
02:15:14,200 --> 02:15:19,480
everybody's final thought so dark Sakura I'll start with you tonight final thought now once

2213
02:15:19,480 --> 02:15:26,240
in a while is stuck in my head once in a while like the best song you don't wanna go in the play

2214
02:15:26,240 --> 02:15:34,800
not even in the movie except for a deleted scene yeah but it's the first time I heard it we were

2215
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:40,920
doing like a kind of a shadow casting with a VHS recording and they paused it and the guy got up

2216
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:48,080
and sang it and everyone's like oh nice and then we continued nice so actually my second time ever

2217
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:53,080
watching the rocky horror picture show I heard the song when we did rocky horror here in Sacramento

2218
02:15:53,080 --> 02:15:56,800
now that everything's digital we spliced it back in we put it back in the movie and we actually did

2219
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:01,400
the scene and it was a really bad audience reception we thought we would like get a lot

2220
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:05,480
of cheers and people going like oh my god they're doing the cutscene and everything but we tried it

2221
02:16:05,480 --> 02:16:08,840
like four different times the audience was just dead we tried to do all these different things

2222
02:16:08,840 --> 02:16:12,480
to make the scene more interesting like we tried to move the slow dancing to that scene and all

2223
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:16,880
but it just didn't work we cut it we ended up re-cutting it just people weren't into it but I

2224
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:21,520
do love that song yeah that's like the best song in the whole thing that and superheroes like my

2225
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:26,240
two favorite songs are like the sad depressing ones are like the ones that are either cut apart

2226
02:16:26,240 --> 02:16:34,240
for the u.s. release or not in the movie yeah so hey you should hear this if you haven't already

2227
02:16:34,240 --> 02:16:39,040
heard it the soundtrack to shock treatment I mean that movie sucks but like soundtracks the

2228
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:43,460
soundtracks really good I need to watch it again to see if it makes sense it's you start to

2229
02:16:43,460 --> 02:16:48,880
appreciate shock treatment on like your sixth viewing you kind of start to realize this was

2230
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:53,600
a parody of reality television before anybody knew what reality television was but like if you look

2231
02:16:53,600 --> 02:16:58,680
at it in that context now it's like a brilliant parody which is so weird because it's that didn't

2232
02:16:58,680 --> 02:17:04,960
exist they were psycho and head ESPN they were completely all right that was a long final thought

2233
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:10,320
but that's okay it was a final discussion it was a final discussion Loki your final thought tonight

2234
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:16,960
my final thought is I'm working more on my game I just am working on trying to design a logo for

2235
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:22,600
my game and you know development company or whatever and then also I do have a new video

2236
02:17:22,600 --> 02:17:28,680
up if you haven't checked it out yet on YouTube so under my channel Loki OLR you can check out

2237
02:17:28,680 --> 02:17:34,880
the new video words on my Twitter nice and then my final thought I will also pimp my YouTube Rob

2238
02:17:34,880 --> 02:17:39,760
Roberts plays and then I'm also on Twitch as just Rob Roberts and I'm really excited to do more live

2239
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:43,800
streaming I've really missed it so I'm gonna get back in the swing of things and more of our jam

2240
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:48,840
videos to come including the lat you know the last video I'm gonna do is Loki's game whatever

2241
02:17:48,880 --> 02:17:54,160
he's freaking got done with it I'm gonna make him let me play it for the last video so I look

2242
02:17:54,160 --> 02:17:58,800
