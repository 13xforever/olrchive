0	17280	This week Summer Games Done Quick has come and gone and congratulations to the group
17280	20920	for raising $1.2 million dollars benefitting Doctors Without Borders.
20920	23800	There's plenty more to talk about in the week's news and it all starts right now
23800	25800	in the show where every gamer has a voice.
53800	60800	The DarkSakura Show is brought to you by DarkSakura Productions.
60800	65560	Listen up there, Techmaster Loki joining me every week.
65560	66560	What time were you up today?
66560	67880	The kids probably got you up at 5 a.m.
67880	70320	Actually, they slept in because we wore them out last night because they went to Josh's
70320	71320	birthday party.
71320	72840	Now that's good planning.
72840	74960	Just convenient planning.
74960	75960	Just convenient planning.
75960	77320	I see how it is.
77320	81360	And also joining us in studio, of course, as she does every single week, say hello to
81360	83320	DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
83320	84320	Hi.
84320	85320	Hi.
85320	87840	And we had a birthday party of our own yesterday, or at least Cheesecake was involved.
87840	89360	We had a scary party.
89360	91120	And Freddy Fazbear was involved.
91120	92120	Yeah.
92120	93120	Poor Rob.
93120	94120	Poor me.
94120	98840	So if you were listening to last week's show live, DarkSakura and I came up with this big
98840	102560	plan where I was going to finish some VOGJAM videos.
102560	105280	So you know, I was making good on the promise there.
105280	108000	And then we were going to do some live streaming, bring that back because I haven't done that
108000	112920	since like January, which ironically, the last live stream I did was Five Nights at
112920	114200	Freddy's one.
114200	119320	So we did a live stream of Five Nights at Freddy's four, and it lasted maybe 25 minutes.
119320	121560	I could not get past night two.
121560	126560	And that is, that is the ugliest scream I've ever let out on a live thing.
126560	128100	So it was a beautiful thing.
128100	130440	It's all on YouTube for everyone to see now.
130440	132380	I think I jumped a few times.
132380	133380	You did.
133380	134480	You got scared at the same point I did.
134480	135480	You did.
135480	136480	You did.
136480	137480	You did more of the lady gasp.
137480	138480	You did more of that.
138480	141480	And then I started giggling like I was five.
141480	142480	I screamed.
142480	143760	It was awful.
143760	148920	I did not publish the picture of you fanning your face.
148920	149920	Fanning the flames.
149920	152560	And of course, my name is Rob Roberts.
152560	157000	Since we're introducing in reverse order tonight, everything is upside down today when we are
157000	158180	taping early.
158180	162520	But if you are, it's not like this is for Australia, Rob, although we love our friends
162520	163520	friends in Australia.
163520	166320	We do love them over there, but I think it's actually like three in the morning over there.
166320	167320	I don't know.
168160	171680	chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
171680	174560	We do have some people joining us that aren't usually here.
174560	178000	It's a smaller crowd because, you know, I'm sure not everybody got the memo and many people
178000	183360	have the 6 p.m. thing worked into their routine, which if you're listening after Bobby Black
183360	187920	Wolf tonight, because usually we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network,
187920	191240	vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black
191240	192240	Wolf show.
192240	196720	We're going to repeat this at that usual time for those that, you know, forgot what we said
196720	200880	last week about the early show or what have you can't make it because I'm sure like people
200880	202420	like Akuma JP or in Japan.
202420	203420	It's like three or 4 a.m.
203420	204920	There's no way he's listening right now.
204920	208600	So we'll repeat it at six o'clock for that crowd.
208600	215040	But I notice over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, Fabrice from Belgium in chat saying it's 8
215040	217040	p.m. in Belgium here.
217040	219320	Finally OLR at a decent hour, not 3 a.m. in the morning.
219320	221160	Well, I'm glad I could work out for you.
221160	224920	And I saw somebody else saying it was only seven o'clock where they were, Kitten Poker
224920	227000	says it's just gone 7 p.m. here.
227000	231080	So that's really cool that we get some people from overseas who don't usually get to participate
231080	232080	in the show.
232080	236840	So Dark Soccer and I have a personal engagement this evening with a friend of ours who's who's
236840	241060	moving out of town is having like her her going away shindig tonight.
241060	243840	So we decided to rearrange things so we could do it.
243840	247240	So appreciate you guys working with us.
247240	251920	But anyway, we are here to talk about video games, gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle.
251920	253860	We will take your calls live.
253860	258920	If anybody wants to give us a call later on in the show, 1-877-GAME-OLR, remember that's
258920	263620	a toll free number in only the U.S. and Canada, but the world can use Skype and you can call
263620	268600	us Orange Lounge Radio on Skype, all one word.
268600	271680	So let's get into game chat.
271680	276580	And starting off here, you know, you heard that in the intro and big congratulations
276580	280600	to the Games Done Quick crew with their Summer Games Done Quick event.
280600	285140	And they raised over one point two million dollars at the end of the day for Doctors
285140	286400	Without Borders.
286400	290400	And I know there were some I didn't get to watch a lot a lot because I don't I just don't
290400	294260	usually end up watching a lot of the game stream stuff, whatever it is.
294260	296580	But I actually did sit down and watch some of this.
296580	300280	I saw some of the run they were doing for Twilight Princess.
300280	303160	I saw a little bit of that and I saw another one they were doing later.
303160	305120	Somebody told me to tune in and watch the Hello Kitty stuff.
305120	306840	So I was watching that for a little bit.
306840	307840	And then I heard.
307840	308840	Yes, they did.
308840	310160	They did like the Hello Kitty game for the week.
310160	312560	It was like an awful game segment or something.
312560	313560	Yeah.
313560	314560	Yeah.
314560	315560	What?
315560	316560	How could you call Hello Kitty awful?
316560	318280	I was watching Chrono Trigger last night.
318280	319280	Yeah, I was.
319280	322680	I heard the finale was like a like was it multiple people doing Chrono Trigger?
322680	323680	Yeah, it was the co-op.
323680	324680	Yeah.
324680	326360	And then there was Super Metroid.
326360	327360	They did like a big race.
327360	328360	Yeah.
328360	332020	It was a big deal because they they had the whole and they always do this to save the
332020	334660	animals or what do they call the other option?
334660	335660	Fuck the animals.
335660	336660	Fuck them.
336660	337660	Yeah.
337660	338660	No, not literally.
338660	339660	Not literally.
339660	340660	You don't literally.
340660	341660	I think it's kill the animals.
341660	342660	Kill the animals.
342660	343660	Yeah.
343660	344660	There it is.
344660	345660	Awesome.
345660	347780	And then like they take extra donations to name the characters.
347780	350460	It's like every main character that you can name was always Iwata.
350460	351980	Oh, that's really cool.
351980	352980	Yeah, I heard.
352980	355740	I think I heard about that because they did on the Chrono Trigger thing, right?
355740	358540	They did it also in Earthbound because I was watching the Earthbound speed run.
358540	359540	Of course.
359540	360540	Of course.
360540	361540	That makes sense.
361540	362540	Well, big props to those guys.
362540	364740	I was going to ask, though, just in general, what do you think?
364820	369940	I mean, obviously the charity element is is great, but what do you think really draws
369940	373180	people to watch those sorts of streams?
373180	376580	What is it that people love about the games done quick in particular?
376580	378380	Because there's lots of charity streams on Twitch.
378380	380460	There's a lot of people doing good out there.
380460	384940	And I'm not trying to turn it into a contest, but I'm curious what draws people to this
384940	386220	one specifically.
386220	390820	What is it about the games being done quickly that that draws people in, you guys think?
390820	394540	And I open that up to our chat room as well as live.vognetwork.com.
394540	397660	I think some of it's just watching how you can break the games.
397660	403260	I mean, most speed running really relies on glitches, I think, for more modern games.
403260	408780	But I like it better for older games, because then you find methods and different changes
408780	413580	and, you know, things you can skip and what's actually essential to the story and whatnot.
413580	416940	So sort of that element of discovery, because I could certainly you know, I think that's
416940	420180	a big part of what I was interested in when I was watching the Twilight Princess thing
420180	422820	is like, I never knew you could do that before.
422820	423820	What?
424100	425100	To break the game like that?
425100	429260	There definitely is that kind of element of surprise for a game that's years and years
429260	430260	old.
430260	432980	It was nice too, as they're able, they're so comfortable in doing it, they're able to
432980	437660	commentate over, you know, the gameplay and stuff to talk about different things.
437660	441720	And it's kind of hilarious, like, especially like, I remember watching one from last year
441720	446580	for I Wanna Be The Guy, or one of the, I think it's like one of the newer ones that they
446580	447580	had.
447580	451060	And he was talking about like, you know, the different, like the spiders and silly the
451060	453180	jump scares that they have in the game and stuff like that.
453220	456740	And it was just, he's run it so many times that it was just funny, you know, talking
456740	459180	about the game as he goes and stuff.
459180	462100	So are there Five Nights at Freddy's speedruns?
462100	465540	Because I can see how maybe people finally, I don't think you can speedrun that game.
465540	466660	Finally get immune to that.
466660	468620	Maybe for four, if you do the little mini games, right?
468620	472700	I was gonna say for four, you could do the little mini games just right and maybe get
472700	473700	through that.
473700	478740	But yeah, I only say that because man, that game scared the hell out of me yesterday.
478740	480940	But of course, I'm playing it on the giant TV.
480940	486220	We did this whole little thing where we hooked a computer up to the TV and yeah, anyway,
486220	492420	going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Joda Star is in chat saying, this has been
492420	498060	my first chance to participate and I'm doing it on an airplane on the way to Vegas.
498060	499220	Wow.
499220	500220	That's pretty cool.
500220	503940	Does that mean we're officially a part of the Mile High Club now?
503940	506940	Are we being fucked?
506940	509660	No, just the animals.
509660	512260	That was the goal there.
512260	513260	Let's see.
513260	515220	Well, thank you for tuning in from Way Up High.
515220	516780	Good luck in Vegas, by the way.
516780	517780	Let's see.
517780	522860	Tiger Claw says, that Super Metroid race, the fourth player died 13 minutes into it
522860	525540	and the third player died during the Mother Brain battle.
525540	529260	Yeah, I heard that somebody got knocked out of that contest a little early because of
529260	531800	death, but that's part of the risk.
531800	535940	When you are doing the speedruns, you're usually skipping a bunch of items that most
535940	538440	people would need to keep them alive.
538440	543680	Because I'm imagining it was not a 100% completion speedrun, the only thing that...
543680	549280	And most people would usually skip the animals to get the better time, but that element has
549280	550780	just become a thing.
550780	551780	Now that's a thing.
551780	557320	And when something becomes a thing, you just bend the rules to accommodate it, right?
557320	562820	Dan watches these four guys all the time who just will randomly race each other in Mega
562820	569020	Man games and all kinds of different stuff and they will have all of them chatting with
569020	573300	each other while they're doing it and I need to find out who they are again, but they're
573300	574300	really cool to watch.
574300	576980	They'll just do different games.
576980	581200	Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom says, I think the closest thing to speedruns for me is doing
581200	586620	the gauntlet near the end of Mega Man 2 where you fight the robot masters again.
586620	590380	So I bet you could run through that real quick, especially if you knew exactly what weapon
590380	591500	to use and what boss.
591500	597340	You could probably get all sorts of times on that gauntlet at the end of Mega Man 2.
597340	604660	But yeah, you know, I find that I will challenge myself to speedrun games when the game encourages
604660	605660	you to do it.
605660	609940	And what I mean by that is like, one game I've been playing a lot this week is Velocity
609940	613880	2X, you know, and that's a game that's on PlayStation 4 and I'm pretty sure it's on
613880	616460	Steam and all the other consoles too.
616460	619180	But it was free during the PlayStation Plus a while ago.
619180	623780	And I really like this game because it's like part shooter, part platformer, so it's
623780	626020	got like that Guardian Legend bit to it.
626020	628060	And the music in the game is fantastic.
628060	634820	Well, the game gives you medals based on how many crystals did you get, how many survivors
634820	638180	did you rescue, and how fast did you do it.
638180	642680	So you get a gold medal when you get through the level real quick.
642680	647140	And if you can get all the survivors, all the crystals, all the points, and fast, you
647140	648200	get like a perfect.
648200	652880	So what I mean is like the game kind of encourages you to run it faster and faster.
652880	657640	So when I beat a level, if I only get a silver medal for time, I'm usually encouraged to
657640	661020	go right back and get a gold medal in the round.
661020	664960	So I know that some games kind of encourage the speedrunning in that regard.
664960	666600	Let's see.
666600	670800	Tigerclaw says, I'm not really into using glitches to beat a game.
670800	673720	I'd rather they play by the rules set in the game.
673720	676280	No clipping through walls and things of that nature.
676280	680680	And Tigerclaw continues, they literally skipped a lot of levels and even boss battles by going
680680	681680	out of bounds.
681680	684420	I'm not a fan of doing speedruns without a bounce.
684420	686840	But they do mix it up a little bit, right?
686840	688320	They also have no glitch runs as well.
688320	692680	Yeah, they have like no glitch runs and they do like 100% item runs and things like that,
692680	693680	right?
693680	696680	So they do a little bit that fosters to other people's styles.
696680	700960	And maybe that's part of the secret of how they're so successful is that they don't just
700960	702440	cater to one audience.
702440	705760	They cater to people that are looking for all sorts of things in speedruns.
705760	706760	So that's kind of cool.
706760	708120	I'd rather they have a Grand Theft Auto speedrun.
708120	709120	That'd be cool to watch.
709120	710120	You think?
710120	713600	It would be too long though, I think, because it's hard to complete the game within like
713600	716000	30 hours.
716000	720320	Do you think there's a game that you would want to get really good at someday and be
720320	721600	a speedrunner for?
721600	722600	No.
722600	723600	No?
723600	727280	Maybe when I get old and like I have a lot of free time, but right now I don't have time
727280	728280	to do it.
728280	729280	In your retirement?
729280	733480	When the rest of you starts to slow down, you'll speedrun to try to keep current?
733480	735000	I like that.
735240	736560	Sure, I guess.
736560	737560	Nice.
737560	739800	Fifth Dream in chat says speedrun Final Fantasy 14.
739800	741680	I'm not sure that's a game.
741680	743840	Maybe you could speedrun from levels 1 to 10 or so.
743840	747680	I know they had, they used to have things like that in World of Warcraft.
747680	753240	Not official, but just like fan sponsored, like either like level one races to get from
753240	758160	this town to this town or who can level up to 15 the fastest or something like that.
758160	760600	You could do something like that in Final Fantasy 14.
760600	761600	So.
761600	762600	Eleven.
762600	763600	Quick.
763600	765080	Kill all the rabbits.
765080	766080	And now the worms.
766080	768400	The Final Fantasy 11 speedrun would take the entire week.
768400	770600	It would take the entire week just to get to level 10.
770600	771600	I'm kidding.
771600	772600	Alright.
772600	773600	Anyway.
773600	779640	Tiger Kong in chat says imagine if you were a developer who made a game that people are
779640	780640	breaking.
780640	781640	How do you react to that?
781640	783960	I'm glad that people are playing your game.
783960	784960	I know.
784960	789600	I think some people like don't even realize that the bug existed in their own game.
789600	793320	Weren't the Shovel Knight folks, the Yacht Club games, weren't they participating with
793320	794320	their own speedrun?
794320	798400	Like kind of, I don't want to say it was like official, but I know I saw some of their tweets.
798400	803440	The ones who did, um, god I can't remember the name, but it was the ones like, you're
803440	807800	just like the little guy that's got all the spinning wheels and everything kind of outliney.
807800	808800	I was watching that one.
808800	809800	You mean Super Meat Boy?
809800	812000	Not Super Meat Boy.
812000	815420	It was one of those really difficult games though.
815420	816420	Like N++?
816420	817420	It almost sounds like?
817420	818420	No.
818420	822720	It was, you play like a little stick figure person, but anyway.
823120	824120	Yeah, that's N++.
824120	825120	It sounds like N+.
825120	826120	Anyway.
826120	827120	I don't think that was it.
827120	828120	I think it was something else.
828120	831960	But anyway, they went all the way through that one really quick while the developers
831960	832960	were watching.
832960	835360	And they were like, hey, that's pretty cool.
835360	836800	Hey, we knew about that.
836800	838280	We just didn't think anyone would figure it out.
838280	839280	Yeah.
839280	844080	No, I think a lot of developers like to watch those sorts of live stream things, you know,
844080	848200	and kind of are flattered when people go to such great lengths to break the games.
848200	850960	At least any developer I've ever talked to kind of likes that.
851000	854520	Especially when you talk about a lot of these older games have kind of been, I don't want
854520	860000	to say they've been forgotten, but you know, it's kind of nice to still have them acknowledged
860000	862360	here in the year 2015, some of these old classic games.
862360	866320	I think a lot of developers kind of like that.
866320	869280	And I know, you know, not necessarily with speed running, but since somebody mentioned
869280	874360	Final Fantasy XIV a minute ago, and I've been following that and read a lot of interviews
874360	880360	and went to the Fan Fest last year, I know that those developers, Naoki Yoshida, who's
880360	885160	been the producer of the game has actually said when that game first went live on PlayStation
885160	890200	4, they started watching a bunch of live streams to see how people were consuming the content,
890200	893440	what people were doing and what people were enjoying.
893440	897520	And so they actually watch live streams to see how people are playing the game, which
897520	899120	I think is fascinating.
899120	903120	So I think there's a lot of developers out there that kind of get a kick out of that.
903120	911080	So anyway, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Fifth Dream in chat says,
911080	916480	I made a level of N++ that one of the devs of it called Beautiful, and she likes the
916480	917480	name of it.
917480	919920	They retweeted my video stream I posted in YouTube too.
919920	920920	Well, there you go.
920920	921920	That's really cool.
921920	922920	I need to check out N++ by the way.
922920	926600	I know that came out on PlayStation 4 this week, but I was distracted by, you know, all
926600	929400	these other games and things, but I meant to check out N++.
929400	931120	I know that's on my list of things to do.
931120	935440	So there was something else I played this week, and we'll get to that in just a moment
935440	938680	because it is time for How Was Your Gaming Week?
938680	942400	But ladies first, DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
942400	947160	I had a very enjoyable experience with Five Nights at Freddy's 4.
947160	949880	I'm glad somebody did.
949880	955440	Dragon Age Inquisition, Dragon Age Origins, Final Fantasy XIV, and Bejeweled.
955440	957760	In that order, all at the same time.
957760	961040	I'm a talented lady, let me tell you.
961040	962040	Awesome.
962040	964000	Loki, how about your gaming week?
964000	966840	I just tried to get to some stuff that I haven't played in a while.
966840	970960	So I played a little bit of Battlefield 4 because I had purchased that like, god, months
970960	973620	ago when it was down to 10 bucks.
973620	976200	And so I played through the first level of that, and it's pretty good.
976200	977200	I enjoy it.
977200	981480	You know, because I'm used to playing just through the campaigns on Call of Duty, and
981480	984960	it's just, I don't know, similar, I guess.
984960	989560	It looks prettier though, so I give them that.
989560	994160	And then, the other thing that kind of stood out to me that was kind of silly was like,
994160	998160	every time I'd kill somebody, I'd hear one of my team members go, good job, man!
998160	1002000	It was just like, they're like trying to hide in cover, it could be like a stealth mission
1002000	1005080	or something, I shoot somebody and they're like, yeah, good job!
1005080	1008060	You're doing a terrible job of being stealthy right now, I'm just saying.
1008060	1011060	So I thought that was a little silly.
1011060	1017400	And then I tried last night a roundabout that had purchased, do you remember roundabout?
1017400	1019440	The game about the spinning limousine.
1019440	1023120	Oh yeah, because that was like on the Ouya, right?
1023120	1024120	Wasn't it?
1024120	1025920	Is that the one where you park the cars?
1025920	1032920	No, no, no, this is about, it's a game that has full motion video cutscenes.
1032920	1038160	That's right, okay, we had a new thing, it's like a purposefully bad type of video game.
1038160	1040680	It's really silly.
1040680	1046360	So I played a little bit of that, and it's okay, you basically have to get through obstacles
1046360	1050200	and stuff and your limousine is spinning the entire time, and so you just have to go
1050200	1051200	through that.
1051200	1057800	And apparently it's this, um, Chick Georgio's, like, it's her technique is she just drives
1057800	1063480	the spinning limousine, and um, I don't know, it's also uber violent because you can crush
1063480	1068040	everybody and they just explode in the blood, but I think it's pretty funny.
1068040	1072900	And the cutscenes are really bad, they're really bad, but that's what makes it kind
1072900	1073900	of good.
1073900	1075640	It's so bad it's good.
1075640	1076640	So I played a little bit of that.
1076640	1081040	I played Minecraft on Playstation 4, because I bought that a while ago, and I was very
1081040	1083360	bored with it.
1083360	1088800	I was playing by myself, to be fair, so I just didn't feel the excitement that I used
1088800	1089800	to have with Minecraft.
1089800	1092480	It just kind of like, eh, here we go again.
1092480	1095120	Is it one of those things where the thrill is starting to run out a little bit?
1095120	1101480	Yeah, kind of, like, and I don't know, it's just maybe, maybe you need more of the PC
1101480	1106280	version with mods on it, like, where there's actual content that I can consume aside from,
1106280	1110600	okay, let's go find some diamonds, I mean, it's just, it's kind of a drag.
1110600	1115280	But you don't want to pay $4.99 for the Skyrim pack, or the, what else did they just, they
1115280	1117280	just added something to Minecraft on Playstation 4 too?
1117280	1118280	Like, Ancient Greece pack.
1118280	1119280	Yeah, the Ancient Greece stuff.
1119280	1123080	No, I don't, because it's just a level, and then I'll get bored with that as well, and
1123080	1124080	skins.
1124080	1128640	Um, so I, I don't know, I played a little bit of that, but I may go back a little later,
1128640	1129760	I don't know.
1129760	1131160	And then, uh, what else did I play?
1131160	1137560	Oh, I played a little bit of Clicker Heroes, and I think I'm almost done with that game.
1137560	1139400	And what else did I play?
1139400	1149160	Um, I worked on my game, mostly, put some new footage up on YouTube of that, and I think
1149160	1150160	that's it.
1150160	1154480	Oh, my son played a lot more of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, and he actually managed to glitch
1154480	1157200	under the map, which was kind of funny, so.
1157200	1158200	Nice.
1158240	1162760	Speaking of your game, Loki, when I was doing the, uh, VoG Jam videos yesterday, which,
1162760	1166000	by the way, if you want to see these, and I, I encourage you to go check them out, they
1166000	1169960	are on the VoG Network YouTube channel, so just check out YouTube.com slash VoG Network,
1169960	1174560	and you can see me playing the games that are available at VoG Network dot com.
1174560	1180240	So I was actually playing Bobby's, uh, Moonbuggy game yesterday, um, along with, um, Hitstun's,
1180240	1182640	um, Skeleton Game and Skeleton Hunter.
1182640	1187820	And then I also did a little bit of Flappy VoG, and I finally spilled the secret on the
1187820	1191020	hidden character, cause, I thought that was, everybody knew about that.
1191020	1194840	No, I don't think everybody, I think, like, a couple people found it, but no, like, nobody
1194840	1199300	knew, like, how to unlock it, I think, so I finally spilled the beans on that, cause
1199300	1202260	it's been, like, a year, I was like, Bobby can't get mad.
1202260	1204380	I thought that, like, a dev is supposed to appreciate it when he was an old dude.
1204380	1206260	I thought they figured that out, like, immediately.
1206260	1210860	No, only a couple people found that, so, so you want to get all the details, go check
1210860	1216140	it out on the, um, uh, VoG Jam playthrough, um, but I, anyway, the point I was making
1216140	1217980	was tied into your game, Loki.
1217980	1222460	I was playing, uh, Bobby's Moon Buggy game, and I don't know if you've played it, but
1222460	1228020	it's kinda like, you, you have, uh, Moon Buggy that you're accelerating and de-accelerating,
1228020	1231460	and you're trying to get over, like, jumps and things like that, but there's that physics
1231460	1235460	engine where sometimes the damn thing will flip upside down, and whatever.
1235460	1240420	So there was one level where I, like, flew over a ramp, and my thing was, like, spinning
1240420	1245740	like crazy, and I went through the finish line like that, and so I still beat it, and
1245740	1250700	I went, nailed it, and it just reminded me of that sequence in your game.
1250700	1252500	Yes, awesome.
1252500	1256780	Anyway, uh, so there, I, I played some VoG Jam games yesterday, that was, uh, part of
1256780	1260460	my gaming week, uh, and then I also played Five Nights at Freddy's 4, which we talked
1260460	1264580	about, um, and you can see me, like, seriously, I let out a hideous scream, I don't know why
1264580	1268340	I let that out on the internet, things we will do for subscribers, but that's on my
1268340	1272540	personal channel, Rob Roberts Plays on YouTube, that's Rob Roberts Plays, all one word, about
1272540	1277420	halfway through that video, you can, uh, see me ugly scream and then ugly cry, um,
1277420	1281780	and I will say this, as much as I always sit here and say, I hate Five Nights at Freddy's,
1281780	1286540	that game is so fucking mean, and stuff like, I hate what it does to me, but I actually
1286540	1292220	think as a game itself, it's pretty brilliant, you know, because it's one of those very simple,
1292220	1296740	it's a simple concept, and most people will say, there's barely any game to Five Nights
1296740	1301940	at Freddy's, eh, eh, look at old Atari 2600 games, there was a lot of very simple concepts
1301940	1305740	there, and I think what, what, um, the creator of Five Nights at Freddy's has done, you know,
1305740	1311100	is taken this great, simple concept, and created a universe around it, that, like, people are,
1311100	1315980	like, super into lore, that don't even necessarily play the games, they just, right, Jamie? Like,
1315980	1319940	super lore nuts about all this stuff that goes into Five Nights at Freddy's, so, I,
1319940	1324500	I think it's an indie game, specifically, it's an, it's an incredible piece of work,
1324500	1329940	and the guy, you know, deserves a lot of credit for that game, so when I sit here and say,
1329940	1334780	I hate the game, I don't really hate the game, I just hate what it does to me, I actually
1334780	1339980	respect it an awful lot, so. Have you seen the, the Twitter pics about, like, them building
1339980	1346260	the actual, um, animatronics that are gonna be for the movie? Oh, God. It's all practical
1346260	1350160	effects, too. Oh, no. And it's been, I think it was Jim Henson's Creature Workshop, they're
1350160	1353540	doing it? Oh, no. Yeah, it's gonna be awesome. I think we have a story on the movie coming
1353540	1358260	up later, so, I don't know, it's gonna be scary, alright. Uh, Fifth Dream in Chat, over
1358260	1362500	at Live.Vocanilwork.com, says Five Nights at Freddy's equals twenty-six haunted house,
1362500	1366940	twenty-six hundred haunted house. I don't know, haunted house on the Atari 2600 was
1366940	1371500	pretty fucking scary, I'm just saying. But Atari 2600 also didn't have the breathing
1371500	1375500	noises that you had to react to, so there, there is that, I will give it that. So what
1375500	1381300	was it, I mean, I guess I'll have to watch the video, but what was it that made you jump?
1381300	1387060	Okay, so, the way that part four plays is very different than part one, and I, here's
1387060	1391140	the funny thing, and I even say this in video, I never played part two and three, I, I sorta
1391140	1396640	know, like, how those games go, but I never play them. But, um, instead of just, like,
1396640	1401180	clicking on different, like, you would actually, you, you do this weird thing with a mouse
1401180	1406040	where you swipe it down and it causes your child to run to the door, and so when you're
1406040	1411980	at the door, you either shine the flashlight to scare the monster back, or if you hear
1411980	1415860	the breathing noise, that means they're right there, and if you shine the flashlight, they're
1415860	1420700	gonna get you. So if you hear the breathing noise, you shut the door. So you have a door
1420700	1424140	on the left, a door on the right, a closet, and then behind you, you have to keep checking
1424140	1428620	the bed, right? So, you know, I'm running to the door, shine the light, running to the
1428620	1431740	door, shine the light, so I keep running to the doors, and then finally, I run to one
1431740	1435420	of the doors and I shine the light, and it goes, BAAAAH! And it's like, there's a big
1435420	1440980	monster right there, and I just, I just... You were taking, you were shining it too quickly.
1440980	1444660	I was, I wasn't, I guess I wasn't listening enough for the breathing noise. I don't think
1444660	1448180	it was loud enough. Yeah, but to be fair, the volume was kind of down, and you guys
1448180	1451760	were talking, so it would be hard for me to hear the breathing anyway, so I just kind
1451760	1457540	of got in a routine, and then I got the pants scared off of me, so. But it was, it was very
1457540	1461760	good at jump scares, very effective. Fifth Dreamin's chat says, sounds like this game
1461760	1466500	would give me a heart attack. It might, it very well might, so be careful. Alright, other
1466500	1470540	games I played this week, because there were others. Again, you know, more Final Fantasy
1470540	1475020	XIV, I mentioned Velocity 2X earlier, but there was a new game I played this week that
1475020	1478300	I want to mention and give a shout out to, because I don't think there's enough people
1478300	1482980	talking about this game, and I think, I think it's definitely worth a look. And the game
1482980	1492220	is King's Quest Episode 1, which is a reimagining of the classic PC series of King's Quest.
1492220	1498160	There's even some, it's not a sequel or anything like that, it's more of a reimagining, a retelling,
1498160	1503060	but it doesn't necessarily follow the plot of the first game word for word. But there
1503060	1509000	are elements of the first game, like the whole fact that you go into a cave to get a mirror
1509000	1514480	from a dragon, there's elements of that in the new game, but it's like a completely different
1514480	1519840	way of telling the story, because you have old Graham, who's voiced by Christopher Lloyd
1519840	1524040	by the way, which I thought was awesome, you have old Graham kind of telling the story
1524040	1529240	to his granddaughter, who has aspirations of her own, and I thought that was a really
1529240	1532960	neat way to do it, and that's why a lot of people are calling it Princess Bride style
1532960	1537340	King's Quest, which actually kind of fits. And here's the crazy thing, Wallace Shawn,
1537340	1542580	you know that name? He's the guy, inconceivable, that guy? He's a fucking voice in the game,
1542580	1545760	so no wonder everybody's calling it like a Princess Bride type of game, because he plays
1545760	1550480	an important character in the game. So I just, here's the thing about King's Quest, I was
1550480	1556080	very nervous about it, because the old games are point and click, sometimes type, it's
1556080	1561240	a very kind of open thing, so when I was moving to PlayStation 4, I was a little worried,
1561240	1566040	like how is that going to translate, like I'm kind of worried about that, but it actually
1566040	1571680	works really well, like they took elements of the old interface and kind of made it work
1571680	1576380	with a controller, and I was worried that it was going to be a lot of platforming stuff,
1576380	1581500	and there's a little bit of that, but the platforming sequences feel more like I'm playing
1581500	1589260	Dragon's Lair or something, like it's hard to explain, it's not like crazy action based,
1589260	1593180	and I still feel like it definitely has the element of the old games. And what's great
1593180	1598180	is that the writing is also very well done, because there's all these stupid puns, there's
1598180	1602820	these silly death sequences that would immediately be followed by commentary, like what's the
1602820	1608020	very first one, there's one room where you have two levers, there's one on the left and
1608020	1611300	one on the right, and they say that you have to pull one of the levers to continue, so
1611300	1614700	if you pull the one on the left, you're going to get smushed by something, and it gets flattened
1614700	1619620	against the wall, and so you have this silly death sequence, cartoony stuff, just like
1619620	1623560	in the old games, and then Christopher Lloyd pops in and says, and that's what of what
1623560	1627580	happened if I pulled the lever on the left, good thing I pulled the one on the right,
1627580	1632180	and then you hit continue, like it's just, I don't know, it's like silly self referential
1632220	1637340	like that, so yeah, and one other thing I have to point out that I really liked about
1637340	1643340	the game were some of the animations of Graham are hilarious, because there's like one scene
1643340	1647960	where he's running away from the dragon real quick, and the way he's running is like with
1647960	1652820	his arms flailing around and up in the air, and it's just like that silly humor that made
1652820	1658340	the old games great, so I really have to hand it to Odd Gentlemen, because I feel like they
1658340	1663300	really did capture the essence of the old games in this new type of format, the only
1663300	1669040	really complaint I can think of is that you can't skip any voice acting scenes, which
1669040	1672900	can be frustrating if you're like looking at the same thing over and over, but that's,
1672900	1677180	usually the scenes are pretty short, so it's not a big deal, and then like especially in
1677180	1684180	the beginning, it's really easy, it's really easy, but I figure, A, it's the beginning,
1684300	1691300	B, King's Quest was a game that I was playing when I was like 10 to 12 years old, so I do
1692400	1697980	have to kind of realize that this King's Quest probably isn't totally designed with me in
1697980	1703540	mind, like the audience of the original games, it's probably designed for the 10 to 12 year
1703540	1708460	olds of today, which is an interesting parallel to the way the whole story is framed anyway,
1708460	1711860	with grandpa telling the granddaughter about his adventures, I don't know if maybe that's
1711860	1716660	an intentional little wink and a nod to the re-imagining itself, but, so if you're willing
1716660	1720980	to forgive that, to get some of the humor and things like that, I think you'll enjoy
1720980	1727580	King's Quest, I know I'm really enjoying it, and I picked up the whole complete collection
1727580	1732780	or what it's called, so, very cool. Fifth Dream in chat says, oh I need this King's
1732780	1738260	Quest now, the first one was probably the first home computer game I ever played. Alex
1738260	1742060	P. Carson in our chat room saying, I want to play the Stanley Parable now, I guess,
1742060	1746280	I have to admit, I've only played like a little bit of Stanley Parable, but there's a lot
1746280	1753280	of that same tongue and cheek kind of humor, cheeky humor, right? Very cheeky. Alright,
1753460	1756860	so anyway, that's it for our gaming week, so let's get into housekeeping and then we'll
1756860	1761520	get into the news for tonight, so, for tonight's housekeeping, just quickly, please follow

1774100	1778340	wherever you can get YouTube, which is pretty much everywhere. We will be back to our normal
1778340	1785340	time live at 6 o'clock pacific, 9 o'clock eastern, next week on the 9th, and that is
1785600	1790580	pretty much all I can think of for now, so let's get into some news. Loki.
1790580	1797580	So, Ouya has had a rough life, I guess. It started off pretty strong with Kickstarter
1798300	1804700	being one of the most backed, you know, game-related Kickstarters or technology-related Kickstarters,
1804700	1810060	and just never really kind of got its momentum after that. You know, the system wasn't that
1810060	1817060	great and there was just a whole lot of, I don't know, broken promises, I guess, you
1818060	1822380	know, it took forever to get stuff out to them. Well, finally, you know, back a few
1822380	1827900	weeks ago, you know, they were trying to sell the company, and they managed to do that,
1827900	1834900	so Razer actually acquired Ouya, and along with that, Julie Ehrman has basically left
1835440	1841420	the company. Now, what Razer is going to be doing with Ouya is actually using it as a
1841420	1846180	brand, so they're not going to be making any more Ouya consoles or anything like that,
1846180	1851980	instead they're playing on rebranding the Ouya store. It's going to be now Cortex for
1851980	1858980	Android TV, as part of, I guess, of their Forge TV Android microconsole platform, which
1859020	1866020	I've never heard of, but okay, cool. And then, along with that, you know, originally when
1867280	1872260	this whole deal took place, I believe Ouya had contacted the developers that are part
1872260	1877820	of that program where, basically, if you put stuff on the Ouya, they would kind of
1877820	1882620	help you with your funding, they would match your backers up to a certain amount, or your
1882620	1886660	backing, and they were basically saying, well, because of this deal, we're just not going
1886660	1892700	to pay you any more. Thankfully, though, Razer did step in, and they are going to be paying
1892700	1899700	the developers for that initiative, so that's good news, at least. Yeah, because I was going
1902260	1908260	to say, a lot of game developers were really counting on that money, so I'm glad to see
1908260	1913740	that they're going to be actually offering that to the developers, as kind of a sign
1913740	1919600	of goodwill. So, why do we think, and I open this question up to the chatroom as well,
1919600	1926180	why didn't Ouya make it? You know, I guess, you know, getting acquired isn't the same
1926180	1930680	as going under, so it's not like Ouya's completely dead, but why is Ouya having to basically
1930680	1934760	sell off when, you know, in the beginning, they were talking about it being a competitor
1934760	1940680	to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, like the cheap console, essentially. What happened? I open
1940680	1944720	this up to chat as well. I have a controversial opinion, but, Logie, go ahead. I think this
1944720	1950080	technology moved too fast. Their idea was a neat idea at first, but then now, any device
1950080	1954080	you can hook it up to, TV, and it's way more powerful. Like, by the time that Ouya came
1954080	1958800	out, it was just underpowered. They're like, well, it's okay, you know, because this processor
1958800	1962920	that's in there, you know, now that you don't have to actually have, like, a phone OS in
1962920	1968600	there, and it'll be wired, you know, plugged in, you know, we can unlock the extra processing
1968600	1973480	power, and it just didn't matter. It just didn't matter, and people weren't buying the
1973480	1979160	games on their platform, they were using it for an emulator. Yeah, and honestly, that's
1979160	1983920	where my thought process goes, and I know this is not going to be a popular opinion,
1983920	1988540	especially among indie developer friends of mine, but I honest to God think this is what's
1988540	1994380	going on with Ouya, and I'm just going to tell it to you, honestly, how I think it is.
1994380	2000200	I think most people kickstarted the Ouya under the pretenses that it was going to be an easy
2000200	2004700	emulator for their television, that it was going to be an easy way to get all these Nintendo
2004700	2009300	games and Super Nintendo and Genesis games on your television, and I think that's what
2009300	2014940	most people ordered, not all, but most people ordered the Ouya under those pretenses, and
2014940	2020180	so, you know, you've got this box that does this questionably legal thing, you know, emulators
2020180	2026260	are in this extremely gray area when it comes to legality, right? So, you know, the Ouya
2026260	2032380	sells all these Kickstarter units based on those pretenses, you know, again, I believe
2032380	2038940	the majority, not everything, but then, because, well, an emulator gray area legally is not
2038940	2043140	going to sustain your business, it's not going to keep things moving, you know, they're trying
2043180	2048340	to legitimize it with this store and all these indie efforts that they're doing, but I don't
2048340	2053220	think most people were interested in the legitimate things the console could do, which is sad.
2053220	2058140	It was just the way that they kind of handled everything, because even the people that backed
2058140	2061700	in on Kickstarter, a lot of them didn't get their units right away, they were hitting
2061700	2065940	store shelves before they were getting their units, and even when it did come out, like,
2065940	2069580	the controller was shit, and it was just like all these ideas that they had, they're like,
2069580	2074540	yeah, it's going to be this, and it just wasn't very good, and I just think it just
2074540	2078100	over well, overall underwhelmed everybody.
2078100	2082500	Which is kind of a shame, because I do applaud some of the things that Ouya was doing for
2082500	2087620	the indie community there towards, you know, in the last year or so, and I like that they
2087620	2091340	were trying to kind of carve themselves a niche for that, and when you go to things
2091340	2096460	like, you know, indie mega boosts at different shows like PAX and so forth, you see a lot
2096460	2101300	of games, or have seen a lot of games, that are PC and Ouya, because Ouya's really embraced
2101300	2106060	that, but unfortunately, there just weren't enough people interested in buying console
2106060	2107060	for that.
2107060	2110340	That's what's also disappointing about the PlayStation TV, is that could have potentially
2110340	2115580	been like the Ouya, as a sense, you know, where you would have this PlayStation mobile
2115580	2119100	platform that you could develop games for, and let's be honest, you probably develop
2119100	2123460	games that are pretty similar to Ouya, maybe, I'm not sure power-wise versus the Vita and
2123460	2124460	the Ouya.
2124460	2129060	I think the Vita was more powerful, but, you know, you could develop games for the Vita,
2129060	2131660	and still have it being able to be played on the TV.
2131660	2135420	I thought that was an excellent idea, and they just shut it down immediately.
2135420	2136420	Now what?
2136420	2138860	Now, what good is that?
2138860	2139860	Yeah.
2139860	2140860	Well, we'll see.
2140860	2145380	I mean, we're eulogizing Ouya, but that's not really what's happening, because Razer's
2145380	2146620	picked it up.
2146620	2151580	Maybe they're gonna transform it into something, you know, maybe this product that's out there
2151580	2155460	the more legitimate, not that you necessarily won't be able to put emulators on it, but
2155460	2159300	maybe they'll try to transform it into something like, I don't know, like look at Raspberry
2159300	2163640	Pi, and, you know, something like that does very well, so maybe they'll kind of approach
2163640	2165140	it a different way, maybe, rebrand it.
2165140	2168020	Well, and that was the other thing too, with the Ouya, they're like, oh well, it's gonna
2168020	2171300	be completely open, you'll be able to jailbreak it once you get it.
2171300	2173180	No, that never was a thing.
2173180	2175220	That never happened.
2175220	2180740	You could sideload things into it, and I'm sorry, but even like with whatever Razer's
2180740	2185500	putting out, if it runs Android, and you can sideload shit into it, it's gonna be playing
2185500	2186500	emulator games.
2186500	2189580	I mean, seriously, that's what people are gonna do with it.
2189580	2190580	And porn.
2190580	2191580	And porn, right?
2191580	2196620	Well, if it has an internet connection, it's gonna have porn on it, so there's that.
2196620	2197620	That is true.
2197620	2203540	Alright, well anyhow, let's move on from something indie to something very, very big budget,
2203540	2207740	and I get excited about this series, and I know a lot of you out there as well, Dragon
2207740	2210580	Quest XI has been announced.
2210580	2216300	Dragon Quest XI will be coming out for, and this is a very interesting combo here of platforms,
2216300	2222100	Dragon Quest XI is coming out for the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation 4.
2222100	2227140	That was revealed this week at basically a press conference at Square held in Japan,
2227140	2229580	totally dedicated to this effort.
2229580	2235500	What's also interesting is that the Nintendo NX has already been announced as under consideration
2235500	2241020	for this game as well, which is interesting, you know, that even though Nintendo hasn't
2241020	2246120	officially unveiled the platform, we all know it's coming, so people are talking about it
2246120	2248460	like it's a thing, so I kind of find that interesting.
2248460	2249460	So...
2249460	2250460	I just hope it's a good thing.
2250460	2252380	Yeah, well, me too, obviously.
2252380	2257900	They also apparently said Dragon Quest X, which was the MMO, would also be under consideration
2257900	2260700	for the NX.
2260700	2265860	There are apparently two different games with the same story, which Nino Cooney kind of
2265860	2269580	did that as well, so even though you have 3DS and PlayStation 4, I guess they're actually
2269580	2271340	different games.
2271340	2276940	They're slated for a 2016 release to coincide with the 30th birthday of the Dragon Quest
2276940	2284940	series, and so PlayStation 4's runs on Unreal Engine 4, and it's open-ish, sort of like
2284940	2290380	Dragon Quest VIII was, and then 3DS, and this was really cool, a lot of people were commenting
2290380	2291640	on this.
2291640	2299800	The 3DS version has 2D on the bottom, and then on the top, it has the 3D sort of view.
2299800	2302900	And they were kind of quick to clarify, the entire game doesn't run like that, but the
2302900	2306620	little sequences you could see in the preview looked really cool, where it was like old
2306620	2310140	school on the bottom and new school on the top, and I thought that was really neat, that
2310140	2311140	kind of effect.
2311140	2313340	So we'll see how much of that is in the game.
2313340	2320100	Alright, also, now we get excited about a title like this, but that doesn't mean it's
2320100	2326020	coming out in the States, because we never did get Dragon Quest X, so obviously people
2326020	2330900	over here in the States want to know, when do we get our turn for, you know, not just
2330900	2337960	Dragon Quest X, but Dragon Quest XI specifically, and of course there was a comment on this.
2337960	2343060	The Japanese publisher stated, it understandably doesn't have a concrete plan at the moment,
2343060	2347740	but it'll consider it as it has done in the past for other Dragon Quest titles.
2347740	2349940	So that's a big fat maybe.
2349940	2350940	And I'm assuming...
2350940	2355660	Well, consider it if you fund our million dollar Kickstarter.
2355660	2359980	Or Dragon Quest Heroes sells a million copies or whatever, because, you know, I don't...
2359980	2363580	See, and I don't understand, why does Dragon Quest Heroes come out over here when we can't
2363580	2364820	get Dragon Quest XI?
2364820	2366180	No shade to Dragon Quest Heroes.
2366180	2369860	I'm assuming it's because there's less to translate or what have you, but it's still
2369860	2376060	kind of frustrating that, you know, the game we really want isn't being announced at the
2376060	2377060	same time.
2377060	2378060	But whatever.
2378060	2382560	I'm sure there'll be a lot of people that will import Dragon Quest XI anyway, and make
2382560	2386980	their way, crash and burn their way through all the heavy Japanese in the game, and enjoy
2386980	2388780	the 2D and 3D sequences.
2388780	2389780	We'll see.
2389780	2390780	Anyhow.
2390780	2391780	Moving on.
2391780	2394820	Well, you remember Zombie U, Rob?
2394820	2396420	I do!
2396420	2399340	That was one of the great games that was launched with the console.
2399340	2406300	Well, it's going to be re-released on PC, PS4, and Xbox One as just Zombie, with an
2406300	2413820	I at the end and no E. It's basically going to be out on August 18th, so we don't have
2413820	2415780	too long to wait for it.
2415780	2423580	It will, basically it's got Permadeath as a feature in the game where, when you get
2423580	2428820	eaten by zombies, you leave a survival pack with your gear in it, and you have the choice
2428820	2438660	as a new survivor to go retrieve your pack from your previous, now zombified, uh, self.
2438660	2443900	Yeah, it's a very Dark Souls, and the Wii U version of this too is a very Dark Souls
2443900	2445300	element to it.
2445300	2447140	It'll be digital download only.
2447140	2449020	Oh, that I didn't realize.
2449020	2450020	Yep.
2450020	2452020	So if you want to find out more, go to zombiegame.com.
2452020	2453020	Interesting.
2453020	2454020	Z-O-M-B-I.
2454020	2455540	I think it comes out in a few weeks too.
2455540	2456540	That's what I just said.
2456540	2457540	That's what I just said.
2457540	2458540	August 18th or whatever.
2458540	2462540	But, uh, yeah, I know we had a rumor on this a couple weeks ago, so it's interesting that
2462540	2467020	now it's been confirmed, and that it's, I didn't, I kind of assumed they would do a
2467020	2470320	physical release for the holidays, so that's very interesting that they're unloading it
2470320	2471320	as a digital game.
2471320	2475260	I get a feeling they're really trying to make some money back that they might have lost
2475260	2478260	on the Wii U version, and maybe there was some sort of agreement.
2478260	2484340	I don't, maybe because Nintendo, Nintendo did do some marketing with ZombiU, right?
2484420	2489060	Because wasn't there an actual ZombiU Wii U in the very beginning?
2489060	2492340	I feel like Nintendo actually had a bundle that came with it, so maybe there was some
2492340	2497400	sort of agreement, things, that's finally expired, because we're, what, three years
2497400	2499500	since the launch of the Wii U now, so.
2499500	2503340	Maybe they will have made improvements since it's coming out on more advanced systems.
2503340	2504340	Yeah.
2504340	2510020	Although, you know, the gamepad really did have a unique element in ZombiU, so it'll
2510020	2513740	be interesting to see how they kind of accommodate for that, but I bet it's the type of thing
2513780	2518820	where you press select or something, and it just, it pops up like your person's going
2518820	2522100	to hold a fake gamepad or something, like, and it'll just kind of do something.
2522100	2523100	That's probably what happened.
2523100	2530100	There was a ZombiU Deluxe Wii U console, and they're still selling it on Amazon.
2530100	2531100	Interesting.
2531100	2534980	So, yeah, I would think because of that, that Nintendo and Ubisoft had some type of arrangement
2534980	2539020	there, so maybe that's why it's taken three years for this to happen, but Ubisoft probably
2539020	2540540	wants to make some of their money back.
2540540	2545820	And if this game does really, really well, maybe that's why they'll be a sequel, but
2545820	2546820	I don't know.
2546820	2549180	When you're unloading it digitally like that, who knows?
2549180	2550580	I'm not sure.
2550580	2551580	All right.
2551580	2553780	Well, I don't know if I'll buy the game again.
2553780	2557380	I already had it on Wii U, and I'm a little disappointed that Ubisoft just decided to
2557380	2562700	fuck off on the Wii U, so I don't know if I'll be supporting this on other platforms,
2562700	2566220	but props to those without a Wii U that want to try it.
2566220	2567220	Moving on.
2567580	2575100	So it appears that the Mighty No. 9 may be quietly delayed past its September 15th release,
2575100	2580260	and this is coming from Game Informer, which, of course, is associated with GameStop, who
2580260	2583260	basically says, hey, guess what?
2583260	2589140	That apparently this delay is being initiated by the publisher, and this includes different
2589140	2594500	placeholder dates that are being put into place that indicates a 2016 release by Deep
2594500	2595500	Silver.
2595500	2602220	Oh, concept right now isn't confirming that if it's been delayed or not, but it probably
2602220	2605300	has been.
2605300	2609580	This is very interesting in light of what we were saying about the Red Ash Kickstarter,
2609580	2613260	where they were asking for more money before the first game was even out, which if you
2613260	2618660	really sit down and think about rationally how long it takes to make a game make sense,
2618660	2622140	but you know the general population and the perception is going to be, why are you asking
2622140	2624180	for money when your first game isn't even out?
2624180	2628260	And now it's going to take even longer for that first game to come out, which is fine.
2628260	2632620	If that's what they've got to do to make sure it's a good game, then do it, but you know.
2632620	2636420	And then that Red Ash Kickstarter, man, then what happened?
2636420	2639380	Didn't somebody else come in at the end, like a company out of China or something came in
2639380	2644660	and ended up funding the whole thing, and then now they're saying the Kickstarter is
2644660	2650540	just a stretch goal Kickstarter, and it just got really weird towards the end there.
2650540	2652040	I honestly don't care.
2652040	2653040	I didn't back it.
2653040	2654040	I didn't either.
2654040	2655040	I'll play it when it comes out.
2655040	2656040	But I didn't back my Mighty No. 9 either.
2656040	2657040	Same thing.
2657040	2658040	I'll play that when it comes out.
2658040	2659040	I'm just not backing it.
2659040	2660040	Yeah.
2660040	2661040	I'll play Mighty No. 9 when it comes out.
2661040	2665160	I really want to try it, but by the time I was like, maybe I will kick in the money.
2665160	2666160	They didn't need it.
2666160	2670160	I mean, Mighty No. 9 had like millions and millions of dollars, so I was like, eh, I'll
2670160	2671160	just wait.
2671160	2672160	I'll wait.
2672160	2675720	Anyhow, we'll see what happens with that.
2675720	2676720	All right.
2676720	2681360	Well, this week I'm sure a lot of you were checking out Windows 10 because the Windows
2681360	2683520	10 rollout began this week.
2683520	2688840	And of course, I'm sure as many of you know, Windows 10 is a free upgrade for those of
2688840	2691200	you running Windows 7 and Windows 8.
2691200	2692200	8.1.
2692200	2693200	Oh, sorry.
2693200	2694200	8.1.
2694200	2698960	Or it has to be Windows 7, I think, Service Pack 1 for whatever that's worth.
2698960	2705540	But Windows is now having to compete, I suppose, on a level with iOS where those upgrades have
2705540	2707000	been free for a while.
2707000	2713200	And I think the operating systems on the MacBooks and stuff are free now, too, right?
2713200	2716480	So this is why Windows is probably having to do something more.
2716480	2720840	I guess it makes sense because when you think about it, unless you're trying to install
2720840	2726440	Linux on one of those devices, you're not really, like on PCs, at least you have a little
2726440	2730400	bit of competition and choice where you can put Linux or you can put Windows.
2730400	2731400	True.
2731400	2737080	Well, also, and then you see that Microsoft really integrates its store into things.
2737080	2740960	You know, if you've used Windows 10 at all and that default, you know, they have their
2740960	2741960	store.
2741960	2748140	I have attempted to remove Candy Crush Saga a few times, and it's sticky.
2748140	2750400	It doesn't want to leave my computer.
2750400	2751400	Really?
2751400	2752400	Mine didn't have Candy Crush Saga.
2752400	2754380	Oh, all of them have Candy Crush Saga.
2754380	2755920	You just haven't looked yet.
2755920	2756920	I guess not.
2756920	2757920	I guess he's never upgrading.
2757920	2758920	I know, right?
2758920	2760640	But no, there's got to be a way.
2760640	2763000	Surely there's a mod to scrape it from your system.
2763000	2768120	No, you can undelete it, or you can delete it, but I attempted it once, and I thought
2768120	2770520	it removed it, but then it came, it was still there.
2770520	2771520	And so then I went back.
2771520	2773000	Cat came back the very next day.
2773000	2778060	Yeah, I went ahead and removed it, and then now it's gone, but it's like, you know, remember
2778060	2781040	we had that story a while ago where they were going to offer it for free because people
2781040	2782040	love that game.
2782040	2783040	Oh, people love Candy Crush.
2783040	2784040	People love it.
2784040	2785040	Yes, yes.
2785040	2789800	As the progress bar was going by, you know, undeleting it, I was flipping off the computer
2789800	2790800	the entire time.
2790800	2793800	I was like, fuck you, King.
2793800	2796680	The candy came back the very next day.
2796680	2798520	Oh my God.
2798520	2801240	So anyway, so a lot of you were upgrading to Windows 10, I'm sure.
2801240	2802240	I know I did.
2802240	2804160	I actually was still running Windows 7.
2804160	2807760	I just ended up staying away from Windows 8 because a lot of people I talked to didn't
2807760	2809840	really like it, but I was like, what the hell?
2809840	2810840	Windows 10 is free.
2810840	2811840	Let's do it.
2811840	2815160	So I upgraded, and yeah, I think it's fine.
2815160	2816160	It's all right.
2816160	2821000	It didn't, like, change my world or anything, but the only real big, big difference I noticed
2821000	2823520	is the start menu.
2823520	2828120	You know, it kind of has some of the eight elements in it, and you see this on the Xbox
2828120	2830080	too with the different tiles, but I don't know.
2830080	2831080	I was able to unpin all the graphics.
2831080	2832080	Yeah, most of those tiles are useless.
2832080	2833840	Let me just pull mine up here real quick.
2833840	2837040	Okay, it has some photos that apparently I have on my computer.
2837040	2841220	It has, oh, my tweets are finally there now.
2841220	2846780	It's asking me to buy Microsoft's Solitaire collection.
2846780	2852180	Oh, did you get in on the Minecraft Windows 10 beta edition because that's free as well
2852180	2853180	if you own Minecraft.
2853180	2854180	Oh, no, I didn't check that out yet.
2854180	2855180	Yeah, you should register for that.
2855180	2860020	You know what game comes installed on OS X?
2860020	2861020	The Dark Castle.
2861020	2862020	Chess.
2862020	2864980	I was going to say no games because...
2864980	2865980	That's it.
2865980	2866980	Stop.
2866980	2867980	That's it.
2868740	2874060	I finally uninstalled Borderlands, but I've got Diablo on here, so I've had no problems
2874060	2875060	playing games.
2875060	2876060	Yeah.
2876060	2877060	Fun.
2878860	2883300	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade at vognetwork.com,
2883300	2886060	use the passphrase, Friday.
2886060	2891340	But anyway, back to Windows 10, the thing I really wanted to talk about, of course,
2891340	2896100	is that now you can stream Xbox One games to your PC.
2896100	2897100	That's a whole big thing in it.
2897220	2899060	And I have to admit, I didn't really try this.
2899060	2903380	I thought it would just be magic and would happen if my Xbox was on and I had the Xbox
2903380	2907540	app open, but I guess you have to actually have a controller plugged in, and I didn't
2907540	2908540	have that.
2908540	2909820	So I was like, why doesn't a streaming button show up?
2909820	2913060	But I guess you have to actually have the Xbox One controller plugged in, and then it,
2913060	2915620	I guess, opens up those extra features or whatever.
2915620	2920560	But I did think the Xbox app within Windows 10 was kind of interesting.
2920560	2923980	And it also kind of goes to show why they might have chosen to make Windows 10 free
2924180	2927980	as they're trying to have you in this ecosystem.
2927980	2934180	They want you in the Microsoft ecosystem where you have an Xbox One and it chats with that.
2934180	2938580	And I'm sure they want you to get a Windows phone as well, although I noticed their phone
2938580	2941540	app would work with Android and iPhone.
2941540	2942540	So I thought that was kind of interesting.
2942540	2947980	I mean, they kind of know that not as many people have a Windows phone.
2947980	2951940	Tigercall on chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, if you don't like the Windows 10 start
2951940	2956460	menu, you can download a program called Classic Shell, which will replace the start menu with
2956460	2959020	the Windows 7 start menu.
2959020	2962500	Fabrice from Belgium says, the start menu isn't bad at all.
2962500	2965780	In fact, things got a lot less complicated.
2965780	2969180	I think if there's like, you know, just a handful of programs you use on a regular basis,
2969180	2975260	it makes it like I pinned Google Chrome and Final Fantasy 14 and Steam all to my little
2975260	2976260	thing.
2976260	2977260	And it's right there.
2977260	2978260	It's nice.
2978260	2982300	I'm not entirely a huge fan of like searching for programs through the all apps.
2982300	2987100	I know it's everything's alphabetical, but sometimes, you know, I just need to use the
2987100	2989260	search bar to find it.
2989260	2993440	Hey, I launched MIRC today with my voice thanks to Cortana.
2993440	2996220	So I tested that out just for the fuck of it.
2996220	2997220	Yeah.
2997220	2998220	And it worked.
2998220	3002180	I just wish it would be always listening because, you know, I have to click this little listen
3002180	3004580	button for it to do something.
3004580	3005580	Do something.
3005580	3008140	It says, ask me anything.
3009020	3010900	What is the weather like?
3010900	3015420	Ask it to divide by zero and see if she reads you like Siri does.
3015420	3022180	Divide by zero.
3022180	3026060	Why did it launch Microsoft Edge when you told it to divide by zero?
3026060	3029580	It just did a search for Bing for divide by zero.
3029580	3031240	That's what happens when you divide by zero.
3031240	3034500	You get Microsoft Edge.
3034500	3037020	It's just Internet Explorer divided by zero.
3037060	3038060	It pretty much is.
3038060	3039740	I mean, they even use the same logo.
3039740	3043020	There's nothing edgy about that other than the E has an edge.
3043020	3045260	The E's got a razor sharp edge.
3045260	3047260	It's what the kids love, Loki.
3047260	3048260	It's edgy.
3048260	3049260	All right.
3049260	3053980	Anyhow, all the other people are using Chrome and Firefox.
3053980	3060260	I'm just going to be different and I'm going to use Edge because I'm cool.
3060260	3061260	Yeah.
3061260	3063140	I use this browser called Microsoft Edge.
3063180	3066180	You probably never heard of it.
3066180	3070980	Anyhow, moving on, Dark Sakura, save us from this hipster talk.
3070980	3075260	Sorry, I was busy playing Minesweeper on my Mac.
3075260	3076260	Anyway.
3076260	3078700	That's an abomination right there.
3078700	3083940	Did you divide mines by zero?
3083940	3085740	Did I just divide Jamie by zero?
3085740	3088500	Blink, blink, blink, blink.
3088500	3093020	So how about some Sony stuff?
3093020	3098900	They released their earnings report and said that they have shipped I think over three
3098900	3104900	million PlayStation 4 consoles worldwide as of June 30th.
3104900	3112860	And so that's twenty five point three million as of that date.
3112860	3116460	I mean, it's considering that it started shipping as of the end of 2013.
3116460	3118380	So that's pretty good, I would say.
3118380	3125000	They are still outselling the Xbox One, though we haven't heard anything from Microsoft officially
3125000	3131020	on their numbers, but yeah.
3131020	3134940	Let's talk about their install base of Windows 10 and like pimp that out.
3134940	3137540	I'll just sit back and roll my eyes really hard.
3137540	3142620	I know Xbox One's been doing better, especially ever since the price drop and some of that
3142620	3143620	other stuff.
3143620	3148140	Ever since they announced that Tomb Raider is going to be absolutely exclusive to Xbox,
3148140	3151940	there is no way you're going to be able to play that in anything other than Xbox when
3151940	3153260	it's originally launched.
3153260	3156220	I don't think Xbox One is bad or anything at all.
3156220	3157700	I'm having a good time with mine.
3157700	3164480	So I think I think they're closing the gap, but they're like much more slowly than they
3164480	3165480	need to be.
3165480	3169940	And the gap is just like the Sony generation.
3169940	3172060	Actually that's not a bad way to put it.
3172060	3176400	I think what's happening to Microsoft this generation is exactly what happened to Sony
3176400	3177460	last generation.
3177460	3182460	It's like the tables have turned completely and it all goes, and for the same fucking
3182460	3183900	reasons too.
3183900	3188900	You know, PlayStation was a laughing stock in 2006 during that press conference with
3188900	3192220	the giant enemy crabs and all that stuff when they originally announced the PlayStation
3192220	3193220	3.
3193220	3198100	And then I wouldn't say Microsoft was necessarily a laughing stock, but the internet definitely
3198100	3202980	rebelled against those policies that Microsoft originally had in place.
3202980	3205740	And you know, PlayStation tore him a new asshole at that E3.
3205740	3207420	We all know about that.
3207420	3214900	And even though Microsoft went back and changed things, which they needed to do, perception
3214900	3216800	is a huge part of things.
3216800	3222180	And by that point, Sony had already opened the wound too much and the Kinect thing still
3222180	3225420	made the Xbox more expensive, yada, yada, yada.
3225420	3229700	So I think these are things that Microsoft is slowly recovering from.
3229700	3233940	But when we looked at the end of last generation, you know, the PlayStation 3 closed the gap
3233940	3235060	quite a bit.
3235060	3239300	You know, everybody appreciated PlayStation 3 and it wasn't, you know, a laughing stock
3239300	3240300	anymore.
3240300	3243660	And I really think that's where Xbox One's going to be in another couple of years.
3243660	3245580	And it's making progress towards that now.
3245580	3247360	Yeah, I don't think it's going to take that long either.
3247360	3252340	And looking at what they potentially are going to be announcing here soon, they could have
3252340	3258700	a really strong lineup as compared to Sony, which, God, what the fuck do they have coming
3258700	3259700	out?
3259700	3260700	And that's sad.
3260700	3265020	It's the last few years it's been just like, what the fuck is coming out on Sony's platforms
3265020	3267300	I mean, they got Uncharted 4.
3267300	3268300	Cool.
3268300	3271380	I mean, but what other first party titles?
3271380	3275460	They're really lacking in the first party title area, which is kind of weird.
3275460	3276460	Yeah.
3276460	3279820	Well, anyway, I will say this one other thing I want to say about Xbox, because I truly
3279820	3284580	believe this to be true, is that ever since Phil Spencer took over is when things got
3284580	3286460	better over at Microsoft.
3286460	3289820	Like honestly, Don Mattrick ruined the Xbox One launch.
3289820	3294300	Like just, I'm just going to call it like it is the minute they got rid of Don Mattrick
3294300	3296540	and brought Phil Spencer and things started getting better.
3296540	3299780	So just, just calling it like it is.
3299780	3301020	I mean, right.
3301020	3303580	That's what happened, is it not?
3303580	3308740	The minute Don Mattrick went away, they finally started selling Xboxes and where did he end
3308740	3309740	up?
3309740	3310740	Zynga.
3310740	3311740	Anyway.
3311740	3313740	He's done wonders for them.
3313740	3314740	Right?
3314740	3320820	I mean, we haven't even mentioned the word Zynga in quite a long time.
3320820	3321820	In a whole week.
3321820	3322820	All right.
3322940	3325140	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.
3325140	3327700	Let's see what games you can get for these consoles.
3327700	3328700	Coming soon.
3328700	3333180	Well, this is the week that you'll be able to pick up Rare Replay on Xbox One, so that'll
3333180	3334180	be coming out.
3334180	3341140	And then Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold, the Fatinear Knight.
3341140	3344740	Or Fatinear Knight.
3344740	3347860	I don't know how to pronounce that.
3347860	3348860	That's it?
3348860	3349860	That's it.
3349900	3355380	I'm super excited, though, about the following week, because Garfield Kart will be coming
3355380	3356380	out.
3356380	3357380	Really?
3357380	3358380	Yeah, it's on the 3DS.
3358380	3362420	Does Garfield sit in a plate of lasagna that goes around the track?
3362420	3364700	Is that what it is?
3364700	3367900	You know, you laugh.
3367900	3370940	Does he get chased by Nermal?
3370940	3375020	I don't know if he gets chased by Nermal, but no, he does not have a plate of lasagna
3375020	3376020	that he's sitting in.
3376020	3377020	Wow.
3377020	3380580	Jason Chat says, Hello Kitty Racing greater than Garfield Kart.
3380580	3381580	That's probably true.
3381580	3384300	It's probably the exact same game, to be honest.
3384300	3385300	It probably is.
3385300	3389540	It's probably the exact same game, just, you know, reskinned.
3389540	3395260	Alright, let's travel around the world and move on to Japan, where on the 6th of August
3395260	3401660	on the PlayStation 4, Gal Gun Double Piece comes out in regular and limited edition on
3401660	3403220	the PlayStation 4.
3403220	3405700	That is almost worth me picking that up.
3405700	3406700	region free.
3406700	3408100	Gal Gun is pretty fun.
3408100	3414780	The PlayStation 3 has Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate and Shin Sangoko Musou 7 getting price reductions.
3414780	3418880	They go into the best series with those releases.
3418880	3423220	On the Wii U, haha, nothing until September.
3423220	3425540	There is nothing in the entire month of August on the Wii U.
3425540	3429380	But PlayStation Vita, man, that is still kicking over in Japan.
3429380	3435140	Gal Gun Double Piece out there as well as Luminous Arc Infinity and Musou Orochi 2 Ultimate
3435140	3438580	gets a price reduction on the Vita this week.
3438580	3444420	At first when he said Luminous Arc Infinity, I was like, this is another Luminous game?
3444420	3445420	Not the puzzle game.
3445420	3446420	Not to be confused with the puzzle game.
3446420	3448100	Thank you for making me clarify that.
3448100	3452660	On the Nintendo 3DS this week, there's some accessories, like you can get some new stretchy
3452660	3458380	touch pens and new pouches, but as far as actual games go, there's Nobunaga no Yabu
3458380	3465060	2 comes out in a regular and premium box and Sango Kushi 2 comes out in regular and
3465060	3466060	premium box.
3466060	3474020	There's also one other game, Banban Ribbon Tokimeki Korede Kira Kira Dance comes out
3474020	3481260	and I shit you not, this appears to be a game with fuzzy, cute, pink animals and bunnies
3481260	3488260	that you dress up and they dance, like Hakune Mitsu style or something like that.
3488260	3504060	This game looks like a birthday cake threw up all over a video game and that's what
3504060	3507860	you have here in this.
3507860	3508860	But it looks cute.
3508860	3510700	I kind of want it.
3510700	3512420	I don't know.
3512420	3515980	Anyway, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game.
3515980	3516980	How about Europe?
3516980	3519500	Oh I'm sorry, of course Europe!
3519500	3522260	One of those being what's coming out in Europe.
3522260	3524740	One game, Rare Replay for Xbone.
3524740	3527340	Oh they get it early over there, lucky.
3527340	3529300	Oh no, that's next week for us too.
3529300	3530860	That's on the 4th.
3530860	3531860	Yeah.
3531860	3533260	Well that's an important game.
3533260	3534260	Yes.
3534260	3535260	Alright.
3535260	3539500	Now, a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.
3539500	3540500	Loki.
3540500	3544780	It's just seriously the week of games being delayed from Kickstarter.
3544780	3547500	And the next one, Amplitude.
3547500	3550240	Yes, that's being delayed as well.
3550240	3552300	But they're adding more stuff to it.
3552300	3556460	It's just going to be coming out now at the end of 2015.
3556460	3561220	So now, instead of the original 16 tracks it was going to have, they're going to have
3561220	3564620	30 plus additional songs for backers.
3564620	3567340	That's a lot of music.
3567340	3570620	And it's going to be coming out on Playstation 4 this year and I guess there is a Playstation
3570620	3578660	3 version coming out later and they said that also a wide release will be happening
3578660	3581520	early 2016.
3581520	3584060	So the backers are going to get the Playstation 4 this year?
3584060	3585180	Yeah, I guess so.
3585180	3587420	But the rest of us have to wait until 2016.
3587420	3588420	Yeah, that's stupid.
3588420	3590500	Ok, well, whatever.
3590500	3592880	That was part of the perks for kickstarting the game.
3592880	3593880	So whatever.
3593880	3594880	Alright, cool.
3594880	3596820	Hope it's not buggy or anything like that.
3596820	3598300	There you go.
3598300	3603260	Alright and if you are interested in this, I don't know how many of you guys like LootCrate.
3603260	3607380	I know some folks, that's a big thing for unboxing videos and stuff.
3607380	3609940	People like to get their loot and then unbox it.
3609940	3613980	But apparently Nintendo is going to be following suit with something similar.
3613980	3619400	Nintendo over in the UK is going to be offering a special subscription service that is kind
3619400	3622100	of a response in some ways to LootCrate.
3622100	3629440	This will be called the N-Box and will have Nintendo themed toys, clothes, and other accessories.
3629440	3636860	You can just buy the N-Box by itself or you can subscribe to a 3, 6, or 12 month plan.
3636860	3641360	Now I guess right now this is considered a rumor status but it does come from a source
3641360	3643220	that tends to get these things right.
3643220	3648900	So no comment from the official Nintendo UK store as of yet.
3648900	3650100	The N-Box.
3650100	3651720	The N-Box.
3651720	3654920	So is the first shipment going to be the N-Box one?
3654920	3656360	No.
3656360	3661520	I think what will happen with the N-Box is that they're only going to have 10 of them.
3661520	3666320	And so you'll have to show up at 7am to collect tickets and hope that you are one of the lucky
3666320	3667320	ones that gets to buy one of the N-Boxes.
3667320	3668880	You open up an empty box.
3668880	3669880	Sorry.
3669880	3670880	This is hell of a custom.
3670880	3674120	It's a rain check in the box is what it is.
3674120	3676400	Sorry we couldn't make enough of them.
3676400	3677400	Sorry about that.
3677400	3681600	Artetsuya in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm hyped for this.
3681600	3683160	I hope they bring it out over here.
3683160	3687400	Hell, I have my Mario characters, enemies, items shirt on right now.
3687400	3690320	So let me get this straight.
3690320	3693240	Let's just assume that this rumor is true.
3693240	3698120	Instead of you purchasing Nintendo products and redeeming a code to go online to get something
3698120	3702100	for free that's a tchotchke, they're like, you know what?
3702100	3705960	We could fuck these people over even more and make money doing it by offering these
3705960	3709400	tchotchkes instead of as a free reward for purchasing their products because none of
3709400	3710400	the people do that.
3710400	3715200	We're instead going to have you buy these products and we'll give you these tchotchkes
3715200	3718600	instead through that by paying us more money.
3718600	3719600	Good job.
3719600	3723840	Well you never know, to be fair, and this would be kind of interesting, since you can
3723840	3728820	buy these N-Boxes apparently by themselves, wouldn't it be interesting if whatever future
3728820	3733120	reward program Nintendo has incorporates these little boxes?
3733400	3738800	I am really surprised, instead of an N-Box, it's not a question mark block like they have
3738800	3739800	in games, right?
3739800	3741120	Where you open it and there's coins.
3741120	3742120	Anyway, forget it.
3742120	3744560	One of the things that we got arrived in a question mark box.
3744560	3745560	Oh really?
3745560	3749920	From one of the last Club Nintendo registration deals.
3749920	3753800	We have a big group of Mario characters.
3753800	3757440	Well okay, since that was part of Club Nintendo, maybe whatever the successor is, maybe we'll
3757440	3762360	have the N-Box and maybe instead of things selling out so quick on the store, it'll just
3762360	3763360	be a random company.
3763360	3766040	When are we going to hear about the successor of Club Nintendo?
3766040	3768880	I don't know.
3768880	3772480	Maybe they're waiting for the NX or Mobile or something.
3772480	3778640	It would either be Tokyo Game Show or, you know, Nintendo can do the direct whenever
3778640	3779640	they want.
3779640	3780640	Nintendo thing and just keep waiting.
3780640	3783280	Keep waiting for those good games to come, keep waiting for everything to come out.
3783280	3786360	Alright, well I'm sure Loki can't wait for this also.
3786360	3788920	One other quick little thing on products here.
3788920	3793920	Loki, I'm sure, can't wait for Super Mario themed Hot Wheels cars.
3793920	3798960	That's right, Nintendo and Mattel teaming up for Super Mario themed Hot Wheels cars.
3798960	3804600	There is a Super Mario World car, a Super Mario Brothers, Dr. Mario, Super Mario Kart,
3804600	3806520	Super Mario Brothers 2, and Super Mario Brothers 3.
3806520	3811800	As someone pointed out, it was kind of funny, but apparently the Dr. Mario car is a hearse?
3811800	3812800	Actually it is.
3812800	3813880	It does appear to be a hearse.
3813880	3815640	That is actually hilarious.
3815640	3819200	And the Mario Kart car, though, it's an old T-Bird.
3819200	3822000	It's one of the cars we saw driving down the road yesterday, Dark Soccer.
3822000	3824440	It's not an actual kart.
3824440	3825440	You mean Model T?
3825440	3828040	Yeah, Model T. It's crazy.
3828040	3829600	We saw like, what, five of them in a row?
3829600	3832280	Yeah, there was definitely some classic car show going on, wasn't there?
3832280	3839360	So anyway, also, I should point this out, is that I have seen the Atari 2600 Hot Wheels.
3839360	3844000	So Hot Wheels doing video game related things is not unheard of.
3844000	3847920	So this is kind of interesting that they moved on from their 2600 license to now they're
3847920	3849800	doing these Super Mario cars.
3849800	3852840	So that's kind of neat, though.
3852840	3857040	Now I just need one of those sets that, you know, you pull back the spring or whatever
3857040	3859520	and it launches your car around a loop.
3859520	3860520	That's what I need.
3860520	3861520	Just go to any toy store.
3861520	3862520	Remember that cool shit from when we were kids?
3862520	3864200	Oh yeah, they sell a piece mail now.
3864200	3865200	It's super expensive.
3865200	3866200	Of course they do.
3866200	3867840	Of course they do.
3868520	3876320	All right, well before back in the day, before they were putting video games on Hot Wheels,
3876320	3883760	they were putting video games on t-shirts and posters and there was no Hot Wheels.
3883760	3887360	But there was classic games and every week Dark Sakura steps into the vault and finds
3887360	3893920	a classic game that she thinks, hey, you ungrateful little shits, stop playing with your Hot Wheels
3893920	3895480	and play a real game.
3895480	3896820	Damn it.
3896820	3899540	Play this M-rated game instead.
3899540	3904840	Dark Sakura is going to step into the gaming vault and find a classic game of the week.
3904840	3909860	Dark Sakura, what have you picked for this week's classic game of the week?
3909860	3917300	Resident Evil Code Veronica, which was Biohazard Code Veronica.
3917300	3919540	Basically this was the one that came out on Dreamcast.
3920180	3927140	It was released in 2000 and it was the first Resident Evil title to show up on anything
3927140	3928860	that Sony did not make.
3928860	3931500	So this was cool.
3931500	3938740	It focused on Claire, Chris and Steve, who we called Mini DiCaprio back in the day.
3938740	3943100	Yeah, because he looked like a floppy haired Leonardo DiCaprio.
3943100	3946780	And I also will say I am cheating because the only video I could find was the PlayStation
3946780	3947780	2 version.
3947780	3950140	So sorry, I am cheating a little bit.
3950140	3957300	Well, that was the updated version.
3957300	3963780	Came out, which was Code Veronica X, which had new cut scenes, a few graphical changes.
3963780	3969220	It came out on the Dreamcast in Japan and PlayStation 2 worldwide.
3969220	3974180	It also came out on GameCube and there's a high death remaster on Xbox 360 and PlayStation
3974180	3975180	3.
3975580	3978580	And that came out in 2011.
3978580	3986780	Sony basically, it's really just more Resident Evil goodness.
3986780	3990700	The camera is a little bit different instead of just following you around.
3990700	3996220	It swings between different angles.
3996220	4003220	And then you've got a couple weapons you can fire from a first person point of view, like
4003220	4006380	the sniper rifle and the linear launcher.
4006380	4014460	You can also play in first person mode using a minigame, you can unlock it.
4014460	4023980	One of the things that I liked is that this particular one also came out on Arcade as
4023980	4027700	Gun Survivor 2, which I've gotten to play.
4027700	4031620	It always made me think that the Dreamcast should have let you use the controller on
4031620	4033740	the gun to play this one.
4033740	4038860	And then shoot on screen in the first person mode, that would have been so much fun.
4038860	4043700	But yeah, in this one you play as Claire Redfield and Chris Redfield, and you control them at
4043700	4045540	different points of times.
4045540	4049140	You start Claire for the first half and Chris for the second half.
4049140	4052460	And Chris can use all of Claire's weapons and all that.
4052460	4057200	It actually plays a lot more like, I'd say, Nemesis did.
4057200	4060920	You can also unlock different secret characters too.
4060920	4065880	You can play as Wesker, or you can play as Steve.
4065880	4071040	And there's the battle game mode and all kinds of different stuff.
4071040	4080840	So as far as this one, there were, like I said, multiple rereleases.
4080840	4087040	We had the Code Veronica X, we had the rereleases later.
4087040	4092560	And then there was also Gun Survivor 2, which oddly enough my article here does not reference
4092560	4093560	at all.
4093560	4094560	It was great.
4094560	4096480	Oh yeah, there is actually one about it.
4096480	4097480	Okay.
4097480	4101680	So it was adapted into Resident Evil Survivor 2 Code Veronica, which is Biohazard Gun Survivor
4101680	4106680	2 Code Veronica in Japan, which is a first person shooter that you could play with the
4106680	4111040	giant gun and it ran on the NAOMI hardware.
4111040	4117140	It didn't really have much to do with the plot, but a lot of it played the same way.
4117140	4125880	You could play it with the gun con on the Playstation 2, and it was just kind of a different
4125880	4126880	interesting one.
4126880	4127880	It was really fun.
4127880	4132860	And then you got Resident Evil Dark Side Chronicles, which is a rail shooter game on Wii that was
4132860	4136760	based off of Resident Evil 2 and Code Veronica.
4136760	4139280	So overall it was a really good game.
4139280	4144380	It really showed off the Dreamcast nicely and had one of the best intros in it.
4144380	4149720	So I'd say this one's definitely a solid release for the Dreamcast.
4149720	4151200	All right.
4151200	4155240	And then of course if you missed it on Dreamcast, it's like everywhere else because the 360...
4155240	4160340	I remember the 360 one and there's lots of videos out there of that one too, very, very
4160340	4163920	crisp and high def for the last generation.
4163920	4166520	There's no excuse to not check this game out.
4166520	4167520	Not at all.
4167760	4175040	Here it is, Resident Evil Code Veronica, the Dreamcast, Playstation 2, Xbox 360, classic
4175040	4176960	game of the week.
4176960	4179780	All right, we're going to take a quick break folks, but when we come back, there is plenty
4179780	4181080	more show to come.
4181080	4185840	Rapid fire news, your answers to the FUCL Question of the Week and more news, your phone
4185840	4190320	calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
4190320	4193760	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
4197520	4207200	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday afternoon with episode
4207200	4212040	number 608 of our show, August the 2nd of 2015, In Progress.
4212040	4216280	Again, this is an early show, so you're turning into VOG Network thinking I was going to hear
4216280	4217280	music right now.
4217280	4222580	No, OLR is on a little bit early today, so Dark Soccer and I can indulge in a meat buffet
4222580	4227620	later this evening with our dear friend, Victoria, who is moving on to sunnier adventures as
4227620	4230420	if things could get any sunnier in Southern California.
4230420	4233940	So I don't know about you, Dark Soccer, are you looking forward to meat, tasty, tasty
4233940	4234940	meat?
4234940	4235940	Mm, meata.
4235940	4240520	We're talking about where we go to, there's this Brazilian place we love to go to where
4240520	4241520	they have the big...
4241520	4242520	Never been.
4242520	4243740	Oh, that's right, you've never been.
4243740	4247220	I've heard about the elusive creature known as Espituse.
4247220	4253100	Well, then that's kind of a double great thing, is that not only do we get a chance
4253100	4256940	to say goodbye to Victoria, who's texting me right now wondering if we're going to hang
4256940	4257940	out before.
4257940	4262100	I like how it all came down though, because I texted Victoria going, I'm sad that you're
4262100	4263100	leaving, we should hang out.
4263100	4267500	Because I was going to try to go yesterday, but she had to work or something.
4267500	4271220	And so we talked about Sunday and she's like, well, if Rob does my move in the show, then
4271220	4272220	we should hang out.
4272220	4273820	I was like, we should go get dinner.
4273820	4275780	And next thing I know, there's an event up.
4275780	4276780	Yeah.
4276780	4280220	Well, and I certainly wanted a chance to hang out with her too, so I'm kind of glad it worked
4280220	4281220	out this way.
4281220	4284620	And I'm sure the listeners understand once in a while, there's going to be a personal
4284620	4285620	engagement.
4285620	4288660	Once in a time, Victoria trumps OLR.
4288660	4289660	Exactly.
4289660	4290660	Exactly.
4290660	4294140	And well, I mean, it's a dual win thing because we get asked once in a while from our overseas
4294140	4297320	fans, when are you going to do a show that I don't have to stay up till 3 a.m. to listen
4297320	4298320	to?
4298320	4299660	So it's a win-win situation.
4299660	4304700	So everybody wins, except those who forgot we were taping early today.
4304700	4307500	So there you go.
4307500	4312220	Uh, anyhow, let's get back into some gaming news after all we are here to talk about video
4312220	4313220	gaming.
4313220	4316860	Who knows Dark Soccer, if we have time today, maybe you and I, it would just depend on time.
4316860	4320660	Maybe you and I will end up over in Japantown and we can go to that arcade and play the
4320660	4322060	table flipping game.
4322060	4323060	You know what?
4323060	4326020	If we go there, I'd be playing, um, pop and music.
4326020	4327020	Yeah.
4327020	4328020	Pop and music is really fun.
4328020	4330840	I like Taiko No Tachi- or Taiko No Tachi- so I can, I can beat the drum.
4330840	4331840	You want to beat on the drum all day?
4331840	4332840	Yeah.
4332840	4333840	I don't want to work.
4333980	4338000	I have some, a legitimate reason to go there because we need cutting boards since I have
4338000	4339480	to go to Daiso for a bit.
4339480	4340480	Nice.
4340480	4341480	If we go.
4341480	4344040	And hey, I need games for my Japanese PlayStation Vita.
4344040	4345040	Remember that?
4345040	4346040	My Heavensward Vita I got a couple?
4346040	4347040	Oh yeah.
4347040	4348040	I wanted to look.
4348040	4349040	There's a movie.
4349040	4350040	I was telling you about it.
4350040	4351040	Except you can just go out to any store to pick up any game.
4351040	4352440	Yeah, no, I know it's region free.
4352440	4355320	But still, I feel like I need a Japanese game in my Japanese Vita.
4355320	4359640	Well, I was also mentioning to you that like one of my favorite old, um, Japanese revenge
4359640	4362080	movies is an actor's revenge.
4362080	4368120	It was Yukino Joe Henge and, um, it's like seriously one of the best movies ever.
4368120	4370980	And I want to see if I can find it on, uh, Blu-ray.
4370980	4373320	So instead of going to Amazon for it.
4373320	4377160	Even though it's probably way overpriced because this is exactly where you'd expect to find
4377160	4378160	something like this.
4378160	4381040	I still need to get a copy of Spirited Away on Blu-ray because I guess a lot of the Miyazaki
4381040	4382420	stuff got re-released on Blu-ray.
4382420	4385200	So Spirited Away is one of my very favorites.
4385200	4388760	I like looking around at, uh, Japan Video though.
4388760	4389760	Yeah.
4389760	4390760	So.
4390760	4391760	Excellent.
4392040	4396100	We could talk about travels and adventures all day long, but we'll spare you and get
4396100	4398120	back into some video game chat.
4398120	4400440	So let's do some rapid fire news.
4400440	4403640	News that just, we just don't have time to talk about a long time, but we'll spend a
4403640	4404640	little time on this.
4404640	4405640	One last thing.
4405640	4406900	Awesome news stories done quick.
4406900	4408440	This is your trivia for the day.
4408440	4412960	Apparently the announcer for Smash Brothers was the announcer for Bill Nye the Science
4412960	4413960	Guy.
4413960	4414960	I did not know that.
4414960	4415960	Now you know.
4415960	4417160	The more you know.
4417160	4418160	All right.
4418160	4419160	Anyway.
4419160	4420160	Uh, news stories.
4420160	4421160	Loki.
4421160	4426680	Fallout 4 is not going to have mod support when it's launched, which is like a duh because
4426680	4432440	most games when they're released don't have mod support because the tools aren't out there.
4432440	4436880	And that is exactly why it's not going to be available when Fallout 4 is launched.
4436880	4437880	Because guess what?
4437880	4440780	They're not going to have the tools available to make mods.
4440780	4443900	That doesn't mean I don't think you wouldn't see those on PC because people don't like
4443900	4444900	to wait for tools.
4444900	4446860	They'll just do whatever the fuck they want.
4446860	4451980	But the official tools won't be made available until later on.
4451980	4453280	So don't be disappointed.
4453280	4455820	They will come eventually.
4455820	4461940	And along with that, we've also got a pretty cool expansion coming out for Don't Starve.
4461940	4464880	Shipwrecked.
4464880	4466480	And I really need to play this game.
4466480	4470000	I have it installed on my Playstation 4 and I just haven't gotten around to it yet.
4470000	4471100	It's fun.
4471100	4473700	But it is coming out later this fall.
4474500	4480260	It's going to have new playable areas, characters, seasonal effects, creatures, and they said
4480260	4482600	it's described as a sea-bound journey.
4482600	4487540	So I guess I'll have to check it out when it comes out.
4487540	4494580	And then last but not least, Terraria is going to be coming out to the Wii U.
4494580	4495580	And guess what?
4495580	4498180	It's got local and online multiplayer.
4498180	4499180	Online multiplayer?
4499180	4502620	Well, not a Wii U game.
4502620	4505500	It's only something you would see from a third party.
4505500	4508580	Oh, it is a third party.
4508580	4512700	Also the 3DS version of the game will be coming out shortly as well.
4512700	4520140	And that one though only supports up to four player local multiplayer.
4520140	4521140	That's kind of cool though.
4521140	4522540	At least it has some multiplayer.
4522540	4526700	Hopefully they'll be getting all those nice free updates that they do for the game.
4526700	4530380	Well, let's move on and talk about Rare Replay.
4530380	4534380	I am very excited about this collection that's coming out because there's so many great games
4534380	4535380	in it.
4535380	4538100	Although really all I need is Snake, Rattle, and Roll.
4538100	4541460	Is there anything else that anybody actually wants to play in this collection?
4541460	4543780	It's Snake, Rattle, and Roll and a bunch of other shit.
4543780	4548580	Well, Rare Replay is coming out and of course it has 30 games from Rare's history in it.
4548580	4550180	I suppose RC Pro-Am.
4550180	4553140	I would understand if that's one that you're looking forward to as well.
4553140	4557040	However, you know some games got left out because Rare made more than 30 games and some
4557040	4558060	games got left out.
4558060	4560660	You know, like Wizards and Warriors for example.
4560660	4562900	So you never know though.
4562900	4567660	During a Twitch live stream, James Thomas from Rare said that cutting down the list
4567660	4569540	to just 30 was pretty hard.
4569540	4573300	And there's a chance that DLC could happen for more.
4573300	4576580	Which of course, you would think of course something like that's going to happen.
4576580	4577580	But here's the quote.
4577580	4579340	There's a wealth of titles that we could dip into.
4579340	4582020	A huge heritage beyond the 30 that we chose.
4582020	4584860	But that's what made choosing the 30 so hard in the first place.
4584860	4587260	We had to put aside our personal preferences.
4587260	4588260	We hope we've done that.
4588260	4589300	But you never know.
4589300	4591500	There could be space for more.
4591500	4593700	Dun dun dun.
4593700	4596700	Anyhow on a serious note, Diablo 3.
4596700	4598620	You know I love that game.
4598620	4601180	I haven't played it in a little while.
4601180	4603840	But I know there's a new big patch on its way for it.
4603840	4606760	But this was really cool in Diablo 3 what they did.
4606760	4612500	There's an update for Diablo 3 that's going to be paying tribute to Kevin Kani Griffith
4612500	4615460	who was an artist at Blizzard who passed away.
4615460	4622580	Unfortunately in October of 2014, Kevin Griffith passed away from a rare form of cancer known
4622580	4624980	as ASPS.
4624980	4630780	So Kani's cube is actually, I did not realize that, the big cube that is going to be in
4630780	4632400	the game is actually named after him.
4632400	4634300	So I knew that this was a huge part of the patch.
4634300	4637000	I did not realize that it was actually in memory of this guy.
4637000	4638000	That's pretty cool.
4638000	4643040	And it's going to be like the horror dick cube in Diablo 2.
4643040	4645420	This is going to be a game changer.
4645420	4651700	So that's a very great way to memorialize someone that they all respected there at Blizzard.
4651700	4654700	Last but not least, a new Splatfest.
4654700	4657500	I know a lot of you guys love Splatfest.
4657500	4659340	And of course, what teams?
4659340	4662140	You have to know what teams are going to face off against each other because what?
4662140	4663660	We had cats and dogs, right?
4663660	4664820	That was a huge one.
4664820	4668860	And then of course we had water slides and roller coasters, right?
4668860	4669860	Who won that one?
4669860	4670860	Roller coasters of course.
4670860	4671860	They had to win.
4671860	4672860	Of course.
4672860	4673860	They had to win that one.
4673860	4675100	Well, this one's interesting.
4675100	4682260	Coming up Nintendo of America on 8-7 from 9 p.m. Pacific through 8-8 at 9 p.m. Pacific
4682260	4686620	we'll be doing marshmallows versus hot dogs.
4686620	4687620	Of course hot dogs.
4687620	4688620	Hot dogs.
4688620	4690900	Because marshmallows are disgusting.
4690900	4691900	Here's the thing though.
4691900	4693780	My favorite flavor of...
4693780	4695460	Try not to get sick, Darkseidro, but I have to say it.
4695460	4699060	My favorite flavor of Jelly Belly is the toast of marshmallow.
4699060	4701060	I love it.
4701060	4702780	There's no accounting for taste.
4702780	4703780	So good.
4703780	4704780	I'll tell you what.
4704780	4711140	I really don't mind that flavor, but I think marshmallows themselves, the texture and the
4711140	4717860	gooey and it's like eating someone's body refuse.
4717860	4722420	Not to be triggering, but can you stand it if it's melted like cream?
4722420	4723420	Is that okay?
4723420	4724420	No.
4724420	4725420	I hate the taste.
4725420	4726420	I hate the texture.
4726420	4730620	The only time I can eat them is when they've been burned to a crisp and all of the gooeyness
4730620	4733460	is now this crispy vanilla flavored goodness.
4733500	4737420	Well, to be fair, the whole reason they chose these two, of course, is they want to know
4737420	4740380	what you'd rather roast over a campfire.
4740380	4741380	My enemies.
4741380	4743860	Well, you can do that in Splatoon.
4743860	4744940	There you go.
4744940	4749740	You can, you can splatter them with the blood of your enemies.
4749740	4751740	Oh boy.
4751740	4753460	I thought I heard about other...
4753460	4759900	They should have just done, you know, which would you rather have, you know, cannibalism
4759900	4760900	or calamari?
4760900	4761900	Oh, Lord.
4761900	4768020	Um, oh yeah, there are different ones too.
4768020	4770140	So Europe gets a completely different one.
4770140	4771860	So you know what Europe gets?
4771860	4773580	This one's, this was kind of stupid.
4773580	4774580	I'm sorry, Europe.
4774580	4775940	I know this is your day today.
4775940	4779900	Well damn, if that's stupid compared to, you know, marshmallows and hot dogs.
4779900	4782060	This is even worse than marshmallows versus hot dogs.
4782060	4783380	You ready for this?
4783380	4786220	North pole versus South pole.
4786220	4787540	Really?
4787540	4792700	I would pick South pole because that's the only one that actually exists.
4792700	4797580	You know, which I think would be a fun one would be Marmite versus Vegemite.
4797580	4798980	Maybe they're both gross.
4798980	4802380	Why don't you send that over to Nintendo of Australia?
4802380	4804060	It could be very international.
4804060	4808780	I vote for option three stripper pole.
4808780	4810940	I believe stripper pole versus lap dance.
4810940	4814540	Japan was having one as well that I'm saying this off the top of my head.
4814540	4818740	I think it was milk tea and lemon tea.
4818740	4819740	Milk tea.
4819740	4820740	I see.
4820740	4821740	But I like, I like lemon tea.
4821740	4824180	Milk tea is milk tea makes me gassy.
4824180	4830540	I'm sensing, I'm sensing a listless perhaps.
4830540	4831540	What do we do?
4831540	4832540	We did that.
4832540	4833540	Didn't we?
4833540	4835000	Oh no, it was a match game question.
4835000	4839180	Remember when we did match game because, uh, uh, Alan said something really nasty for one
4839180	4840180	of his answers.
4840180	4846340	Something like cream pie versus bukkake or something really nasty.
4846340	4848700	All out versus cow pie.
4848700	4854900	Uh, remember I did, um, Cylon occupied Caprica versus non-silon occupied Caprica.
4854900	4855900	Remember?
4855900	4858540	Oh, now that that's what I want to see.
4858540	4860020	Humans versus Cylons.
4860020	4861020	Get on it, Nintendo.
4861020	4864940	I just don't think it's relevant anymore.
4864940	4865940	What?
4865940	4866940	How dare you?
4866940	4867940	Yes.
4867940	4869260	Dark Galactica will always be relevant.
4869260	4877620	I don't care if it's been 10 years, always, anyway, moving on, so much for rapid fire
4877620	4878620	news.
4878620	4881820	Uh, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us for rapid fire news?
4881820	4884980	Well, um, we have some news about Five Nights at Freddy's movie.
4884980	4888220	I just keep looking at this picture and I think I want it for my desktop.
4888220	4891580	Um, but oh, there's a nice picture of Chica's teeth.
4891580	4893660	Are you going to drag me to see the Five Nights movie?
4893660	4894660	Hell yeah.
4894660	4899860	I kind of want to see it and I just, you know, I'm not a huge, so they have, um, Gil
4899860	4905060	Keenan who is actually, um, on the Poltergeist remake is a director and co-writer, which
4905060	4909620	honestly enough, the, um, I'm very interested in the Poltergeist remake because Poltergeist
4909620	4912140	is like my favorite movie is my favorite kids movie.
4912140	4915180	I heard it wasn't offensively bad as far as remakes go.
4915180	4916300	Did it already come out?
4916300	4917300	That's kind of a compliment.
4917300	4918300	Yeah.
4918300	4919300	Didn't it?
4919300	4920300	I thought, I thought it did.
4920300	4921300	Cause I didn't hear anything about it.
4921300	4922300	I could be wrong.
4922300	4923300	Chatters, do you know?
4923300	4924300	Cause I don't follow movies as well.
4924940	4931380	Anyway, um, it's going to be something that's supposed to be loyal to, you know, loyal to
4931380	4937820	the story for the fans, but not like, you know, Wes Craven, you know, quality.
4937820	4945700	And then, um, there's a story about, uh, Squeenix going out with Yasunori Mitsuda, um, to, uh,
4945700	4949220	do a 20th anniversary Chrono Trigger, uh, album.
4949220	4951940	So, uh, I'm actually super excited about that.
4951980	4954740	And now the name of it, and I'm going to have to read it a little slowly cause it's really
4954740	4963460	is, um, Haruka Naruto Kinoka Nata He is really long.
4963460	4970460	The far beyond the distant time anyway, or which would be too far away times.
4970460	4975700	So, uh, albums with new arrangements, um, for Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross.
4975700	4979660	So very excited about that.
4979700	4982220	I wonder if I could actually say that fast, but I'm not going to try.
4982220	4987740	Um, also Final Fantasy Explorers is going to be coming out to the 3DS, um, on January
4987740	4998420	26th, 2016, which is basically Crystals and War and Planet Power and Monster Hunting.
4998420	5001420	So all the Final Fantasies.
5001420	5007140	Well it's, I say that because it's Final Fantasies franchise's answer to Monster Hunter.
5007140	5008940	It plays a lot like a Monster Hunter game.
5008940	5013100	Uh, Shane has it on the Japanese 3DS cause it's been out in Japan and I wondered where
5013100	5015980	the hell it was at E3, but I guess that answers that.
5015980	5018060	They were just sitting on it as a January game.
5018060	5019340	So that's cool.
5019340	5021620	I'm happy we're getting it.
5021620	5024140	So all right, there it is.
5024140	5026180	Your rapid fire news.
5026180	5030020	Fifth Dream says the Blu-ray is out already for Poltergeist.
5030020	5031020	I had no idea.
5031020	5033540	I knew it was out in theaters or I was pretty convinced.
5033540	5038580	I kind of forgot about keeping up with it cause I mean, I loved the first one.
5038620	5041060	But I guess it means I have to get the Blu-ray and watch it.
5041060	5043540	Oh no, Fifth Dream says he was looking at the wrong one, but soon.
5043540	5046140	Well yeah, I have the Blu-ray of the original.
5046140	5050460	The third one used to give me freaking nightmares because of the mirrors.
5050460	5052180	I just like the little gypsy lady.
5052180	5053180	She's my favorite.
5053180	5054620	That was Zelda Rubinstein.
5054620	5055660	That's it, yeah.
5055660	5061620	And Zelda Rubinstein was also in the Teen Witch, which was a fun, bad movie.
5061620	5065900	Fifth Dream says September 20th for the Blu-ray.
5065900	5067820	So it's already out of the theaters then, well shit.
5067860	5069860	Check the second run theaters.
5069860	5073460	I was gonna say, yeah, check Sunrise or something like that.
5073460	5074460	You never know.
5074460	5075460	Movie day!
5075460	5076460	OLR movie day.
5076460	5077460	We're gonna go see Poltergeist.
5077460	5079020	Wait, why am I volunteering to see a scary movie?
5079020	5080020	Nevermind.
5080020	5081020	Yay, Rob!
5081020	5082900	Dark Soccer and Loki could go without Rob.
5082900	5085260	Oh yeah, I only go if there's cheesecake involved.
5085260	5086900	Okay, there'll be cheesecake involved.
5086900	5087900	Yes!
5087900	5090020	Can you like sneak cheesecake into the theater?
5090020	5092060	I think they sell cheesecake bites.
5092060	5093620	I'm pretty sure is like a movie smell.
5093620	5095060	Oh, it came out May 22nd.
5095060	5096460	This should still be running.
5097100	5098100	Yeah, you never know.
5098100	5099100	Oh.
5099100	5100100	Alright.
5100100	5103220	Speaking of Poltergeist, no I've got nothing.
5103220	5106740	We're gonna go to the Fookle Question of the Week.
5106740	5110340	Every week we check our Facebook and our Google Plus fan communities.
5110340	5113580	We ask a question and we read some of our favorite answers here on the show.
5113580	5127460	This week we asked our listeners about the Loot Crate thing, the End Box.
5127460	5131900	It looks as though Nintendo may launch a Loot Crate rival of sorts.
5131900	5135660	Would you be interested in a mystery box full of gaming-related surprises from Nintendo
5135660	5136660	every month?
5136660	5142220	If not Nintendo, is there another gaming company or franchise you'd like to get random treats
5142260	5143940	from every month?
5143940	5146660	So let's go to Facebook and see who answered us over there.
5146660	5148460	We have a few answers.
5148460	5151180	The off hour worked out for getting more answers this week.
5151180	5157980	Fabrice from Belgium I think is starting us off tonight saying a Sega Loot Crate naturally,
5157980	5161300	although the Loot Crates really seem hit or miss.
5161300	5165700	Every month you would just get a recycled Master System game over and over again because
5165700	5167460	that's what Sega's business is these days.
5167460	5168980	That was a little bit of reading.
5168980	5171860	Sonic with legs that keep getting longer and longer and longer.
5171860	5175100	And more bandages.
5175100	5177780	Are you ready to make some crazy money?
5177780	5182620	Tech 2030 says if this was a few years ago I would have jumped on something like this.
5182620	5185900	Lately I've been pretty minimalistic when it comes to video games.
5185900	5191580	Hardly any physical games, no memorabilia, only one home console and one handheld.
5191580	5197020	Cutting back, that's like an Amish gamer's lifestyle right there.
5197020	5199580	Andy R says I'm not into Loot Crate in general.
5199580	5203980	I love physical goods like figures and physical games but I barely have enough room for the
5203980	5204980	stuff I buy.
5204980	5210180	I don't need what seems like a mess of overstocked junk to add even more clutter and that'll
5210180	5213900	probably extend to anything Nintendo tries in this space.
5213900	5217780	Silent Tom says I would love to get random goodies every month from the Street Fighter
5217780	5221180	franchise and would love to get monthly for The Legend of Zelda.
5221180	5224220	I would be so broke but it would be so worth it.
5224220	5228260	You know a fucking amiibo is going to be in these fucking end boxes.
5228260	5230740	There's going to be a random fucking amiibo or those Animal Crossing cards.
5230740	5234300	There's going to be things like that in these stinking boxes.
5234300	5238500	Hey anyway, Critical Myth says it depends on whether the service sticks to the original
5238500	5244100	randomness of Loot Crate or takes after the newer services that have taken it a step further
5244100	5247460	into more targeted, better selections.
5247460	5251860	Dark Tetsuya says I've lost count of the number of Nintendo themed t-shirts I own so sure,
5251860	5252860	sign me up.
5252860	5256700	I do agree there ought to be a favorite franchises option somewhere so you're guaranteed the
5256700	5258780	stuff you like most.
5258780	5263180	Joda Star replied and said I think of all these subscription boxes are a cool idea but
5263180	5265940	I prefer to find my own memorabilia.
5265940	5269060	I would maybe consider a Star Wars box.
5269060	5273020	Well with the movie coming out you never know, everybody's going to want to get in on Star
5273020	5274020	Wars fever.
5274020	5277900	It's that hype, that hype train is going to roll all the way through December and on into
5277900	5280100	the following movies.
5280100	5284620	William Murderface says I would like to see a blizzard service where you could get physical
5284620	5285620	memorabilia.
5285620	5289660	A plushy battle cruiser would be awesome and digital goodies, maybe even some skins or
5289660	5290660	some mounts.
5290660	5291660	That's a really good idea.
5291660	5295340	You know Blizzard has a whole cult of fans, that's something they could start, give a
5295340	5301380	little bit of that bag that you get at Blizzcon throughout the year.
5301380	5305380	And lastly on Facebook, Justin H says if I could pick a specific developer it would have
5305380	5307120	to be BioWare.
5307120	5310900	Star Wars, Mass Effect and Dragon Age would be all I ever need.
5310900	5315100	Unfortunately space for goodies is starting to get limited after having my first child
5315100	5319860	and I would hate to end up as the Lego movie dad who has so much awesome stuff and won't
5319860	5323900	let his kid play with any of it.
5323900	5324900	I love it.
5324900	5329820	Although I think Dark Soccer might agree with you there, just a hunch on the BioWare loot
5329820	5331060	crate might be something.
5331060	5332460	I'd be down for that.
5332460	5333900	I think so too.
5333900	5337860	That was not something I realized I wanted until just now.
5337860	5341700	I would love a Lego loot crate if it wasn't so expensive.
5341700	5342700	Right?
5342700	5345660	Because that shit is expensive.
5345660	5349340	Well we have a couple, sorry Fifth Dream in chat I have to read this, Fifth Dream in chat
5349340	5356020	says Star Wars box, 1 Vader eraser, 14 Jar Jar stickers, and a piece of hairy Chewbacca
5356020	5358020	gum.
5358020	5361160	Love it.
5361160	5365260	We do have some answers over on Google Plus though, hey despite the news that apparently
5365260	5370740	Google Plus is, everybody is saying rest in peace you're dead, buy Google Plus, I still
5370740	5374460	see people using it and maybe that's because I play Ingress and that's how Ingress players
5374460	5376500	talk to each other is all through Google Plus.
5376500	5381540	It's really only for YouTube that they're not going to force you to make a Google Plus
5381540	5382540	account for.
5382540	5389180	Yeah so I don't know but hey until people stop using it I can plan on continuing to
5389180	5391140	post the question on Google Plus.
5391140	5394460	It's an easy copy paste job.
5394460	5398220	Redertainment says there's an independent record store out here called Gray Whale that
5398220	5403140	buys, sells, and trades video games, music, DVDs, vinyl, and other sort of things.
5403140	5405980	I'd like to see a Gray Whale loot crate type of thing.
5405980	5407940	So it sounds like Dimple for us locally.
5407940	5410140	They are exactly like Dimple.
5410140	5415180	It would be a great way for them to get rid of all the wrestling DVDs people trade in.
5415180	5420420	Oh god that's how they could get rid of like the 20,000 copies of you know old Madden games
5420420	5421420	that come through the store.
5421420	5423260	That would be garbage then.
5423860	5426420	Just give people random garbage when they purchase them.
5426420	5429460	But when it's in a mystery box and you can put it on YouTube locally.
5429460	5433460	I remember like there was one time there was a guy that was buying a bunch of junk that
5433460	5438660	was in our warehouse and one of the things he ended up buying was it was literally like
5438660	5444540	49 copies of like the original Xbox like Madden, it's like a old ass Madden game.
5444540	5447580	Madden like 2005 or I don't even remember what it was.
5447580	5450940	It's just some old ass Madden game that there was just a ton of copies of.
5450940	5454780	I feel like as an art project because those things have only got to cost like what one
5454780	5456120	or two bucks a pop.
5456120	5460620	As an art project we should buy like a bunch of them and build a sculpture out of old Madden
5460620	5461620	games.
5461620	5462620	I don't know.
5462620	5463620	Maybe it's...
5463620	5464620	Create Madden out of Madden.
5464620	5465620	Yes.
5465620	5467420	Create Madden out of Madden.
5467420	5468420	I love it.
5468420	5469420	All right.
5469420	5474100	And then lastly, Act Def says this sounds like a cool thing though I would also be down
5474100	5476280	with having a Pokemon Center loot crate.
5476280	5478420	They have a lot of cool merchandise.
5478420	5480300	So something maybe targeted a little bit.
5480300	5483460	Well don't worry when they release all of those Pokemon amiibo because there's going
5483460	5484500	to be hundreds of them.
5484500	5486660	I'm sure that they can include a few in the loot crates.
5486660	5487980	There you go.
5487980	5490120	All those extra boxes.
5490120	5493260	All the little like Pokemon that nobody wants.
5493260	5494640	All the little like...
5494640	5497840	I can't even think of the names off the top of my head but like I remember when Burger
5497840	5501920	King did the Pokemon toys and like half of them were that little thing.
5501920	5504660	It looked like a turd and it was like a cave thing.
5504660	5505660	It looked like a poop.
5505660	5506660	It was a poop-ymon.
5506660	5507660	Aw dookie.
5507660	5515340	Dookie you stench.
5515340	5516340	It's super offensive.
5516340	5517340	All right.
5517340	5518340	Anyway.
5518340	5519340	There you go.
5519340	5522180	That's it for the Frugal Question of the Week.
5522180	5525420	So let's get back into some more news and of course in just a little while your phone
5525420	5530260	calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
5530260	5531260	All one word.
5531260	5532260	Loki.
5532260	5533260	All right.
5533260	5537860	So you know PlayStation Plus has been a pretty good program they've had going where you get
5537860	5542420	lots of nice games and stuff for free and now you may have a little bit of a say in
5542420	5543420	that.
5543420	5550100	Apparently they are going to be opening up voting for members to pick maybe the next
5550100	5553900	games that will be part of the instant game collection.
5553900	5560620	I guess they will be once the game has been support or whatever game gets the most support
5560620	5566300	it will be automatically added to the future month's lineup.
5566300	5573820	So apparently it says for the first vote the titles that aren't selected will be available
5573820	5574820	at a member's discount.
5574820	5579060	That's kind of neat I guess.
5579060	5580940	Where are the titles though is what I want to know.
5580940	5584660	Yeah I want to know what are we all talking about like which ones are we going to get
5584660	5586420	to really vote for.
5586420	5588780	Aw man, Knack.
5588780	5592860	Well actually I'm surprised Knack still hasn't shown up as a PlayStation Plus game.
5592860	5598460	I kind of assumed that would have happened by now but it still hasn't so kind of interesting.
5598460	5602420	But you know I mean PlayStation Plus as it is is already a great deal.
5602420	5607500	I mean there's so many games I really think maybe wouldn't have been as big if it wasn't
5607500	5610660	for PlayStation Plus and I think Rocket League is a great example of that.
5610660	5616860	I still need to try out Injustice Gods Among Us which I downloaded like ages ago.
5616860	5620780	Yeah that was a lot of fun that's a good one.
5620780	5626980	Well get this I mean this is the game that refuses to die and you can take that in many
5626980	5627980	different ways.
5627980	5635820	P.T. that's right Silent Hills the playable trailer P.T. is back sort of.
5635820	5642100	Well here's the thing Konami might have erased it from the store but this developer and I'm
5642100	5648940	sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name but Farhan Qureshi recreated P.T. in Unity for
5648940	5653380	the PC and he's releasing it for free.
5653380	5657860	Qureshi is an aspiring game developer living in Calgary, Alberta.
5657860	5661320	Well I don't know if Konami is going to necessarily throw you a job but hopefully somebody else
5661320	5663220	will because it's pretty impressive.
5663220	5669140	Qureshi recreated P.T. to showcase it at a workshop that he's going to be teaching.
5669140	5672980	It's called Punity with the P and the T capitalized.
5672980	5673980	For the record.
5673980	5674980	Get it?
5674980	5675980	P.Unity.
5675980	5676980	Not just PC.
5676980	5677980	Oh.
5677980	5678980	Mac and Linux as well.
5678980	5679980	Nice.
5679980	5680980	Oh it's only mentioned here on PC that's great.
5680980	5684020	Well that makes sense too because it's Unity it could be easily ported to other platforms
5684020	5685140	so hooray.
5685140	5690140	You can actually download that for free and apparently the internet pretty happy with
5690140	5691140	that.
5691140	5696540	It's not apparently a 100% recreation but you know it's obviously probably doesn't have
5696540	5700700	the trailer at the end or any of that stuff but still that's pretty awesome.
5700700	5701700	Get it while you can.
5701700	5705720	I mean it's on the internet so it's never going to disappear now but I'm sure come Monday
5705720	5710980	Konami will be sending a cease and desist but at the same time what does the company
5710980	5711980	have to lose?
5711980	5713980	I mean they're not putting it out there anymore.
5713980	5715760	The game's out there for free.
5715760	5721760	This guy's not trying to charge for it so I say let it be but I have a feeling Konami
5721760	5723800	will sue.
5723800	5724800	Download it before.
5724880	5726920	So I mean it's on the internet now.
5726920	5730040	It's on torrent sites every I mean it's it's a done deal.
5730040	5732220	Konami cannot erase this at this point.
5732220	5733880	So there you go.
5733880	5734880	Check that out.
5734880	5735880	I think that's really cool.
5735880	5738520	I would like to just check it out just to see maybe like what the differences are.
5738520	5740120	Oh God is that going to have to be a live stream.
5740120	5741120	Oh God oh God oh God.
5741120	5742360	That would be awesome.
5742360	5744240	I'm downloading it from my Mac right now.
5744240	5746160	Nice nice.
5746160	5747160	All right.
5747160	5751920	Well while you download check out the next news story as well there Sakura.
5751920	5755680	Well you know we've been going on for what is it now a couple of years now about the
5755680	5757680	whole net neutrality thing.
5757680	5763640	Well ISPs are now saying that their information service and not telecommunications services.
5763640	5770960	They've filed a 95 page brief at the U.S. Court of Appeals to try to make see that they're
5770960	5777740	not a I would say included with any of the legislation gone against them for right now.
5777740	5783680	So one of the things that it says on there is that no matter how many computer mediated
5783680	5788820	features the FCC may sweep under the rug the inescapable core of the Internet access is
5788820	5794020	a service that uses computer processing to enable consumers to retrieve files from the
5794020	5795380	World Wide Web.
5795380	5801780	People still use that word and browse their contents and thus offers the capability for
5801780	5805860	acquiring retrieving and utilizing information.
5805860	5809180	Yeah I think they're just trying to still stiff people for money.
5809180	5814220	So let's wait for that one to fail shall we.
5814220	5817740	This here's the thing that's kind of ironic though where you know they're trying to call
5817740	5824640	themselves an information service but doesn't Comcast actually sell a phone line that uses
5824640	5828300	your Internet like and that's part of their whole bundle thing and I hate because like
5828300	5831060	I mean sorry but who needs a landline anymore.
5831060	5834920	Like at least from my perspective maybe other people you need home security now because
5834920	5837480	that's the next thing that they're including with it.
5837480	5841660	OK but at least that sounds like so and again that uses the Internet right.
5841660	5846160	It just sends you it takes all the video is the information service beams it through.
5846160	5848920	Yeah it's it's it's telecommunications.
5848920	5852680	It seems weird to me because they're using a phone line through the Internet and trying
5852680	5853680	to say that it's not it.
5853680	5856160	Well I'm picking on Comcast but a lot of companies do this.
5856160	5857160	It's stupid.
5857160	5858160	Do you have a PC.
5858160	5859160	Yes.
5859160	5861760	Is there a PC that's remotely somewhere out there in another part of the world.
5861760	5862760	Yes.
5862760	5863760	Are they communicating with each other.
5863760	5865640	It's fucking communication.
5865640	5869200	It's communicating over you.
5869200	5871480	You should be a lawyer like a stupid.
5871480	5872480	It's stupid.
5872480	5877640	It's just like this is about as dumb as when fucking Sony said hey guess what the PlayStation
5877640	5878640	3.
5878640	5879640	It's a computer.
5879640	5881440	It's not a game console.
5881440	5886320	It's a computer because we don't play pair taxes or some shit like that.
5886320	5892040	It's a fucking game console is because you can put Linux on it doesn't make it anymore.
5892040	5897120	So it's definitely not a computer now just like rumble isn't a feature.
5897120	5898120	That's last gen.
5898120	5899120	Who needs rumble.
5899120	5902960	Entertainment and chat over at live.vog network dot com says Loki should be a judge.
5902960	5905360	I think I kind of agree with that.
5905360	5914600	Loki I would watch a judge Loki show well I want to see receipts and that I've seen
5914600	5915600	those receipts.
5915600	5916600	I don't give a shit.
5916600	5923560	I'm still filing the answer dark dark Tetsuya in our chat room says Loki O.L.R.'s ace attorney.
5923560	5927640	There you go objection anyway.
5927640	5931520	Now quickly before we get into Loki's next story I did want to mention the chat room
5931520	5935720	was saying where can they get that punity demo demo because I didn't even give out the
5935720	5936720	URL.
5936720	5940480	I'm sorry I didn't give it out because it's a long URL so I can't really read it but you
5940480	5941920	can check out the guy's website.
5941920	5948640	It's the dash outline dot com and then there's slash portfolio slash punity dash p t dash
5948640	5949800	hallway dash recreation.
5949800	5955800	I really think you should probably just Google p t hallway recreation PC unity or punity
5955800	5959480	although well I don't know you might get a lot of other stuff with that word but hopefully
5959480	5963480	put a link in the chat room and probably yes I did put a link in chat.
5963480	5967340	So hopefully if you're listening to this on the podcast feed I'm sure it's it's on a lot
5967340	5972420	of gaming news sites out there because obviously people love p t and wanted to play Silent
5972420	5977460	Hills but L.O.L. oops anyhow back in some other news Loki.
5977460	5982420	So you may remember we talked about a story about harebrained schemes the company that
5982420	5988540	brought out shadow run out for PC not too long ago they're talking about hey you know
5988540	5995560	what we're thinking about going back into some of the older I.P.s that Jordan Weisman
5995560	5999800	owns and maybe bringing those back and everyone's like oh my goodness what could that be could
5999800	6003880	it be cringe of the skies or battle tech well it's going to be battle tech and they're going
6003880	6006360	to be launching a new kickstarter for battle tech.
6006360	6011960	It's going to be a turn based game and that's going to be coming to kickstarter later this
6011960	6019840	year I am looking forward to that ironically I did back shadow run I have shadow run and
6019840	6023320	much like about ninety nine percent of the games on my steam library I have not played
6023320	6030560	shadowrun I mean I even have the expansion I also have shadowrun online and I still have
6030560	6036240	not played that either so I am a terrible consumer no you're a great consumer great
6036240	6040240	you buy shit and then you don't even use it well no they would probably have a gym membership
6040240	6044720	because that's exactly the type of customer they want yeah I don't have a gym membership
6044720	6052080	you know don't get one all right Loki maybe this is another game you'll add to your library
6052080	6056120	although knowing you you probably won't even let this touch your computer it is finally
6056120	6062560	happening you guys angry birds 2 is coming and here's the thing you're probably thinking
6062560	6067140	to yourself hasn't there already been angry birds 2 believe it or not no there's been
6067140	6073680	angry birds star wars transformers Rio apparently there was even a mario kart angry bird yeah
6073680	6077960	there was Rio because wasn't that a movie or something yes Rio was a movie I don't know
6077960	6085600	but now angry birds 2 I think the game would have been much better if Duran Duran had done
6085600	6090240	the soundtrack I think so too Duran Duran makes everything better well maybe Duran Duran
6090240	6095920	will lend the reflex to angry birds 2 well all I need to know is this game is not by
6095920	6100480	King good okay cool then I don't know it's Rovio oh I have no problem with Rovio there
6100480	6104880	it is Rovio is not evil here's the thing you're still doing you're still flinging the birds
6104880	6112400	the pigs but now we've got multi-stage levels boss piggy battles and so on Rovio by the
6112400	6117280	way they've had some financial difficulties lately so kind of not a surprise that angry
6117280	6121520	birds 2 is coming but here's here's my question are people going to care because I really
6121520	6126120	think with a lot of these phone games a lot of them are very flash-in-the-pan sorts of
6126120	6131200	things that lightning doesn't tend to strike twice glad you asked that what the what's
6131200	6134960	the flappy bird guy doing now well probably rolling in his piles of money that he never
6134960	6140080	expected to make but I mean I mean and then what Zinga spent all that money to buy draw
6140080	6146240	something and nobody fucking plays that anymore so it's like really I was thinking for a little
6146240	6150640	I'm back to words with friends though most people I know quit when Zinga bought them
6150640	6154640	like everybody was like I'm out what were you gonna say Logie I said I'm glad you were
6154640	6159560	asking about how how they would respond to that well boy anger birds 2 was downloaded
6159560	6169280	one million times in the half a day wow so apparently pretty well I guess so so much
6169280	6177080	for what I was thinking so I guess Dark Sakura is suggesting that perhaps for Angry Birds
6177080	6186960	2 Rio they could have Duran Duran you know who doesn't want to knock over some pigs to
6186960	6193440	this this would be like the best this is like boss battle music right here well Angry Birds
6193440	6198400	2 does feature boss pigs exactly that's what I'm singing you know it's funny though Dan didn't
6198400	6203840	realize that Duran Duran was named after the Barbarella movie oh yeah because of dr. Duran
6203840	6209640	Duran yeah didn't they actually have a song called Barbara electro Barbarella later on it's like one
6209640	6214520	of the later songs that came out was like their comeback song or something like that no in the 90
6214520	6224680	they did well that wasn't the same album in the 90s that did come undone and no let your
6224680	6230520	Barbarella was before that and then they did the the whole revival in the 90s but anyway 80s 90s
6230520	6236520	whatever fifth dream in chat says this is like the erasure song in robot unicorn attack it makes the
6236520	6242600	game yes it does there you go always needs to be in everything and fifth dream says the song you
6242600	6248480	forgot was ordinary world how could a DDR player forget that song but come undone was also on the
6248480	6253280	same album is what I love that song is my favorite Duran Duran song yeah on my favorite Duran Duran
6253280	6259360	song would probably be hungry like the wolf I like the didn't they do a James Bond they did James
6259360	6265460	one they yeah they did you know yeah if you don't like it was also a good one not a great Bond movie
6265460	6271880	but it did have um grace she had grace Jones it's a great Bond movie it was just not the good Bond
6271880	6278320	actor but it had no Jones in it no and I like I actually really super love like James Bond movies
6278320	6282440	it's kind of one of those things I don't really talk about Dan yeah but he was funny is like it
6282440	6288800	had the most cheeseball line in it oh what if you to a kill yeah they always have to work in the
6288800	6298400	title Oh 80s yeah so which I am so I remember it's the bond no one liked um not as a Dalton
6298400	6304880	no it wasn't Dalton it was pre Dalton anyway I'm gonna have to look at him now but um I cannot
6304880	6312560	wait for specter I am so excited and I love that they cast what's your name for the matrix Monica
6312560	6317280	Bellucci is that her name she's now 50 Roger Moore Roger Moore that's it's Roger Moore but
6317280	6321360	um Monica Bellucci she's what now 50 and they cast her as the Bond girl I think that's rad
6321360	6328240	freaking gorgeous she's gorgeous good for her so that's amazing anyway if you know I kill came out
6328240	6333640	in 1985 I know it's it was kind of in that I was nine there was a real dead period cuz there's one
6333640	6339040	more after that in 88 right and then there was like a huge gap before golden I golden I was so
6339040	6348160	good golden I was like fucking Tina Turner Switzerland's best citizen I actually think I
6348160	6353280	need to see now I just need to see a bad movie with Tina Turner in it so I say let's watch Mad
6353280	6357320	Max Beyond the Thunderdome I was just gonna say Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdome bad movies with
6357320	6368000	Tina Turner but it has an awesome theme song it does favorite Bond movie oh fuck um I think I'd
6368000	6376080	have to go with dr. no hmm or maybe octopussy hmm I would say see you know I like cheesy ones right
6376080	6380840	so which one which which is like the cheesiest Bond film they ever did you wouldn't go with a
6380840	6385400	view to a kill we know I mean cuz Grace Jones is awesome I do love Grace Jones but live and let
6386040	6393400	die is my favorite Paul McCartney doing the guy that gets blown up at the end it's yeah Paul
6393400	6400400	McCartney did that and then it got covered by Gunther Rogers that's right Loki what's your favorite
6400400	6404520	Bob movie you know I can't remember too many of them I've watched a few I remember watching
6404520	6413360	GoldenEye and I know I've watched a lot of the Roger Moore ones and Sean Connery ones I I don't
6413360	6419160	really have any favorites I mean I don't know I really like die another day I know most people
6419160	6424080	didn't care for that one but I was on the Halle Berry and I really I thought like the one with
6424080	6429400	Michelle Yeoh mmm that was yeah that one was good but I love Michelle Yeoh I love everything I've
6429400	6434320	ever seen God but that was one with Denise Richards I forget about her it hadn't had Michelle Yeoh in
6434320	6439000	it all right anyway and she was in Wing Chun and that was great my favorite Bond movie is if looks
6439040	6445720	could kill and I think I think these new Daniel Craig ones are so fucking good I think I just
6445720	6451680	want him to look at me like casino those eyes casino Royale and Skyfall Skyfall especially was
6451680	6457560	like that's like honestly probably the best like movie they've done through the whole thing quick
6457560	6462480	time out hmm the lady that played Evelyn in Masters of the Universe and him could you imagine the eyes
6462480	6468040	their child would have all right just saying all right we could we could just talk about James Bond
6468040	6471960	the rest of the night and hell Goldeneye was probably one of the best video games they ever
6471960	6478440	did make the first video game that made me throw up really you couldn't handle the awesome this is
6478440	6485280	so awesome no I didn't I when I moved out here Dan had a Nintendo 64 because he was like recording
6485280	6489520	me like the music for Killer Instinct and whatnot and so I was trying to watch him play Goldeneye
6489520	6496200	and I got so freaking motion sick I had to run to the bathroom and hurl and then like he was still
6496240	6500360	playing the game he's like are you okay it's like motion sick so I just laid over in the couch and
6500360	6507920	passed out that's how I knew that some 3d games will make me super sick there you go Wow the more
6507920	6513000	and more real they got all right well anyhow we just we just fell into minutes and minutes of
6513000	6517960	James Bond chat but I think that's okay that we had to fill a little time with that because usually
6517960	6524000	we have no mail we would get it in the mail bag right now but you guys have sent no mail oh there's
6524000	6529840	one actually is there okay well part here participate at orange long trainee calm dark

6533160	6538040	sharing with you all today dear dark Sakura you should do all the things ever you should have a
6538040	6544400	solo career as a podcaster you should do the dark Sakura show and have it themed to Clarissa

6629680	6636920	sure I don't know they don't green like that but Oh Melissa Joey that sounds like a fucking great
6636920	6641280	idea well she was she was huge in Sabrina the Teenage Witch so it made sense that they wanted
6641280	6647000	to do something with her why they give show you guys solo show should be all sass they did they
6647000	6653080	uh it was Melissa and Joey had this whole thing on ABC exactly it's I'm saying why the fuck is

6762480	6768000	tugging on everyone's heartstrings by saying Jericho the lion was dead too we'll just use
6768000	6773000	a little line for when it's not true they even got me because it was on freakin CNN I thought
6773000	6779040	maybe CNN would check their sources no so more like F you to sensationalized news I'm just gonna
6779040	6789240	stick with the BBC I like my news dry and British thank you appropriate for today yes I actually do
6789440	6794680	the BBC website for most of my news by the way I I love British news too but I prefer the Daily
6794680	6801520	Mail just kidding girl by the way my mom sent me this thing on Facebook says a poem for mornings
6801520	6809120	coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee everyone shut up coffee that's like a haiku yes Loki here
6809120	6814800	I've used the week um my only F used really to Windows 10 just for some reason after I've
6814800	6820440	updated my touchpad isn't quite right like especially when I try to right-click stuff
6820440	6825400	it keeps you moving the pointer and then doing a little left-click and it's just kind of it's
6825400	6831120	annoying because they'll launch stuff without you know me wanting it to be launched or you know I'm
6831120	6837360	just trying to copy and paste something and it's just not working out for me so I'm still trying
6837360	6844280	to tweak the settings to get it right but it's no luck so far all right my F you goes to my back
6844280	6848080	I don't know what the fuck I did yesterday but I really heard I don't know if it's moving the
6848080	6851600	computer around I know it was the way I was sitting against the couch and maybe when I
6851600	6856520	jumped during one of those five-night scares I somehow like really fucked up my back so F you
6856520	6860720	to that because getting old sucks so if you did that as well I could give you some of my horse
6860720	6865240	pills and then lastly well I've got to drive tonight you don't want me on meds and then my
6865240	6873360	last F you my last if you goes to lays potato chips and I'm gonna tell you why because we make
6873360	6877600	a thing out of the flavor contest every year since the first year we try all the different flavors
6877600	6881600	so the first year chicken waffles best thing ever I don't care if you disagree with me you're wrong
6881600	6887480	you're super wrong you're wrong or they're long just like when you all pick team dog you're that
6887480	6894480	wrong the second year the best flavor that they had was actually they were all pretty good last
6894560	6899160	year I gotta say they were all really strong contenders last year I really like the mango
6899160	6906400	one but it grew on me and I even like the cappuccino chips this year all the flavors suck they are bad
6906400	6912640	um and I cannot stand that southern biscuits and gravies one and apparently everybody is loving
6912640	6917040	that one and I thought it tasted like bark now granted I'm not a big gravy fan to begin with I
6917040	6923120	like biscuits okay if the chips had been cheddar bay biscuits I have not heard oh my god right
6923120	6928200	that's that that's the fucking that was a million dollar idea right there right Jesus you know they
6928200	6933520	sell those at the store now huh can just yes I heard him they're amazing so amazing but here's
6933520	6938680	the thing so and then we also bought the truffle fries one which that was okay but the one I
6938680	6943800	actually liked the best was the euro the sandwich I haven't tried that was really good have leave
6943800	6947800	the chips are all gone we ate them all cuz we're fat but yeah they're out there they're out there
6947800	6952400	in stores apparently Alan got the Reuben one which is the only one I haven't had yet but I
6952400	6956000	am not interested in trying that one because somebody told me it has like a mayonnaise taste
6956000	6961720	to it and you know how if you know how I feel about mayonnaise it's not gonna happen so anyway
6961720	6965200	I just say a few delays because I don't think the chips are as strong this year as they've been in
6965200	6968560	previous years even though I like I thought truffle fries would be hella good but it's like
6968560	6973000	french fries are already a potato so it's redundant you're eating a potato flavored
6973000	6979200	potato chip no shit french fry well what and why don't we have ketchup chips in the States
6979240	6985200	like I know that's a Canadian thing but we don't have them here stupid ketchup chips
6985200	6992160	make sense you put french fries in ketchup anyway yeah going to our chatroom over at
6992160	6998240	live dot vog network comm fifth dream says I still say the coolest weird chip is cheeseburger
6998240	7004440	Pringles I didn't even know that was a thing mm-hmm I'm so hungry now yeah Alex P Carson says they
7004440	7008900	had a mac and cheese flavor that could have been way better you know and that's weird is that I can
7008900	7015520	find even though last year the wasabi one won the contest the cheddar mac and cheese bacon one that
7015520	7020300	I would have thought would have won is like I can that's in our work vending machine like it's a huge
7020300	7026900	flavor so I don't know it's weird anyway enough about potato chips more about video games we have
7026900	7031740	a couple more stories for you guys and then your phone calls at 1 8 7 7 game olr or a username on
7031740	7040300	skype orange lounge radio but first Loki color me so surprised that Sega's first quarter fiscal
7040300	7048860	year is not doing well I mean that is just shocking apparently there's been dramatic decreases in sales
7048860	7056780	and the operating and in net income I haven't been doing too well kind of negative not too well
7056780	7065620	they're saying that the net sales dropped 41.2% to 52.9 billion yen or about 426 million dollars
7065620	7075140	and their losses for operating with 9.5 billion yen or 76 million total net losses 9 7.9 billion
7075140	7083700	or 63.8 million so yeah they're gonna what do they have coming that's gonna help them get out of that
7083700	7089820	slump I mean I don't know if that really counts Atlas stuff but then again Atlas you know props
7089820	7093700	to them for being a great company and putting out good games but I don't think that's enough to lift
7093700	7101060	up Sega I don't know how about fucking Phantasy Star Online 2 oh that's not coming out though but
7101060	7107940	and yes I did hear about the English like apparently there's a server now that they took
7107940	7111580	away the region restrictions so you can get on but it's like a year behind or something like that
7111580	7118180	like and it's not like officially so I mean I think that you know I don't they have like a new
7118180	7122820	Sonic game coming out this year or something or I know that there's the new Mario and Sonic at the
7122820	7129780	Olympics it's anek and danky Kang Santa Santa danky Kang which is actually a fake meme that's a total
7129780	7135560	that's not a true somebody photoshopped that jeopardy thing but anyway I still would buy
7135560	7141320	Sanic and danky Kang I thought I thought it was that they spelled it wrong wasn't that it that
7141320	7155680	like you know is danky Kang and Zordla princess Zordla Zordla all right well sorry Sega just not
7155680	7163280	bringing in the money you once were there it is anyhow last but not least I should probably keep
7163280	7169760	that Price is Right horn ready for this one did we fucking see this coming or did we see this
7169760	7179480	coming guess what there is a new Castlevania themed pachinko machine coming yep Konami is
7179480	7187640	putting out a Castlevania pachinko machine somehow it is featuring erotic violence that is in the
7187640	7191800	title of it erotic you really do need to watch the trailer it's hilarious and if you watch the
7191800	7196440	trailer I haven't actually watched the trailer let's watch the trailer cuz it's only 51 seconds
7196440	7200920	wait we need we need dark soccer as well cuz I need if she's gonna let out a deep sigh I need
7200920	7205760	that on the micro it's about the best part about it is it shows zero gameplay awesome so here it
7205760	7224840	is the trailer for a new Castlevania pachinko let's take a look that was a booty
7224840	7235080	that's Richter
7242200	7244320	that's way too many boops I paused it sorry
7244320	7259920	now here's the thing that could have been amazingly like bad video game in a rumble
7259920	7265440	roses kind of way that could have been like a showgirls bad video game because I did get
7265440	7270360	okay so like I'm watching that and I'm like I should be the trailer for like it's a little
7271360	7278240	bit Bayonetta like I still feel like Bayonetta itself is better at making the joke but it does
7278240	7283320	feel like when the feather was flying between her breasts come on that is fucking stupid like it's
7283320	7288400	it's it's excessive but yeah that's that's hilarious that it's not even like a fucking
7288400	7293720	actual game it's just a pachinko machine which is nowhere near as exciting as that video is
7293720	7300400	like the entertainment and chat says erotic violence is this WWE zappy in chat says how
7300400	7305440	about just new Castlevania act-deaf in chat says we all joked about it we knew it was coming but
7305440	7310880	why do I still feel sad from this why do you need Konami originals Alan alchemy and chat says
7310880	7316400	Konami says not only will we drive by in a big-ass truck and splash you with gutter water as you
7316400	7322840	stand in the rain waiting for your fave we'll spit at you and flip you off while doing it and
7322840	7333160	be glad they don't turn that truck around and run you over when not their target audience anymore
7333160	7339960	some beautiful insight from our chat room over at live vog that's gonna get some now speaking of
7339960	7344040	chatter I don't know we get chatters real quick it's your turn if you want to give us a call
7344040	7349520	one eight seven seven game olr or in our Skype orange lounge radio all one word here's your
7349520	7355640	chance what is the target demographic for pachinko machine gamblers I don't and I'm just assuming
7355640	7359520	like cuz I know gamblers over here most of them tend to be elderly is this supposed to like drive
7359520	7366320	through the elderlies like whoa I got bring me some of that I don't know if the same stereotype
7366320	7371480	is true overseas is it is gambling just for the elderly overseas dark soccer that you've seen I
7371480	7378160	think people of all ages are businessmen yeah that's yeah I've seen that too so I I don't know
7378160	7383880	what the stereotype is over there but you also notice over here they try to do things to lure in
7383880	7389080	not just the elderly like they like remember there was like a Dungeons & Dragons machine and they try
7389080	7394260	to do things like the hangover and things that like you know younger folks are into but they
7394260	7399320	definitely have the machines that target the older audiences as well like there's an Ellen
7399320	7403240	show slot machine I mean that's not really older audience everybody loves Ellen but I thought that
7403240	7408080	was interesting when I was in Reno I won $40 from a Dolly Parton slot machine thank you very much
7408520	7413760	blasted nine to five while I was playing that was a good time but the best slot machine I ever
7413760	7419640	played in Reno Queen it was a queen slot machine that was awesome and I'm so sad it's not there
7419640	7425440	anymore does it play we are the champions when you can yeah for me it played radio gaga it's when you
7425440	7432960	get the free spins just cycle over and over so there you go 1877 game olr or a username on skype

7454240	7464360	and star versus see what this looks like here it's supposed to be a competitive shooter huh but it's
7464360	7470000	like any s it's all any s graphics any yeah it's on the NES and so you can't you fight each other
7470000	7474640	oh that's pretty cool as little ships it's like Gradius meets a twin stick shooter meets a

7523000	7529400	calls like this are what keep us motivated to keep going right guys yeah yep so but you know
7529400	7534440	what would also motivate us is some Belgian chocolate I'm just saying that could also be
7534440	7540760	right are sorry I'm all right so anyway I'm just joking oh well I'll send some over just giving
7540760	7545480	address oh gosh you're you're far too kind I really appreciate that I would love to come
7545480	7549760	visit over there someday there's lots of lots of beautiful architecture and things over there
7549760	7554520	I think it'd be worth seeing and then I could hoard up on all the junk food over there so what
7554520	7561120	video games you playing lately well not that much actually I've been playing Metal Gear Solid 5
7561120	7568400	yesterday because it was with the games with gold and I really like it oh yeah the whole the preview
7568400	7572880	what does what the hell was it called I can't remember now the solid the phantom I know it's
7572880	7577760	the Phantom pain what was the what was the demo called the Metal Gear Solid ground zero ground
7577760	7582960	zeros that's it so yeah yeah I have that downloaded I haven't checked it out yet though but I kind of
7582960	7588560	I don't know I kind of fell out of the Metal Gear Solid series I never played I didn't play four even
7588560	7594660	though I have it on PlayStation 3 I barely played three at all so but I just I love the series on
7594660	7600360	the NES I never was able to make the hop to 3d like I love the story in Metal Gear Solid later
7600360	7604920	on but I just couldn't get into the gameplay like everybody else did on the PlayStation and so forth
7604920	7611240	but I understand why people are really into it but that's cool I'm glad you enjoyed that so a
7611240	7616520	little perk of PlayStation Plus is there are there any other games that you're waiting to go free on
7616520	7623600	PlayStation Plus no it's on Xbox one oh you're playing it on Xbox one I got with the games with
7623600	7631640	gold thingy I forgot the games with gold got that yeah they just got it this month ah okay so okay
7631640	7635640	I assumed it was PlayStation 4 because I knew they got it as part of their program I see well then
7635640	7644520	I'll flip it is there is there an Xbox game you want them to put out on games of gold actually
7644520	7652960	rice I like I hope I like it but I don't know I read a lot of mixed reviews yeah I don't know
7652960	7659240	if it's really worth to buy it that's that's a good call that's almost very much like knack on
7659240	7662280	the PlayStation 4 is like it's kind of one of those things you're curious about but it didn't
7662280	7667080	get very good reviews but rise that's that's a good one cuz yeah wasn't that the one that
7667080	7670800	originally was gonna be like a Kinect game and then they kind of like changed it and then it
7670800	7675200	kind of got the mediocre reviews yeah I'd still be curious to check that out though for sure for
7675200	7679400	sure well for breeze I really appreciate the call thank you so much for your kind words and calling
7679400	7684040	into the show today okay no problem thank you guys all right you take care and thanks so much

7700320	7705280	this yeah this is reaching me hey good afternoon to you I didn't even think you were listening
7705280	7719400	right now I didn't see you in chow what's up buddy you're breaking up a little bit so I might
7719400	7726520	have to cut you off ketchup flavored in the PTF chips here in Buffalo you're not very calm you
7726520	7733600	can't go to the big major stores you'll have to go to the smaller colder stores and get them but
7733600	7742080	not less they are here so I never personally tried them but I've seen around try target that's where
7742080	7755840	I find them yeah now number do this rage nator if you can hear me you're breaking up really bad I'm
7755880	7760120	so sorry I'm gonna have to let you go because I can't understand what you're saying I only heard
7760120	7765640	the part about the chips but try to ask if you ask your question in chat over at live dot vog
7765640	7770360	network comm because I know you hang out in chat I'll be happy to answer whatever that is there so
7770360	7774440	watch check that out of live dog network comm sorry Skype was acting weird I don't know why
7774440	7779160	it does that I guess they don't have a lot of bandwidth up in Buffalo either usually it's only
7779160	7783520	during the snow storms that he cuts out but I know it's not snowing today all right one eight seven
7783720	7789440	game olr or username on Skype orange lounge radio all one word I'm checking with Loki again I heard
7789440	7795800	you about to read another yes I do have another story I know which game you're waiting for forum
7795800	7802360	for this generation of games dead or alive extreme three is in development is it yes yes can you
7802360	7809080	imagine the physics calculations that are possible by these new systems I am very excited although I
7809200	7815360	am also just be clear I am all for equal opportunity offensiveness so if they want to have package
7815360	7823320	physics that's completely fine as well but I'll take boob jiggles too I'll take all of it all
7823320	7833040	right I want everything to be shaking just just give me jello the game that's all is that it
7833040	7841600	that's it and then apparently though it's getting released exclusively though in Asia
7841600	7849160	oh come on something like that can't stay exclusive to Asia we need that so that dev says in our chat
7849160	7853920	room over at live dog network comm we need that I agree we need it all right well it looks like
7853920	7858720	nobody else is taking advantage of the Skype line today but I know it is a weird time so we probably
7858720	7862560	don't have a lot of our usual audience listening right now probably will have a bunch of people
7862720	7866160	listening later on going crap I forgot they were doing the early show today even though we to put
7866160	7871560	it on Twitter and Facebook always stay on top of our Twitter twitter.com slash olr any important

7907480	7911680	another hard-working independent podcast there's so many people out there that do this just for the
7911680	7916800	fun of it and and they need your support so bad really appreciate it before we get to final
7916800	7922320	thoughts Raginator got his question out in chat so I'll go ahead and entertain this here so summing
7922320	7927320	up my call here Raginator says one that free magic game is out on Steam now we need to set up a vog
7927320	7935600	game night two do you know if upgrading a PC's OS will fuck up miscellaneous files DRM Loki do you
7935600	7942200	know about that I it can it depends sometimes you like I know for like unity we had the revoked the
7942200	7949240	license if you had a pro version and then redo it for the most of my other stuff no so it depends
7949240	7953400	yeah for everything I had it transferred over pretty cleanly I didn't have a problem and I
7953400	7958200	would imagine if that license is through Microsoft you're not gonna have a problem at all but what
7958200	7963280	I'd encourage you to do first whatever the license is through whatever the DRM is through just Google
7963280	7968440	it and try to see if other people have been having problems just Google it followed by Windows 10 or
7968440	7973960	whatever most people have been ready to send for a while now they didn't just upgrade they've been
7973960	7978240	running preview builds and stuff so they should be aware of any issues that are out there yeah so
7978240	7983000	you'll know so do your research like you know I did not upgrade till Windows 10 until I verified
7983000	7988320	Final Fantasy 14 has no problems on Windows 10 you know so those types of issues you definitely
7988320	7991800	want to Google and just do your research upfront and just make sure nobody else is having problems
7991800	7996800	and there's no problem like Windows 10 is gonna be free for what a year so you don't have to I'm
7996800	8001480	assuming that's the OS your win upgrade do you don't have to necessarily jump in right now you
8001480	8006400	can wait a week or two it's not gonna kill you in fact a lot of people are saying wait a week or two
8006400	8010480	so Microsoft can work out some of these bugs although I'm not getting a very buggy experience
8010480	8014800	I guess some other people are one last thing I'll say about the Windows 10 upgrade that I didn't
8014800	8020960	know about but made me feel better about doing it is that it actually keeps your old Windows
8020960	8026240	installation for a month so if you decide you don't like Windows 10 you can go into the settings
8026240	8030280	and you can bring back your old installation of Windows 7 or whatever it was you have before so
8030280	8034720	that that kind of made me go okay knowing that I feel better and I'll take the plunge that I can
8034720	8040280	always recover from that so there's some things to think about and then the last part there with
8040280	8044760	with rage nators saying about the magic the free magic game out on Steam now we need to set up a
8044760	8048840	vog game night I agree and now that I'm doing a little more of the live streaming and so forth
8048840	8054600	I'd be super open to that so you can check that out we do have a community on Steam so you can

8096000	8100760	of better to have this at the very end of our weekend but once in a while when we're able to
8100760	8105200	make it work we're glad that we can do something at a different time to help some different people
8105200	8109840	get the live experience happy to share that with you guys so that's gonna do it for another week
8109840	8114200	here at orange lounge radio before we officially closed down though we have to go around and get
8114200	8119480	everybody's final thought so dark Sakura I'll start with you tonight final thought now once
8119480	8126240	in a while is stuck in my head once in a while like the best song you don't wanna go in the play
8126240	8134800	not even in the movie except for a deleted scene yeah but it's the first time I heard it we were
8134880	8140920	doing like a kind of a shadow casting with a VHS recording and they paused it and the guy got up
8140920	8148080	and sang it and everyone's like oh nice and then we continued nice so actually my second time ever
8148080	8153080	watching the rocky horror picture show I heard the song when we did rocky horror here in Sacramento
8153080	8156800	now that everything's digital we spliced it back in we put it back in the movie and we actually did
8156800	8161400	the scene and it was a really bad audience reception we thought we would like get a lot
8161400	8165480	of cheers and people going like oh my god they're doing the cutscene and everything but we tried it
8165480	8168840	like four different times the audience was just dead we tried to do all these different things
8168840	8172480	to make the scene more interesting like we tried to move the slow dancing to that scene and all
8172480	8176880	but it just didn't work we cut it we ended up re-cutting it just people weren't into it but I
8176880	8181520	do love that song yeah that's like the best song in the whole thing that and superheroes like my
8181520	8186240	two favorite songs are like the sad depressing ones are like the ones that are either cut apart
8186240	8194240	for the u.s. release or not in the movie yeah so hey you should hear this if you haven't already
8194240	8199040	heard it the soundtrack to shock treatment I mean that movie sucks but like soundtracks the
8199040	8203460	soundtracks really good I need to watch it again to see if it makes sense it's you start to
8203460	8208880	appreciate shock treatment on like your sixth viewing you kind of start to realize this was
8208880	8213600	a parody of reality television before anybody knew what reality television was but like if you look
8213600	8218680	at it in that context now it's like a brilliant parody which is so weird because it's that didn't
8218680	8224960	exist they were psycho and head ESPN they were completely all right that was a long final thought
8224960	8230320	but that's okay it was a final discussion it was a final discussion Loki your final thought tonight
8230320	8236960	my final thought is I'm working more on my game I just am working on trying to design a logo for
8236960	8242600	my game and you know development company or whatever and then also I do have a new video
8242600	8248680	up if you haven't checked it out yet on YouTube so under my channel Loki OLR you can check out
8248680	8254880	the new video words on my Twitter nice and then my final thought I will also pimp my YouTube Rob
8254880	8259760	Roberts plays and then I'm also on Twitch as just Rob Roberts and I'm really excited to do more live
8259760	8263800	streaming I've really missed it so I'm gonna get back in the swing of things and more of our jam
8263800	8268840	videos to come including the lat you know the last video I'm gonna do is Loki's game whatever
8268880	8274160	he's freaking got done with it I'm gonna make him let me play it for the last video so I look
8274160	8278800	forward to that please look forward to it thank you guys so much for I just thought of a channel
