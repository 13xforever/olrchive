00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,840
This week, Rera unloads a slew of old games for us to enjoy all over again, ranging from

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,000
arcade and PC-type classics to games from only one generation ago.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There's sure to be something for everyone in this episode, and it all starts right now

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 609 for this

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
August 9th of 2015. My name is Rob Roberts, you can find me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E,

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and joining me here in Studio N7 with me as always, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Sommers.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Word.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How you doing, Jamie?

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My stomach hurts.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But it's full of avocado, which makes me happy.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, that avocado shouldn't be making you sick, I hope.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, just life makes me sick.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So we're back at our normal time. Well, I'm sorry to hear that life is making you sick.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Are you allergic to the program?

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Well, I'm allergic to air.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I know it doesn't make you sick. So we had the early show last week, so we're back at our normal time tonight.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hi everybody. We do tape live, I always say this, we do tape live every Sunday night at the

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Voice of Geeks Network, voggenetwork.com, 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But we did an early show last week, in part so that our friends in Europe and in the different time zones

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
could partake in the show, which is always fun, we had some different callers last week,

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
but also so that you and I could get in the car and go straight out to San Francisco,

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
which there's no such thing as going straight to San Francisco with all the traffic.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We went curved to San Francisco.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I think a lot of you use this app on the phone called Waze, and I'll just shout it out,

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I mean they're not paying me to, but it's a great app because it accounts for traffic.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But man, we took back roads the whole way to San Francisco, it was actually a really pretty drive.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We went down the river and all around.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So we went to San Francisco and you for the first time got to eat at the Brazilian meat place.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What did you think of the meat buffet?

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It was amazing. Except it took me like five days to recover from the sugar I had.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That and being sick, because I actually did come back sick on Monday.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh no. Well, I definitely had a great time.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think even for five days of sick it would have been worth it.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Less worth it though is our pal Victoria, who we were seeing off.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She has officially moved to Southern California.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But we appreciate everybody being flexible with the schedule last week.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We're back to being on time this week.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
On time with us here in studio, of course, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hello.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
How you doing, Loki?

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Fine.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What are you watching here on YouTube? Call of Duty Black Ops 3 multiplayer.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, this is Gamescom stuff.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah, I was just checking out the video.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah. Is this one of these fancy YouTube videos that runs in the 60 frames a second?

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It is one of those fancy YouTube videos.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I was just trying to see, you know, because it looks very similar to Advanced Warfare,

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and I just want to see how it looked differently.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And there's a wall running. I don't know. I'll check it out, I guess.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
As if you weren't going to be buying this game anyway. Let's be real.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't know. See, I bought Advanced Warfare, I played through the campaign,

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
and then I bought the season pass and everything.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I was like, oh, yeah, all my friends will do it, and then I stopped playing it.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So I have the season pass, and I have all this content waiting for me to play it.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I just need to go play it.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All right. Get on it. Anyway, we have a really busy show tonight.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You know, with Gamescom having gone on this past week,

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
there's a lot of news coming out from overseas.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So we're going to get into that, of course, tonight.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But I want to get into our kickoff topic here tonight,

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
and I invite you guys to participate with this topic or anything on the show.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We do, of course, tape live on Sundays, and if you are listening live,

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
you can head on over to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
and have your say on what we're talking about here in studio.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Tonight's kickoff topic, you know, a big game was released this week,

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
but it wasn't really a new game. It was a game made up of old games.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Of course, I'm talking about Rare Replay, and I'll talk about my personal thoughts

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and a little mini review of the game in a little bit when we get into

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
how is our gaming week.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But I wanted to talk a little bit about kind of the fixation on retro classics,

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
because, you know, certainly Rare Replay isn't the only retro collection,

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
you know, that's coming out soon.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I want to give a shout-out to my pals over at SacGamers Unite.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Of course, Gabe and Bree have been on this program before with the SacIGDA.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
They were kind enough to have me on their show this past Wednesday,

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and they do two guests on their show because it's a two-hour program,

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and I was on the first hour.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And the second hour was a gentleman who was involved with the Mega Man update

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that's happening, and I think they finally dated that for the end of...

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Is it this month?

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Is it this month?

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It is this month.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, it's coming real soon, so it's within weeks.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And I know there's a lot of people looking forward to that too, although I know...

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know. I'm not entirely looking forward to it,

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
because I'm going to all of a sudden go, man, I'm not as good as I used to be at this.

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, and that's kind of what I want to get into.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And, you know, I'm not going to talk about a game that's not released.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I haven't got a chance to try.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I definitely am interested to check it out, because, yes,

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I realize that GameCube collection is out there,

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
but I also realize that the GameCube is not going to look on my new high refresh rate.

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Television is not going to look the same as PlayStation 4 or Xbox One,

97
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you know, with this Mega Man update.

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
So I'm still curious to check it out on the online leaderboards and all that stuff too.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But I digress.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I kind of want to go into what you're talking about a little bit, Loki,

101
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
with the whole, sometimes these games aren't really as good as I remember them.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And some of the things I'm seeing on Twitter about Rare Replay is,

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you know, I'm having fun with Banjo-Kazooie and RC Pro-Am,

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
but there's a lot of crap in this collection.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There's a lot of filler in this particular collection.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't know. For one, certainly I can see where, you know,

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
one person's trash is another's treasure.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I think there might be some people that are really into a game that maybe you didn't even know about.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
For me, that's Cobra Triangle.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And I admit that game is hard as hell.

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, I used to play the hell out of it.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
See, I have so many memories with that game that it just kind of gives me a warm fuzzy just to even go play it.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But here's my question.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why do we have this fascination with retro things?

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And do they hold up against our imagination sometimes?

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Because it seems like, based on some of the vibe I'm seeing about Rare Replay, it doesn't.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What do you guys think in our chatroom, live.vognetwork.com?

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Do retro games hold up, or is it just we want them to be as good as we remember them 20 years ago?

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think a lot of this collection, it's kind of an easy way for them to make money off of that stuff.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Some of the more well-done collections, I think, have been like those Dreamclass collections

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
or the Model 2 collections that they had from Sega.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You remember they had that, was it that big Sega collection?

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The Sonic retro collection, stuff like that.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I was really well done, too.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So I'm down with those types of things.

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, to be fair to Rare Replay, despite the oddity about it adding all these Xbox 360 games in your library,

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,000
which I'll talk about in a minute, it isn't just a menu with games and click the game.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They really took time to build a little shell around the games.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They have all these interesting kind of remixes of the songs that will play on the menus.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So there's some neat little tracks.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They make a little theme. They sing a little song about Rare games, which I thought was really cute in the beginning.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So they added a lot more than just front-end menu, play the game type of thing.

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's more than what Nintendo has with Virtual Console. Sorry for the shade, but it's true.

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Virtual Console could be so awesome. They could just do so much with that.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Imagine, if you would, your virtual living room, and all your games are up on the shelf.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You could pull the boxes out, look at the box.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The Microsoft Game Room was kind of sold out.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, sort of like that. They could do so much with that, and they just have it.

139
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
They're just like, aaaand rum.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I mean, so it's like, I don't know. Just take the extra step, and people will appreciate that much more.

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I was reading a tweet or something that called out an amazing fact about Rare Replay,

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
is that with the release of Rare Replay, there are now more Nintendo 64 games playable on the Xbox One than there are the Wii U.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And I kind of had to do a second take at that fact.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I kind of don't think it's counting that there are Nintendo 64 games on the Wii Virtual Console,

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and you can kind of back-end into the Wii on the Wii U.

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But still, it is kind of a jarring, like, wow, you would think they'd have a lot of these games available on the Wii U, and they're not.

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
How hard is it to bring that stuff over? I don't understand.

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If it runs natively in the Wii U anyways, are you telling me that the Wii U can't emulate a Nintendo 64 game?

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Because my fucking phone can emulate a Nintendo 64 game.

150
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Like, I think the PSP could emulate a phone, you know, one of those games.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You can't tell me that the Wii U does not have the processing power, nor do they have the skills to create an emulator to run a Nintendo 64 game.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Dark Soccer, the queen of the classic game of the week.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I want to get your thoughts on this in a minute about how retro games hold up, but I want to go to some comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Dungeon Buster says, some retro games do, others just don't.

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I played GoldenEye again a while ago after hooking up my N64 back up, and yeah, yay, progress.

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You know, speaking specifically of GoldenEye, it's interesting he mentions that one.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
VomitEye.

158
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, because the motions. You know what's funny?

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Even when I was playing Banjo-Kazooie, I don't usually get motion sick, but I was definitely like, whoa, okay, some of those turns and things are way too fast.

160
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Granted, these games were not designed with a 60-inch TV and high refresh rate in mind, but I mean, still, I was like, oh, crap, I gotta look away for a minute.

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So, it's like...

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hold on, I just want to call out, the GoldenEye, some people are lamenting about the games that aren't there.

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Like, you know, with the Rare Replay, everybody's quick to say, well, there's no GoldenEye, there's no Donkey Kong Country,

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
there's no anticipation.

165
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There's no jumping in Perfect Dark.

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But, I mean, I understand licensing makes that whole thing very, very tricky.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Anyway, Loki, what were you about to say?

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I... oh, I was just asking, I didn't realize GoldenEye wasn't in there, I was gonna ask if they had online multiplayer with that.

169
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Perfect Dark, I'm assuming they have online multiplayer since the Xbox Live Arcade version.

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Exactly, what they did for some of those games is it's just the Xbox Live Arcade version.

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So, when you're getting Perfect Dark, you're not getting the N64 version, you're getting the 360 version, which was basically the N64 version with better textures, things like that.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
One other comment here in chat, then I'll go over to Jamie.

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Raginator says, I like retro stuff, I have all the Sega stuff on Steam.

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hell, I called y'all two weeks ago complaining that Steam needed more retro stuff.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So, maybe what's out there just isn't enough.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Checking in with our queen of the retro classic game of the week here on OLR.

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Darcyra, what do you think? Do retro games hold up, or are some of them better left in our memory and we probably shouldn't go back?

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes.

179
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
To which part?

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Both, depends on the game.

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Some things that you think are fun when your brain is less developed that ends up not being so much fun once you have an adult brain.

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Interesting facts you're delivering there is that your brain is not fully developed when you're a kid, and so maybe there's certain things that you are entertained by a little differently than you are when you're in your 30s.

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm gonna go into a little bit of neuroscience.

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay, not too much though.

185
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
No, just a little bit.

186
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't bore the show.

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Basically, your brain hasn't finished creating all of its neural pathways for men until oldest about between 24 and 27, and for women it's a little bit earlier than that.

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That means that anything that gives you immediate reward is going to appeal more to a younger mind than it will for something that's gonna take longer to build up to.

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So you can play a game that might have been one of those instant reward games, but it's not gonna have the same payoff for you as an adult who's looking for something that wants something more cumulative.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yeah.

191
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So at that respect, you've got it.

192
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Then again, if you've got something that's gonna combine that immediate result, yay, I passed the level, I'm going on to the next, and build on that, then that's gonna be the type of things that's gonna have, I think, a little bit more staying power.

193
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Do you think our bullshit tolerance was higher when we were kids?

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And maybe part of that is the technology, but I feel like there's some games you go back and play and you go, this really wasn't very good.

195
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What was I thinking?

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I'm not saying that with about Rare Replay, but just other retro things.

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Raise your hand if you liked the Back to the Future game on the NES.

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I, okay, I will raise my hand for this, and I defend this game to this day. I liked Friday the 13th on the NES.

199
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That game was funny.

200
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And I realize a lot of people hate that game.

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Well, it's just like Goonies 2.

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Goonies 2 was awesome too, but you're right, you go back and you play some of those games, it's a little rough now these days.

203
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah.

204
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You know, look at things that we just instantly put as a classic, like, we have the Guardian Legend.

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
We're gonna use that one because that is the best game in the universe.

206
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Why do we still like it to this day?

207
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Because it's maintained staying a difficult game, yet you've got the progression through it as you keep going.

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's got great music. It's visually a good game, you know, for an early compile game.

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You know, but it's got all of those factors that made it cool for us as kids.

210
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You know, you'd get the instant payoff of finally beating that one boss, but when we go back to it and we can still do it,

211
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
or we still have the progressive difficulty, you know, we're not aware of that as kids, we're aware of it as adults.

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, and you know, and certainly I'm definitely not saying that all retro games, none of them hold up,

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
because like, I still to this day go back, and who doesn't?

214
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Like, there were so many different ways to play it.

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Go back to like Mario 3 and be like, I'm gonna just play through all the stages on World 1 just in a sitting,

216
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
because I just remember this game and I love it.

217
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Like, you know, and some games like that just are never gonna get old.

218
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Or for me, you know, like the Guardian Legend, like you talk about Kid Icarus.

219
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
When I went to Penny Arcade Expo East and I was in the classic game room, I was waiting for Bobby or something.

220
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't remember what I was doing, but I was like, you know what?

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm gonna get a copy of Kid Icarus and play it on an old school Nintendo the way it was meant to be played.

222
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
And it was so fun and I still love that game to this day and it holds up amazingly well.

223
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
So does any version of Metroid.

224
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why do you think we still have the collection?

225
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I mean, that's pretty much it.

226
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Um, you know, or here's another one, like playing through Dracula X.

227
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I mean, there's a reason why that game to this day is a hundred plus dollars.

228
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You know, because it is a solid game and it's got everything that's going to appeal no matter what age you are,

229
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
or how you remember playing it, it's still gonna be fresh every time you pick it up.

230
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Let me get to some more comments in our chat room over at Live.VogueNetwork.com.

231
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Alan Alchemy says, how many damn trash movies can you watch now as an adult,

232
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
only because you first saw it because you were 13 and you know damn well if it wasn't for that,

233
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
you couldn't stand it for longer than a few minutes.

234
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I still love Xanadu.

235
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's a really good analogy, but I have to admit, some of them I love even more as an adult.

236
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Like Clue of the Movie, that was my favorite movie when I was eight years old.

237
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I shoot you not. I watched it every day.

238
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Clue's not bad.

239
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
No, it's not. It's cheesy and I think a lot of people look at it and go that movie's so cheesy,

240
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
but like that movie just got even better as I got older.

241
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And Pee Wee's Big Adventure, you get more of the jokes when you get older.

242
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You realize how fucked up some of those movies were.

243
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You know, actually it's the same thing for going back and watching Rocky and Bull Eagle.

244
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes, or even like the Animaniacs or Tiny Toons, you know,

245
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
because when those, at least for you and me and a little bit Loki,

246
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
we were right at about that age where all the jokes started to make sense,

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
you know what I mean, when those shows were new.

248
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Anyway, also comments in our chat room.

249
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Akuma JP says, for me, I think it's imagination.

250
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We had more of that when we were young.

251
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And Dungeon Buster piggybacks on that saying, I agree, imagination filled in a lot of gaps

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
because the hardware was only capable of so much back then.

253
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Why do you think all the artwork on the Atari 2600 was epic

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and so unrepresentative of the final game?

255
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Because when you're playing a game like combat,

256
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
they don't want you to see these crappy little boxes on a screen that are firing.

257
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That was all about gameplay. It didn't matter that it looked stupid.

258
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It was just cool. It's a tank game where you get to fight each other.

259
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But you know they're tanks because on the box you see an epic,

260
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
and I think with combat it wasn't just tanks because people forget this,

261
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
but you had the game switch, which is a huge part of Atari,

262
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
and there was like an air battle mode because airplanes and other stuff too.

263
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It wasn't just tanks.

264
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The big plane versus the three planes, that was always fun.

265
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And of course, Tiger Claw bringing up the opposite here in our chat room.

266
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm sure you remember the artwork for Mega Man and then playing the actual game.

267
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Mega Man didn't look like the cover art. Well, there's always exceptions.

268
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Yes, and I would like to also remind everybody to fuck you Konami,

269
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
and also fuck you Capcom.

270
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I had to add the Konami one in there, but fuck you Capcom for teasing us

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
to the fucking box art Mega Man versus Capcom 3.

272
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
And fuck you Konami just for the fuck of it.

273
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Just while you're at it.

274
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Just while I'm at it. I'm mad at you still.

275
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why is everybody in the games industry so angry, Loki?

276
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So angry all the time.

277
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Because of, what was it, sexual violence or what was that?

278
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What?

279
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Erotic violence, that's why we're angry.

280
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Oh, oh god, you're talking about the, that was in last week's show, right?

281
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The pachinko trailer that came up at the end of last week's show?

282
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Yes.

283
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Alright, anyway.

284
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You just took it to an awkward place, talking about erotic violence.

285
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Anyway, and Dark Tetsuya said, bad box art Mega Man was taken across Street Fighter.

286
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Whatever. It doesn't matter. Still Capcom, still fuck them.

287
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Alan Alchemy is talking about Street Fighter 2010, that horrible NES game.

288
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I love that game! That's unfortunate.

289
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Everybody's got that game. They're gonna stick up for it.

290
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I still love that game.

291
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You know what? Yeah, it was stupid. It was incredibly stupid.

292
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But you know what? That was back in the day where you fucking go and rent your games and shit.

293
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
And that's, it looked cool, played it, you know, whatever. I played the hell out of that.

294
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Alright. I think that's gonna do it for our kickoff topic this week. Lots of good discussion.

295
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think in a future week we need to get into, though, what game do you still defend to this day that everybody else hates?

296
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I feel like we might have done it on a previous show. I mean, with 600 previous episodes, it's easy to duplicate things sometimes.

297
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Should do it by, like, generation.

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Yeah, maybe. Maybe that'll be a fun thing to get into one night.

299
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Alright, anyhow, we'll do that another week. For now, let's get into our gaming week and talk about the types of games that we've been playing this week.

300
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It was a lot of Dragon Age Inquisition because of the DLC coming out next week.

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Which, I couldn't find the story to talk about that, so...

303
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
DLC coming out next week. It'll be awesome.

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Now, Jamie, it's not time for the news yet.

305
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You know what? I don't care.

306
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Rule breaker!

307
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I also played some Final Fantasy XIV, just so that my free company didn't think I was dead.

308
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Playing a lot of Peach World, honestly enough, because it's been sort of my brain break game.

309
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And I got Pillars of Eternity from my Mac. I haven't installed it yet, but I just got it the other day.

310
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So I will be giving it a try.

311
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Alright. Awesome. So good luck with the Dragon Age DLC this week. I'm curious to hear how that goes.

312
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I really need to go back and beat Inquisition. That's still on my list of, like, to-do.

313
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But, you know, MMOs, other games, they all fight for my attention.

314
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Loki, what got your attention this week? How was your gaming week?

315
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I played a bunch of weird stuff this week.

316
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So I played a little bit of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes because my son's still playing that game.

317
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He's, like, almost 180 hours in it now.

318
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Wow.

319
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Probably over 250 hours by the time the next game comes out.

320
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Unfortunately.

321
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You know what? Just on a random side note, when your son's our age, like, you know, we'll say mid-20s, Wink, our age.

322
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:18,000
When your son's mid-20s, I bet he'll say the best PlayStation 4 game was this LEGO game because it's the one that he'll have memories of playing with you.

323
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Not to be cheesy, but I bet that'll totally be it.

324
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Well, yeah, because, well, here's the thing, though.

325
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It won't be frickin' No Man's Sky or Uncharted. It's gonna be LEGO because that's the one he remembers playing with you.

326
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Well, here's the funny thing about that, too. It's, like, I've been pointing out, like, all the glitches in the game, and so now that he points out all the glitches in the game.

327
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh, God! It's a mini Loki!

328
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
And so, like, he's all, he's all, Dad, look at this glitch! Look at this glitch!

329
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
And there'll be, like, people walking through the buildings or up in the air or something like that.

330
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He found a way to clip under the map the other day on accident.

331
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You got a speedrunner in training.

332
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And so, um, so then I figured out a way to clip under the map, and so we've been just clipping under the map and just breaking the game.

333
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I guess I'm bored. I don't want to play this game anymore.

334
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Dad and son cheating together.

335
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Like, I don't want to, like, we've been, like, wandering around the city for, like, hundreds of hours now, and I'm just like, okay, I need something else I can do in this game, because you don't want to play any of the levels, so.

336
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Alright, I'm going to clip under the map now.

337
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,000
And so I clip under the map, and I finally got into the helicarrier, like, because all the internal stuff from, like, the helicarrier is just hidden under the map.

338
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And so I clipped into it, and, um, so I was inside the helicarrier while he was outside.

339
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Which is weird, because when someone goes into the helicarrier, both players have to go in there.

340
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So why the fuck is that limitation in there, since, you know, obviously the game can run just fine with one person in there and not, I don't know, whatever.

341
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So, we played a little bit of that.

342
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Um, what else did I play this week?

343
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I played, um, I played a little bit of Woah Dave, and, woah man, that game is terrible.

344
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I deleted that. I do not like Woah Dave.

345
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Well, you, okay, but do you like the retro style? Well, speaking of retro-

346
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah, I like retro style games, and I understand the point of it, but I just got bored with it really fast.

347
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I liked it in a, I see this in an 80s pizza parlor type of way.

348
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Like, it's not something I would sit there for an hour and hours, but-

349
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yeah, I get it, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it, because it was a free game, but I just, I removed it off my hard drive after.

350
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I gave it a few tries, and I'm like, nope, sorry, I just don't want to play this anymore.

351
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Um, Justin in our chat room says, get the fuck out of here with that Woah Dave hate. That game is excellent.

352
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Ah, whatever, I mean, it's fine.

353
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Thank you, at least somebody agrees with you.

354
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I played a little bit more Roundabout. I was trying to show my, because I'm trying to get myself to play something else other than Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

355
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I just play anything else. How about Minecraft? How about, how about Roundabout?

356
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You know, and so I showed him Roundabout, and he just didn't like that. He thought it was stupid.

357
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Um, so I played a little bit of Roundabout, um, and then I played a few games.

358
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I was asked by one of our listeners to play through Dream, and I'm such a stupid chicken shit when it comes to these games.

359
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Like, because I read the achievements on, it's a Nightmare 1, Nightmare 2, Nightmare 3, I'm like, oh shit, this is gonna be one of those games that's fucking jump scares or something like that.

360
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
So, like, the first part, you start off in a house, and you're, you're-

361
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Wait a minute, do you get really scared of these games? Do you like-

362
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
No, I just, I don't play them, so, I just don't like those types of games.

363
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Am I the wrong person to be broadcasting Five Nights at Freddy's? Should it have been Loki this whole time, doing these games?

364
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You want me to buy you a copy?

365
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I have, I don't, no, I don't need to buy, have you buy a copy. I have enough games in my library.

366
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
No, but seriously, um, so I ended up, cause, like, it was a glitchy game, so I heard, like, a door shut.

367
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm like, oh shit, it's gonna be fucking jump scare time, cause now they're trying to tell me to turn off all the lights and go to bed.

368
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm like, okay, there's gonna be some, like, ghost or something, like, waiting for it to jump out at me, and so I'm like, okay, off.

369
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And then, so I was like, okay, fine. I promised I'd play it, so, I played through all that, and apparently there are no jump scares in that part.

370
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
But, the game, I guess you explore dreams or something, so, like, this, the first part of it, you're in this, like, desert, and you have to go through these caves,

371
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and turn off the lights, and you do that by walking under the lights, and then when you turn off the lights, all of the lights, it traps a smoke monster or something in there.

372
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And so, like, it's kind of weird because it's, like, it talks about, like, you know how they do dream interpretation stuff, what that's supposed to mean?

373
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So, like, you find, like, a fragment and tells you, okay, a maze means this, and smoke means this.

374
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:28,000
So, yeah, that's the only, like, it's not even scary, it's just like, ooh, I heard, like, something chasing after me, you know, so there's this smoke monster thing I'm running from.

375
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, sorry.

376
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, I was going to say, it's very similar to, like, um, like, was it the, um, Ether One? Like, it's one of those first person exploration games, I guess.

377
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
So, it's like a puzzle game. I want to go back and play Ether One, but it's broken.

378
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Um, there's an, okay, so Shane has already picked out the next scary game I need to play.

379
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Okay.

380
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:57,000
And I forget the name in the moment, I'm hoping he's listening and he'll text it to me, or somebody in chat will just shout it out based on, uh, what my description of the game.

381
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,000
But it's, like, a multiplayer scary game. I know we talked about it on the show before, too, which makes the fact that I can't remember the name more frustrating.

382
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,000
But, like, some people are the ghosts, and then some people are the ones in the house trying to basically outlive the ghosts.

383
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
And I know it's something Shane's been playing with Flocko, he's like, we need to play this, we need to play this.

384
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But since it's a multiplayer game, Loki, I think it's something we all need to play. I think Jamie needs to play, too.

385
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
They're saying that I should play Five Nights at Freddy's. I thought I had Five Nights at Freddy's. I swear I played that game.

386
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I don't remember, because I played it and, like, I got, you know, one of the things jumped at me and I was like, alright.

387
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Like, I don't know, it wasn't like I was scared by it or startled by it, it was just kind of like, eh, I don't really want to play this anymore.

388
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's just, you know, it's going to be too hard to get past these levels, you know, I don't know. I think, I'm pretty sure I have it, I gotta check my Steam library.

389
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
But, anyway, speaking of Steam library, another game I played was Bionic Commando.

390
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And I had bought Bionic Commando when it first came out, because, you know, I'm a huge fan of Bionic Commando, and I even, I don't give a shit, even the 3D one, you know, I'm totally into that.

391
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But I tried playing it on Steam, and man, that game is fucking terrible. And I'm not saying that it's a terrible game, as in, you know, the story's terrible, I'm sure the story's terrible, but I don't give a shit about that.

392
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:26,000
The controls are fucking terrible. Like, I'm literally standing two feet away from a soldier and I can't fucking hit him with my gun, because the goddamn controls are all just fucked up.

393
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:37,000
The sensitivity, I could never get it right on the controller, it just felt very delayed, I even dropped, my laptop's not that strong, but shit, it should be able to run fucking Bionic Commando.

394
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That game's fucking old, so, I dropped down the resolution, down the 720, and it still was running very choppy and like shit, so, I don't know.

395
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I may give it another try, I thought it ran pretty good on Xbox 360, and I know I've played it on that, but, I don't know, maybe I'll go back and play Rearmed or something.

396
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So I played that, and then, what else, I don't think I worked on my game this week, I've been trying to figure out, trying to design logos and stuff, because I want to work on my website to go with all that, for like leaderboards and stuff, and I just want to get to look nice first before I get to it.

397
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,000
God, I thought I played another game, maybe that was it. Yeah, that was my gaming week.

398
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Alright, fair enough. Let's see, let's get into my gaming week, and like I mentioned before, I played Rare Replay.

399
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:42,000
So I picked that game up, and I was checking that out on Xbox One, and reliving some of the old, all the way from the old Spectrum stuff, like I actually enjoy Jetpack, but then there's some other games in there that are really bad.

400
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Like Gun Fright, I don't understand what the hell's going on in that game. And I know I can hit a button and read the manual on the side, but I kind of don't like that setup.

401
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Like I really think some of these old games could have just benefited from like a splash screen that says, here's how the game plays.

402
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:06,000
And I really can't believe, especially with all the polish that they put on the game, they didn't put something that simple in there to help people who may not have known these games understand a little quicker how to play them.

403
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
It seems kind of self-explanatory, like it's just like...

404
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Not that game. I don't understand why there's a one, I imagine there's one particular guy you're looking for, but I don't know who's good, I don't know who's bad. It's just a weird setup.

405
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I mean, yeah, some of them are really easy to pick up, like Slalom, you know, the skiing game on NES, that doesn't really make the game good.

406
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:35,000
But I don't want to sound all negative on Rare Replay, because actually it's a really fantastic deal for $30, and there's enough really, really good stuff in there to justify the purchase.

407
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I mean, games like RC Pro-Am are still great today, except for the excessive squeaking noise when you're making corners.

408
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That still bugs me to this day, there's too much squeaking.

409
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But RC Pro-Am 2, I think I only ever played that game like one time, so it was really cool to see that again.

410
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And I even love the games like Cobra Triangle, even Snake Rattle and Roll, even though it can be infuriatingly difficult sometimes,

411
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
because if you can't control the snake just right, then you fall into the water and it's doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo, you know, just really silly stuff.

412
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
But I would have no idea what to do in Snake Rattle and Roll if I didn't remember some of the concepts from when I was a kid.

413
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,000
By the way, the goal, you're trying to get as many pieces for your snake so that you weigh down the bell at the end, which is what will open the door to the next level.

414
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
And so you want to eat anything that's circular, but not if it's going to turn into a bomb, or, you know, things that are not pieces of snake.

415
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
And you actually hit a button when you're over the little trapdoors, and some of them have pieces of snake in them.

416
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So that's what that is. If you're wondering what the eff that game is all about, there you go. I gave you a little overview right there.

417
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I like Alan's comment. Slalom is a bad name for that game. It should be called Skiing Butthole.

418
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Well, the reason why he says that is I was playing the game and your character kind of bends over as he's like skiing down the hill.

419
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So Alan walks in the room and kind of goes, that is a giant butthole on the screen right now.

420
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And it's because of the slalom. You're just going down and skiing down the mountain. That game's kind of bad though.

421
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
But like, there's some games that Rare has done that I didn't get to experience the first time.

422
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You know, I know we do this podcast, but you all know this isn't how we pay our bills.

423
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
We don't have time to play every single game that's ever been out.

424
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And there was especially a few years in there during the Nintendo 64 era, you know, right at the end of N64 and beginning of PlayStation 2 and Dreamcast and all that.

425
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
They're like, I missed a lot of games. And one of those games I just never got around to playing before was Banjo-Kazooie.

426
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And I know there's a lot of love for that game and especially with the spiritual successor coming out, right?

427
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Yooka-Laylee, that whole thing, right?

428
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So getting to go back and play Banjo-Kazooie was actually kind of rad because I had not played it before.

429
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And yeah, even though the graphics are a little rough and so forth, it was actually a lot of fun kind of playing the game and exploring the first level and getting...

430
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
It's very Mario 64-esque if you, for whatever reason, have never played it.

431
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
But obviously with some different mechanics with the fact that you learn like new moves everywhere.

432
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
So you're putting all these moves together to get through different stages.

433
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
But yeah, getting to play that for the first time was pretty cool.

434
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So for every stinker like Gun Fright, there's some gem in there probably that you haven't experienced before.

435
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So I think for 30 bucks Rare Replay is worth it.

436
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But I have one more, as much as I enjoy the game and I recommend it, I do have one more thing I gotta be picky about because I don't get it.

437
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Okay? So when I put Rare Replay, the disc and the drive, my Xbox goes, I gotta download 5 gigabytes worth of updates.

438
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:36,000
What? 5 gigab... Well, what it's downloading is because it's putting all the 360 games, get their own little entry, thanks to the backwards compatibility thing, get their own little entry in your game library.

439
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So the 360 games and the way it interfaces with Rare Replay is kind of clunky.

440
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:53,000
And I guess I understand why they did it because if you already had the game in the past and have achievements and stuff, they wanted to be able to just tap into the old library and so forth, but it's really clunky.

441
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And you know, my Xbox 360 wasn't wired and it was taking forever to download things, so I had to go get the wire and plug it into my 360.

442
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It was just kind of a hassle. So I don't... And now if I go into my game library, it's filled with all the Xbox 360 Rare Replay stuff.

443
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
And so I kind of wish... I don't know, I just wish they'd taken a different approach with that because that whole thing felt really clunky to me in what otherwise is a fairly slick interface.

444
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So that's my other minor, minor complaint. Otherwise I thought the game was a lot of fun and worth it for $30.

445
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, the only thing I disliked about Banjo-Kazooie was it kind of brought in the OMG play the game 20 times to collect all 254 pieces of 40 different tokens mechanic.

446
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:49,000
So, let's see. Tigerclaw wants to know, did the N64 ports fix the framerate issues? Seeing as I hadn't played that game on N64, I couldn't tell you.

447
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,000
But what I will tell you is that it's the 360 versions of most of those games. If Rare put it out on the 360, then you're getting that version.

448
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,000
So Banjo-Kazooie, 360 version. Perfect Dark, 360 version. So take that for what it's worth.

449
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Other than that, I played a lot of the same stuff. I've still been playing a crap load of Final Fantasy XIV because, you know, MMO addiction.

450
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
What else did I play this week? I felt like there was something else new I wanted to play that I wanted to tell you guys about.

451
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And now I'm forgetting into the moment what I was playing. So I guess that'll have to do. More Clicker Heroes.

452
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Because I'm still addicted to that game. That's not really a game though. That's just kind of a pastime.

453
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,000
You can appreciate this, Loki. Last night, I went out and played Ingress for three hours with friends.

454
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
We went out on the town. I know you love my Ingress addiction, so...

455
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I don't have a problem with it, honestly. In songs you don't have a problem with me cheating like crazy at fucking Clicker Heroes.

456
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You do what you want.

457
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The game plays itself. I mean, literally plays itself. Because I had an autoclicker on and I didn't want to have to do it.

458
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I think a ton of people use an autoclicker.

459
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
And here's why. It's because I was already so far in the game before the Flash version stopped working.

460
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And so I'm like, fuck it. I just want to finish all the achievements on this. I don't even fucking care.

461
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I don't just want to play it anymore.

462
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
If you want to play a single player game like Clicker Heroes and cheat, that's fine. Do your thing. Nobody cares.

463
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
But as long as you don't cheat in a multiplayer game like Ingress, because everybody hates the people that cheat in Ingress. It's awful.

464
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
How do you cheat in that?

465
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Wow.

466
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
But I'm hoping we can at least have a little get-together somewhere.

467
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You know, maybe an official meet-up spot somewhere. So we'll work that out in the coming days.

468
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The other thing I want to mention, I already gave my shout-out to SacGamersUnite, but I did want to just shout them out one more time for having me on their show this week. Thank you very much. Appreciate that.

469
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I want to give a shout-out to Anime Jam Session, which is Tuesday nights here at the Voice Geeks Network.

470
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,000
They're going to be bringing us a special programming Saturday from noon Eastern to five Eastern, which will be 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Pacific.

471
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
They are going to be bringing us International Sailor Moon Day. Did you know that Sailor Moon has a day?

472
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Everything has a day.

473
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Sailor Moon has a day, and it's Saturday, and there's going to be little mini conventions all over the world.

474
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I think yesterday was International Cat Day or something.

475
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
There was National Underwear Day this week as well on Twitter, so I think Twitter invents a lot of shit.

476
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:56,000
But International Sailor Moon Day I think is a little more legit. I think National Sailor Moon Day is up there with Talk Like a Pirate Day.

477
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You're not going to see either one officially recognized on a Hallmark calendar.

478
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
It's up there with Steak and a Blowjob Day, right?

479
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
We'll have to ask Rama where that all lay.

480
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
But anyway, tune in on Saturday for Sailor Moon, and everybody will transform magically on cue.

481
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
And I think Rama's going to call on the show later to talk a little more about that, so we welcome that.

482
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
So, there you go.

483
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
That is, I think, all I have for Housekeeping Tonight. I'm probably forgetting something. I'll have to come back to it later.

484
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
But in the meantime, we need to get into some gaming news, because there is a lot going on.

485
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So, Loki, let's get into it.

486
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Hey! It's a game, a sequel for a game that we never asked for a sequel for.

487
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But Halo Wars, the RTS Halo game, is getting a sequel.

488
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And it is coming out on Windows 10.

489
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I wonder, probably Xbox One as well. Yeah, Xbox One as well.

490
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
And, hooray! I don't know.

491
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
It's also being developed by Creative Assembly, and of course they did the Total War series.

492
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Along with that, they were announcing at Gamescom something more towards your mainstream Halo fan.

493
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The Halo World Championships.

494
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
They're going to be doing basically a competition, a multiplayer competition along with that.

495
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Around the same time, they will be offering the brand new Halo 5 Guardians limited edition console.

496
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,000
That's one terabyte. It has a one terabyte hard drive, and it looks pretty nice.

497
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I dig how that is painted with all the blue and silver and... yeah.

498
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
That did look like a really pretty machine. It almost made me sad I already bought an Xbox One, but not...

499
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,000
If only certain games were coming out this year and not being pushed to next year.

500
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Crackdown, you say?

501
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Yes, crackdown I say.

502
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
But, yeah. I'll just have to wait for that one, I guess.

503
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Well, now, I know a lot of people out there were big fans of Halo Wars, but I wasn't really expecting that game to ever get a sequel.

504
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
So, it's kind of neat that I guess something is coming, after all, for that.

505
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Well, it's also good to see that there's another RTS game, because there's not a whole lot of mainstream RTS games nowadays.

506
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
True.

507
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,000
So, I guess it's good in that sense.

508
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I guess it's better than that Gears of War one that they were showing off at one time.

509
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So, I don't know. And I guess with Halo 5, they're also kind of trying to...

510
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
They have that brand new game mode that's supposed to cater more towards the esports thing.

511
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,000
So, I think they're really trying to jump on that esports bandwagon to kind of get up there with the Call of Duty's and Dota's and all that stuff.

512
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Makes sense. Bobby Blackwolf with a fun fact in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

513
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Bobby says, the first Halo World Championships were broadcast on G4 before the TechTV acquisition and commentated on by Will Wheaton.

514
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Because Will used to do the arena show on G4, right? For at least a short time.

515
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I've been listening to lots of Will Wheaton lately, because I started listening to the audiobook version of Armada.

516
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Which is not interesting so far, but I'm listening to him talk in my ear for several hours at a time.

517
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Well, there you go. So, the Halo World Championship is not exactly new, but I guess, hey, why not?

518
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The Nintendo World Championships, 25 years later, all the rage.

519
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I bet they do that again at E3 next year, or at some other time.

520
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So, why not? Why not? Microsoft wants their World Championships to get people excited about, too.

521
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
I want more Maker games.

522
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
You want more Mario Maker games?

523
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I want Nintendo Maker. No, seriously, I want to be able to cross Zelda, Metroid, Mario...

524
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You want NES Remix Maker?

525
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Basically, yeah. I think that would be fucking amazing.

526
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Can you imagine doing a Legend of Zelda game skin like Metroid or something?

527
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
You know, like top-down shit with all the fucking Metroid enemies and graphics and all that stuff?

528
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You know Nintendo's afraid of all the sex games people are going to make, though.

529
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
You know Nintendo's afraid of, well, I don't know if I want to say afraid, but concern.

530
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Nintendo's concerned about all the penises that will be drawn out of Mario and Lincoln.

531
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Who cares? It's just...

532
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Just let people get it out of their system and then done.

533
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
The more attention you pay to it, the more people are going to do it.

534
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Haven't you had kids before? Don't you know if you want to, you know, get rid of a bad behavior?

535
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You ignore it. And then unless they keep doing it, then you smack the shit out of them.

536
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Or you put them in timeout. Whatever your choice of discipline is.

537
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Alright. Before I get into my next story here, which is all side of gamescom, I remember the other thing I wanted to bring up in housekeeping.

538
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
So I'm going to say it now.

539
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
So, you know, here at OLR, we do this show for free.

540
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
And we don't ask for your money. I'm not asking for your money.

541
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
You know, we say just tell a friend or five about the show.

542
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And spread the word. That's all we ask here at OLR.

543
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:56,000
But out of the goodness of their hearts, sometimes listeners will send us gifts.

544
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
And, you know, I don't just go giving out the shipping address to anybody.

545
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I kind of have to know you a little bit, right?

546
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,000
But we still have some listeners that, you know, I've known for a while who are good enough to actually send us things once in a while.

547
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Like, Dara Sagar, you got booze from a listener, right?

548
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yes. Although I can't have it unless I've been super, super, super vigilant with my healthy stuff.

549
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Well, I have to tell you guys, we got a box this week.

550
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
What?

551
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And speaking of stuff you probably can't have, Dara Sagar, I apologize in advance, but you're just going to have to deal with it.

552
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
We got a box this week from Akuma JP from Japan.

553
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And I want to make sure you guys got this because there were some cool things for me.

554
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And he was very cool and got me some amiibo, so I was very happy for that.

555
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
He's only helping your addiction there.

556
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,000
But I want to point out, Loki, he got that for you. There's a little Mario.

557
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Nice.

558
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
From Japan.

559
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
That's cool.

560
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And then this is for you, Dara Sagar, a little Kirby.

561
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So I'm going to throw that over there.

562
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Oh my God, he's so cute.

563
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm assuming these are for you, Dara Sagar, because I can't read a lick of Japanese.

564
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But there's some gaming magazines here, and Dara Sagar, I'm sure you will enjoy that.

565
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And then as well as this poster here.

566
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Maybe we'll hang that up in the studio.

567
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
But then remember, do you remember when Akuma sent us all the candy?

568
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yes, it was delicious.

569
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
And there was one in particular.

570
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
The green melty kisses.

571
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
He sent us nine boxes of the pear candy.

572
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Oh my God, that's the best stuff.

573
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Nine boxes. Look at that right there. Sorry, I know this is radio.

574
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,000
But nine boxes of the pear candy because we loved it so much.

575
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,000
And all I'm thinking in the back of my mind is Dark Sagar's on a diet.

576
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
But she's going to have to go on the fuck it diet for a few minutes.

577
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
You know what? I have totally been excellent and good. Let me read the label.

578
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
There it is.

579
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It's so good.

580
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Akuma JP in the chat is apologizing. I'm so sorry. No more amiibo.

581
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
What are you apologizing for? Don't apologize for anything.

582
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Alright, they want a picture in chat of this.

583
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So we'll get the magazine and some of this stuff all together.

584
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
We'll take a little picture. We'll put it on our Twitter account.

585
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

586
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Doesn't it look like he just picked the whole damn thing up off the shelf?

587
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I'm just taking a picture of the candy.

588
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Just the candy.

589
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Alright, so there it is.

590
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So I wanted to make sure Akuma JP got a shout out.

591
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And thank you so much.

592
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Thank you so much. And again, our listeners don't have to do that.

593
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And I think that's awesome that, you know, anybody would take the time out to do that.

594
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Especially when it's from other places.

595
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Because I can't walk into a store and get pear candy.

596
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And in the US, I can't walk into a store and get pear candy.

597
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You can have it over at the Corianna Plaza or whatever.

598
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I've checked at the Corianna Plaza for this. They don't have this candy.

599
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
They do have green tea KitKats.

600
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
You know this is weekly Famitsu, right?

601
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
That is Famitsu. I figured it was Famitsu, yeah.

602
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I was gonna say, I found the Melty Kiss that was so good.

603
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
But I've been asking Oto's to get the pear candy and they haven't gotten it.

604
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Well, Akuma JP is actually clarifying in our chat right now.

605
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
You can't get the pear candy anymore. It's seasonal.

606
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Holy crap.

607
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
This is like pumpkin spice right here.

608
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
So it's like the pumpkin spice trade. It's like the modern, you know.

609
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
This is the other seasonal thing then.

610
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Because the buffalo sweat, the vanilla bean is seasonal as well.

611
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
That's what I need to send to Akuma JP.

612
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
I'm gonna send him just a box full of pumpkin spice stuff.

613
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
He'll probably be like, I hate pumpkin. What are you doing?

614
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I'm gonna have to airdrop the pictures to myself and e-mail to you for the official Twitter.

615
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Oh, you don't have the OLR Twitter?

616
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Not on my phone.

617
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Darsakra, give it the program. Alright.

618
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Anyway, more stuff.

619
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
As I'm sitting here airdropping it to myself because, hello.

620
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Alright, back to some gaming news.

621
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Speaking of Japan and things that come out of Japan.

622
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Obviously the Xbox One kind of starving for some content there.

623
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Because I would bet one thing that Akuma JP couldn't send me from Japan.

624
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Maybe something I could send Akuma JP that he probably doesn't have in Japan would be like anything that has an Xbox logo on it.

625
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Or anything Xbox One really. Like an Xbox Magazine. It's probably unheard of over there.

626
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
So anyhow, Scalebound though, hoping to make a splash on the Xbox One.

627
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
They announced more about Scalebound at Gamescom.

628
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Including the fact that the gameplay trailer shows four player co-op.

629
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
And that the game is not out until holiday 2016.

630
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
So if you were thinking it was this year, you gotta wait a little longer.

631
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
But the game still does look really cool.

632
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And you got a good glimpse at the hero and they actually put out a trailer which you can check out on their YouTubes.

633
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So there you go. Platinum Games of course releasing that in holiday 2016.

634
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm interested in Scalebound.

635
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Wait, DarkSakura is freaking out and she doesn't have a mic. So we can't hear her.

636
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I just did the barcode scan and it actually is in my fitness palette.

637
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And this stuff is called Choco London pear flavor.

638
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Well it's delicious.

639
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Yeah, and it actually doesn't have a little bit of sugar.

640
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Oh, she's rationalizing people.

641
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
No, it really doesn't. It's only got like 3 grams per piece.

642
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Alright. Can I talk about more Microsofts?

643
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
No pear candies.

644
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Well they're both green.

645
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Anyhow, for your Pear Box 1, I'm sure a lot of you are looking forward to Backwards Compatibility.

646
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Well Backwards Compatibility is coming out for everyone in November.

647
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,000
That is what we've learned that Backwards Compatibility will be out for everybody in November.

648
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
We don't know any more details than that.

649
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Although, there was a little bit of a movie thing that they were showing to tease it.

650
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:38,000
And you could see some more box art that's not already there.

651
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,000
You could distinctly see Alan Wake as one of the games that would be Backwards Compatible.

652
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
That's another great 360 game that I think a lot of people might have missed.

653
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:56,000
And on top of that, they were promising to think with that,

654
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
that upcoming Xbox Games of Gold games that are going to be offered for 360

655
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
were going to be Backwards Compatible as well.

656
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
So you can kind of build up your library that way.

657
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
But how long are they going to keep the Games of Gold thing for 360?

658
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Because I would think there's not a lot of 360 games coming out.

659
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
But maybe that's it.

660
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You've got lots of people that have a 360 that don't have an Xbox One.

661
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:26,000
So it would be kind of cool to enhance that Sony.

662
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
I mean that would be pretty nice.

663
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I'd love to play all my PlayStation 3 games on my PlayStation 4.

664
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Hey, we're waiting for the Sony response to this.

665
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Come on, my PlayStation Portable could play PlayStation 1 games.

666
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I think a PlayStation 4 can probably handle that.

667
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Same argument goes with Nintendo, like as I mentioned earlier.

668
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
We're going to wait and see how that...

669
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Don't tell me that your fucking processor that can handle so many particles and shit

670
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:58,000
can't render the advanced low-poly engines that were in PlayStation 1 titles.

671
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Calm down, we'll see.

672
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
If they do another one of those PlayStation fan...

673
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
What did they call that thing they did in Vegas last year?

674
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
PlayStation Experience, was that it?

675
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
If they do another one of those this year, that would be a great time for them to just

676
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
whip out backwards compatibility on stage.

677
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
That would be cool. Or announce whatever the fuck they have coming for fourth quarter.

678
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Because right now it's Zilch, so I don't know what they've got for fourth quarter this year.

679
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Alright, third party.

680
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The Call of Duty, that's why they bought the Call of Duty exclusive stuff.

681
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I'm sorry.

682
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
You got DLC slightly early in Call of Duty.

683
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
We're getting on another tangent.

684
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
At least Microsoft has Halo.

685
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,000
And they fucking have, you know, Forza, so we know what they've got coming.

686
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Dark Sakura, what's next?

687
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Did you get the pictures? Because I sent them to you.

688
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
I did. I'll get them on Twitter later.

689
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Okay.

690
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Well, Steam is giving out full unconditional refunds for Journey of the Light.

691
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
It was a PC puzzler that was supposed to be one of the hardest puzzle games on Steam.

692
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
And yeah, it's really hard, because you know why?

693
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Because eight of the puzzles don't exist.

694
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
No, seven of the puzzles don't exist.

695
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So, yeah, people were trying to open the game, and yeah, there was only the one level, so there's nothing else.

696
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So yeah, Steam just like, here's all your money back.

697
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:23,000
So yeah, the game has also been...

698
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Yeah, there's actually another note on here that the guy who made the game is not sure why it happened that way,

699
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
but he said that that's not how it was when he released it, so whatever.

700
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
He said it was an error in a patch that he released.

701
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Yeah, somehow that I copied over all the levels with the same level.

702
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:54,000
But here's the funny thing, apparently the first level is also unbeatable, so I don't know.

703
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Interesting.

704
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's why they have the Steam refund policy, so...

705
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Well, and I thought there was one interesting thing I caught when I was reading about this before the show,

706
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
is that, well, Steam will let you refund anything up to two hours, right?

707
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
But with this game, they're opening it up for, you can play it however long,

708
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,000
because, I guess one of the things was, the trading cards don't unlock until you've played it for two hours.

709
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Yeah.

710
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And I didn't realize that they could set that by the game.

711
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
I thought they all unlocked every 20 minutes or whatever, I thought that was a Steam standard rule.

712
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So I didn't realize that you had to play the game for more than two hours to unlock the cards,

713
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,000
and then I was thinking about it, I was like, that's a really wicked way to work around the whole two hour return thing,

714
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
is that now you're gonna start not getting cards until you've played the game for two hours.

715
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Who cares, they're fucking trading cards.

716
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I know.

717
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
But you know some people are super into that.

718
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Well cool, then you're dumb enough to buy a broken game and keep playing it for two hours until you get stupid trading cards for that game.

719
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Woo.

720
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Alright.

721
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I hope that when you do finally end up crafting those cards into a badge, you get a giant wallpaper that says,

722
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
You purchased a broken game, you dumbass.

723
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
But hey, ha ha, you played it too long, so no refunds for you.

724
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
No tixie-baxies.

725
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Loki, you're in a mood tonight, but why don't you go to the next story, Loki.

726
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Alright, so Microsoft is offering a free DVR program, or DVR service, I guess, for over-the-air TV.

727
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And apparently they're gonna allow you to record footage.

728
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It can be played back on any Windows 10 device.

729
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And of course that would include the Xbox One, Windows 10, and Windows phones.

730
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
They're saying that you can remotely schedule the programs via the One Guide.

731
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
And then I guess recording, it's done seamlessly.

732
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:59,000
What I'm curious though is, how the fuck do you get over-the-air TV into the Xbox One?

733
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Because it doesn't have a cable jack in it.

734
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So how's that work? Is it gonna be a separate adapter that's gonna be plugged into it?

735
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Doesn't it have an import for HDMI or something?

736
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Yeah, it has that HDMI input.

737
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Could you do a TV output to the input? Just your TV?

738
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I guess, but that would be kind of... I don't know if that would work.

739
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I mean, and even still, they're only limiting it to over-the-air.

740
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,000
It can't be cable or anything.

741
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
And a lot of TVs, I'm not sure if they have HDMI out.

742
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Justin is pointing out in our chatroom, you can buy an HDTV tuner accessory.

743
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I wasn't aware that they even sold an accessory like that.

744
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Okay, so that makes a little bit more sense.

745
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
So it's like the DVD player on the original Xbox.

746
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
That's kind of cool that they have that.

747
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,000
I kind of want to set something up like that on my TV,

748
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
because I had to put an antenna in the attic and I just...

749
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
I don't want to go in the attic.

750
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Because that means crawling through the attic.

751
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And there's like fiberglass up there, and spiders and shit,

752
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
and it's fucking hot, and I'm going to fall through the ceiling.

753
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
And it's totally what's going to happen.

754
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:14,000
There's a part of me that thinks this sounds super cool.

755
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Obviously, I would be really into this if it could do the cable box.

756
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Because, what? Comcast wants to charge an additional $10 a month

757
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
to literally push a button on the box.

758
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It can already do DVR, but they only enable it if you pay the extra $10 a month.

759
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Oh my god, I could just put the fucking antenna in my garage.

760
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Duh! Stupid! Run the cable outside!

761
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Loki's brainstorming in his head right now.

762
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Makes sense.

763
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So there's a part of me that... I mean, you still can get a lot on over-the-air channels.

764
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I mean, not everything, but I could watch the new Heroes.

765
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm wondering, where's that service that was for $15 where you get cable channels and shit?

766
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I'm down with that.

767
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Are you talking about Arrow? Didn't they get sued out of existence?

768
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
No, no, no. Not Arrow. There was another thing that you got, like a beta test.

769
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Was it Sling or something like that?

770
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Where they were going to have it on the Xbox One, actually, where you can actually get...

771
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It wasn't Arrow, because Arrow was all local stations.

772
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:22,000
This was basically TBS, TNT, Comedy Central, MTV, Food Network stuff for like $15 a month.

773
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Or it starts at $15 a month, I think.

774
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Because I'd be down for those channels for $15.

775
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Well, also, maybe Microsoft may be getting into their own cable thing,

776
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
kind of like we've seen Sony starting to get into in some cities as well.

777
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
So maybe that's why... I don't know.

778
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Maybe there's a reason Microsoft really doesn't want to piss off the cable companies.

779
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I mean, maybe that's just a battle they decide isn't worth fighting.

780
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I don't know. At least it's free, like over-the-air TV always has been.

781
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
So it's interesting enough, but I think you're right.

782
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
It's only going to be in certain circumstances, if I'm willing to run a wire a certain way or what have you,

783
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
that I'm really going to benefit from it.

784
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I've got an over-the-air tuner for my Boxee Box, which I think is fucking old as shit.

785
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
But maybe it's universal. I mean, it's by Hopage, so...

786
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I don't know.

787
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
There's a lot of channels I can get just through my TV without really an extra accessory.

788
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
You know, I bet if I bought a cheap little HD antenna, I'd get a lot more.

789
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
At least the local, like 310 and 1340 and all the local ones.

790
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,000
We used to get the fucking... what was it? The over-the... I forgot to call those now.

791
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
It was the over-the-air stations through your cable line.

792
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Normally, if you have cable TV and you can do that...

793
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:43,000
I forget the term for it, but basically you would just plug into that and you would get those without having to have an antenna.

794
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And then they caught wise and went,

795
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Wait a second, you know, you weren't buying our cable package. Shut off!

796
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
So they don't have that anymore.

797
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Alright, well, moving on to some very different news.

798
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
You know, Microsoft was not the only ones at Gamescom that were announcing some big updates and changes and what have you.

799
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Activision Blizzard, namely the Blizzard part of that equation,

800
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
was also making some announcements at Gamescom.

801
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,000
One of them including that Starcraft 2 Legacy of the Void, it will release within 2015.

802
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
We've been waiting a long time for this final part of the Starcraft 2 trilogy.

803
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Because, you know, Starcraft 2 started a while ago and, you know, we're finally getting to that last part.

804
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Then what the fuck are they going to have at Blizzcon?

805
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
That's a very good question. I'll get to that in a minute.

806
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
They're saying the final third of the story will be released within 2015.

807
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It is currently in closed beta, which you can get if you've pre-ordered the game.

808
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
This is the version of the game that's going to focus on the protoss.

809
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
There are, of course, some new modes for casual and competitive play.

810
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,000
So, maybe they're going to announce a release date at Blizzcon because they could do that.

811
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Or, oh, it's going to be their mob-

812
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Don't they have, like, another game coming or something like that?

813
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Like some, like, Team Fortress 2 type thing?

814
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Yeah, Overwatch.

815
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,000
But anyway, one other game that will certainly be playable at Blizzcon, I'm sure,

816
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
is the newest World of Warcraft expansion. Legion was announced at Gamescom.

817
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,000
So, World of Warcraft Legion is the next expansion pack for World of Warcraft.

818
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:15,000
No idea when it's coming out, but I imagine that's something they will give more details on at Blizzcon.

819
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Coming in the game for Legion is a new class.

820
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Demon Hunter is a new hero class that will be playable within the game.

821
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
So, you can check out Demon Hunter in the game.

822
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I guess it's tank and DPS. No healer. No healieros or anything.

823
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Artifact weapons will be a new feature in the game.

824
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:39,000
You get artifact power and you unlock ability and traits and customize the weapon to do what you need it to do.

825
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:44,000
The Broken Isles will be the new zone where you can now level to 110.

826
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You can level your character to 110 out in the Broken Isles.

827
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
There will be a new order hall where NPC members of your class carry out missions at your command.

828
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I don't know if that's part of the garrison or what that's all about.

829
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And a brand new PvP honor system. This sounds very interesting.

830
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
They're really going to change PvP with this whole new way you rank up and you can get the points

831
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,000
and spend them on accessories and things for PvP and show-offy things.

832
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
So, all that sounds very interesting.

833
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I have to admit, as a former World of Warcraft player who I kind of quit during Pandaria

834
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
and now I pretty much play Final Fantasy XIV exclusively.

835
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I tried to go back to World of Warcraft during Warlord's Draenor, but I don't know.

836
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I just wasn't feeling it the same way I used to.

837
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And I've got to admit, when I'm watching the trailer, I'm not getting really excited about it.

838
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
So, I don't know. I guess my time with WoW is all done. I don't know.

839
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Dear Blizzard, no incur.

840
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Well, no. There's a lot of people that still care, but that number is certainly less than it used to be.

841
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
You know, I was talking with Twitter earlier this week about where the sub numbers,

842
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
because, you know, they had taken a dive not that long ago,

843
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:57,000
but when Warlord's Draenor came out, the sub numbers skyrocketed to, what, like 10 million?

844
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
So, will that happen again with Legion?

845
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,000
I don't think it's going to get that high, but there certainly will be a spike.

846
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,000
But I kind of think World of Warcraft has peaked.

847
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Like, I think we've seen the peak of World of Warcraft.

848
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
And that's okay. Blizzard has other ways.

849
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I mean, a lot of people that left World of Warcraft went to go play Heroes of the Storm.

850
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Still a Blizzard game.

851
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Probably going to check out Overwatch.

852
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Still a Blizzard game.

853
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Diablo 3.

854
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Starcraft.

855
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Hearthstone.

856
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
A lot of people playing Hearthstone.

857
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
You know, these are all still Blizzard games, so they're still making money off you one way or another.

858
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
So, I don't think Blizzard has anything to worry about.

859
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
As far as what are they going to announce at BlizzCon this year,

860
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I kind of suspect it'll be a Diablo 3 expansion pack,

861
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
because the game's done well on console.

862
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:50,000
It's one of their few games that's console and PC.

863
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So, I sort of think they'll squeeze out a little more Diablo 3.

864
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
That's what I would expect to hear about at BlizzCon.

865
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
By the way, if you're interested in going to BlizzCon,

866
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
and you have the money for a ticket, and you want to go,

867
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
hit me up, A-S-A-P, on Twitter.

868
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Twitter.com slash Sky, S-K-I-E.

869
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
And you want to get a hold of me before the 14th is the last day for name changes.

870
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
The reason why, due to a personal conflict that has come up,

871
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I can no longer go to BlizzCon.

872
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I was going to go, and this has nothing to do with the fact that Horde House has been on hiatus.

873
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
In a couple weeks, I'll tell you guys what's going on.

874
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
But there's a personal thing that's happening that now I can no longer do BlizzCon.

875
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
So, I do want to sell those tickets at face value.

876
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I'm not going to scalp you. No shenanigans.

877
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,000
I think it was 406 for two tickets.

878
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
So, just 200. 200 pop.

879
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
I am looking for somebody to buy both, but if I get desperate,

880
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
we get to like the day before, I will look at breaking them up.

881
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Or if I can find two individual buyers, then fine, I'll break them up. I don't care.

882
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
So, just a heads up.

883
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
If you're interested in going to BlizzCon and checking that out,

884
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
swag bags all yours, let me know on Twitter,

885
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
because I'm trying to unload those tickets.

886
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
So, there you go.

887
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Blizzard updates out of Gamescom.

888
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
We are going to get to release dates soon,

889
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
but Dark Soccer has got a quick note for us before we do.

890
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
That I do.

891
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
This is kind of a switch up in something EA's been doing.

892
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,000
They're basically going to start releasing their games in the UK a day earlier.

893
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
So, instead of doing it Friday in the UK, they're going to do it Thursday in the UK.

894
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So, pretty much, it's going to be, from what I can tell,

895
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
the equivalent of simultaneous releasing,

896
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:40,000
because, I mean, the day before there is, yeah, it's kind of weird.

897
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,000
So, yeah, but basically, they want to make sure that everyone in Europe

898
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
gets their games at the same time as everyone everywhere else.

899
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
So, yay.

900
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
All right.

901
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
I wonder if this will be a trend that moves on to other companies.

902
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
Maybe EA starts this and then a whole lot of other companies start releasing their games earlier.

903
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Yeah.

904
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,000
We'll see.

905
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Timey-wimey stuff.

906
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,000
All right.

907
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Well, before we find out, we've still got many more weeks to get through,

908
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
including this week and what is coming out in the US, Japan, and the UK.

909
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So, Loki, what is coming out in the US this week?

910
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Fuck if I know.

911
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Is that your official answer?

912
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
It's my answer currently.

913
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I'm just pulling it up real fast.

914
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I do apologize.

915
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Loki was unprepared for a release date segment that we do every week here on OLR.

916
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Well, yeah.

917
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Hey, I finally got a text back from Shane on that game that I'm supposed to check out on Steam.

918
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Oh, which game was it?

919
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Dead Realm is the name of the game.

920
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Dead Realm?

921
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
That's the game I'm supposed to check out on Steam in the scary game.

922
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I don't know.

923
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Look at it later when you're not looking up release dates.

924
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Okay.

925
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:02,000
So, this week, not a whole lot, actually.

926
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Basically, it looks like they're doing a, I guess this is an update,

927
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Toy Soldiers War Chest Hall of Fame Edition for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

928
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Then, for some stupid reason, they have a Paddington Adventures in London game for 3DS.

929
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
X-Blaze, Lost, and then Memories.

930
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
That's on PlayStation 3.

931
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Oh, that's right.

932
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I did remember there was a big game this week.

933
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Garfield Kart on 3DS.

934
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Oh, yay.

935
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,000
X-Blaze, Lost, Memories is also coming out on Vita as well.

936
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
And not a game you can buy at retail, but everybody's gone to the Rapture

937
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
or should be coming out on PlayStation 4.

938
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I was going to say, I see AndyScout mentioning that in chat right now.

939
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Everyone's gone to the Rapture.

940
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I know they've been pushing that on PlayStation as well in the digital store,

941
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
so I want to check that out too.

942
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
It's like a fun game.

943
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
That's it.

944
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
All right.

945
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Moving over to Japan and checking out the releases over there.

946
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,000
In Japan this week on the PlayStation 4, actually, there's really not a lot on PlayStation 4.

947
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Things are kind of quiet in Japan right now until the 27th of August,

948
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
at least on the PlayStation 4.

949
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Looking at some of the other systems, of course, the Wii U.

950
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Ain't got nothing until Mario Maker's out.

951
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
So they're pretty slow there.

952
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
But, you know, you can always usually count on the Vita in a slow week,

953
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
but this week on the Vita, nothing as well.

954
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
There's a Romeo vs. Juliet chapter pack thing coming out on the Vita,

955
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
but that's not until August 20th.

956
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So that just leaves me with the 3DS.

957
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:41,000
The 3DS has one lone game out this week, Atelier Deco La Doll Collection.

958
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
That's right.

959
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
A doll dress-up game is your lone release there on the 3DS this week.

960
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
So a very quiet week in Japan for releases.

961
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Dark Sakura?

962
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Just a few things.

963
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
On the 11th, we have Everybody's Gone to the Rapture,

964
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Goat Simulator on PS4 and PS3, and Olli Olli 2.

965
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Oh, God.

966
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Is that coming out over here too?

967
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I will have to buy it for a third time.

968
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Hasn't Olli Olli 2 been out forever?

969
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
No, fuck that.

970
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,000
I'm talking about Goat Simulator.

971
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Oh.

972
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Oh, God.

973
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Goat Simulator's on PC and Xbox One?

974
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Yeah, it's on PC, Xbox One, Xbox 360.

975
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Ah, got it.

976
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Yes, I want to buy that again.

977
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
That'll be the game I get my son to play.

978
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Goat Simulator.

979
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
He'll have to stream that shit.

980
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Are you a fan of Goat Simulator, Dark Sakura?

981
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I liked it for about five minutes.

982
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I think it's fun.

983
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
All right.

984
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Just a couple more stories, and then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week.

985
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Loki.

986
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
All right.

987
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Let's talk about Konami.

988
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I know.

989
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
It's depressing.

990
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Apparently, there's some information coming out from Nikkei's report about the company.

991
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I guess from some insiders.

992
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Some of the things coming out of the report.

993
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Apparently, they have renamed the computers that were originally part of Kojima Productions,

994
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
now known as Number 8 Production Department, and they're not connected to the internet

995
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
and only can send messages internally.

996
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Employees who leave office during lunchtime are monitored by time cards, and those who

997
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
take too long have their names announced throughout the company.

998
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Developers, including relatively high-ranking ones, who aren't seen as useful, they are

999
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
being reassigned to different jobs, including sometimes security guards or even cleaning

1000
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
staff of Konami's health clubs.

1001
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:45,000
Apparently, also, the company, they've monitored the farewell Facebook post of a soon-to-be-leaving

1002
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
employee, who had gotten a job at another company, and any employees who'd liked the

1003
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
post were reshuffled within the company.

1004
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,000
That sounds like a pretty hostile work environment, if you ask me.

1005
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Well, not that I'm gonna say, oh, I agree with all this stuff or necessarily defend.

1006
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,000
There is a big part of me that says, well, wait a minute, I'm gonna take a huge grain

1007
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:15,000
of salt with this, because is some of this being sensationalized for headlines sensationalism

1008
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,000
in my gaming journalism?

1009
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Maybe, I don't know.

1010
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
It's more real than you think, Loki.

1011
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
So, I mean, okay, some of it is extreme.

1012
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
The whole thing where people are getting reassigned to be the janitor and stuff, that's a little

1013
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,000
weird.

1014
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,000
But, okay, the computers are not on the internet.

1015
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
That does not seem like a crime against humanity, because putting the computers on the internet

1016
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
puts them at risk of getting hacked.

1017
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
The developers of the games probably don't have a need to be on the internet, because

1018
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
all the tools they use are internal.

1019
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Whatever they need access to are probably on their internal network.

1020
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Well, I think what they're doing is because maybe they're getting rid of that team that

1021
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,000
they don't want information being sent out from them externally or something like that.

1022
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But it's not unheard of for other companies as well.

1023
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Especially in a lot of non-office environments, you probably don't have access to the internet

1024
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
where you work.

1025
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Even in my work, the internet, a lot of stuff is blocked.

1026
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Is it a crime against humanity?

1027
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,000
No.

1028
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I understand why I can't play on Facebook during the workday.

1029
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Which also, again, if people are clicking like on a post or whatever about somebody's

1030
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,000
work, you've got to be careful what kind of crap you post on Facebook about the workplace.

1031
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,000
You really, really do.

1032
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Again, it's not that I agree, but I question how much of this is a little bit like the

1033
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
movie version.

1034
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I don't know.

1035
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
This is Konami, though.

1036
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I'm willing to believe a lot of it, because look at what they did.

1037
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
They literally scrubbed Kojima off of his game.

1038
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I mean, who does that?

1039
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
That's just bullshit.

1040
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I think that's why a lot of this is believable.

1041
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
I'm sure morale is in the toilet at Konami.

1042
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I'm sure morale is absolutely in the toilet.

1043
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:06,000
There's no arguing that, really, based on everything we're seeing and hearing.

1044
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Again, the urge to kick them while they're down, you've got to put that in check with,

1045
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
but what's the reality?

1046
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
But that's okay, though.

1047
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I've got good news for you.

1048
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Oh, goodie.

1049
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Because I know that everybody was so disappointed that PT came up there and they took it down

1050
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,000
off the internet and you're like, ah, damn, what about a new Silent Hill game?

1051
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
There's a brand new Silent Hill game coming.

1052
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
They just announced it.

1053
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Get excited for mobile games.

1054
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
It's a slot machine.

1055
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It's really happening.

1056
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
We were joking about that on the show a couple months ago when all this fuckery was hitting

1057
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
its peak.

1058
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:47,000
There really is a Silent Hill slot machine happening.

1059
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Yes.

1060
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
God.

1061
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
All right.

1062
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Okay.

1063
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Whatever.

1064
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Dr. Sakura's making a motion with her hand that's not safe for work.

1065
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:04,000
But really, the best news out of all this probably is completely unrelated, but I've

1066
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,000
been kind of watching some of their coverage of the test locations of the new DDR machine,

1067
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
but BomaniStyle's back.

1068
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
BomaniStyle.com.

1069
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Check it out.

1070
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
It's back.

1071
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Oh, yeah.

1072
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Our pals at BomaniStyle are back after this.

1073
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So to show there are still some good and some fans and stuff of Konami and, well, music

1074
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
gaming in general, because they're running a lot of stuff on Guitar Hero and other stuff

1075
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
too.

1076
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
But yeah, it's good that they're back.

1077
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
So welcome back.

1078
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Rolling out the red carpet.

1079
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Ticker tape parade.

1080
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
I'll have to get Eddie back on the show at some point.

1081
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
It's a lot of fun to have him on.

1082
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Especially in light of everything that's been going on, I'd really like to hear because

1083
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
he probably follows them even more closely than we do.

1084
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
So when are we going to start seeing the Silent Hill machines like at Red Hawk or something

1085
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
like that?

1086
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I don't know if they would ever bring the Silent Hill machines here because I don't

1087
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
think it really fits in with the old grandmas who fill up the arcade.

1088
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Oh my heart!

1089
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
You know, you look at the slot machines in Reno and it's more like, you know, the Ellen

1090
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
show and the Hangover movie.

1091
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
They have an Ellen show slot machine.

1092
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
I won 40 bucks off a Dolly Parton slot machine.

1093
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It was awesome.

1094
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
But they also had a Dungeons and Dragons.

1095
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
That's what makes me understand.

1096
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
I don't understand.

1097
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Maybe this is bigger in Japan or something.

1098
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
They have a really healthy gambling scene in Japan.

1099
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
I mean, where are these slot machines going?

1100
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Because I know over here in the states that do allow slot machines, I just don't see this

1101
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
type of slot machine being a draw.

1102
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
It's probably other Asian regions.

1103
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
It may not even necessarily be Japan.

1104
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
It could be Macau.

1105
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
It could be, you know, other parts of the world where there's gambling.

1106
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I just don't know.

1107
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Whatever, that's the direction you want to take the company in.

1108
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I guess I can only...

1109
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
No, I can mock you as long as I want, I guess.

1110
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
So I will continue to do so.

1111
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,000
All right.

1112
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Anyhow, let's move on.

1113
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I got to give a shout out to this real quick.

1114
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,000
It's on my mind.

1115
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,000
I got to say it.

1116
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
So our pal, Dekeman.

1117
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
You know, Dekeman?

1118
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
We owe Dekeman a lot.

1119
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
We would have a website right now if it wasn't for Dekeman.

1120
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
I know it's very old, and one of these days we'll get it updated.

1121
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
But Dekeman, he has a Tumblr, and I still keep in touch with him on Tumblr,

1122
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
and he posted a picture.

1123
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
He was behind a Konami car.

1124
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And remember, Dekeman lives like in the middle of nowhere Canada.

1125
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
With all due respect, you know, Dekeman, you're great,

1126
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
but you live in the middle of nowhere Canada, right?

1127
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
He knows that.

1128
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So he's behind this Konami car in the middle of nowhere Canada

1129
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
at a McDonald's drive-through.

1130
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And so he took a picture of him flipping the car off in the McDonald's drive-through.

1131
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
And on Tumblr, I couldn't help but add the line.

1132
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I said, how apropro that Konami is now resorting to buying from the dollar menu at McDonald's.

1133
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
But apparently he's got casinos, because he's in a remote part of Canada,

1134
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
he's got casinos where he's at.

1135
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I think it's a touristy area, because without giving away his home address,

1136
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I think he's in like a lake, which a lot of Canada is by a lake.

1137
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Would the dollar menu be considered microtransactions at McDonald's?

1138
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Fuck off.

1139
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Or is really any transaction a microtransaction at McDonald's?

1140
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
I mean, especially when you look at calories, I guess.

1141
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
So next time you go to, I can just see Loki.

1142
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
This is angry old man Loki driving to the McDonald's.

1143
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Yeah, I want a hamburger and a large diet coke.

1144
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
You want fries with that?

1145
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Fuck your microtransactions!

1146
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
First off, I have to question my sanity ordering a diet coke,

1147
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
because that's like, I'd rather drink water than diet coke.

1148
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
That shit is nasty.

1149
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Although, like, my wife had like some, I don't know what it is,

1150
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
like hipster green coke or something like that.

1151
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It's something like green canned shit that has like,

1152
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
something that's not sugar, it's unnatural.

1153
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Oh, it's the stevia coke.

1154
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Oh yeah, it's okay, I guess.

1155
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
It's coke life.

1156
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I got one of those once before they even had a price on it at the store.

1157
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
They basically rolled it out a month early.

1158
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I'm sorry, you just said hipster soda and Dark Sakura says,

1159
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
well, I got it a month before everybody else did.

1160
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
No, no, no, my grocery store actually put it out on the shelves

1161
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
before they were supposed to, so they didn't have a skew for it.

1162
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
You know, it's just, you're being hipster about hipster soda, but I love it.

1163
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever.

1164
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Arts.

1165
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I mean, one of those things.

1166
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,000
You want, you want some parakeet?

1167
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
You want, you want a whole box?

1168
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Cause we got nine boxes.

1169
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I'll take a box home.

1170
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Take a box home.

1171
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Give me one now.

1172
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Take two boxes home.

1173
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Get it out of my house.

1174
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Thank you.

1175
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I'll just give some as a housewarming thing when people come over.

1176
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,000
I only went to my wife.

1177
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
She always wants exotic candy.

1178
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
There you go, exotic candy.

1179
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Pear candy for, there you go.

1180
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I'll give, make sure Alan eats a box.

1181
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I just don't want to open the box.

1182
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
What is it?

1183
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
It's like a chocolate.

1184
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
It's like pear peanut brittle stuff.

1185
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,000
It looks like what it does on the front there.

1186
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Anyway.

1187
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
It's pear nut brittle with chocolate.

1188
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
This is great radio.

1189
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,000
So let's move on and talk about Killer Instinct season three.

1190
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Yeah, Killer Instinct's still going and Killer Instinct announced that season three is going

1191
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,000
to be coming to Xbox One and of course, as mentioned at E3, Windows 10.

1192
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
The date will be March of 2016.

1193
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,000
There is no gameplay footage available.

1194
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:22,000
However, Killer Instinct is apparently going to feature guest characters from Rare Replay.

1195
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Imagine that crossover.

1196
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Rash from Battletoads will be a character in Killer Instinct.

1197
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Actually, not even will be.

1198
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
He is a character available in Killer Instinct right now.

1199
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
So you can check out Rash, a preview character from Killer Instinct season three.

1200
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,000
And a cute little tie in there for Rare Replay.

1201
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
So if you want to know if GameStop has Battletoads, yes they do.

1202
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,000
And it's available even on the Xbox One as well.

1203
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Battletoads everywhere.

1204
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Now just, how about just a new Battletoads game?

1205
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I feel like that's the thing that Microsoft's been dancing around for ever since they picked up Rare.

1206
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
How about a new Battletoads game? How about it?

1207
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Microsoft is to Battletoads as Nintendo is to F-Zero.

1208
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
It is kind of irritating, isn't it?

1209
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Alright, let's go back to a more classic time.

1210
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Let's go back to a time when Battletoads was new and relevant.

1211
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Well, maybe a little past that actually.

1212
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Still pissed us off.

1213
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
It's the classic game of the week.

1214
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Dark Sakura's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

1215
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
hey, this is worthy of your attention.

1216
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
A classic game that you ought to be playing.

1217
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,000
And the rule is...

1218
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
It's so old.

1219
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Ten years old or more.

1220
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Because I think tonight's is like right on the line, right?

1221
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
It's like April, 2005.

1222
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
So if you can believe it, this game is ten years old.

1223
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Get ready to feel old.

1224
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1225
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Psychonauts.

1226
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
Yes, Psychonauts.

1227
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
It came out in 2005.

1228
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Released by Double Fine Productions through Majesco.

1229
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,000
So basically you play as a boy who has psychic powers.

1230
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Who runs away from the circus to sneak into summer camp for other people who are psycho.

1231
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I mean, have psychic powers.

1232
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
So you can be a Psychonaut.

1233
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
And there is a plot going on at the camp.

1234
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
The only he can stop.

1235
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:24,000
So he basically also works with a few of the other characters in the game.

1236
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Solves puzzles.

1237
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
And one of the things about this one that made it really...

1238
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
I'd say a special, special snowflake.

1239
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Is that not only is it a platforming game or has platforming elements to it.

1240
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:44,000
But it also sort of throws in the type of dialogue options that you get from an adventure game.

1241
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:50,000
You have to find hidden items you can use to buy items at the camp.

1242
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Or get psy cards that boost your ranking.

1243
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
You have to do like little levels within the game.

1244
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:02,000
And then you have the quote real world that's the camp that you're in.

1245
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
You also have an insane asylum in the game.

1246
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And every game needs an insane asylum.

1247
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,000
One of the other things that I thought was fun is finding the tags to match to emotional baggage.

1248
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Which is how you unlock different things in the game.

1249
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:23,000
And break mental vaults to get slideshows that let you know a little bit more about the character and whatnot.

1250
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So it's just really a fun little quirky game.

1251
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:33,000
He's got powers like telekinesis, pyrokinesis which is great.

1252
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Clairvoyance, PsyShield, PsyBlast, confusion, levitation, and invisibility.

1253
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
So pretty, pretty fun stuff.

1254
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:52,000
And I'm not going to go too much into that because honestly I think most of you have played this already since it's not, you know, it's just ten years ago, you know.

1255
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Loki was just telling me he was playing it yesterday. Isn't that right, Loki?

1256
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
No, I have never played this game. It's in my library. I have not played it.

1257
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Ten years.

1258
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,000
I have a feeling, unfortunately, there's a lot of people who picked up Psychonauts and let it rot in their library.

1259
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
So this might be a gentle reminder to go check it out.

1260
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,000
Well, at any rate, it got a really good score when it came out.

1261
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:26,000
It actually was, one of the best descriptions is actually one of GameSpot's sources.

1262
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
The whole look of the game feels like an unholy love child of Tim Burton and a Pixar animation team.

1263
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Yeah, I can see that.

1264
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
It's pretty accurate.

1265
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Well, and it's funny because we're talking about the whole, like, I was talking about Banjo-Kazooie earlier and it's almost kind of like this is that type of game evolves a little bit.

1266
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I mean, obviously there's a lot of differences. It's not tit for tat.

1267
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
But, you know, the whole, like, platformer, you know, what that looked like years later.

1268
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Well, it also won, like, a bajillion awards in 2005.

1269
01:19:53,000 --> 01:20:02,000
2006 it won Best Screenplay, Games Magazine, Electronic Game of the Year, Best Writing.

1270
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:08,000
It got Top Hero, 10 out of 10 for certain magazines.

1271
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
So it basically won all of these awards.

1272
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:16,000
But despite winning all of that, it actually was a commercial bomb.

1273
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
It failed.

1274
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,000
So, however, it's got a huge, like, cult following.

1275
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So it's remained popular even after that.

1276
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:29,000
You know, just sort of like Xanadu, you know?

1277
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Or the Rocky Horror Picture Show.

1278
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Or Xanadu.

1279
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
That's what this is. Or the Rocky Horror Xanadu Show.

1280
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Or with showgirls.

1281
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
In fact, I heard that coming to the Castro, Peach is Christ and Jinx Monsoon are doing Psychonauts.

1282
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Believe it or not.

1283
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I think that's the thing that's happening.

1284
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Maybe not.

1285
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.

1286
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Psychonauts.

1287
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
It's probably in your Steam library.

1288
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Go check it out already.

1289
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Dig it up.

1290
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
I think they were giving it away for free at one point.

1291
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,000
I swear, like, they were.

1292
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
It was like a Humble Bundle or something.

1293
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Yeah, Humble. It's been Humble.

1294
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,000
One of the earliest ones had it.

1295
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Yeah.

1296
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
So there you go. Classic game of the week.

1297
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Hey, we've got plenty more show coming up.

1298
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
We still have some more news out of Gamescom.

1299
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
We're going to get to the foogle question of the week as well.

1300
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And, of course, your emails.

1301

Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1302
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
It's the place to send your emails.

1303

And we're going to read some of those.

1304
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I think we actually got some this week.

1305
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
So we'll get to those.

1306
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000

1308
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1309
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1310
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Episode number 609 already in progress.

1311
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,000
This is part B. Live on this August 9th of 2015.

1312
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I just realized the episode number is 609.

1313
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
It's almost 69.

1314
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
But there's, like, a zero in the middle.

1315
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
There just comes a certain...

1316
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,000
It's for the threesome.

1317
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:54,000
That's right.

1318
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,000
They just put an O.

1319
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
The giant fat man.

1320
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Yeah.

1321
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Yeah.

1322
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Yeah.

1323
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,000
That's right.

1324
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,000
They just put an O.

1325
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,000
The giant fat man that's just sitting there doing nothing.

1326
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Or an O face in the middle.

1327
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Nope.

1328
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
It's the cat.

1329
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Hey, what are you doing?

1330
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Are you cuddling?

1331
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,000
I want to cuddle.

1332
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Purr, purr, purr, purr, purr.

1333
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Wouldn't that be 63?

1334
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Because the cat face is colon 3.

1335
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Yeah, but if it's, like, Shermie-sized, it's no.

1336
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Okay.

1337
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,000
All right.

1338
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Well, believe it or not, it's not a total perverted show.

1339
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Just sometimes.

1340
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
We talk about video games here on the program.

1341
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
And we're going to get back into rapid-fire news here, but I wanted to mention this, because

1342
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,720
Loki, you were talking during the break, you were mentioning you had to get this new Humble

1343
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:34,720
Bundle.

1344
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,280
And it does sound pretty awesome, actually.

1345
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,720
You know, they put together some really good deals over at Humble Bundle, I got to say.

1346
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:44,040
So what is it that people can catch up on this week?

1347
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,040
It's all Namco games, right?

1348
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,340
It's all Bandai Namco stuff.

1349
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:50,280
So they've got Pac-Man Championship Edition DX.

1350
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,280
That's the version with all the DLC.

1351
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,600
Do you know how much I paid for that?

1352
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,600
Yeah, though.

1353
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,600
And now they're just giving it away.

1354
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,600
The all-you-can-eat bundle.

1355
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,600
That's true.

1356
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,600
For a dollar.

1357
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:03,800
That's Platform Mines, Dead Core, and then for, if you beat the average, you get Ridge

1358
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:10,400
Racer Unbounded Bundle, Enslaved Odyssey to the West, Ace Combat and Assault Horizon,

1359
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:14,120
and then for $10, Dark Souls Prepared to Die Edition.

1360
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,800
Plus more games that they'll announce all later today.

1361
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:18,520
Yet to be announced!

1362
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:20,840
Maybe one of the Pac-Man Ghostly Adventure games.

1363
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:22,760
I haven't played Ridge Racer Unbounded too much.

1364
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,680
I played just a very little bit of it.

1365
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,640
And, I don't know, it's Bugbear, so it's not too terrible.

1366
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,640
It's just not...

1367
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:34,160
Damn, it's about time for a new Ridge Racer game, Namco.

1368
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:35,160
I mean, seriously.

1369
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:39,920
Well, I'm telling you, that whole thing is worth it for Pac-Man DX alone.

1370
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:40,920
I love that game.

1371
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:46,040
That's a great update of the Pac-Man series, so, I mean, just get that, even if nothing

1372
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,040
else.

1373
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,040
Drop the dollar.

1374
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:49,040
Although there's a lot of other good stuff in there, too.

1375
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:50,440
I'm just saying, the Pac-Man one just really jumps out at me.

1376
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:51,440
I was like, wow, what a deal.

1377
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:57,240
If Namco really wanted to do right by Ridge Racer fans, it would get reskinned R4.

1378
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:02,480
Now, going back to the whole retro glasses thing we were talking about at the very beginning

1379
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,480
of the show.

1380
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:04,480
That's for nothing.

1381
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,480
R4 was the best Ridge Racer game.

1382
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,200
It's the best Ridge Racer game there was.

1383
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,880
Okay, so you would take it just a reskinned HD R4?

1384
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,880
I would just take R4, period.

1385
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,080
I mean, I've got R4.

1386
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:14,560
R4 for PS4?

1387
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:15,760
R4 was amazing.

1388
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,200
With JotCon compatibility.

1389
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,120
The JotCon was not very good.

1390
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,760
It was actually pretty fun.

1391
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,460
That was playing Wipeout with the NegCon.

1392
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,460
That was pretty fun.

1393
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:31,200
ActDeft in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, I would kill for the Ridge Racer 5 HD

1394
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,200
remaster.

1395
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,620
Let's see, Ragenator says, I got the Namco Bandai bundle.

1396
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:36,620
Everything minus the Dark Souls.

1397
01:24:36,620 --> 01:24:40,880
I ended up giving Pac-Man CEDX Plus away since I already had it.

1398
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:45,320
I imagine a lot of folks out there probably already have it, but if you don't, this is

1399
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,960
a great time to jump on that.

1400
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:47,960
Just saying.

1401
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:52,200
Alright, let's go around and check out some other quick news and little quick bites we

1402
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,840
call rapid fire news.

1403
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:54,840
Loki.

1404
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:59,780
We seriously need to play the R4 theme at some point, like maybe break next week or

1405
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:00,780
something like that.

1406
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:01,780
It's amazing.

1407
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:02,780
Remind me, we'll do that.

1408
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:04,880
I'm pretty sure I have it from old OLR rotation.

1409
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,960
It might even be in VOG rotation right now.

1410
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,680
It is absolutely amazing.

1411
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:16,920
Anywho, so as I mentioned, I was back into reading, or well, I started reading, but then

1412
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:21,960
I got lazy, and actually I like listening to the audiobook version better, but Armada.

1413
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:27,520
And of course, Armada is by Ernest Cline, who also wrote Ready Player One, which as

1414
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:33,680
you may know is getting adapted into a feature length movie by Steven Spielberg.

1415
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:34,680
That is amazing.

1416
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:38,440
And no, it's even more amazing, we have a release date for it.

1417
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:44,320
That's right, Steven Spielberg's adaption of Ready Player One should be out December

1418
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,160
17th, 2017.

1419
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:50,960
It's two years away, but I can't wait.

1420
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,160
It's gonna be awesome.

1421
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:57,440
That's a little bit of a wait, but considering they haven't even casted one yet.

1422
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,440
I don't care.

1423
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:00,520
I will be waiting and hyped.

1424
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:03,200
Go get in line right now, like those Star Wars people.

1425
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:04,200
They're crazy.

1426
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,880
It's gonna be amazing.

1427
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:13,460
Along with that though, Uncharted, and there's a brand new Resident Evil movie.

1428
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,500
Those also have release dates.

1429
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:21,020
So Uncharted's supposed to be scheduled to come out June 30th, 2017.

1430
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:28,200
Also the new Resident Evil movie, slated, called Resident Evil The Final Chapter.

1431
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,420
The search for even more money.

1432
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:31,420
Scheduled to be coming out January.

1433
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,380
Is it really gonna be the final chapter?

1434
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,100
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see.

1435
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,580
Is Mila Jovovich finally done with this shit?

1436
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:39,100
It's the final chapter until they reboot that shit.

1437
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:47,020
And then so, that's gonna be coming to theaters January 27th, and then non-gaming related.

1438
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:50,500
Bad Boys 3, February 17th, 2017.

1439
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:55,980
Ghostbusters, they rebooted that July 7th, 2016.

1440
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:57,540
Which apparently Bill Murray is in now.

1441
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,220
I just heard that today.

1442
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:00,220
Cool.

1443
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:02,020
Is he gonna be a ghost in that one?

1444
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:04,140
It's a cameo, so maybe.

1445
01:27:04,140 --> 01:27:06,980
Jumanji, they're rebooting that.

1446
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:16,540
That's Christmas 2016, Magnificent Seven September 23rd, 2016, and Underworld 5, yet

1447
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:21,040
another series of movies that really should end.

1448
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:24,300
That's gonna be October 21st, 2016.

1449
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,300
Alright.

1450
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:31,220
Embryon in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, Resident Evil, the really honestly final

1451
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:33,260
chapter, we swear for reals.

1452
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:35,380
I am seriously, I caught a movie.

1453
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:36,860
Like Five Nights at Freddy's?

1454
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:41,740
Didn't the final chapter suddenly disappear from all the Five Nights at Freddy's 4 stuff?

1455
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:45,260
I bet the reason why we got Five Nights at Freddy's 4 early is because he took his final

1456
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,860
game and split it into two.

1457
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:50,220
I bet he took some of his ideas and split them.

1458
01:27:50,220 --> 01:27:51,220
Just saying.

1459
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:52,220
Just saying.

1460
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:53,220
Five Nights at Freddy's 5.

1461
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:56,740
I know, you would think there's gotta be a fifth Five Nights at Freddy's game.

1462
01:27:56,740 --> 01:27:57,740
Then you end it.

1463
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:58,740
The fifth night.

1464
01:27:58,740 --> 01:27:59,740
There you go.

1465
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:00,740
At Freddy's.

1466
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:01,740
There you go.

1467
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:02,740
Anyway.

1468
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:07,300
Yeah I caught like one of the Resident Evil movies in the middle and like, I think that

1469
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:10,100
series stopped being Resident Evil quite a long time ago.

1470
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:13,500
Like I was like, this is like the fucking Matrix shit.

1471
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:14,740
And I'm okay with that.

1472
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:20,700
Cause I'm not like a huge fan of Resident Evil but I'm pretty sure from what I know

1473
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:23,480
of Resident Evil, that was not Resident Evil.

1474
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:26,340
That was some crazy Matrix bullshit that I watched but.

1475
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:27,340
Those movies are gross.

1476
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:28,700
I'm okay with that.

1477
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:29,900
I don't need all that gore.

1478
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:30,900
I'm not into that stuff.

1479
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:31,900
No it wasn't very gory.

1480
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:34,060
It was just ridiculous.

1481
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:36,380
Like why are there all these clones of you?

1482
01:28:36,380 --> 01:28:40,060
And why are they jumping off of a building and skydiving in slow mo?

1483
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:42,460
I don't understand what the fuck is going on here.

1484
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:44,180
Wesker is cool.

1485
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:45,940
But I didn't understand what the hell was going on.

1486
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:46,940
Alright moving on.

1487
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:50,580
And of course Ally Larter is in that.

1488
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:51,580
Yeah.

1489
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,180
I'm sick of her after Heroes.

1490
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:55,180
Anyway sorry.

1491
01:28:55,180 --> 01:28:56,260
This is pretty exciting though.

1492
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:59,660
They're gonna be doing an Attack on Titan game for the Playstation 4.

1493
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:06,460
It's gonna be developed by Omega Force behind the Dynasty Warriors series.

1494
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:14,900
That's supposed to be coming out sometime, I don't know, 2016 sometime?

1495
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:15,900
Something like that.

1496
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,020
I'll play that.

1497
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:27,540
And then along with that there's gonna be a VR game based on John Wick.

1498
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:36,140
So this is gonna be done by, I guess, the studio behind the Darkness, Payday 2, and

1499
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:38,820
the Chronicles of Riddick, Escape from Butcher Bay.

1500
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:42,380
So Starbreeze, I mean Payday 2 is fucking amazing.

1501
01:29:42,380 --> 01:29:46,580
So I think that'll be awesome.

1502
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:53,500
It's apparently, they're saying right now that they have like a promo experience version

1503
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:57,340
of the game that's on the HTC Vive world tour.

1504
01:29:57,340 --> 01:30:03,500
So if you happen to come across that, you can check out a demo that's gonna be on the

1505
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:06,620
HTC Vive through SteamVR.

1506
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:07,940
Alright.

1507
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:13,100
Well, traveling around for some other rapid fire news, out of Gamescom this week, I know

1508
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:17,940
a lot of you are looking forward to Street Fighter 5, and Vega was confirmed.

1509
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:20,260
That's our Vega, or Claw.

1510
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:22,900
He was confirmed for the game.

1511
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:27,220
And not everybody a fan of what's hiding under the mask though.

1512
01:30:27,220 --> 01:30:29,260
Vega and Ken could possibly be brothers.

1513
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,180
Maybe that'll be a plot twist, I don't know.

1514
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:32,660
Re-imagine Ken.

1515
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:33,660
But I don't know.

1516
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:34,660
You know what?

1517
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:35,740
I'm still hyped about Street Fighter 5.

1518
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:36,740
I don't care.

1519
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:37,740
I'll still play it.

1520
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:38,900
So will you.

1521
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,660
Who cares if they look a little weird?

1522
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:45,040
They're gonna have reskins anyway available for, you know, $1.99 in the store.

1523
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,040
Let's be real.

1524
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,040
So there you go.

1525
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:49,660
Vega happening for Street Fighter 5.

1526
01:30:49,660 --> 01:30:54,220
Final Fantasy XV also got a new trailer out of Gamescom.

1527
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:56,860
I gotta admit, didn't care for it.

1528
01:30:56,860 --> 01:31:01,860
And I'm hyped about Final Fantasy XV, but considering how much they hyped up that trailer,

1529
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:06,300
I wasn't, like, then it came out, you know, I was like, that's really pretty.

1530
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:07,860
That's very artistic.

1531
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:09,260
But it tells me nothing about the game.

1532
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:11,420
It's just like, oh, pretty pictures.

1533
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:14,800
Which, to be fair, I guess is a lot of Final Fantasy, but I wasn't, I don't know, I guess

1534
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:15,800
I was just expecting a little more.

1535
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,580
I still haven't gone back to play that, like, updated demo that they have.

1536
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:19,580
Episode Disque, yeah?

1537
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:20,580
Yeah.

1538
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:21,580
No, you should.

1539
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:22,580
I haven't.

1540
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:23,580
No.

1541
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:24,580
You know what else I haven't gone back to?

1542
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:26,740
That's what I kind of thought we would see out of Gamescom is other scenes from the game

1543
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,060
besides what we saw in Disque.

1544
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:29,060
Yeah.

1545
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,060
I thought that's what we'd get.

1546
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,060
Yeah, I kind of regret buying that.

1547
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,060
Maybe Tokyo Game Show.

1548
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:34,340
Kind of regret buying the other Final Fantasy game for that demo.

1549
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:36,340
You didn't like it?

1550
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:40,460
That's what you get.

1551
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:41,460
They knew a lot of people.

1552
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:42,460
It was okay.

1553
01:31:42,460 --> 01:31:43,980
They knew a lot of people would buy the game just for that demo.

1554
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:51,620
I thought it looked good, like, the trailer looked good for that game, but not so much.

1555
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:57,180
Well, anyhow, you know, it's only, like, a couple minutes, and it is pretty, so you might

1556
01:31:57,180 --> 01:32:00,900
as well go watch the damn trailer, so it's out there if you haven't seen it yet.

1557
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:06,820
Now, by the way, also, regarding Final Fantasy XV, there was a little update that was going

1558
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:07,820
on.

1559
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:11,500
Apparently, they actually showed off the Marlboro enemy and what it looks like now, and then

1560
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:15,060
they were talking a little bit about the big villain in the game, and they're actually

1561
01:32:15,060 --> 01:32:20,900
talking about that the villain in Final Fantasy XV is going to top all of the previous Final

1562
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:23,900
Fantasy villains.

1563
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:27,220
They also said that there is the girl with the black hair that you see in some of the

1564
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:28,220
previews.

1565
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:33,160
The girl with the black hair is mysterious, but integral to the story.

1566
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:38,820
They're also saying a playable city demo will be released soon, but no idea when that will

1567
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:39,820
launch.

1568
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:40,820
Probably just like the game.

1569
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:43,200
They have no idea when that is actually going to launch.

1570
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:48,140
Speaking of Final Fantasy series in a game I was very hyped about, you might have heard

1571
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:54,380
throughout the past week that Arnie Roth, who is the Distant Worlds Final Fantasy composer,

1572
01:32:54,380 --> 01:32:59,460
he kind of slipped up at a concert and talked about a Final Fantasy XII Remake, to which

1573
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:04,300
I said, yes, I was so excited for Final Fantasy XII Remake.

1574
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:09,140
Like, look, I get not everybody was into the story, but Final Fantasy XII probably had

1575
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:13,780
the best battle system out of any of the Final Fantasy games, and it brought us Balthier

1576
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:14,780
and Fran to the world.

1577
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:18,940
So we have things to be thankful for, and you know you want some Balthier and Fran in

1578
01:33:18,940 --> 01:33:19,940
HD.

1579
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:20,940
Let's be real.

1580
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:25,660
You will put up with the van scene, you will put up with that shit so you can see Balthier

1581
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:31,220
and Fran in HD, especially if they're still keeping the same voice act, anyway.

1582
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:38,260
But, well, Arnie Roth put out a statement and retracted the word remake, saying it was

1583
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:40,700
used in error.

1584
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:45,180
Following conversations with composer Hitoshi Sakamoto regarding new concert arrangements

1585
01:33:45,180 --> 01:33:50,420
of music from Final Fantasy XII, regrettably, the term remake was used in error during one

1586
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:53,900
of the announcements that took place from the stage during the concert.

1587
01:33:53,900 --> 01:33:57,260
Maybe they meant they remade the song or remade the arrangement.

1588
01:33:57,260 --> 01:33:58,260
I don't know.

1589
01:33:58,260 --> 01:34:01,380
Maybe they're gonna HDify the game.

1590
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:05,980
Hopefully they're just covering their ass for a Tokyo game show reveal.

1591
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:10,460
That is my hope, but, uh, I guess I won't hold my breath, but I just, I really want

1592
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,620
a Final Fantasy XII HD.

1593
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:14,500
Why won't you give it to me square?

1594
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,620
Why won't you?

1595
01:34:16,620 --> 01:34:19,220
Dark Sakura, save me.

1596
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,940
There's no saving you from fandom, Rob.

1597
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:24,540
No saving.

1598
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:30,580
Real quick from chat, sorry, live.vognetwork.com, Embreon in chat says, the world deserves Bosh's

1599
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:32,980
chest and Fran's butt in HD.

1600
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:35,860
Eye candy for everyone.

1601
01:34:35,860 --> 01:34:42,940
So, um, we've been talking off and on about Guitar Hero Live and what, uh, we had some

1602
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:46,140
thought for it, but they actually have confirmed there's going to be singing in it.

1603
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:51,980
So you get to belt out, you know, the, the greatest hits involved in it.

1604
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:56,940
Hopefully in key, they should put in like a auto-tune for stuff.

1605
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:59,940
Or we get Loki to sing it in the key of funny.

1606
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:07,140
So moving on, um, Lego, uh, Marvel Avengers have been delayed to 2016.

1607
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:08,140
Boo!

1608
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:10,140
Big, fat, boo.

1609
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:11,940
And I know why they're doing it too.

1610
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:14,340
It's for that fucking Lego Dimensions bullshit.

1611
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:18,540
Yeah, let's sell us our $30 fucking expansion packs for that game.

1612
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:20,540
Jamie, I think you pushed a button.

1613
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:22,540
No, no, we'll push a button.

1614
01:35:22,540 --> 01:35:24,540
I didn't do shit.

1615
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:29,540
No, I read the article too.

1616
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,140
They even bring up Lego Dimensions, so.

1617
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:34,140
Yeah, it's fucking $100 for the base.

1618
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:35,140
It's Lego.

1619
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:36,140
Okay.

1620
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:37,140
It's Lego.

1621
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:38,140
It's the Lego premium.

1622
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:42,940
You know, $100 for the fucking base set and $30 for fucking expansions.

1623
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:47,740
Dark Sakura again, making back and forth, not safe for work signs with her hand.

1624
01:35:47,740 --> 01:35:48,740
Thank God.

1625
01:35:48,740 --> 01:35:50,740
This is why it's not a video show, people.

1626
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:51,740
Yep.

1627
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:56,740
So speaking of delays, of course, some Mighty No. 9 has been delayed until 2016.

1628
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:58,940
No!

1629
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:01,940
Sorry, I just felt after what Lowkey did.

1630
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:05,940
Comcept posted about this, saying, and I'm just going to read the quote.

1631
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:08,940
We can acknowledge that the game will no longer meet its current release.

1632
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:12,940
Bad use of an apostrophe, geez.

1633
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:19,940
Will no longer meet its current release date and will now, in fact, appear in Q1 2016.

1634
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:23,940
We will announce a firm release date and further details once we have it later.

1635
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:29,140
Basically, they say it's for bugs and quality assurance.

1636
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:35,140
I think it might have a little bit more to do with Red Ash failing.

1637
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:36,140
A little bit to do with it.

1638
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:42,140
By the way, Red Ash has a investor now, so it's going to have its releases after all.

1639
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:45,140
I don't know if it has anything to do with Red Ash.

1640
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:48,140
I just think they, you know, video games are hard, people.

1641
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:50,140
They're not easy things to make.

1642
01:36:50,140 --> 01:36:53,140
And I think sometimes people are too aggressive with how long it's really going to take to make them.

1643
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:56,340
They heard that 2016 was going to be the year that everyone was going to be releasing their game,

1644
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:58,340
so they're like, hey, you know what, let's do it too.

1645
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:03,340
We want to be in with that action, so let's do that.

1646
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:07,340
Maybe it's punishment for Red Ash not meeting its Kickstarter.

1647
01:37:07,340 --> 01:37:08,340
It's because they really...

1648
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:09,340
We'll get them.

1649
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:15,340
It's because, just like LEGO Marvel Avengers, they really wanted to highlight another game

1650
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:18,340
that was coming out, and that being the Mega Man collection.

1651
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:22,340
They didn't want to steal any thunder away from them, so that's why it's coming out later on.

1652
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,540
And they're going to bug fix the hell out of it.

1653
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:29,540
All I'm saying, every little thing that goes wrong with this Kickstarter

1654
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:32,540
is going to affect future Kickstarters, just saying.

1655
01:37:32,540 --> 01:37:34,540
Bloodstained better do it right.

1656
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:36,540
Whatever, what Kickstarter has come out on time?

1657
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:38,540
Like, hardly any, so...

1658
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:42,540
I got my Exploding Kittens in the timeframe they said it would come out.

1659
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:44,540
I mean, granted, that's a card game, but...

1660
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:46,540
And it's sitting there in a box, unopened,

1661
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:49,540
and everything I hear is about how the box is amazing,

1662
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:51,740
but I'm not going to open it until I have people over.

1663
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:52,740
We have a party.

1664
01:37:52,740 --> 01:37:54,740
Play some Exploding Kittens.

1665
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,740
Open it.

1666
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:57,740
No, I'm not going to open it now, because...

1667
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:58,740
The box is amazing.

1668
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:00,740
Don't you want to see how amazing it is?

1669
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,740
Maybe we'll do a YouTube thing or something,

1670
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:05,740
because apparently I have to have Sanrio in the room when I do it.

1671
01:38:05,740 --> 01:38:07,740
So...

1672
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:08,740
Alright, anyhow...

1673
01:38:08,740 --> 01:38:14,740
It doesn't shoot out like some sort of compressed catnip or something.

1674
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:17,740
It's just a catnip bomb goes off in the room.

1675
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:20,940
It's like someone dropped a flashbang, but catnip bang.

1676
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:22,940
DungeonBuster in chat says,

1677
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:25,940
The new Hong Kong sequel is on target for this month, actually,

1678
01:38:25,940 --> 01:38:27,940
even with the expanded content due to the Kickstarter.

1679
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:31,940
DungeonBuster saying Shadowrun Returns was a month or so off target,

1680
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:33,940
but it came out relatively close.

1681
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:35,940
Once again, another game that I backed by Kickstarter

1682
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:38,940
and have the content and haven't played it.

1683
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:41,940
And I was super hyped about that, and I really need to go back and play it,

1684
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:42,940
but, you know...

1685
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:44,940
That and Shadowrun Online, yeah,

1686
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:46,940
I'm going to dedicate myself to an MMO.

1687
01:38:47,140 --> 01:38:48,140
Have that as well.

1688
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,140
I think.

1689
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,140
Do I have it?

1690
01:38:50,140 --> 01:38:53,140
This is a comment on a story that Jamie read a little earlier,

1691
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:54,140
but it's good, so I'm going to read it.

1692
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:57,140
Andy Scout in our chatroom over at live.voguenetwork.com says,

1693
01:38:57,140 --> 01:39:00,140
Guitar Hero Live is going back to basics.

1694
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:02,140
Now we added singing.

1695
01:39:02,140 --> 01:39:04,140
How long until drums?

1696
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:06,140
That's a good point, though.

1697
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:07,140
They said they're going back to basics,

1698
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,140
then all of a sudden here comes the whole band.

1699
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:12,140
I'm hoping it's just because singing is easy,

1700
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:14,140
and maybe can be done through the iPhone,

1701
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:15,140
like SingStar is now.

1702
01:39:15,140 --> 01:39:16,140
You don't even need a microphone.

1703
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:19,340
Like, by the way, if you weren't aware about that with SingStar,

1704
01:39:19,340 --> 01:39:22,340
all you need is the mobile phone and the PlayStation 4,

1705
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:23,340
and it's magic.

1706
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:24,340
The whole Bluetooth magic.

1707
01:39:24,340 --> 01:39:26,340
You don't even need a mic now.

1708
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:27,340
Sing into your phone.

1709
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:28,340
Like, I was almost...

1710
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:33,340
Because my one son's super into Let It Go from the Frozen movie.

1711
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:35,340
What child isn't into that song?

1712
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:36,340
I don't understand it.

1713
01:39:36,340 --> 01:39:41,340
I mean, I think it's the daycare they play it.

1714
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:43,340
Like, he is obsessed with that fucking video.

1715
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:45,340
We played that for about an hour today.

1716
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,540
But I was almost like...

1717
01:39:46,540 --> 01:39:47,540
Because they like dancing, too.

1718
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:48,540
So I was like, okay, well, maybe...

1719
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:50,540
Let's see if this is in Just Dance.

1720
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:51,540
It's got to be in Just Dance.

1721
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:52,540
And sure enough, it is.

1722
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:56,540
But now they have in Just Dance was the Angry Birds theme,

1723
01:39:56,540 --> 01:40:00,540
and there's people dressed up like angry birds,

1724
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:02,540
and it's kind of creepy.

1725
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:07,540
Seeing the angry birds with people feet and arms.

1726
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:11,540
It's like the Reddit forum where they've got...

1727
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:14,540
Or the subreddit where birds with human arms or whatever it is.

1728
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:18,540
Yeah, some of those Just Dance videos are very, very creepy.

1729
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:21,540
But, you know, they got some really awesome songs in that game, too,

1730
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:22,540
so I can't complain.

1731
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:26,540
Anyhow, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

1732
01:40:26,540 --> 01:40:30,540
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

1733
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:33,540
You put Facebook and Google together, you get FUGL.

1734
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:43,540
And yes, Google Plus is still a thing, as far as I know.

1735
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:46,540
It's still running, so until it isn't running...

1736
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:49,540
If people stop answering all together on Google Plus,

1737
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,540
then I'll stop asking it there.

1738
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,540
But we're still getting one or two answers a week.

1739
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:55,540
That's something.

1740
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:57,540
That's more phone calls than we got last week.

1741
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:02,540
So might as well run the Google Plus page as well as the Facebook.

1742
01:41:02,540 --> 01:41:04,540
So we're an equal opportunity here at OLR.

1743
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:07,540
Actually, we got four answers on Google Plus this week.

1744
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:09,540
So here's the question this week.

1745
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:12,540
It is about the news about the DVR service.

1746
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:16,540
We want to ask you guys about something not directly related to games.

1747
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:20,540
Microsoft announced that they will roll out a subscription-free DVR service for the Xbox One.

1748
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:23,540
This will allow you to record TV over the air, not cable.

1749
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:26,540
They can be played back on any Windows 10 device,

1750
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,540
meaning the Xbox One or your PC.

1751
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:30,540
Are you interested in a feature like that?

1752
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:34,540
Or do you think Microsoft needs to keep the message about the games?

1753
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:37,540
Let's start on Google Plus tonight, since four is a lot on Google Plus.

1754
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:39,540
We'll start with Redertainment, who says,

1755
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:42,540
As I'm considering my options as far as TV is concerned,

1756
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:48,540
what keeps me going back to satellite is being able to watch WWE, ESPN, and local channels via a DVR.

1757
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:53,540
If I can get the local channels on my Xbox One and can get ESPN on Sling TV,

1758
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:58,540
the only thing keeping me on satellite is being able to watch full complete episodes of WWE Raw,

1759
01:41:58,540 --> 01:42:02,540
which isn't currently possible via any legal online platform.

1760
01:42:02,540 --> 01:42:06,540
So yes, DVR on Xbox One is very appealing to me.

1761
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:08,540
Josh Wye replied and said,

1762
01:42:08,540 --> 01:42:11,540
No, I think that Microsoft has muddled the message already.

1763
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:14,540
You either walk on the side of the street or the other.

1764
01:42:14,540 --> 01:42:17,540
If you try to walk in the middle, you get run over.

1765
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:20,540
Also where I live, Sony tried DVR with their PlayStation TV.

1766
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:22,540
That didn't go anywhere.

1767
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:24,540
Anyway, I thought the future is streaming.

1768
01:42:24,540 --> 01:42:26,540
Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they shouldn't do this,

1769
01:42:26,540 --> 01:42:28,540
it's just that they shouldn't lead with it.

1770
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:33,540
You know, interesting in that comment, the part about the smartphone,

1771
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:36,540
it's interesting in that comment, the part about the streaming,

1772
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:39,540
because I think he does make a very good point there,

1773
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:44,540
is that it's interesting that NBC and CBS and Fox and all of them

1774
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:48,540
haven't really answered with full on streaming.

1775
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:50,540
I guess in a way they have, because somebody is going to jump in and say,

1776
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:53,540
Hulu, Hulu is an NBC thing and Fox partnership.

1777
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:56,540
So I guess in some way they have and CBS has their own thing.

1778
01:42:56,540 --> 01:42:59,540
But again, then you all know how we feel about the fragmented

1779
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:01,540
when you got one guy over here, one guy over here,

1780
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:03,540
like you don't want to pay ten bucks each for all that stuff.

1781
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:07,540
So I think it is interesting that the whole part about streaming,

1782
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:11,540
where maybe some of these shows just need to be more accessible in streaming.

1783
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:14,540
And some of these companies need to wake up to the reality that,

1784
01:43:14,540 --> 01:43:16,540
you know, the game has changed and over the air TV

1785
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:18,540
isn't how everybody is watching their TV anymore.

1786
01:43:18,540 --> 01:43:22,540
Anyway, ActDeft says on Google+, it's free.

1787
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:25,540
Unless it's utter crap and useless, I don't mind.

1788
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:28,540
Extra Futures do sell a console for lots of people.

1789
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:32,540
Brozame replies and says, for me a console is about games,

1790
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:35,540
so adding in features that don't add value for everyone buying an Xbox One

1791
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:37,540
seems like a huge waste to me.

1792
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:40,540
I'd much rather see games that make me want to buy the console,

1793
01:43:40,540 --> 01:43:42,540
instead of just waiting for the PC version,

1794
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:44,540
since there's maybe two games I'm missing out on

1795
01:43:44,540 --> 01:43:47,540
between both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1796
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:51,540
Over on Facebook, we had Fabrice A who said,

1797
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:53,540
this would be very interesting for cable,

1798
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:56,540
but no use to me since I only get four channels over the air.

1799
01:43:56,540 --> 01:44:01,540
Tigerclaw says, it's great that Microsoft is offering a free DVR service,

1800
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:03,540
but the fact it's only over the air isn't good enough.

1801
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:05,540
Not many people can get a good quality signal

1802
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:07,540
for over the air channels on their TV.

1803
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:10,540
If they just allowed the functionality to control your cable box,

1804
01:44:10,540 --> 01:44:11,540
it would make the service better.

1805
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:14,540
Andy R said, I don't even have cable, so not really.

1806
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:17,540
In the days of Hulu and such, DVR seems less and less relevant.

1807
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:21,540
The few cable shows I do watch, like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Agent Carter,

1808
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:24,540
are up on the studio's website the night of airing for cable subscribers

1809
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:26,540
and a week later for non-subscribers.

1810
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:29,540
Why bother setting up something to record if they're going to do it for you?

1811
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:31,540
I'd rather focus on games.

1812
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:33,540
I already have a PlayStation 4, Wii U, and both handhelds,

1813
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:35,540
and not enough time to play everything on those.

1814
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:37,540
If they want me to buy an Xbox One,

1815
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:41,540
I need games I want to play that I can't already get elsewhere.

1816
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:42,540
Well, to be fair to Microsoft,

1817
01:44:42,540 --> 01:44:45,540
I do feel like a big part of their campaign this year has been,

1818
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:50,540
you know, these are the games you're going to play on Microsoft only this fall.

1819
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:53,540
They're running the Rise of the Tomb Raider and the Halo 5

1820
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:57,540
and the Rare Replay and all the stuff that's on their console.

1821
01:44:57,540 --> 01:45:01,540
Silent Tom says, I think that it will be forgotten and underused,

1822
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,540
just like Nintendo's TV.

1823
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:07,540
They just need to focus on games and not weird bells and whistles.

1824
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:10,540
Rageinator says, I'd use a free DVR service.

1825
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:12,540
Okay, so it's not games related. So what?

1826
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:18,540
We all may be gamers, but we all don't live, breathe, and shit games 24-7-365.

1827
01:45:18,540 --> 01:45:22,540
Well, I don't know about you, Rageinator, but we have other interests, too,

1828
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:27,540
and it would be nice to consolidate devices that enable us to enjoy our non-gaming interests.

1829
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:29,540
Alan H. replied and said,

1830
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:34,540
Consoles have been a household multimedia appliance since the 360 and Netflix integration,

1831
01:45:34,540 --> 01:45:39,540
arguably easier for those who watch DVDs via their PlayStation 2.

1832
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:41,540
I understand why Microsoft, a giant in their own right,

1833
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:46,540
would absolutely not want to go near negotiations with Comcast or Time Warner Cable,

1834
01:45:46,540 --> 01:45:49,540
two companies with reputations for not playing fair.

1835
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:52,540
They have little reason to view Microsoft as a competitor,

1836
01:45:52,540 --> 01:45:54,540
and Microsoft is too smart to start giving them one.

1837
01:45:54,540 --> 01:46:00,540
That said, obviously, that limitation is going to make it useless to the vast majority of consumers.

1838
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:02,540
And lastly, sj100matt says,

1839
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:08,540
I may be in the minority, but I love these TV, TV sports, TV features that consoles roll out.

1840
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:13,540
I think it broadens and enhances the experiences that you can have with a console, but I digress.

1841
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:18,540
I think the hot item about this DVR feature is that you should be able to stream your saved shows on your Windows 10 tablets.

1842
01:46:18,540 --> 01:46:20,540
People will eat that up.

1843
01:46:20,540 --> 01:46:24,540
Yeah, I got to admit, part of it that does seem really interesting to me

1844
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:29,540
is the fact that it's not just the fact that it DVRs to the same TV that your Xbox is on anyway,

1845
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:34,540
but you could then, with the streaming, you could then watch that same show on your computer

1846
01:46:34,540 --> 01:46:37,540
or watch it on your Windows tablet or whatever.

1847
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:39,540
That part is kind of interesting to me.

1848
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:44,540
So that is definitely an enhanced feature there, so I'm keeping that in mind.

1849
01:46:44,540 --> 01:46:46,540
Anyway, some really great answers tonight, you guys.

1850
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:47,540
Thanks for participating.

1851
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:53,540
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

1852
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:55,540
Be our friend on social networking.

1853
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:57,540
Darn it, be our friend.

1854
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:59,540
Let's get back into some other news. Loki.

1855
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:06,540
Alright, I was just checking out my friend who used to work at a, well, he still runs a game store

1856
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:10,540
and he's an actor and stuff, and he's going to be in some Disney film.

1857
01:47:10,540 --> 01:47:11,540
Good for him.

1858
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:12,540
Oh yeah, you were talking about that.

1859
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:15,540
He also got sued by Pepsi, so he lives a strange life.

1860
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:17,540
Alright.

1861
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:20,540
Anyways, so this is kind of cool.

1862
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:28,540
Cities Skylines, you know, kind of the SimCity, but not SimCity, at least not shitty as the last SimCity game was.

1863
01:47:28,540 --> 01:47:34,540
It'll be coming to consoles, and of course, it'll be coming to the Xbox One first.

1864
01:47:34,540 --> 01:47:42,540
That is scheduled to be coming out, I'm not sure, doesn't really mention yet when, but soon.

1865
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:50,540
And then of course, you know, hopefully other consoles after the Xbox One at a later date.

1866
01:47:50,540 --> 01:48:01,540
Also, Crackdown 3, the game that was going to get me to buy an Xbox One, not coming out until 2016.

1867
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:05,540
But they did show off some development footage.

1868
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:13,540
Now, one of the things that they were touting about the series was that it was going to be using that Microsoft cloud server stuff

1869
01:48:13,540 --> 01:48:18,540
to allow for this really crazy destruction in the game.

1870
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:25,540
However, that destruction is only going to be available in multiplayer, but it's 100% destruction,

1871
01:48:25,540 --> 01:48:31,540
so you can blow up any building that you see in the game, and it will dynamically be destroyed.

1872
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:34,540
And that is amazing, so I'll have to check that out.

1873
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:39,540
But yeah, unfortunately, Crackdown 3, not coming out until summer 2016.

1874
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:42,540
So, got a year away.

1875
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:44,540
Alright.

1876
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:47,540
I'm excited to try that new Crackdown game, too.

1877
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:51,540
I wasn't as huge on the series as you were, but you know I gotta go collect orbs.

1878
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:52,540
You do.

1879
01:48:52,540 --> 01:48:54,540
That's what everybody was into, right?

1880
01:48:54,540 --> 01:48:56,540
Hey, I'm excited about this.

1881
01:48:56,540 --> 01:49:00,540
You know, with the whole talk we've had tonight about retro being new again and all this,

1882
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:06,540
I think this is a retro series that is really long overdue for reimagining.

1883
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:12,540
And I realize it already had one, but anyway, the series I'm talking about is A Boy and His Blob.

1884
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:14,540
Remember that game on the NES? I love that game.

1885
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:15,540
Yes.

1886
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:16,540
It's a great little puzzle game.

1887
01:49:16,540 --> 01:49:19,540
You feed the jelly beans and it turns the blob into these different things.

1888
01:49:19,540 --> 01:49:21,540
Very cool little NES game.

1889
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:25,540
And I know they had the 3DS, it was like 3DS or a Wii?

1890
01:49:25,540 --> 01:49:26,540
It was both, yeah.

1891
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:27,540
Yeah, it was on both.

1892
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:29,540
Did it ever actually come out?

1893
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:30,540
No, it did.

1894
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:33,540
Okay, because I remember playing it at E3 and then it seemed like it disappeared.

1895
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:40,540
But anyway, apparently Majesco Entertainment has appointed a new CEO,

1896
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:44,540
and they're actually going to be focusing on digital games, not just the retail games.

1897
01:49:44,540 --> 01:49:47,540
The company Majesco is working on Glue,

1898
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:52,540
and it's also working on a new entry for the Boy and His Blob series.

1899
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:56,540
Sometime in the next two fiscal quarters is when we'll see this game,

1900
01:49:56,540 --> 01:50:01,540
and it's going to be across all next generation consoles, and in some cases, PC.

1901
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:06,540
So who knows, The Boy and His Blob will be very logical to show up on the PC as well.

1902
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:11,540
David Rector, by the way, now taking over as Majesco's new CEO and Chairman of the Board.

1903
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:14,540
So yeah, very cool that's been worked on.

1904
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:20,540
I hope it's not treated like shovelware, because I could really see where this just gets thrown into a kid's game.

1905
01:50:20,540 --> 01:50:25,540
But yeah, that was a game I remember really loving in the NES days.

1906
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:28,540
So we'll be looking forward to that reboot.

1907
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:30,540
Meanwhile, Dark Sakura.

1908
01:50:30,540 --> 01:50:32,540
Stuff. The end.

1909
01:50:32,540 --> 01:50:34,540
No, really.

1910
01:50:34,540 --> 01:50:36,540
That's going to do it for tonight, Solr.

1911
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:41,540
If you want an alternative to Mighty No. 9 and you're tired of waiting,

1912
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:47,540
there is a game that's actually under Steam Early Access right now called 20XX.

1913
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:50,540
And it looks like it's pretty good.

1914
01:50:50,540 --> 01:50:53,540
It's $12 right now through Steam Early Access.

1915
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:55,540
It keeps getting updated.

1916
01:50:55,540 --> 01:51:00,540
It's in beta right now, but it's got really, really good ratings.

1917
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:08,540
And it actually originally was named as Echoes of Eridu, but got renamed to 20XX.

1918
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:13,540
Raised over $20,000 from backers on Kickstarter, so hey.

1919
01:51:17,540 --> 01:51:21,540
And I thought Mighty No. 9 ripped off Mega Man. Holy crap.

1920
01:51:21,540 --> 01:51:25,540
What's funny isn't the 20XX, isn't that the opening of Mega Man 2?

1921
01:51:25,540 --> 01:51:26,540
Yeah, that's the Mega Man thing.

1922
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:29,540
Where it goes in the year 20XX.

1923
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:34,540
So it's like, not even is the game biting a little bit of Mega Man there,

1924
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:38,540
but the name is, at least I kind of see it as a Mega Man reference.

1925
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:41,540
A very subtle one, but it's there.

1926
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:43,540
In the art world, it's called a quote.

1927
01:51:43,540 --> 01:51:45,540
A quote.

1928
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:52,540
Meaning if you see remnants of another painter's style from an earlier era, it's called a quote.

1929
01:51:52,540 --> 01:51:54,540
So this is a quote.

1930
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:58,540
So when I make a happy little cloud in Mario Paint, I'm quoting Bob Ross.

1931
01:51:58,540 --> 01:51:59,540
You sure are.

1932
01:51:59,540 --> 01:52:00,540
Hey, there you go.

1933
01:52:00,540 --> 01:52:03,540
It sounds like a roguelike Mega Man game.

1934
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:08,540
Alan Alchemy in chat says, that reminds me of Homestar Runner when it made fun of Mega Man.

1935
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:11,540
In the year XDXD6.

1936
01:52:11,540 --> 01:52:13,540
20XD6.

1937
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:15,540
Yeah.

1938
01:52:15,540 --> 01:52:17,540
Hey, Stickley Man, what are you doing?

1939
01:52:17,540 --> 01:52:21,540
Wasn't there a new Homestar Runner this week that was talking about how Flash is dead?

1940
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:24,540
Like, and then there was a part of me that was like, wow, they're still making Homestar Runner?

1941
01:52:24,540 --> 01:52:25,540
That's awesome.

1942
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:28,540
Like, it came back after like a huge break.

1943
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:31,540
Alright, anyhow, Loki.

1944
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:40,540
Alright, so Bethesda has released some more information about Fallout 4, including a little bit of endgame stuff for Fallout.

1945
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:46,540
With that, there is going to be no end to the game after the main story is done.

1946
01:52:46,540 --> 01:52:50,540
You know, I think that's pretty similar to the other games that Bethesda has released.

1947
01:52:50,540 --> 01:52:53,540
And also, no level cap for Fallout 4.

1948
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:56,540
So you can level, level, level, level some more.

1949
01:52:58,540 --> 01:52:59,540
And more.

1950
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:02,540
The level cap is 20XDX.

1951
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:04,540
20XDX.

1952
01:53:05,540 --> 01:53:06,540
Yes.

1953
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:08,540
Are you excited for Fallout 4, Loki?

1954
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:11,540
I am, even though I've not really played a Fallout game.

1955
01:53:11,540 --> 01:53:15,540
And I, you know, I have Fallout 3 and I bought it and it made a big deal of it.

1956
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:18,540
But it's such a pain in the ass to get it to work.

1957
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:20,540
Because of the stupid games for Windows shit.

1958
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:26,540
It just, update your shit so I don't have to do all this work around crap to get your fucking game to work.

1959
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:31,540
Well, this is funny because after E3, I seem to remember.

1960
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:35,540
I don't know if this was a conversation Bobby and I were having or if Bobby said it on his show.

1961
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:37,540
Probably both, honestly.

1962
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:41,540
But we were talking about, or he was saying on his show about how,

1963
01:53:41,540 --> 01:53:46,540
now that Shenmue 3 has showed up on the Sony stage,

1964
01:53:46,540 --> 01:53:50,540
how much longer until Kickstarters on stage at conferences become the norm?

1965
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:53,540
Well, guess what happened at Gamescom?

1966
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:55,540
Microsoft had a Kickstarter on their stage.

1967
01:53:55,540 --> 01:53:58,540
This one was a little different though because it was already funded.

1968
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:03,540
Koji Igarashi got up on the Microsoft stage to talk about Bloodstained.

1969
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:07,540
And so, yeah, they give a little update on Bloodstained.

1970
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:11,540
Talking about a new character in the game, they showed some models and art.

1971
01:54:11,540 --> 01:54:15,540
Didn't really say if this character is playable or not, but he sure looks it, so we'll see.

1972
01:54:15,540 --> 01:54:24,540
Also, Bloodstained is given a release window of March 2017 for PlayStation 4, Vita, Xbox One, Wii U, and PC.

1973
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:32,540
They also mentioned on the stage there that the game will feature cross-play between Windows 10 and Xbox One.

1974
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:35,540
So that is something else a little bit Microsoft-centric there.

1975
01:54:35,540 --> 01:54:37,540
So, pretty cool.

1976
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:39,540
I'm looking forward to Bloodstained.

1977
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:45,540
I hope just because they're saying March 2017 now doesn't mean it actually gets delayed to February 2018.

1978
01:54:45,540 --> 01:54:47,540
But be prepared for anything.

1979
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:49,540
Games always get delayed.

1980
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:53,540
I got reminded when I was talking about Shadowrun and everything.

1981
01:54:53,540 --> 01:54:55,540
Oh yeah, Shadowrun Online. Yeah, I backed that.

1982
01:54:55,540 --> 01:54:58,540
That was supposed to be out in 2013.

1983
01:54:58,540 --> 01:54:59,540
Really?

1984
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:03,540
The last update that I just read because I don't follow it too closely.

1985
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:06,540
The company is filing for bankruptcy.

1986
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:09,540
I don't think I'm going to be playing that game apparently.

1987
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:10,540
Sorry to hear that.

1988
01:55:10,540 --> 01:55:12,540
Thankfully I didn't back it for too much money.

1989
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:13,540
Alright.

1990
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:16,540
Well, every week we like to take a trip to our mailbag.

1991
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:20,540
Participate at Orangelauntrader.com is the place to send us emails.

1992
01:55:26,540 --> 01:55:32,540
Dark Soccer is going to suit up and head on into the mailbag and find some emails worthy of reading on tonight's show.

1993
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:35,540
And after a very slow response past few weeks, we actually got a few tonight.

1994
01:55:35,540 --> 01:55:36,540
Two?

1995
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:37,540
Two.

1996
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:38,540
I'll take them.

1997
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:39,540
Two emails.

1998
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:41,540
So the first one comes from Robert M.

1999
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:44,540
And it's disjointed.

2000
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:46,540
Apparently comes the warning.

2001
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:50,540
Briefly Loki, yes there's at least one unofficial LEGO Loot Crate type service.

2002
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:53,540
Look up Brick Builders Club for one.

2003
01:55:53,540 --> 01:56:01,540
Secondly, I saw some developers Twitter post showing the two dozen or so games Scott Cawthorne did before the Five Nights series.

2004
01:56:01,540 --> 01:56:05,540
I wonder if the games have any easter eggs that call back to his previous games.

2005
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:12,540
Third, I imagine we'll have an Angry Birds the Movie the Game, still not sure about the characters having bodies.

2006
01:56:12,540 --> 01:56:14,540
That is so true though about Angry Birds the Movie the Game.

2007
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:22,540
For the record, when I was in Illustrator class, one of our assignments was to make a CD or, you know, a game cover.

2008
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:25,540
So I did Silent Hill of the Movie the Game.

2009
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:28,540
So I did, anyway.

2010
01:56:28,540 --> 01:56:34,540
I've recommended OLR slash VOG to a few others and gotten recommendations for other indie casts.

2011
01:56:34,540 --> 01:56:41,540
The Slash Films Toboloski Files with poignant stories from the character actor.

2012
01:56:41,540 --> 01:56:51,540
The St. Louis based Geekly Podcast and BCX Beyond Comics Radio with DJ Jacob Riles whose style reminds me a bit of Travis's.

2013
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:55,540
Does he also orbit around the earth when doing his show?

2014
01:56:55,540 --> 01:57:00,540
Because you know Travis broadcasts from the satellite of VOG so we'll have to look into that.

2015
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:02,540
Last email?

2016
01:57:02,540 --> 01:57:03,540
Yes.

2017
01:57:04,540 --> 01:57:07,540
God, this is long. Holy!

2018
01:57:07,540 --> 01:57:08,540
It's from Raw Steel UT.

2019
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:09,540
Yeah, I get that a lot.

2020
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:10,540
Oh, Raw Steel UT.

2021
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:15,540
Balking at the size of the email there.

2022
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:16,540
You're gonna read parts.

2023
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:17,540
Okay.

2024
01:57:17,540 --> 01:57:19,540
Dear Raw Steel UT.

2025
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:21,540
And anybody sending long emails.

2026
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:24,540
Don't send a novel.

2027
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:30,540
I don't want it annotated with footnotes.

2028
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:32,540
I want the cliff notes.

2029
01:57:34,540 --> 01:57:36,540
Or put it up on the forums.

2030
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:42,540
Yes, you can write novels on our forums all you want because nobody's loving those forums.

2031
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:46,540
Although, I will say, Ray Genator posted a Final Fantasy XIV question so I was like, yay, forums.

2032
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:50,540
Hey guys, I just bought Rare Replay in part due to the mostly positive buzz it's been receiving.

2033
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:56,540
And it is here once more that I learned to avoid buying based mostly on positive buzz.

2034
01:57:56,540 --> 01:57:58,540
See, the game does something rather odd.

2035
01:57:58,540 --> 01:58:01,540
It installs the base menus and the menu of the game straight away.

2036
01:58:01,540 --> 01:58:11,540
However, anything that received Xbox Live Arcade or on-disk 360 releases is running rather ghetto on the clearly experimental Xbox 360 emulation software.

2037
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:14,540
This is where the issue begins for me.

2038
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:16,540
See, the games install off the disk just fine.

2039
01:58:16,540 --> 01:58:20,540
Although, they're all their own separate entries in the apps list.

2040
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:23,540
However, this is a big fucking deal.

2041
01:58:23,540 --> 01:58:27,540
Each of them requires a separate update in the hundreds of megs.

2042
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:39,540
And seeing that this is an Xbox One title, those updates not only take longer to download than they would on literally any other piece of hardware, but also fuck up bandwidth on any network the Xbone is on.

2043
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:43,540
I kinda referenced this when I mentioned that I put in the disk and it wanted to do like 5 gigs of updates.

2044
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:47,540
I think he's talking about this just using more colorful language.

2045
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:50,540
Ray Genator, don't you fucking dare.

2046
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:52,540
What was Ray Genator threatening?

2047
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:54,540
A War and Peace sized email.

2048
01:58:54,540 --> 01:58:57,540
Just, ooh, it fell in the trash. Imagine that.

2049
01:58:57,540 --> 01:58:59,540
We accidentally lost your email, Ray Genator.

2050
01:58:59,540 --> 01:59:01,540
This is a long email and I want to get it read.

2051
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:02,540
Alright.

2052
01:59:02,540 --> 01:59:09,540
Not only that, but while 360 titles start fine without the updates, you can't play them because for some weird reason you have to download your profile.

2053
01:59:09,540 --> 01:59:14,540
That's right, there's no option for profile creation or simply using the Xbone profiles.

2054
01:59:14,540 --> 01:59:17,540
I'm just saying Xbone because it's funny.

2055
01:59:17,540 --> 01:59:24,540
Nope, and a separate X360 profile needs to be downloaded in order to play the games, meaning there's no real option to play your games.

2056
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:29,540
Or use the Xbone at all until a few extra gigs of data have been downloaded onto the system.

2057
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:33,540
Can I just quickly say, I did not have that problem, so I actually don't know what he's talking about here.

2058
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:38,540
And I don't know if that's because I was in the emulation thing already, but I don't even remember ever going through that.

2059
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:46,540
So, my question is, where it's downloading all the games and stuff like that, do you get those, like the Xbox 360 ones, do you get those on the Xbox 360?

2060
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:53,540
I don't think so, because these specifically say Rare Replay at the top. So, anyway.

2061
01:59:53,540 --> 02:00:02,540
This, mind you, for games that are almost a decade old at minimum, and for a compilation being re-released in mid-August, that has no real reason to be rushed.

2062
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:09,540
This brings me to the real issue, most likely the massive downloads are for updates to the emulators being written for each and every game.

2063
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:17,540
The fact that I got Banjo-Kazooie to start suggests that the games themselves are on disc, but as the backward compatibility is clearly being cobbled together desperately,

2064
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:26,540
they're probably being worked on for each game, casting further doubt on the future of much ever coming out on Xbone's backwards compatibility initiative,

2065
02:00:26,540 --> 02:00:32,540
simply due to the apparent effort that is being exerted to get each game a decent emulator.

2066
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:40,540
Now, that's entirely possible that the coming OS update for the Xbone will have an emulator. Okay, it's going way into it, okay.

2067
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:49,540
Okay, complaint, complaint, complaint. Okay, I'm really not trying to be...

2068
02:00:50,540 --> 02:00:52,540
It's long your editing, it's fine.

2069
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:54,540
I'm trying not to be rude about it.

2070
02:00:55,540 --> 02:00:57,540
Okay, so I'll just skip down to the last.

2071
02:00:57,540 --> 02:01:03,540
If you're buying the collection for the games that haven't been seen Xbox 360 released before, then you'll likely have a good time.

2072
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:11,540
If you're buying the game for the games that have seen 360 released before, you're better off dusting your 360 off and playing those games there,

2073
02:01:11,540 --> 02:01:18,540
unless, of course, you're among the very elite who can afford and have access to Google Fiber or similar highly expensive internet speeds,

2074
02:01:18,540 --> 02:01:21,540
at least if the emulator issue isn't resolved soon.

2075
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:26,540
And that has been today's warning from the Office of the OLR Minister of Unpopular Opinions. Have a great day.

2076
02:01:26,540 --> 02:01:28,540
Regards, Ross Steel UT.

2077
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:35,540
Actually, I don't know who gave you that title, Ross Steel UT, but it should actually be the OLR Minister of Long and Unpopular Opinions.

2078
02:01:35,540 --> 02:01:37,540
Just, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2079
02:01:37,540 --> 02:01:40,540
Well, you know, he goes into the missing games, which...

2080
02:01:40,540 --> 02:01:48,540
Which we talked about a little bit earlier in the show, and then I did notice the complaint about, like, Conker's Bad Fur Day and Grabbed by the Ghoulies.

2081
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:55,540
I guess they did something a little different there, and to be honest, I haven't really dipped into both those games yet, so I didn't catch the same thing.

2082
02:01:55,540 --> 02:02:03,540
But I guess they did the N64 version of Conker's Bad Fur Day for some reason, but then they did the Xbox version of Grabbed by the fucking Ghoulies.

2083
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:07,540
He says he was not a fan of that, so, interesting.

2084
02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:10,540
Thank you for the paraphrasing for me, because my...

2085
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:16,540
I'm trying, I'm hoping I didn't screw that up, but seeing as I haven't played either of those games yet, I may be fucking up his opinions, I apologize.

2086
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:23,540
And I, sometimes, I mean, actually more often than not, I tend to agree with some of his stuff.

2087
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:32,540
I mean, I haven't played the game, so I can't make a judgement on it, and I'm probably not gonna get it, because, honestly, I think I own all of those games.

2088
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:35,540
On their original consoles.

2089
02:02:35,540 --> 02:02:39,540
Well, a Spectrum, though, but yeah, I mean, you're not gonna go back and collect Spectrum.

2090
02:02:39,540 --> 02:02:41,540
There's other emulators for the Spectrum.

2091
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:48,540
You know what? Sometimes you have to hear unpopular opinions, and I think that's one thing I want this show to bring.

2092
02:02:48,540 --> 02:02:55,540
But it works both ways, too, is that, you know, I want the people, like, and I'm just picking on RustyOuT, because he happens to be the current emailer.

2093
02:02:55,540 --> 02:02:58,540
I want him to be able to hear the other side as well.

2094
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:08,540
So I think as long as we can have a respectful, underlined, italicized, bolded dialogue about, you know, things that we like and we don't like, and, you know, have a...

2095
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:14,540
I think that's a great thing that we can do on this show, is make people think differently. Put ourselves in other people's shoes for a little while.

2096
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:19,540
Even if it doesn't change your opinion, at least respecting that another opinion exists and is just as valid.

2097
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:20,540
Yes.

2098
02:03:20,540 --> 02:03:21,540
And keep in mind...

2099
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:25,540
And sometimes it can strengthen your own opinion to understand why another person thinks the way they do.

2100
02:03:25,540 --> 02:03:28,540
And keep in mind, don't confuse opinion for fact.

2101
02:03:28,540 --> 02:03:31,540
And I actually don't think anything he's saying in this email is actually unpopular.

2102
02:03:32,540 --> 02:03:36,540
I've heard a lot of people complaining about the Xbox 360 load times and some of the other stuff with the game.

2103
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:38,540
And to be honest, I felt the same way, so...

2104
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:41,540
Yeah, we're probably not getting it. Like I said, we've got most of the games. There's no point.

2105
02:03:41,540 --> 02:03:42,540
Yep.

2106
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:50,540
Okay, well, regardless, it is time, after the email bag, to get into our FUs of the week.

2107
02:03:50,540 --> 02:03:51,540
Here we go.

2108
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:07,540
Dark Sakura.

2109
02:04:07,540 --> 02:04:10,540
FU to the weekend being too damn short.

2110
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:12,540
And me for sleeping most of it.

2111
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:14,540
That's it.

2112
02:04:14,540 --> 02:04:15,540
Loki.

2113
02:04:15,540 --> 02:04:19,540
FU to my wife and kids for...

2114
02:04:19,540 --> 02:04:24,540
Well, mainly my wife for yesterday when the kids went to sleep.

2115
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:27,540
She takes a nap on the couch and took up the entire couch.

2116
02:04:28,540 --> 02:04:33,540
So I couldn't nap on the couch, so I ended up just because I was exhausted laying on the floor.

2117
02:04:33,540 --> 02:04:35,540
Well, the floor is cement.

2118
02:04:35,540 --> 02:04:40,540
And so now my back has been fucking hurting for the last two days because I was laying on that hard fucking floor.

2119
02:04:40,540 --> 02:04:45,540
I would have slept in our bedroom, but the baby wasn't yet asleep yet.

2120
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:48,540
So I had to wait for him to go to sleep before I could go in there.

2121
02:04:48,540 --> 02:04:50,540
And I was too tired for that.

2122
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:53,540
And FU having to work on Saturdays until the other day.

2123
02:04:54,540 --> 02:05:00,540
That's going to be a tough change, but like I said before the show, having the weekday off for appointments.

2124
02:05:00,540 --> 02:05:02,540
And working until 7 o'clock at night.

2125
02:05:02,540 --> 02:05:08,540
That's weird too because I'm used to going in at 7 or 8 and it's going to be like 10 or 30.

2126
02:05:08,540 --> 02:05:11,540
But that means you can stay up until 3 AM and it's justified.

2127
02:05:11,540 --> 02:05:14,540
No, I still have to wake up early to get the kids off from school.

2128
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:15,540
No.

2129
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:16,540
So no it's not.

2130
02:05:16,540 --> 02:05:20,540
But I get a little bit... I'm easy to work I guess.

2131
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:21,540
Alright.

2132
02:05:22,540 --> 02:05:29,540
My FU of the week goes to the fact that I cannot get over the mental block that change is scary.

2133
02:05:29,540 --> 02:05:33,540
Because you know, change usually ends up a good thing.

2134
02:05:33,540 --> 02:05:38,540
If you do the same thing every single day for your life, you're always going to get the same end result.

2135
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:40,540
So change kind of has to happen.

2136
02:05:40,540 --> 02:05:43,540
But yet, all that being said, I still...

2137
02:05:43,540 --> 02:05:50,540
There's still a big part of me that is very nervous about a big change that's happening very soon.

2138
02:05:50,540 --> 02:05:54,540
And so of course I'm a little scared about that.

2139
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:56,540
But it'll all work out kids.

2140
02:05:56,540 --> 02:05:58,540
It'll all work out.

2141
02:05:58,540 --> 02:05:59,540
Alright.

2142
02:05:59,540 --> 02:06:01,540
Let's get to a couple more stories.

2143
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:05,540
And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2144
02:06:05,540 --> 02:06:07,540
And our user name on Skype.

2145
02:06:07,540 --> 02:06:08,540
Orange Lounge Radio.

2146
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:10,540
All one word.

2147
02:06:10,540 --> 02:06:12,540
Alan Alchemy in chat says,

2148
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:13,540
Stop vague blogging.

2149
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:14,540
This isn't Facebook.

2150
02:06:14,540 --> 02:06:15,540
Hey, you know what?

2151
02:06:15,540 --> 02:06:17,540
It isn't Facebook.

2152
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:18,540
It's OLR.

2153
02:06:18,540 --> 02:06:21,540
The vagueness is sometimes even worse on this show.

2154
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:22,540
You must be new here.

2155
02:06:22,540 --> 02:06:24,540
Alright.

2156
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:26,540
Let's get to a couple more stories for you guys.

2157
02:06:26,540 --> 02:06:28,540
And then the Skype line.

2158
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:29,540
Loki.

2159
02:06:29,540 --> 02:06:32,540
So, take note Nintendo and Sony.

2160
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:36,540
This is how you should really do your pre-order bonuses and stuff like that for games.

2161
02:06:36,540 --> 02:06:37,540
Just Cause 3.

2162
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:42,540
If you happen to order that on the Xbox One,

2163
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:50,540
you also get a backwards compatible version of Just Cause 2 on the Xbox 360 to play as well.

2164
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:52,540
I think that's pretty awesome.

2165
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:58,540
And, of course, Just Cause 3 is coming out December 1st on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

2166
02:06:58,540 --> 02:07:02,540
But you'll only be able to get that free game on the Xbox One version.

2167
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:05,540
Now, I want to say this isn't the first game they're doing this with, too.

2168
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:07,540
They had, I think...

2169
02:07:07,540 --> 02:07:09,540
There were some other ones, too.

2170
02:07:09,540 --> 02:07:11,540
Among that, of course, would be Gears of War.

2171
02:07:11,540 --> 02:07:16,540
The Gears of War Ultimate Edition, which is actually coming out in a couple weeks here.

2172
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:21,540
If you do happen to purchase that game, you'll get access to Gears of War,

2173
02:07:21,540 --> 02:07:28,540
Gears of War 2, Gears of War 3, and Gears of War Judgment all for free via backwards compatibility.

2174
02:07:28,540 --> 02:07:33,540
So, the Ultimate Edition, that'll be coming out August 25th.

2175
02:07:33,540 --> 02:07:37,540
And then you're going to have that offer until the end of 2015.

2176
02:07:38,540 --> 02:07:43,540
This seems like a very interesting trend, where buy the game and get the old game free.

2177
02:07:43,540 --> 02:07:45,540
Yeah, now...

2178
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:47,540
Maybe that's how they enhanced the digital...

2179
02:07:47,540 --> 02:07:53,540
However, with at least this version of it, that's not necessarily...

2180
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:58,540
Not the same with Just Cause, but in this one, you don't actually get those games for free.

2181
02:07:58,540 --> 02:08:01,540
You get them for free until the end of the year.

2182
02:08:01,540 --> 02:08:03,540
And then they're not free anymore.

2183
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:07,540
Oh, interesting. It's a way to raise hype, I guess.

2184
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:12,540
All they want you to do, they want you to push A and pre-order digitally.

2185
02:08:12,540 --> 02:08:15,540
And if they have to throw games at you to do it, that's what they're going to do.

2186
02:08:15,540 --> 02:08:17,540
Old games to get you to press A.

2187
02:08:17,540 --> 02:08:23,540
Well, I liked how they did it with the PlayStation versions of...

2188
02:08:23,540 --> 02:08:29,540
For example, Call of Duty Advanced Warfare did this, where you had your PlayStation 4 version.

2189
02:08:30,540 --> 02:08:33,540
You got the other version for free. It was cross-buy.

2190
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:38,540
And I thought that was awesome, because my friends don't have that version of the game.

2191
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:41,540
And thankfully, my PlayStation 4 had broken.

2192
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:45,540
And so I was still able to play a version of the game while it was being fixed.

2193
02:08:45,540 --> 02:08:48,540
And that was awesome that they offered that.

2194
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:50,540
And I think more they should do that.

2195
02:08:50,540 --> 02:08:54,540
Especially Nintendo! Hello! You have all these fucking virtual console games!

2196
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:57,540
Start throwing that shit in like crazy!

2197
02:08:57,540 --> 02:08:59,540
Give it away like pear candy!

2198
02:08:59,540 --> 02:09:02,540
You buy the Wii U, guess what? You get 20 virtual console games.

2199
02:09:02,540 --> 02:09:05,540
I mean, that would totally sweeten the deal, I think, for a lot of people.

2200
02:09:05,540 --> 02:09:07,540
That's what they did with the 3DS, remember?

2201
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:09,540
Yeah, do that again!

2202
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:14,540
It's not helping that you have one game that released a few weeks ago,

2203
02:09:14,540 --> 02:09:17,540
and then the next game's not releasing for a few weeks from now.

2204
02:09:17,540 --> 02:09:20,540
Fucking fill in that shit in the middle.

2205
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:23,540
Alright, AndyScout in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com points out,

2206
02:09:23,540 --> 02:09:26,540
Sword Art Online, Lost Song does it too.

2207
02:09:26,540 --> 02:09:30,540
If you pre-order on PlayStation 4, you get re-Holo Fragment free.

2208
02:09:30,540 --> 02:09:34,540
So, I think you'll be seeing that a lot more with sequels and series,

2209
02:09:34,540 --> 02:09:39,540
where the old stuff is bundled in to get you to buy the new stuff.

2210
02:09:39,540 --> 02:09:44,540
Anyhow, just a couple other quick little tidbits here before we open up the Skype line.

2211
02:09:44,540 --> 02:09:48,540
One of them about Rare Replay, because it's kind of all the rage this week.

2212
02:09:48,540 --> 02:09:51,540
Rare has announced that they are teaming up with iam8bit,

2213
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:56,540
and they're going to be releasing limited edition vinyls for some of their classic titles.

2214
02:09:56,540 --> 02:10:00,540
It's in vinyl records, so that's pretty rad.

2215
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:03,540
These soundtracks will be around $25 to $35,

2216
02:10:03,540 --> 02:10:07,540
and you can see there's some for Perfect Dark and Battletoads and Banjo-Kazooie.

2217
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:10,540
So that's pretty rad, especially if you're into vinyl collecting,

2218
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:12,540
and especially some of the art that goes with those vinyls.

2219
02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:16,540
I think you might be interested in this, so very cool.

2220
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:19,540
And lastly, speaking of music,

2221
02:10:19,540 --> 02:10:24,540
Nintendo will be releasing a Super Mario 30th Anniversary soundtrack.

2222
02:10:24,540 --> 02:10:27,540
It's for Japan, but it will be coming out on September 30th,

2223
02:10:27,540 --> 02:10:30,540
and thanks to the internet, I'm sure once it comes out in Japan,

2224
02:10:30,540 --> 02:10:32,540
it's going to be on piracy websites anywhere.

2225
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:38,540
Not that I'm saying that's okay, but you would think they would just bundle this in with pre-orders of Super Mario Maker.

2226
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:43,540
But I digress. 3,240 yen, two discs full of classic songs,

2227
02:10:43,540 --> 02:10:50,540
from Super Mario Bros., 2, 3, Land, World, USA, as they call it in Japan,

2228
02:10:50,540 --> 02:10:52,540
which was our Mario Bros. 2,

2229
02:10:52,540 --> 02:10:59,540
Super Mario Land 2, 6 Golden Coins, 64, Sunshine, Galaxy, New on the Wii,

2230
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:06,540
Galaxy 2, 3D Land, New 2, New You, Mario 3D World, and Mario Maker, the bonus track.

2231
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:10,540
So much Mario. You probably know all the songs by heart already,

2232
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:15,540
but there you go. You have a soundtrack to blast in your car, if you so desire.

2233
02:11:15,540 --> 02:11:20,540
Anyhow, that is it. We are to the end of the show,

2234
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:23,540
and this is the part where we open it up for your feedback.

2235
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:25,540
If you want to talk about anything you've heard on the show tonight,

2236
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:28,540
or maybe something you haven't heard, or you just want to say,

2237
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:31,540
hey, at least talk to us about something gaming, give us a call.

2238
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:36,540
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2239
02:11:36,540 --> 02:11:39,540
The Skype line is open now, and it's lighting up.

2240
02:11:39,540 --> 02:11:42,540
We're already getting calls. This is crazy.

2241
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:43,540
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2242
02:11:43,540 --> 02:11:45,540
Hey, guys. It's Jason.

2243
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:46,540
Hey, Jason. How you doing?

2244
02:11:46,540 --> 02:11:47,540
I'm doing pretty good.

2245
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:49,540
Great. Great to hear from you. What's up?

2246
02:11:49,540 --> 02:11:59,540
I need to talk about a rare replay game that nobody else has mentioned tonight, as far as I'm aware.

2247
02:11:59,540 --> 02:12:06,540
It's kind of right in the middle, but it's been one of my, I would openly call it obsession,

2248
02:12:06,540 --> 02:12:15,540
but it's been one of my favorites since the first time I played it back in 97, and that would be Blast Corps.

2249
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:18,540
I was trying to think which one of them is from 97.

2250
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:19,540
It's got to be one of the later games.

2251
02:12:19,540 --> 02:12:23,540
Definitely one of the N64 games, and it's really interesting,

2252
02:12:23,540 --> 02:12:30,540
because I never had an N64, and Blast Corps is one of those games that just doesn't emulate well.

2253
02:12:30,540 --> 02:12:39,540
For about a year, a buddy of mine runs stores in New Mexico, Albuquerque and Rio Rancho,

2254
02:12:39,540 --> 02:12:45,540
that does mostly game trade-ins on a lot of classic games,

2255
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:50,540
but still gets his own fair share of shipments of new games and that kind of stuff.

2256
02:12:50,540 --> 02:12:53,540
It's a game store, period.

2257
02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:58,540
Great guy. I've known him for, wow, if not two decades now,

2258
02:12:58,540 --> 02:13:02,540
pretty damn close to it, even though I never went to school with him or anything like that.

2259
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:07,540
But I've been talking to him for a while and various other friends,

2260
02:13:07,540 --> 02:13:10,540
and I've been planning on getting an N64 for a while.

2261
02:13:10,540 --> 02:13:16,540
I never had one when I was younger, so any time I played it, I was either renting it from Blockbuster,

2262
02:13:16,540 --> 02:13:21,540
borrowing it from a friend, or just over at a friend's house and playing it.

2263
02:13:21,540 --> 02:13:26,540
Something really interesting when I've been talking to people about Rare Replay and Blast Corps

2264
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:31,540
is there was a question earlier about whether or not frame rate bugs were fixed.

2265
02:13:31,540 --> 02:13:36,540
You made the comment about if there was a 360 release and it's a 360 version.

2266
02:13:36,540 --> 02:13:41,540
There was a bug in Blast Corps where you could...

2267
02:13:41,540 --> 02:13:45,540
I don't know the specific details, so it's kind of hard to explain it,

2268
02:13:45,540 --> 02:13:49,540
but Blast Corps has a mechanic that there are multiple vehicles in the level,

2269
02:13:49,540 --> 02:13:53,540
so you can get out of a vehicle, get into another one, that kind of thing.

2270
02:13:53,540 --> 02:13:55,540
It's a puzzle element, so on and so forth.

2271
02:13:55,540 --> 02:14:03,540
There was a bug where if you just held down the leave button, the disembark button,

2272
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:07,540
that it would overwhelm the game's engine or something like that,

2273
02:14:07,540 --> 02:14:12,540
and it would just destroy the building in front of you after about five seconds or something like that

2274
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:16,540
after just holding down the button.

2275
02:14:16,540 --> 02:14:23,540
I've never legitimately beaten that game until Rare Replay,

2276
02:14:23,540 --> 02:14:27,540
until I actually streamed the vast majority of it over this week when I saw it,

2277
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:31,540
and I was jumping up and down and flipping out because there are certain levels in that game

2278
02:14:31,540 --> 02:14:34,540
that are fucking difficult, and I was so happy to have cleared it.

2279
02:14:34,540 --> 02:14:43,540
But I assume just because of the speed of the N64, the frame rate issues that are suffered,

2280
02:14:43,540 --> 02:14:50,540
how many calculations happen in the game even when nothing is being drawn?

2281
02:14:50,540 --> 02:14:52,540
I need to find a better way to explain this.

2282
02:14:52,540 --> 02:14:58,540
Do you remember the old DDR glitch that let people access the hidden challenge charts

2283
02:14:58,540 --> 02:15:06,540
for Last Message, Blue Impulse, Love Shine, and the fourth one I can't remember?

2284
02:15:06,540 --> 02:15:08,540
Yeah, so long ago, yeah, yeah.

2285
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:13,540
The trick where you would go, you would rig the popular courses and switch between,

2286
02:15:13,540 --> 02:15:16,540
I think it was Naoki standard and popular one.

2287
02:15:16,540 --> 02:15:21,540
It's a similar kind of thing, and if you listen to any speedruns,

2288
02:15:21,540 --> 02:15:25,540
if you watch speedrun streams or listen to speedrunners talk about the details,

2289
02:15:25,540 --> 02:15:31,540
I can only assume that it has something to do with the rendering power of the N64

2290
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:37,540
and the slowdown that happens when there's this input calculation physics massacre

2291
02:15:37,540 --> 02:15:42,540
compared to the Xbox One that can emulate it more reliably,

2292
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:46,540
that building destruction spam trick doesn't work anymore.

2293
02:15:46,540 --> 02:15:53,540
So in my classic fashion, I get to this one towards the last level of the game.

2294
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:58,540
I get through a very obnoxiously long, like 15, 20-minute level.

2295
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:04,540
I get to the very end of it, and I didn't actually know how to beat the level legitimately,

2296
02:16:04,540 --> 02:16:09,540
so I just fell back on my old spam the exit button trick,

2297
02:16:09,540 --> 02:16:12,540
and I do that for like 30 seconds and nothing happens.

2298
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:16,540
So I'm sitting here. This is streamed. It should be in my past broadcast

2299
02:16:16,540 --> 02:16:18,540
if anybody wants to look it up on Twitch.

2300
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:24,540
I'm just standing there with this unable to leave the vehicle sound playing repeatedly

2301
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:28,540
over and over and over and over, and so I finally have to give up

2302
02:16:28,540 --> 02:16:33,540
and replay the level a couple times to figure out how to actually do it legitimately.

2303
02:16:34,540 --> 02:16:39,540
The long story short of this game is that Blast Corps is amazing,

2304
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:46,540
and I'm working through the rest of Rare Replay because I have played very, very few of those games,

2305
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:52,540
but Blast Corps is a game I have been dying to own, like I said, since 97 or 98,

2306
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:56,540
whenever it originally came out, and now I do, and it's more faithful.

2307
02:16:56,540 --> 02:17:02,540
It's forced me to actually be able to play the game legitimately, and it is so much fun.

2308
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:06,540
Thank God. I've already decimated the game, but I had such a fun time doing it.

2309
02:17:06,540 --> 02:17:11,540
That's so interesting that they fixed the bug like that, because that makes me think like,

2310
02:17:11,540 --> 02:17:17,540
what if they were to release, let's say, Blaster Master, which, God, I'd love to see that come back,

2311
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:23,540
but then they fixed the bug where pausing will no longer kill the bosses in an instant, right?

2312
02:17:23,540 --> 02:17:27,540
Remember that trick where you would pause the boss and the grenade would just fire over and over again?

2313
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:30,540
You could kill the boss super easy that way? What if they got rid of that?

2314
02:17:30,540 --> 02:17:34,540
We would all be screwed, because that game was hard to begin with.

2315
02:17:34,540 --> 02:17:38,540
So, I mean, this is funny, because when you're talking about this bug in Blast Corps,

2316
02:17:38,540 --> 02:17:42,540
that's the scene that's running through my mind, is like, what if they took out the pause glitch?

2317
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:47,540
Because there are certain glitches in old games. We've been talking a little bit about old games and glitches.

2318
02:17:47,540 --> 02:17:56,540
There are certain ones that we all did as kids. Not really a glitch, but very few people can get through Contra

2319
02:17:56,540 --> 02:18:01,540
without some up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, BA, start. Same thing with Gradius, right?

2320
02:18:01,540 --> 02:18:02,540
Absolutely.

2321
02:18:02,540 --> 02:18:05,540
Anyway, it's just funny. Like, what if they got rid of that? We'd be hosed.

2322
02:18:05,540 --> 02:18:11,540
And I don't think they explicitly fixed it. I think it's just a quirk of emulation

2323
02:18:11,540 --> 02:18:15,540
and just what the difference in hardware and software rendering is.

2324
02:18:15,540 --> 02:18:21,540
And the comment especially about the frame rate issues, Blast Corps was a pretty intensive game,

2325
02:18:21,540 --> 02:18:29,540
because it was all about a vehicle running into buildings, sometimes like pushing TNT into it, what have you.

2326
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:35,540
But it was all about physics and collisions in an N64 game and explosions and everything else.

2327
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:39,540
So there was a lot of calculation and madness and that kind of stuff going on.

2328
02:18:39,540 --> 02:18:48,540
And if I vaguely recall slowdowns playing it on the N64 back in the day, I would not be at all surprised.

2329
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:52,540
I would just be willing to wager that I definitely came across them.

2330
02:18:52,540 --> 02:19:00,540
But it played stunningly on the Xbox One. It was such a grand and smooth and clean experience.

2331
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:06,540
And I really just got to enjoy the game all over again in my hands-on my time from start to finish.

2332
02:19:06,540 --> 02:19:11,540
It is so weird seeing these old-ass games really cleaned up for HDTV and high refresh rate

2333
02:19:11,540 --> 02:19:16,540
and the HDMI cables and things that just weren't a factor in the 80s and 90s.

2334
02:19:17,540 --> 02:19:23,540
And I'm pretty curious. Banjo-Kazooie is on my shortlist as well. I played a fair amount of that as well.

2335
02:19:23,540 --> 02:19:29,540
And I'm kind of curious. I don't think I'm any bit motion sick. I don't get any kind of motion sickness.

2336
02:19:29,540 --> 02:19:35,540
But I'm pretty curious to see the difference in camera interactivity like you were talking about as well.

2337
02:19:35,540 --> 02:19:39,540
Yeah, neither do I. And that game was like setting something off.

2338
02:19:39,540 --> 02:19:42,540
So anyway, Jason, I gotta let you go so we can fit in some more calls.

2339
02:19:42,540 --> 02:19:43,540
But thank you so much for the call.

2340
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:44,540
Of course.

2341
02:19:44,540 --> 02:19:45,540
Great to hear about. Take care, my friend.

2342
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:46,540
You too.

2343
02:19:46,540 --> 02:19:52,540
There it is. Orange Lounge Radio. Jason, the voice of the show. If you listen to the intro carefully, you hear Jason.

2344
02:19:52,540 --> 02:19:58,540
If you check in to the show, you know, those of you who listen to the podcast feed, you hear that little do-do-do-do-do-do.

2345
02:19:58,540 --> 02:20:02,540
If you want to check in, use this passphrase at vognetwork.com. Jason does that as well.

2346
02:20:02,540 --> 02:20:06,540
And you should check in. Get your VoG network points. Participate with the show already.

2347
02:20:06,540 --> 02:20:09,540
All right. It is lighting up on the phone lines. I gotta get to another call.

2348
02:20:09,540 --> 02:20:11,540
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2349
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:13,540
Hey, what's up, everyone? It's Ranma.

2350
02:20:13,540 --> 02:20:15,540
Hey, Ranma. Good to hear from you, buddy. How you doing?

2351
02:20:15,540 --> 02:20:16,540
Good to hear from all of y'all.

2352
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:17,540
What's that?

2353
02:20:17,540 --> 02:20:19,540
It's good to hear from all of y'all.

2354
02:20:19,540 --> 02:20:23,540
Yeah. I mean, we missed you. You weren't here for the early show last week, right? Because we were in a winter time.

2355
02:20:23,540 --> 02:20:28,540
No. I was doing a Love Live school idol project photo shoot when I got back.

2356
02:20:28,540 --> 02:20:34,540
I'm listening and I'm making comments in the chat. I'm like, wait a minute. This was pre-recorded already.

2357
02:20:34,540 --> 02:20:38,540
I know. And you know what? I forgot to run chat last week during the show.

2358
02:20:38,540 --> 02:20:44,540
I should ask Darktitsou here, somebody that was probably here, to send me a chat log, see if there's any really good comments during last week's show.

2359
02:20:44,540 --> 02:20:46,540
I usually try to run it. I forgot last week.

2360
02:20:46,540 --> 02:20:48,540
I can hook you up with that.

2361
02:20:48,540 --> 02:20:51,540
Yes. Nice. Appreciate it. So, what's in your mind tonight?

2362
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:56,540
Well, I wanted to call in and talk briefly about International Sailor Moon Day, if I can.

2363
02:20:56,540 --> 02:21:01,540
I was gonna ask you about it anyway at the end of the call, so why not? Yeah, let's talk about it. What's going on on the stream Saturday?

2364
02:21:01,540 --> 02:21:11,540
Well, let me give you a brief, a quick history. We started this about, I'd say, two years ago about the announcing of Sailor Moon Crystal.

2365
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:20,540
And we have a large Sailor Moon cosplay, non-cosplay fan group here in New York City, so we decided to do something to celebrate that.

2366
02:21:20,540 --> 02:21:27,540
It was originally held by another group, which had the event, and then they were not able to do it last year.

2367
02:21:27,540 --> 02:21:34,540
So, Sailor Moon Meetup decided to go ahead and do this, and we did this at a local studio, and we were streaming it online.

2368
02:21:34,540 --> 02:21:46,540
Pretty much, we were talking to people such as Ms. Dream, who does fan scanlations of the manga and translations of the various Sara Miu musicals online.

2369
02:21:46,540 --> 02:21:59,540
And there is a local group, I forget their name, they're based out of the area, they do Sailor Moon slash K-pop style videos and dance routines.

2370
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:06,540
Fun. Yeah. So, this year we decided, you know, let's do it again and do things slightly different.

2371
02:22:06,540 --> 02:22:17,540
So, part of this is that we're celebrating, like, the resurgence of Sailor Moon, as well as, if you notice, there are other classic animes that are making a big comeback in recent years.

2372
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:27,540
That is very true. Well, now, and I noticed when I was looking this up on Facebook, trying to get some more information on it, I noticed that there is, like, international Sailor Moon stuff all over.

2373
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:32,540
Like, they're doing something in San Francisco. This is not a New York-centric thing. It's everywhere.

2374
02:22:32,540 --> 02:22:39,540
It started out in a New York event, and then there were other people that said they wanted to hold their own event.

2375
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:47,540
So, we have people across the country, around the world, that are having their own versions of International Sailor Moon Day.

2376
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:53,540
Some of them are doing, like, a Skype get-together. Some of them are actually having events in their local cities.

2377
02:22:53,540 --> 02:22:55,540
That's fun. Are you going to dress up?

2378
02:22:55,540 --> 02:23:01,540
I am staffed, so most likely that's not going to happen, but I will most likely be wearing my Artemis hat.

2379
02:23:01,540 --> 02:23:07,540
That's awesome. You know, I know we're not the anime show on the network. You guys are. We're the video game show.

2380
02:23:07,540 --> 02:23:13,540
But, you know, fandom, those lines blur a lot, and there's a lot of people who are into games who are into these other things.

2381
02:23:13,540 --> 02:23:16,540
And certainly, I have a lot of Twitter followers who love their Sailor Moon.

2382
02:23:16,540 --> 02:23:23,540
I can't profess personally to following it very closely, but I have seen some of the old 90s anime, and it is awesome.

2383
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:25,540
I'm a big fan of Tuxedo Mask, so...

2384
02:23:25,540 --> 02:23:29,540
Who does the least amount of work out of all of them at all together?

2385
02:23:29,540 --> 02:23:32,540
I know, I know. But, you know, can't help it.

2386
02:23:32,540 --> 02:23:34,540
He one-time cosplayed Santa Claus.

2387
02:23:37,540 --> 02:23:43,540
So, you're streaming from one of the live events with all these routines and things and tribute performances.

2388
02:23:43,540 --> 02:23:51,540
This year, what we're doing is we're going to have different guests who have been part of the Sailor Moon community from, like,

2389
02:23:51,540 --> 02:23:55,540
scanlations, cosplay, performances. We're going to have that.

2390
02:23:55,540 --> 02:23:58,540
We're also going to do a Sailor Moon-themed match game.

2391
02:23:58,540 --> 02:24:00,540
Oh, my favorite!

2392
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:09,540
Yep, karaoke contests. We're going to have the Jubon Fashion Show, which is pretty much everybody in cosplay gets up on the stage and strut their stuff.

2393
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:13,540
And we're going to have a special guest.

2394
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:16,540
Oh, are you going to tell us who it is? We've got to wait.

2395
02:24:16,540 --> 02:24:22,540
Absolutely. You might not know the name, but you'll know the commercials that she has done.

2396
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:28,540
She's sang various songs for the English version of Sailor Moon. Her name is Jennifer Sehe.

2397
02:24:28,540 --> 02:24:35,540
Now, the name may not sound familiar, but do you remember Hot Pockets commercials?

2398
02:24:35,540 --> 02:24:38,540
She sings the Hot Pockets song?

2399
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:41,540
She does the Hot Pockets? That's her.

2400
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:54,540
With all due respect, Rama, you know I'm a fan of things that you're a fan of. With all due respect, that's a way bigger deal than Sailor Moon.

2401
02:24:54,540 --> 02:25:00,540
You want to know something? A bunch of people are like, wait a minute, that's her? That's her?

2402
02:25:00,540 --> 02:25:04,540
What are you going to eat? Hot Pockets. Oh, my God, it's the Hot Pockets lady.

2403
02:25:05,540 --> 02:25:10,540
Why don't I just change the banner on the site to a giant Hot Pocket?

2404
02:25:10,540 --> 02:25:16,540
See, if you're going to do that, it's got to show Usagi eating a Hot Pocket because that's the only way it would work.

2405
02:25:16,540 --> 02:25:22,540
Get me the picture and I'll make it happen. The whole chat is lighting up. Hot Pockets!

2406
02:25:25,540 --> 02:25:31,540
No, we do need a new intro for the show. That would be an amazing...

2407
02:25:32,540 --> 02:25:40,540
SSJ100 Man Chat says, come for the Sailor Moon, but stay for the Hot Pockets jingle. That is amazing.

2408
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:44,540
So she's going to be on your stream. We're going to have the Hot Pockets lady on VoG?

2409
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:49,540
Yes, she will be coming via Skype online and you'll be seeing her as part of the livestream.

2410
02:25:49,540 --> 02:25:54,540
Oh, my God, we're going to have the Hot Pockets lady on VoG. We are huge, you guys. So excited.

2411
02:25:54,540 --> 02:25:55,540
We made it.

2412
02:25:55,540 --> 02:26:02,540
All laughing and silliness aside because I think this is amazing, but that's so awesome, the Sailor Moon fandom and everything you guys are doing.

2413
02:26:02,540 --> 02:26:06,540
So glad we could be a part of it. Just a quick programming note because I know some people may be curious

2414
02:26:06,540 --> 02:26:10,540
because you guys are going to be on at the same time the Critical Myth marathon is usually on.

2415
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:16,540
Critical Myth actually ends up coincidentally having the week off, so there's no new shows to air on Saturday anyway.

2416
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:22,540
We will still rerun their reruns. We're going to do reruns of the reruns on Sunday instead at 9 a.m.

2417
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:27,540
So if you usually listen to the Critical Myth marathon, we're going to see this once in a year Sailor Moon event happening

2418
02:26:27,540 --> 02:26:31,540
and then Critical Myth will be on Sunday, which, by the way, speaking of those boys over at Critical Myth,

2419
02:26:31,540 --> 02:26:34,540
I mean, they're taking a lot of weeks off right now because it's summer programming anyway.

2420
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:40,540
There's not as much to talk about during the summer, but they are hitting episode 600.

2421
02:26:40,540 --> 02:26:45,540
Now, granted, they do three shows a week, so it's a little different. It didn't take them as long to get there as it did us,

2422
02:26:45,540 --> 02:26:50,540
but it's still a huge accomplishment. So they're going to hit episode 600 on the Monday when they return.

2423
02:26:50,540 --> 02:26:51,540
So there you go.

2424
02:26:51,540 --> 02:26:52,540
Amazing.

2425
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:59,540
Amazing. So International Sailor Moon Day this Saturday, 12 to 5 Eastern. Check it out.

2426
02:26:59,540 --> 02:27:03,540
Transform into a giant Hot Pocket with us here at VOG.

2427
02:27:03,540 --> 02:27:06,540
Form of Hot Pocket.

2428
02:27:06,540 --> 02:27:10,540
All right. Rama, thanks so much for the call, and good luck on Saturday.

2429
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:13,540
Hey, no problem. All right. Before I go, Rama, I just want to say one thing.

2430
02:27:13,540 --> 02:27:17,540
I meant to say it before. You talked about doing cosplay at Dragon Con. I just want to say...

2431
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:18,540
Oh, it's happening.

2432
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:27,540
It's awesome. And to answer your questions before, as long as you give credit to whoever you got it commissioned from or whatever, nobody's going to care.

2433
02:27:27,540 --> 02:27:32,540
All right. Awesome. Yeah. I gave her a shout on Twitter. My good friend Victoria, she goes by VicKnives on Twitter.

2434
02:27:32,540 --> 02:27:39,540
She's putting it all together. We did the shopping. We shopped for the material this week, and I've seen her sketches and everything,

2435
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:42,540
and we did the fitting. Well, I'm sorry. We did the measurements, and then the fitting comes out.

2436
02:27:42,540 --> 02:27:44,540
So what is it? What's your costume?

2437
02:27:44,540 --> 02:27:46,540
Well, I was going to keep it a secret.

2438
02:27:46,540 --> 02:27:47,540
All right. That's fine. No, that's cool.

2439
02:27:47,540 --> 02:27:52,540
No, it's the worst kept secret ever. I put the sketches on Twitter. I'm going to do Joker from Mass Effect 3.

2440
02:27:52,540 --> 02:27:54,540
I helped.

2441
02:27:54,540 --> 02:28:00,540
Yes, you did, because Dark Sakura actually started the whole thing. She gave me a hat, a gamer X.

2442
02:28:00,540 --> 02:28:03,540
She gave me her old SR2 hat, which is the perfect...

2443
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:05,540
My unworn SR2 hat.

2444
02:28:05,540 --> 02:28:11,540
But it's the perfect Joker from Mass Effect 3, so we went out and bought the stuff it's going to take to make the top and everything.

2445
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:12,540
I'm really excited about it.

2446
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:15,540
I need to talk to you about what your friend's charging you.

2447
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:20,540
Yeah, we'll talk about that. So, yeah, she's great. So, yes, full credit. I would not try to take credit for the costume myself.

2448
02:28:20,540 --> 02:28:23,540
I've decided I want to do a Grey Warden mage for gamer X.

2449
02:28:23,540 --> 02:28:28,540
Oh, and I will. Yeah, and that's the great thing is that I can reuse this costume.

2450
02:28:28,540 --> 02:28:32,540
I will definitely use it at gamer X as well for those of you that are going to be there in December.

2451
02:28:32,540 --> 02:28:39,540
And trying to firm up the plans for MAGFest. Tickets and hotel aren't available for MAGFest yet, because it's still like six months out.

2452
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:46,540
Still waiting. Normally by now, with both conventions, hotel information is already up, so I'm just like waiting, you know?

2453
02:28:46,540 --> 02:28:50,540
Yeah, I think a lot of people are, but I will say that is definitely in my plan.

2454
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:54,540
And I can't imagine people don't do cosplay at MAGFest, so assuming I can get away with...

2455
02:28:54,540 --> 02:28:55,540
Oh, trust me.

2456
02:28:55,540 --> 02:28:57,540
Yeah, I'll do cosplay there too.

2457
02:28:57,540 --> 02:29:06,540
Well, I think I told Jamie this, but me and a friend, GBT for cosplay, we are putting together a rival school's cosplay group for MAGFest.

2458
02:29:06,540 --> 02:29:08,540
Oh my god. That's going to be awesome.

2459
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:10,540
You didn't mention this to me, but that's cool.

2460
02:29:10,540 --> 02:29:12,540
Wait, you're going to be at MAGFest too?

2461
02:29:12,540 --> 02:29:22,540
Yeah, I'm shooting, even though Catsicon's the weekend before, I'm trying to do both, because two of my favorite cosplay friends are coming from the Midwest for Catsicon.

2462
02:29:22,540 --> 02:29:28,540
And your very favorite sassy gay friend is coming out from the West Coast for it, so I think that's a good reason.

2463
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:35,540
Well, yeah, I'm trying to do both. If they don't come from Katsu, I'm skipping Katsu, you'll see me at MAGFest.

2464
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:40,540
You'll probably see me passed out, drunk as Luigi, in front of the Ninja Turtle machine with a 40 in my hand.

2465
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:45,540
Alright, sounds good. Just look for the drunken joker that's clinging to a Burger Time machine.

2466
02:29:45,540 --> 02:29:47,540
You got it, dude.

2467
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:49,540
Alright, take care of my friend. We've got to let you go to get more calls.

2468
02:29:49,540 --> 02:29:50,540
Awesome. No problem. Okay.

2469
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:51,540
Bye.

2470
02:29:51,540 --> 02:29:55,540
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2471
02:29:55,540 --> 02:30:01,540
Quickly, I want to make sure Loki has a minute to get in some last minute stories here while I wait on another call to come in.

2472
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:03,540
I don't know if you have anything to share with us, Loki.

2473
02:30:03,540 --> 02:30:05,540
No, sadly I don't, and I've been looking.

2474
02:30:05,540 --> 02:30:06,540
What?

2475
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:08,540
I've been looking, there's just nothing.

2476
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:10,540
I guess we had such a busy show in other parts.

2477
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:14,540
Killer7's celebrating 10 years, like two months ago, so there's that.

2478
02:30:14,540 --> 02:30:18,540
There's that. Oh my god, there's like 17 million calls coming in right now.

2479
02:30:18,540 --> 02:30:20,540
Did you know that this is the 35th anniversary of Xanadu?

2480
02:30:20,540 --> 02:30:21,540
Nope.

2481
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:22,540
I did not.

2482
02:30:22,540 --> 02:30:24,540
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2483
02:30:24,540 --> 02:30:26,540
Ah, you're breaking up. Oh no.

2484
02:30:26,540 --> 02:30:28,540
My internet connection bad?

2485
02:30:28,540 --> 02:30:30,540
No, we can hear you just fine if you can hear us. Who's this?

2486
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:32,540
This is Andy.

2487
02:30:32,540 --> 02:30:33,540
Andy, what's up?

2488
02:30:33,540 --> 02:30:35,540
He's on the chat, or AndyR on Twitter, or on Facebook.

2489
02:30:35,540 --> 02:30:39,540
I don't, I hear your name a lot, obviously, on Facebook and so forth.

2490
02:30:39,540 --> 02:30:42,540
I don't think I've ever heard you on the show. Is this your first call?

2491
02:30:42,540 --> 02:30:44,540
Yeah, I usually listen to the podcast, so.

2492
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:46,540
Well, welcome.

2493
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:49,540
And I see you brought your bird friend, he's on video, so I can actually see him and we're looking at his studio.

2494
02:30:49,540 --> 02:30:51,540
Aww, pretty birdie.

2495
02:30:51,540 --> 02:30:53,540
Little birdie Fran. What's birdie's name?

2496
02:30:53,540 --> 02:30:55,540
Yeah, she's been listening to the show with me.

2497
02:30:55,540 --> 02:30:57,540
Well, I hope she doesn't start repeating what Loki says.

2498
02:30:57,540 --> 02:30:59,540
So, what's on your mind, buddy?

2499
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:04,540
Just calling to say hi and thank you for the podcast all the time, and yeah.

2500
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:07,540
Thank you for listening all the time. We appreciate it. What kind of games do you play?

2501
02:31:07,540 --> 02:31:09,540
I work week, so.

2502
02:31:09,540 --> 02:31:11,540
Do you listen to us on your commute usually, or at work?

2503
02:31:11,540 --> 02:31:13,540
At work, at my desk.

2504
02:31:13,540 --> 02:31:16,540
Gotcha. Awesome. What kind of games are you playing right now?

2505
02:31:17,540 --> 02:31:19,540
A whole lot of Vita, actually.

2506
02:31:19,540 --> 02:31:26,540
Really? It's nice to hear some Vita love out there, because it sure seems like everybody in the U.S. forgot about the Vita.

2507
02:31:26,540 --> 02:31:28,540
So, what are you playing on Vita?

2508
02:31:28,540 --> 02:31:32,540
Well, I guess they're all Japanese games, so maybe the U.S. did forget about it.

2509
02:31:32,540 --> 02:31:36,540
But I imported three rhythm games for it recently and I've been playing those.

2510
02:31:36,540 --> 02:31:40,540
Let me guess. Tycoon no Tatujin's got to be one, because that just came out.

2511
02:31:40,540 --> 02:31:41,540
Yep.

2512
02:31:41,540 --> 02:31:45,540
Let me think. Probably one of the Hatsune Miku knockoffs.

2513
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:48,540
Yes, I.A.V.T. Colorful. It's another one of the Vocaloid games.

2514
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:52,540
Yes, we had a story on that a couple weeks ago, I remember. So, yeah. And then what else?

2515
02:31:52,540 --> 02:31:53,540
Persona.

2516
02:31:53,540 --> 02:31:57,540
Oh, Persona Dancing All Night. Of course. Of course. How are you enjoying?

2517
02:31:57,540 --> 02:32:03,540
Which, if you had to rank the three, Sophie's Choice, if you had to rank the three, which one's your favorite?

2518
02:32:03,540 --> 02:32:09,540
I only just got Colorful, like, two days ago, but that might be that one.

2519
02:32:09,540 --> 02:32:14,540
Really? Okay. Interesting. Usually, a lot of fans of Persona that I know are, like, rabid foaming at the mouth.

2520
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:17,540
But maybe that's just hanging out with Shane too much, because he's kind of like that.

2521
02:32:17,540 --> 02:32:22,540
I absolutely love Persona Dancing. My biggest issue is it's only got 27 songs.

2522
02:32:22,540 --> 02:32:26,540
And, like, seven of them are remixes of songs that are already in the game.

2523
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:30,540
So, I kind of plat in the game in, like, ten hours.

2524
02:32:30,540 --> 02:32:34,540
Okay. All right. Well, that makes sense. I can see where that string is.

2525
02:32:34,540 --> 02:32:38,540
It's a good game, though. And if I could get the DLC on my Vita, then that would probably make it better.

2526
02:32:38,540 --> 02:32:42,540
Awesome. Well, that's cool. I'm glad to see the Vita getting a little love.

2527
02:32:42,540 --> 02:32:48,540
And this is why systems should be region-free. So, I love that. I love that.

2528
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:50,540
Well, Andy, thanks so much for listening to the show. Really appreciate it.

2529
02:32:50,540 --> 02:32:54,540
And glad you could get in and say hello and introduce us to your bird.

2530
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:55,540
Yep.

2531
02:32:55,540 --> 02:32:58,540
All right. Well, take care, my friend. I'm going to let you go so we can get more calls.

2532
02:32:58,540 --> 02:32:59,540
All right. Sounds good.

2533
02:32:59,540 --> 02:33:00,540
All right. Take care.

2534
02:33:00,540 --> 02:33:01,540
Bye.

2535
02:33:01,540 --> 02:33:02,540
Bye.

2536
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:06,540
I should have also mentioned that Andy R. was wearing a Giants shirt. So, clearly a fan of the correct team.

2537
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:08,540
I want a bird, but Midna won't let me.

2538
02:33:08,540 --> 02:33:14,540
All right. 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

2539
02:33:14,540 --> 02:33:20,540
AkumaJP in chat saying, every time I hear Hot Pockets, my brain goes non-compute.

2540
02:33:20,540 --> 02:33:25,540
Okay. The phones are lighting up. Let's get to another call. Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio. Who's this?

2541
02:33:25,540 --> 02:33:30,540
I must be one crazy motherfucker because it's nearly 5 a.m. for me.

2542
02:33:30,540 --> 02:33:32,540
Oh, my God. This is Obi Wan Jabroni.

2543
02:33:32,540 --> 02:33:37,540
Obi Wan Jabroni. And I was going to say, where you're at, you're like, oh, my God.

2544
02:33:37,540 --> 02:33:38,540
5 a.m.

2545
02:33:38,540 --> 02:33:40,540
I love your icon.

2546
02:33:40,540 --> 02:33:43,540
I'll be saying daylight soon, actually.

2547
02:33:43,540 --> 02:33:45,540
Wow. You are dedicated.

2548
02:33:45,540 --> 02:33:47,540
You guys can hear me okay, right?

2549
02:33:47,540 --> 02:33:48,540
Oh, yeah. You sound great.

2550
02:33:48,540 --> 02:33:53,540
We're checking out your Skype icon where you have the little PlayStation, keep calm and defeat Psycho Mantis.

2551
02:33:53,540 --> 02:33:54,540
Love it.

2552
02:33:54,540 --> 02:34:00,540
Yeah, Dark Sakura mentioned that last time, but yeah, I'm calling you from bed. Holy shit.

2553
02:34:00,540 --> 02:34:03,540
Wait a minute. Are we all in bed with you right now?

2554
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:04,540
Yes.

2555
02:34:04,540 --> 02:34:06,540
I'm not in a bed, but I am reclining.

2556
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:09,540
But we're in bed with Obi Wan Jabroni.

2557
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:12,540
I'm lounging.

2558
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:16,540
Lounging in bed, all three of you, all four of us in bed.

2559
02:34:16,540 --> 02:34:18,540
Is there a soft duvet?

2560
02:34:18,540 --> 02:34:24,540
There is. There is a memory foam mattress, pillows, and a duvet.

2561
02:34:24,540 --> 02:34:27,540
Squish.

2562
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:31,540
I only want listeners to call us from bed.

2563
02:34:31,540 --> 02:34:33,540
You know, we can do some.

2564
02:34:34,540 --> 02:34:39,540
SSG 100 Man Chat says someone's got top bunk.

2565
02:34:39,540 --> 02:34:41,540
Oh, you crazy kids.

2566
02:34:41,540 --> 02:34:43,540
All right. Well, what did you, what, you stayed?

2567
02:34:43,540 --> 02:34:46,540
Well, first off, we did the early show last week.

2568
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:48,540
I know. I'm making up for this.

2569
02:34:48,540 --> 02:34:49,540
All right.

2570
02:34:49,540 --> 02:34:51,540
I've been, I've been drinking. That's why.

2571
02:34:51,540 --> 02:34:52,540
Oh, great.

2572
02:34:52,540 --> 02:34:53,540
That's why I'm up.

2573
02:34:53,540 --> 02:34:56,540
Great. He's calling us in bed and drunk.

2574
02:34:56,540 --> 02:34:58,540
So, what's the beverage of the evening?

2575
02:34:58,540 --> 02:35:00,540
Budweiser.

2576
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:02,540
Budweiser.

2577
02:35:02,540 --> 02:35:04,540
All right.

2578
02:35:04,540 --> 02:35:05,540
I'm sorry.

2579
02:35:05,540 --> 02:35:06,540
Well, I'm sorry to hear.

2580
02:35:06,540 --> 02:35:08,540
It's from a bottle though.

2581
02:35:08,540 --> 02:35:10,540
All right. Well, it's a little better.

2582
02:35:10,540 --> 02:35:12,540
All right. What's on your mind tonight, my friend?

2583
02:35:12,540 --> 02:35:14,540
What did you stay up late for?

2584
02:35:14,540 --> 02:35:16,540
I always stay up late to listen to this show.

2585
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:18,540
I'm crazy.

2586
02:35:18,540 --> 02:35:24,540
Listen, if I, if I fall asleep during the show, which happens probably about 80% of the time,

2587
02:35:24,540 --> 02:35:26,540
I'll listen back to the podcast.

2588
02:35:26,540 --> 02:35:27,540
I'm dedicated to this.

2589
02:35:27,540 --> 02:35:31,540
I appreciate that. I mean, you, you listeners that are so dedicated to this show are so-

2590
02:35:31,540 --> 02:35:33,540
And I'm always in the comments.

2591
02:35:33,540 --> 02:35:37,540
You always see, you always see me post some sarcastic shit in the comments.

2592
02:35:37,540 --> 02:35:38,540
So-

2593
02:35:38,540 --> 02:35:42,540
I read all the comments. I don't always reply, but I always read them because there's not a lot of them.

2594
02:35:42,540 --> 02:35:43,540
So, it's enough to be-

2595
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:44,540
That's cool.

2596
02:35:44,540 --> 02:35:48,540
Act Deft in chat, drunk at 5 a.m. on a Monday.

2597
02:35:48,540 --> 02:35:49,540
Awesome.

2598
02:35:49,540 --> 02:35:54,540
And Embryon in chat saying, oh my God, the total rejection of Budweiser.

2599
02:35:54,540 --> 02:35:55,540
Anyway.

2600
02:35:55,540 --> 02:35:57,540
So, what's up? What's on your mind tonight?

2601
02:35:57,540 --> 02:36:05,540
Well, I wanted to call in and extend the F for you to Capcom because I didn't get into the Street Fighter V beta,

2602
02:36:05,540 --> 02:36:07,540
or beta, wherever you live.

2603
02:36:07,540 --> 02:36:13,540
The funny thing about that whole thing with us in Europe was we had to fill out a form.

2604
02:36:13,540 --> 02:36:16,540
So, we didn't actually have to pre-order the game.

2605
02:36:16,540 --> 02:36:18,540
So, we had to fill out some form.

2606
02:36:18,540 --> 02:36:22,540
And there was a question on it and it said, how many BPD are Battle Points?

2607
02:36:22,540 --> 02:36:28,540
And because I play on Xbox mostly, I have zero on PlayStation.

2608
02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:29,540
Oh.

2609
02:36:29,540 --> 02:36:33,540
So, maybe- I don't know. Maybe that's because I didn't get in.

2610
02:36:33,540 --> 02:36:35,540
No idea.

2611
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:36,540
I would still think-

2612
02:36:36,540 --> 02:36:38,540
Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

2613
02:36:38,540 --> 02:36:41,540
To accurately test a game, you need people at all levels.

2614
02:36:41,540 --> 02:36:44,540
So, you do need some people with zero Battle Points.

2615
02:36:44,540 --> 02:36:46,540
You need some people who don't know what the F they're doing.

2616
02:36:46,540 --> 02:36:51,540
So, I would actually think that shouldn't solely disqualify you, but that's my thought.

2617
02:36:51,540 --> 02:36:52,540
Yeah.

2618
02:36:52,540 --> 02:36:59,540
Second thing was, just a PSA on this whole Xbox One thing, the PVR feature.

2619
02:36:59,540 --> 02:37:05,540
There's a couple of small points they haven't mentioned.

2620
02:37:05,540 --> 02:37:09,540
If you have a hard drive connected because you ran out of storage,

2621
02:37:09,540 --> 02:37:15,540
you need to attach a second hard drive because all that stuff lives separately.

2622
02:37:15,540 --> 02:37:19,540
It can't live on the hard drive that you plugged in the first one.

2623
02:37:19,540 --> 02:37:20,540
You know what I mean?

2624
02:37:20,540 --> 02:37:21,540
Interesting, yeah.

2625
02:37:21,540 --> 02:37:22,540
Yeah.

2626
02:37:22,540 --> 02:37:24,540
I wonder if they're different formats. They're probably formatted differently.

2627
02:37:24,540 --> 02:37:29,540
Yeah, because, I mean, Devia hard drives are standard, but I don't know.

2628
02:37:29,540 --> 02:37:31,540
They use a different system.

2629
02:37:31,540 --> 02:37:38,540
So, you'd have to purchase a separate hard drive as well as the tuner, I guess.

2630
02:37:38,540 --> 02:37:40,540
No, that's good to know. I had no idea.

2631
02:37:40,540 --> 02:37:41,540
Yeah.

2632
02:37:41,540 --> 02:37:43,540
I wonder if you- this is just a crazy thought.

2633
02:37:43,540 --> 02:37:47,540
Could you take one hard drive and do two partitions?

2634
02:37:48,540 --> 02:37:49,540
I-

2635
02:37:49,540 --> 02:37:51,540
I don't know. Just throwing it out there, maybe.

2636
02:37:51,540 --> 02:37:53,540
The tech master might be able to- I don't know.

2637
02:37:53,540 --> 02:37:54,540
I don't know.

2638
02:37:54,540 --> 02:37:55,540
If the tech master could answer that one.

2639
02:37:55,540 --> 02:37:57,540
But, no, I have no idea on that one.

2640
02:37:57,540 --> 02:38:04,540
But, yeah, you have to purchase two hard drives if one's full and if you've extended it.

2641
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:11,540
It's unfortunate because PlayStation has given us accessible hard drives and Xbox hasn't.

2642
02:38:11,540 --> 02:38:12,540
You know?

2643
02:38:12,540 --> 02:38:13,540
Right.

2644
02:38:13,540 --> 02:38:14,540
And it sucks. It really does.

2645
02:38:14,540 --> 02:38:18,540
I wish you could access it and just, you know, put your own hard drive in.

2646
02:38:18,540 --> 02:38:20,540
And the Xbox drive fills up fast.

2647
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:21,540
It does.

2648
02:38:21,540 --> 02:38:23,540
I think the game installs are just so much bigger.

2649
02:38:23,540 --> 02:38:30,540
And I have the terabyte system and it's- I've owned the terabyte system for like a month and it's already up to like 22% full.

2650
02:38:30,540 --> 02:38:31,540
Really?

2651
02:38:31,540 --> 02:38:35,540
I have my 500 gigabyte PlayStation 4 and I was actually looking at the storage of it.

2652
02:38:35,540 --> 02:38:38,540
I still have room and I've been buying everything digitally.

2653
02:38:38,540 --> 02:38:40,540
I've filled up the PlayStation 4.

2654
02:38:40,540 --> 02:38:41,540
I have finally filled that up.

2655
02:38:41,540 --> 02:38:47,540
I think with all of the PlayStation Plus games I've had to go through and actually finally delete some of the PlayStation Plus things that I'm just not playing.

2656
02:38:47,540 --> 02:38:49,540
Because I know that at least it's in my library.

2657
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:50,540
I can grab it later.

2658
02:38:50,540 --> 02:38:51,540
Yeah.

2659
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:53,540
I mean I use my Xbox one more.

2660
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:55,540
I do have a PS4 as well.

2661
02:38:55,540 --> 02:38:58,540
But, you know, I'm not favoring any of the system.

2662
02:38:58,540 --> 02:39:02,540
That's my go-to system, the Xbox.

2663
02:39:02,540 --> 02:39:04,540
Mine was full and I had to go through-

2664
02:39:04,540 --> 02:39:10,540
Because I was downloading the gold games, you know, for every month.

2665
02:39:10,540 --> 02:39:11,540
Right.

2666
02:39:11,540 --> 02:39:12,540
And those can be huge.

2667
02:39:12,540 --> 02:39:15,540
I mean, especially when you get one and then it has to update.

2668
02:39:15,540 --> 02:39:19,540
So, you know, there's always that.

2669
02:39:19,540 --> 02:39:21,540
So I had to go through it the other day and kind of delete stuff.

2670
02:39:21,540 --> 02:39:26,540
And it's kind of- I still think that interface is pretty cumbersome, you know?

2671
02:39:26,540 --> 02:39:27,540
Yeah.

2672
02:39:27,540 --> 02:39:30,540
I am really looking forward to the redo of the interface.

2673
02:39:30,540 --> 02:39:32,540
Especially because I don't have Kinect.

2674
02:39:32,540 --> 02:39:33,540
Do you have Kinect?

2675
02:39:33,540 --> 02:39:34,540
Because I don't.

2676
02:39:34,540 --> 02:39:35,540
And so it's-

2677
02:39:35,540 --> 02:39:36,540
Yes.

2678
02:39:36,540 --> 02:39:37,540
I got the day one edition.

2679
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:38,540
Oh wow.

2680
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:39,540
I was a sucker.

2681
02:39:39,540 --> 02:39:41,540
No, a lot of people were really into it.

2682
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:46,540
And I got FIFA 10, which I'm not a FIFA player.

2683
02:39:46,540 --> 02:39:48,540
Which is probably shocking to you guys.

2684
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:51,540
I'm more of a PES person.

2685
02:39:51,540 --> 02:39:53,540
So yeah, I got FIFA whatever it was.

2686
02:39:53,540 --> 02:39:56,540
FIFA 13, I believe, I think.

2687
02:39:56,540 --> 02:40:01,540
So I went through it and I deleted that because I'm not going to play it.

2688
02:40:01,540 --> 02:40:05,540
But yeah, the menu system on that is terrible.

2689
02:40:05,540 --> 02:40:08,540
I mean, I've unplugged my Kinect, actually, speaking of Kinect.

2690
02:40:08,540 --> 02:40:09,540
Wow.

2691
02:40:09,540 --> 02:40:13,540
The only feature I used was Xbox User Code.

2692
02:40:13,540 --> 02:40:16,540
And I'm sorry if anyone's Xboxes went off there.

2693
02:40:16,540 --> 02:40:19,540
But yeah, that's all I used it for.

2694
02:40:19,540 --> 02:40:24,540
Yeah, I think I would use it for live streaming and then maybe playing Dance Central a few times.

2695
02:40:24,540 --> 02:40:25,540
And that's probably it.

2696
02:40:25,540 --> 02:40:26,540
Oh, and the Fantasia game.

2697
02:40:26,540 --> 02:40:27,540
I want to check that out too.

2698
02:40:27,540 --> 02:40:28,540
That's probably it.

2699
02:40:28,540 --> 02:40:33,540
But I've got Rare Replay coming as well.

2700
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:34,540
I'm looking forward to it.

2701
02:40:34,540 --> 02:40:38,540
Not looking forward to this whole drama of the installs, though.

2702
02:40:38,540 --> 02:40:40,540
That's going to be a nightmare.

2703
02:40:40,540 --> 02:40:41,540
You get over it.

2704
02:40:41,540 --> 02:40:42,540
It's going to clutter.

2705
02:40:42,540 --> 02:40:46,540
See, the thing is, I think a big problem about it is the interface as well.

2706
02:40:46,540 --> 02:40:52,540
And so when you take the clunky interface and then you're just suddenly going to blow up your library with ten more games, it's a little bit irritating.

2707
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:53,540
That's the only thing.

2708
02:40:53,540 --> 02:40:57,540
That's more going through your shit and deleting crap, isn't it, after you're finished with it.

2709
02:40:57,540 --> 02:40:59,540
So a couple more quick things.

2710
02:40:59,540 --> 02:41:02,540
Yeah, very quickly because then I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls.

2711
02:41:02,540 --> 02:41:03,540
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

2712
02:41:03,540 --> 02:41:04,540
That's okay.

2713
02:41:04,540 --> 02:41:05,540
I've dragged on.

2714
02:41:05,540 --> 02:41:06,540
When's Dan coming back?

2715
02:41:06,540 --> 02:41:10,540
I want to talk to Dan about Sega because I know he's a big Sega guy.

2716
02:41:10,540 --> 02:41:11,540
When's Dan coming back?

2717
02:41:11,540 --> 02:41:12,540
I don't know.

2718
02:41:12,540 --> 02:41:18,540
Tell him the fans, fans from their beds, drunken fans in their beds are demanding he return to the show.

2719
02:41:18,540 --> 02:41:22,540
Dan says that he likes to come by when no one expects it.

2720
02:41:22,540 --> 02:41:25,540
Something like the Spanish Inquisition.

2721
02:41:25,540 --> 02:41:26,540
Alright, well there it is.

2722
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:27,540
No one expects it.

2723
02:41:27,540 --> 02:41:28,540
There it is.

2724
02:41:28,540 --> 02:41:30,540
Dan will be back when you least expect it.

2725
02:41:30,540 --> 02:41:32,540
I will keep listening.

2726
02:41:32,540 --> 02:41:34,540
Doctor Who, how is the Apple Watch?

2727
02:41:34,540 --> 02:41:35,540
I love it.

2728
02:41:35,540 --> 02:41:38,540
It reminds me to get off my butt.

2729
02:41:38,540 --> 02:41:46,540
I'm waiting for Gen 2 because the one I wanted was like a grand.

2730
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:47,540
I'm not even joking.

2731
02:41:47,540 --> 02:41:54,540
You know the space black one and it was black and stainless steel.

2732
02:41:54,540 --> 02:41:57,540
That's the one I wanted but it was way too expensive.

2733
02:41:57,540 --> 02:42:02,540
I got the space grey aluminum with the black sports band because I have certain problems with steel.

2734
02:42:02,540 --> 02:42:05,540
You got the sport one.

2735
02:42:05,540 --> 02:42:06,540
I did.

2736
02:42:06,540 --> 02:42:07,540
It's been just fine.

2737
02:42:07,540 --> 02:42:10,540
It hasn't felt like that weird sweaty band feeling.

2738
02:42:10,540 --> 02:42:16,540
The thing I really like best is that I have a bad habit of getting way too wrapped up in what I'm doing.

2739
02:42:16,540 --> 02:42:22,540
So I get that little tap on the wrist when it's time to stand up even though I will fuss at my watch and tell it not to tell me what to do.

2740
02:42:22,540 --> 02:42:26,540
I like that it tracks my activity.

2741
02:42:26,540 --> 02:42:27,540
I can get texts.

2742
02:42:27,540 --> 02:42:29,540
I do directions on it when I'm driving.

2743
02:42:29,540 --> 02:42:36,540
In fact, this morning that was funny, I was texting my mom but I used my voice to text with my watch.

2744
02:42:36,540 --> 02:42:38,540
Dan's like, what?

2745
02:42:38,540 --> 02:42:40,540
I'm like, I'm talking to my mom.

2746
02:42:40,540 --> 02:42:43,540
It's the whole Dick Tracy thing.

2747
02:42:43,540 --> 02:42:44,540
He just sounded so confused.

2748
02:42:44,540 --> 02:42:46,540
I've made calls to him from Target.

2749
02:42:46,540 --> 02:42:53,540
I am also very curious to see what they do to kind of push it further because Apple does kind of do that a lot with their products.

2750
02:42:53,540 --> 02:42:56,540
Where the first one is, okay, it's the first one and here's the new idea.

2751
02:42:56,540 --> 02:42:59,540
But then the second one is always, here's how we're going to take it a step further.

2752
02:42:59,540 --> 02:43:04,540
Read up about the beta for watchOS 2.0.

2753
02:43:04,540 --> 02:43:06,540
It's in beta right now and there's reviews out around it.

2754
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:10,540
You're supposed to have a bunch more local apps.

2755
02:43:10,540 --> 02:43:20,540
The reason I'm waiting for Gen 2 is that I'm still on this fence because I got burnt with the iPad 1.

2756
02:43:21,540 --> 02:43:23,540
And I still have the iPad 1.

2757
02:43:23,540 --> 02:43:26,540
I'm looking at it right now.

2758
02:43:26,540 --> 02:43:32,540
That's why I'm kind of like just on that fence, on that Apple fence.

2759
02:43:32,540 --> 02:43:35,540
I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Apple.

2760
02:43:35,540 --> 02:43:38,540
We should start an Apple show, by the way.

2761
02:43:38,540 --> 02:43:40,540
Well, here's the thing.

2762
02:43:40,540 --> 02:43:44,540
Well, first off, I'd love to get more nerdy shows.

2763
02:43:44,540 --> 02:43:45,540
No.

2764
02:43:45,540 --> 02:43:49,540
I'm scared of chat rooms because someone's going to ask me ASL and I'm such a sad person.

2765
02:43:49,540 --> 02:43:51,540
No, not in the vog chat room. Not in the vog chat room.

2766
02:43:51,540 --> 02:43:53,540
ASL.

2767
02:43:53,540 --> 02:43:56,540
I'm such a sarcastic cunt and I'm sorry to say that word.

2768
02:43:56,540 --> 02:44:01,540
But I'm going to reply after sex leave because that's the kind of asshole I am.

2769
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:08,540
Send me an email to participate at orangeandradio.com

2770
02:44:08,540 --> 02:44:12,540
and I will send you my actual email and we will have a talk.

2771
02:44:12,540 --> 02:44:14,540
All right.

2772
02:44:14,540 --> 02:44:17,540
They're going to talk while Obi-Wan and Jabroni is done.

2773
02:44:17,540 --> 02:44:19,540
We're going to have a pillow talk.

2774
02:44:19,540 --> 02:44:21,540
About watches.

2775
02:44:21,540 --> 02:44:26,540
We should get me, you, and the smooth-talking Jason.

2776
02:44:26,540 --> 02:44:28,540
There you go.

2777
02:44:28,540 --> 02:44:30,540
He's got a dream line up in his head.

2778
02:44:30,540 --> 02:44:32,540
All right, Obi-Wan, Jabroni, I've got to let you go, but have a good night.

2779
02:44:32,540 --> 02:44:34,540
Thank you so much for calling and staying up late. I appreciate it.

2780
02:44:34,540 --> 02:44:36,540
Hey, no problem. Take care.

2781
02:44:36,540 --> 02:44:38,540
I'll start my Nintendo podcast.

2782
02:44:38,540 --> 02:44:40,540
I can't wait for that.

2783
02:44:40,540 --> 02:44:42,540
You know what? I know it's 9 o'clock, but dang it.

2784
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:44,540
Let's try to squeeze in one more call.

2785
02:44:44,540 --> 02:44:47,540
1-877-GAMO-L-R, our username on Skype, orange loungerio.

2786
02:44:47,540 --> 02:44:51,540
Just because it's been lighting up tonight and there it goes again.

2787
02:44:51,540 --> 02:44:56,540
You guys, some weeks we get no calls and then some weeks it just floods.

2788
02:44:56,540 --> 02:44:58,540
So I'm loving it.

2789
02:44:58,540 --> 02:45:00,540
Thank you guys for blowing up our phones tonight.

2790
02:45:00,540 --> 02:45:02,540
We've got another call on the line, though. Let's get to it.

2791
02:45:02,540 --> 02:45:04,540
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

2792
02:45:04,540 --> 02:45:06,540
Hey, Rob. It's Embryon.

2793
02:45:06,540 --> 02:45:08,540
Hey, Embryon. How you doing?

2794
02:45:08,540 --> 02:45:10,540
I am super great.

2795
02:45:10,540 --> 02:45:12,540
This is your first time calling into the show, isn't it?

2796
02:45:12,540 --> 02:45:13,540
It is.

2797
02:45:13,540 --> 02:45:16,540
All of a sudden we have all these longtime listeners, first time caller.

2798
02:45:16,540 --> 02:45:18,540
Well, how you doing?

2799
02:45:18,540 --> 02:45:20,540
I'm super well.

2800
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:25,540
I'm enjoying some wine and I'm playing Mother 3 for the second time,

2801
02:45:25,540 --> 02:45:29,540
but I've never actually beaten it before, so it's all kind of fresh still for me.

2802
02:45:29,540 --> 02:45:32,540
So I'm enjoying that and listening to the show.

2803
02:45:32,540 --> 02:45:35,540
And I couldn't very well let Obi-Wan be the only person to call in who had been drinking.

2804
02:45:35,540 --> 02:45:39,540
I was going to say, what is the theme tonight with people there drinking and listening to OLR?

2805
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:41,540
Are you in bed?

2806
02:45:41,540 --> 02:45:43,540
Maybe.

2807
02:45:43,540 --> 02:45:47,540
I would do this show drunk every day if I could.

2808
02:45:47,540 --> 02:45:50,540
I mean, let's see. I think my mic reached it far enough.

2809
02:45:50,540 --> 02:45:52,540
I mean, can you still hear me from bed?

2810
02:45:52,540 --> 02:45:54,540
Yes, we can. There it is.

2811
02:45:54,540 --> 02:45:57,540
It's official. There is a second phone call from bed. I love it.

2812
02:45:57,540 --> 02:45:59,540
Very temporarily from bed.

2813
02:45:59,540 --> 02:46:03,540
Mother 3. Why Mother 3 of all the games to attack?

2814
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:05,540
Because it's fantastic.

2815
02:46:05,540 --> 02:46:09,540
I live in Tucson, Arizona, and recently we had Camp Fangamer,

2816
02:46:09,540 --> 02:46:11,540
which was a little Earthbound convention.

2817
02:46:11,540 --> 02:46:13,540
I remember talking about that on the show, and I went,

2818
02:46:13,540 --> 02:46:17,540
how adorable is that? Because it's Tucson.

2819
02:46:17,540 --> 02:46:19,540
Yeah, I know, right?

2820
02:46:19,540 --> 02:46:21,540
That is so cute.

2821
02:46:21,540 --> 02:46:23,540
So I went to that a few weeks ago when it happened, and it was super cool.

2822
02:46:23,540 --> 02:46:25,540
And I've always been an Earthbound fan.

2823
02:46:25,540 --> 02:46:27,540
I have a Starman tattoo on my chest.

2824
02:46:27,540 --> 02:46:31,540
And so it kind of reinvigorated my excitement for the series.

2825
02:46:31,540 --> 02:46:33,540
And since I had never beaten Mother 3, I figured,

2826
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:37,540
now is the time right before the college semester starts.

2827
02:46:37,540 --> 02:46:40,540
I'm going to my last semester, so I'm going to be super swamped,

2828
02:46:40,540 --> 02:46:43,540
and I wanted to actually just get into it and dig deep.

2829
02:46:43,540 --> 02:46:47,540
So there I am right now, and yeah, it's been great so far.

2830
02:46:47,540 --> 02:46:50,540
Wow, Andy in chat saying, apparently Arizona is a theme too.

2831
02:46:50,540 --> 02:46:52,540
I called from Phoenix.

2832
02:46:52,540 --> 02:46:53,540
Oh, okay.

2833
02:46:53,540 --> 02:46:54,540
I had no idea.

2834
02:46:54,540 --> 02:46:56,540
Hello. Sorry you live in Phoenix. It's terrible.

2835
02:46:56,540 --> 02:47:00,540
I've been to Phoenix. It's a hot ass mess.

2836
02:47:00,540 --> 02:47:02,540
I can say that. It's a hot ass mess.

2837
02:47:02,540 --> 02:47:04,540
It is a hot ass mess. Tucson's not that much better.

2838
02:47:04,540 --> 02:47:08,540
But I went to the, oh my God, why can't I remember his name all of a sudden?

2839
02:47:08,540 --> 02:47:10,540
Alice Cooper. I went to his restaurant. That was pretty awesome.

2840
02:47:10,540 --> 02:47:11,540
Okay.

2841
02:47:11,540 --> 02:47:12,540
Anyway, what was I going to say?

2842
02:47:12,540 --> 02:47:17,540
Oh, now I want to make sure you get a chance to plug your stuff,

2843
02:47:17,540 --> 02:47:19,540
because our listeners may not know, but you do your own show,

2844
02:47:19,540 --> 02:47:21,540
and I want to make sure you get your shout out here.

2845
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:23,540
So tell us a little bit about the show that you do.

2846
02:47:23,540 --> 02:47:25,540
Well, that's not why I called, Rob. Come on.

2847
02:47:25,540 --> 02:47:28,540
I know, but I want to make sure you get your shout out.

2848
02:47:28,540 --> 02:47:30,540
Okay, well, that's very nice of you.

2849
02:47:30,540 --> 02:47:35,540
I write and podcast for rpgfan.com, so we run a couple of podcasts,

2850
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:38,540
and the primary one is Random Encounter.

2851
02:47:38,540 --> 02:47:42,540
It's on iTunes, and we have an RSS feed, and it's all there.

2852
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:45,540
It's a video game talk show, obviously, focusing on RPGs.

2853
02:47:45,540 --> 02:47:48,540
We just talk about news and what we've been playing and blah, blah, blah.

2854
02:47:48,540 --> 02:47:51,540
And if you're a big video game music fan like I am,

2855
02:47:51,540 --> 02:47:54,540
we also run Rhythm Encounter, which is like a video game music show.

2856
02:47:54,540 --> 02:47:58,540
And most recently, Retro Encounter started up, which is like a video game book club.

2857
02:47:59,540 --> 02:48:02,540
So if you want to listen to people talk about RPGs,

2858
02:48:02,540 --> 02:48:04,540
then we have many options for you.

2859
02:48:04,540 --> 02:48:06,540
It sounds like you have a competing network going on.

2860
02:48:06,540 --> 02:48:08,540
No, I'm just kidding. I think that's great.

2861
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:10,540
I'm all about supporting the indie podcast.

2862
02:48:10,540 --> 02:48:12,540
Well, the reason why I want to make sure you plug that

2863
02:48:12,540 --> 02:48:15,540
and knowing that you do the work with rpgfan is because

2864
02:48:15,540 --> 02:48:17,540
then I could ask you this question,

2865
02:48:17,540 --> 02:48:19,540
and maybe you can speak with a little bit of authority

2866
02:48:19,540 --> 02:48:23,540
because you've at least been following these games for forever and so forth.

2867
02:48:23,540 --> 02:48:26,540
But why do you think Nintendo is so effing stubborn

2868
02:48:26,540 --> 02:48:28,540
about bringing Mother 3 out to America?

2869
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:29,540
My God, I don't know!

2870
02:48:29,540 --> 02:48:32,540
I wish they'd just licensed the fan translation already.

2871
02:48:32,540 --> 02:48:36,540
I mean, obviously they're aware that the demand is there, right?

2872
02:48:36,540 --> 02:48:40,540
Because they just released Earthbound Beginnings on Virtual Console

2873
02:48:40,540 --> 02:48:46,540
and they continue to work with Sakurai to put Earthbound characters into Smash.

2874
02:48:46,540 --> 02:48:49,540
I wish I had a good answer for you.

2875
02:48:49,540 --> 02:48:51,540
I don't have any kind of super insider info.

2876
02:48:51,540 --> 02:48:54,540
I just think they're being stubborn as shit for no reason.

2877
02:48:54,540 --> 02:48:56,540
And it's about time they do something about it.

2878
02:48:56,540 --> 02:48:59,540
It is one of the most frustrating things in gaming,

2879
02:48:59,540 --> 02:49:03,540
but then at least at E3 they threw us a frickin' bone with the Earthbound Zero

2880
02:49:03,540 --> 02:49:05,540
and I was like, this is leading up to something.

2881
02:49:05,540 --> 02:49:07,540
Right, exactly. I was like, okay, here it comes.

2882
02:49:07,540 --> 02:49:09,540
Here's the real announcement, it's on the way.

2883
02:49:09,540 --> 02:49:14,540
It's Lucas in Smash Brothers is the thing they're ramping up to, I don't know.

2884
02:49:14,540 --> 02:49:19,540
And that also could be its own lead-in, but I don't know.

2885
02:49:19,540 --> 02:49:20,540
I don't know.

2886
02:49:20,540 --> 02:49:22,540
Was there something else you wanted to call in and talk about tonight?

2887
02:49:22,540 --> 02:49:24,540
No, I just wanted to say hi.

2888
02:49:24,540 --> 02:49:27,540
I thought I heard you hinting in another topic. Well, that's all right.

2889
02:49:27,540 --> 02:49:30,540
I appreciate the phone call nonetheless and being able to talk about Earthbound.

2890
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:34,540
I love Earthbound as well, but I'm going to tell you a secret.

2891
02:49:34,540 --> 02:49:36,540
I have never played Mother 3.

2892
02:49:36,540 --> 02:49:38,540
I mean, I'm not that far behind you.

2893
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:42,540
I got about halfway through it last time I tried it and that was, I don't know, five years ago.

2894
02:49:42,540 --> 02:49:46,540
So, it's okay, Rob. You can still do it.

2895
02:49:46,540 --> 02:49:48,540
Okay, I'm glad I could vent that and not be judged for it.

2896
02:49:48,540 --> 02:49:50,540
I'm glad this is a safe space.

2897
02:49:50,540 --> 02:49:54,540
But time is running short because if you haven't played it within the next six months, I'm going to judge you.

2898
02:49:54,540 --> 02:49:57,540
All right, I'll work on it. I promise.

2899
02:49:57,540 --> 02:49:58,540
Okay.

2900
02:49:58,540 --> 02:50:00,540
All right. Well, thank you so much, Embryon, for the phone call.

2901
02:50:00,540 --> 02:50:03,540
I really appreciate it and good luck with everything on your own show.

2902
02:50:03,540 --> 02:50:04,540
Yeah, thanks for having me.

2903
02:50:04,540 --> 02:50:05,540
Hey, you're welcome. Anytime. Take care, buddy.

2904
02:50:05,540 --> 02:50:06,540
You too.

2905
02:50:06,540 --> 02:50:07,540
All right, bye.

2906
02:50:07,540 --> 02:50:11,540
All right, sadly, I'm going to shut the Skype line down at this time

2907
02:50:11,540 --> 02:50:13,540
and I know there are still people trying to get through.

2908
02:50:13,540 --> 02:50:15,540
There's multiple people still trying to get through.

2909
02:50:16,540 --> 02:50:17,540
Please consider sending the show an e-mail.

2910
02:50:17,540 --> 02:50:20,540
Participate at orangewonstrategy.com or a tweet.

2911
02:50:20,540 --> 02:50:24,540
Or you can always go to our forums at thevognetwork.com and click on forums

2912
02:50:24,540 --> 02:50:26,540
and you can still participate with the show.

2913
02:50:26,540 --> 02:50:28,540
You can leave a comment on a past episode of the show.

2914
02:50:28,540 --> 02:50:30,540
Whatever. Send smoke signals.

2915
02:50:30,540 --> 02:50:33,540
We'll get you on the show one way or another.

2916
02:50:33,540 --> 02:50:37,540
But for now, it is well after midnight on the East Coast, after 9 p.m. on the West Coast,

2917
02:50:37,540 --> 02:50:40,540
so we have to start to wrap up the show tonight.

2918
02:50:40,540 --> 02:50:43,540
So, before I go around and get everybody's final thoughts,

2919
02:50:43,540 --> 02:50:45,540
we did run out of last minute stories, right, Loki? We're good?

2920
02:50:45,540 --> 02:50:48,540
Yes, and I've been watching videos of Grand Theft Auto 5.

2921
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:49,540
Oh, good times. Good times.

2922
02:50:49,540 --> 02:50:52,540
Well, before we wrap up, for realsies, we've got to go around

2923
02:50:52,540 --> 02:50:55,540
and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2924
02:50:55,540 --> 02:50:57,540
But I do want to say, of course, as always,

2925
02:50:57,540 --> 02:51:00,540
thank you so much for downloading our show or listening live

2926
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:02,540
or however you're participating with Orange Lounge Radio.

2927
02:51:02,540 --> 02:51:05,540
Just thanks for being here for the past three hours,

2928
02:51:05,540 --> 02:51:08,540
two and a half, maybe, on the podcast feed,

2929
02:51:08,540 --> 02:51:11,540
to listen and participate with our show. We really appreciate it.

2930
02:51:11,540 --> 02:51:15,540
We don't ask for your money. All we ask, help spread the word about the show.

2931
02:51:15,540 --> 02:51:18,540
Tell a friend or five about the show because word of mouth

2932
02:51:18,540 --> 02:51:20,540
is all we have here at Orange Lounge Radio,

2933
02:51:20,540 --> 02:51:23,540
and that's the only way our show grows is for you to tell a friend.

2934
02:51:23,540 --> 02:51:27,540
If you didn't like Orange Lounge Radio, well, you still made it to the end of the show,

2935
02:51:27,540 --> 02:51:29,540
so I'm hoping there's something you liked about it.

2936
02:51:29,540 --> 02:51:33,540
But I always say, even if you didn't like OLR, support indie broadcasting.

2937
02:51:33,540 --> 02:51:38,540
You heard our buddy there from RPG Fan. Maybe you'd like one of their podcasts.

2938
02:51:38,540 --> 02:51:41,540
Maybe you'd like one of the other podcasts on the Voice of Geeks Network,

2939
02:51:41,540 --> 02:51:43,540
vognetwork.com, or just something out there.

2940
02:51:43,540 --> 02:51:45,540
Just support hard-working, independent broadcasters

2941
02:51:45,540 --> 02:51:48,540
because there's so many people out there who don't get paid to do this,

2942
02:51:48,540 --> 02:51:52,540
who also don't get advertised on big podcasting networks and stuff

2943
02:51:52,540 --> 02:51:55,540
because they don't have money, so I really appreciate your support.

2944
02:51:55,540 --> 02:51:59,540
So go find, and you heard some shout-outs in an e-mail there as well,

2945
02:51:59,540 --> 02:52:02,540
so lots of suggestions for you guys this week.

2946
02:52:02,540 --> 02:52:05,540
So, all right, all that being said, now it is time to go around

2947
02:52:05,540 --> 02:52:08,540
and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2948
02:52:08,540 --> 02:52:10,540
And I guess I'll start tonight. I don't usually go first.

2949
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:12,540
So my final thought tonight is...

2950
02:52:12,540 --> 02:52:16,540
Ahh! Ahh!

2951
02:52:16,540 --> 02:52:18,540
Darsakra, your final thought tonight?

2952
02:52:18,540 --> 02:52:20,540
I really like cheese.

2953
02:52:20,540 --> 02:52:23,540
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2954
02:52:23,540 --> 02:52:27,540
Uh, I need to work more on my game this week.

2955
02:52:27,540 --> 02:52:28,540
Yes, you do.

2956
02:52:28,540 --> 02:52:33,540
And if anybody out there makes logos, I know, I know you do.

2957
02:52:33,540 --> 02:52:35,540
I know I need to send you information, Jamie.

2958
02:52:35,540 --> 02:52:40,540
But anybody else out there too, you know, I need one for my game,

2959
02:52:40,540 --> 02:52:43,540
for my company that I haven't formed yet, but I will,

2960
02:52:43,540 --> 02:52:46,540
because I have a website already that's been sitting there for, like, six months.

2961
02:52:46,540 --> 02:52:49,540
All right, Loki, get on that. I'm excited to play your game.

2962
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:51,540
You know, I still have a couple more VoG Jam games to play,

2963
02:52:51,540 --> 02:52:55,540
and I'm hoping for the very last one, I could do, like, the quote-unquote

2964
02:52:55,540 --> 02:52:59,540
world premiere, even though you've already premiered it on your own YouTube channel.

2965
02:52:59,540 --> 02:53:02,540
But that doesn't stop other websites from saying exclusive and premiere,

2966
02:53:02,540 --> 02:53:07,540
so I'm going to use that word here at VoG Network to show your stinking VoG Jam game already.

2967
02:53:07,540 --> 02:53:08,540
All right.

2968
02:53:08,540 --> 02:53:09,540
So I'm excited.

2969
02:53:09,540 --> 02:53:13,540
All right, well, that is going to do it for another edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

2970
02:53:13,540 --> 02:53:17,540
We will be back next week to talk about whatever should happen in the gaming world

2971
02:53:17,540 --> 02:53:20,540
in the next seven days in whatever games you're playing.

2972
02:53:20,540 --> 02:53:23,540
Have a great time playing video games out there.

2973
02:53:23,540 --> 02:53:26,540
Remember, treat each other with respect online, for God's sake.

2974
02:53:26,540 --> 02:53:27,540
Don't be rude to people.

2975
02:53:27,540 --> 02:53:30,540
And that's it.

2976
02:53:30,540 --> 02:53:33,540
Maybe I'll see you on the battlefield in Splatoon,

2977
02:53:33,540 --> 02:53:36,540
because I've got to level my character up so I can join a squad.

2978
02:53:36,540 --> 02:53:38,540
So I think that's on my to-do list for the week.

2979
02:53:38,540 --> 02:53:40,540
So have a great week, everybody.

2980
02:53:40,540 --> 02:53:44,540
