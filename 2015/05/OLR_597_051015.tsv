0	17360	This week, two months before the anniversary of its reveal, a Splatoon demo lands on the
17360	21000	Wii U, reigniting enthusiasm, complaints, and lots of discussion we heard last year.
21000	23720	We'll give you our perspective along with the rest of the week's gaming news, all
23720	26720	starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
53720	57520	And joining me here in studio to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer
57520	60360	lifestyle is DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
60360	61360	Hi.
61360	63360	How are you, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?
63360	64360	Injured.
64360	65360	Injured?
65360	66360	Because I'm stupid.
66360	71380	Oh my god, you're leaving yourself wide open for me to make fun of you, but I'm gonna really
71380	72380	bite my tongue.
72380	73380	I'm in a good mood today.
73380	75560	No, but how did you hurt yourself?
75560	76800	I walked.
76800	78540	My shoe slipped off.
78540	79540	I tripped on it.
79540	81000	So you tripped on your own feet.
81000	83000	I tripped on my shoe.
83000	84800	My foot tripped on my shoe.
84800	85800	You know what that means.
85800	86800	You need some shoes.
86800	87800	Oh my god.
87800	88800	Shoes.
88800	89800	Oh my god, shoes.
89800	92720	I was actually telling Dan that I need shoes that fit, because these are basically my man's
92720	97960	handles, and they're so comfortable, and they're just like, I'm just gonna put these on and
97960	102680	not care what I wear, and my man's handles tried to kill me, so.
102680	103680	All right.
103680	104960	Dan blames my watch.
104960	107520	Oh yeah, your new watch that you got?
107520	108640	Yes, my Apple watch.
108640	110400	The one that will poke you when you haven't moved?
110400	112800	It doesn't poke me, it taps.
112800	116400	It's like tap tap, it's time to stand.
116400	119880	Does your watch actually tell you, I love you, tap tap, kiss kiss, like the cat does
119880	123400	when I'm trying to sleep, the cat will come over and lick my finger, I love you.
123400	127960	You can actually, if you have somebody else who has one, then they can send you like their
127960	136560	heartbeat or draw pictures on their watch to send to you, and I just use it to harass
136560	137560	Dan.
137560	140520	Do you draw a big middle finger and send it to Dan?
140520	146300	I can't, he doesn't have a watch, but I, well he's not cool, how can you be with somebody
146300	147300	who's not cool?
147300	150000	He's cool in other ways.
150000	153040	That's because he has big feet.
153040	160400	Okay, let's move on to somebody else here in studio who has a very big brain, that's
160400	161720	why we call him Tech Master Loki.
161720	164160	I don't have big feet, but whatever.
164160	166360	How you doing, Loki?
166360	167360	I'm doing fine.
167360	168360	Yeah?
168360	169360	What's new with you?
170200	171200	I don't know.
171200	172200	Not much.
172200	173200	Yeah?
173200	174200	Just...
174200	175200	You sound tired.
175200	176200	You had a long week.
176200	177200	Oh, I'm always tired.
177200	178200	What are you talking about?
178200	179200	Kids keeping you up?
179200	185360	Yeah, we went and ate, well yesterday we went and had food at a Brazilian barbecue, so...
185360	187440	Did you go to that place in Roseville we were telling you about?
187440	188440	Yeah.
188440	189440	Oh, how'd you like it?
189440	190440	It was pretty good.
190440	191440	Yeah?
191440	192440	Expensive.
192440	193440	It is expensive, but it's pretty good, yeah?
193440	194440	It was pretty good.
194440	195440	You're in a food coma now?
195440	196440	No, I'm not really.
196440	197440	Not to eat the garbage.
197440	203000	They were trying to give me sausages and chicken and stuff, and I'm like, chicken?
203000	204440	I didn't come here to buy chicken.
204440	210360	I came here to eat all your top sirloin and keep it coming.
210360	211360	And that's what I did.
211360	212360	But I did try everything.
212360	213360	Nice.
213360	214360	Even the chicken?
214360	215360	Yeah, even the chicken.
215360	218480	Like, a few different varieties of chicken, like chicken wrapped in bacon, chicken...
218480	220360	Yeah, so did they have all the bacon wrapped, everything?
220360	221360	Because that's what always makes you happy.
221360	226040	They had bacon wrapped pork, I had bacon wrapped pork.
226040	231440	A filet, or bacon wrapped filet mignon, and bacon wrapped chicken.
231440	232440	Wow.
232440	233440	That's a lot of bacon.
233440	236880	The problem was that the bacon wasn't that crispy, so a lot of times I ended up just
236880	240320	pulling the bacon off, and it wasn't, it's just, it's salty.
240320	243880	Well, to cook it with the meat like that, you can't really, you know, crisp it up too
243880	244880	much, so...
244880	247240	Eh, you could try it harder.
247240	248240	Alright.
248240	254280	Well, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, voggetnetwork.com,
254320	258320	immediately after the Bobby Black Wolf show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, and
258320	263640	if you are listening to us live, you should head on over to our chat room at live.voggetnetwork.com,
263640	271080	and some folks commenting there on the watch, saying, let's see, Kaijuto, actually talking
271080	275600	about Jamie tripping on her feet in the shoes, saying, could be worse, they could have been
275600	276800	roller skates.
276800	279200	Well, luckily, you don't work as...
279200	280200	I'm not Roller Girl.
280200	282120	You're not like a Roller Girl at Sonic, or whatever.
282160	284560	I was thinking of the other Roller Girl.
284560	286400	From Boogie Nights?
286400	287400	That's not me.
287400	291800	Wow, your mind instantly, I was trying to think, like, who actually has girls on roller
291800	296320	skates, or guys on roller skates, who has those, like, anymore, and Sonic Drive Thru
296320	299720	is the only thing I can think of that actually still has that, so.
299720	304080	I can't think of a lot of environments where you wear roller skates still, unless you work
304080	305360	at a roller rink.
305360	306360	That might be another one.
306360	307980	Are roller rinks still popular?
307980	308980	Do kids have birthday?
308980	309980	I want to go to a roller rink.
309980	311880	I haven't been roller skating in, like, a year.
311880	315640	There, without giving out my address on air, there's one really not far from here.
315640	320280	So, wait, oh, oh, oh, wait, no, no, you can't talk in studio without coming on a mic and
320280	321280	saying something.
321280	324920	Come here, no, I'm serious, you're causing crappy radio.
324920	326000	Grab a mic here.
326000	327560	It's live radio.
327560	329320	There should be a yellow mic on the ground.
329320	330320	Grab that.
330320	331800	And here in studio, uh, joining us is Shane.
331800	336640	Just really quick, I was gonna say that little kids in elementary school have those shoes
336640	339280	that are also skates, and I still see them all over the place.
339280	340280	Heelys.
340280	341280	Yes.
341680	342680	I'm jealous, because those are amazing.
342680	345480	Don't, I wish those had been around when I was a kid, like, where they would walk in
345480	346480	and then they just-
346480	349480	All we got were light-up shoes, which are kind of cool, but not as cool as skates.
349480	353520	I am a little older than you all admit, but when I was in junior high, it was all about
353520	354520	pumps.
354520	355520	Dude, that was before my time.
355520	357520	Oh, that, that was the big, you remember pumps?
357520	358520	Yeah.
358520	359520	That was the big thing.
359520	365480	Well, it was either that or, well, that was the, like, right, and then the whole grunge
365480	368800	thing happened, and then it was all, everyone wore vans.
368800	369800	Everyone wore vans.
370320	374200	Like, the prize they got, like, the big kids got those prizes on, like, Make the Grade
374200	375600	on Nickelodeon and stuff like that.
375600	379360	I was like, I don't understand what you do with those, but light-up shoes were my thing
379360	380760	back when I was younger.
380760	381760	Awesome.
381760	382760	Goodbye.
382760	385480	Wait, wait, since you're here, I was just gonna say, you've got, you've put Alan to
385480	386480	work tonight.
386480	389040	Alan's here, and he's working in the other room on your new computer.
389040	391560	Three days now, we're, we're fine-tuning it.
391560	392560	So, so tell us a little-
392560	393560	It's just a baby.
393560	394560	Tell us about your new computer.
394560	395560	It's blue.
395560	396840	You splurged, you bought a new computer.
396840	397840	It's blue.
397840	398840	What are the specs?
398880	399880	There's a question people are gonna want to know.
399880	400880	What are the specs?
400880	404240	He doesn't even know the specs on the damn computer.
404240	409000	Four, three blue fans that light up.
409000	420840	Since I looked at it, you know, it's got, let's see, G-Force was an EVGA GTX 980, super-clocked
420840	426360	GPU in it, and I'm not sure of the processor, because that's under a chip, but they have
426360	430880	a, what was it, an Asus Hero 7 motherboard on there.
430880	436840	Alan, please speak for Shane, since he's dumb and doesn't even know his own computer.
436840	440240	Yeah, I was the brains, and Shane was the pocketbook.
440240	449000	Yeah, it's got the 980 GTX overclocked on it, and 16 gigs of RAM, which I think we got
449000	454400	at 1866 speed, which isn't the best, but we're trying to have a little bit of a budget.
454440	459120	The processor is the i7, I think, 4790 Intel, it's whatever the top one is, 4 gigahertz,
459120	462120	and no, we're not overclocking it.
462120	469520	So then why spend the money on the i7, did you do the i7K, or is it the, you know, just
469520	470520	the regular i7 one?
470520	472080	I think it's just the regular i7.
472080	473920	Oh, okay, that's like 100 bucks cheaper.
473920	477680	Let me ask this question, since Shane's not in the room anymore and can't defend himself.
477680	481560	Did he really just buy this computer for no other reason than to play Heavensward?
482400	484800	No, there are other games.
484800	488320	There was content in the base game that he couldn't do because of his little computer.
488320	491040	His little computer was like eight years old, so he's due.
491040	492600	Like I can't, we can't razz him that much.
492600	498080	I was able to run World of Darkness today, and I could get through it with no lag, which
498080	499760	is a first.
499760	504040	So it makes playing games harder though, because I'm used to compensating for that.
504040	505880	Will you play anything else on that computer?
505880	507880	I've already played Heroes of the Storm.
507880	508880	Okay, alright.
508880	510240	I've played several games with that.
510240	514760	Even hard to play because I'm not compensating for lag anymore.
514760	517280	But yeah, that's actually a really fun game now.
517280	518280	Fair enough.
518280	521280	And three bright blue LEDs.
521280	522280	Three.
522280	523280	Three.
523280	524640	That's the most important thing.
524640	526480	How fast does Tumblr load?
526480	527480	I don't know.
527480	528480	I haven't been to Tumblr.
528480	529480	Okay, alright.
529480	530480	Not you.
530480	533080	Alright, there it is.
533080	534080	Let's see.
534080	539840	And of course now it started a whole like, ACES rocks, fuck ACES, and this whole thing
539840	540840	in our chat room.
540840	541840	See?
541840	542840	You should have left it at three blue fans.
542840	545800	They're just like, oh, I gotta keep talking about it.
545800	546800	This is the internet.
546800	549480	Somebody in chat would have been like, why don't you get green fans, asshole?
549480	551320	Because green is ugly compared to blue.
551320	552320	They're arguing over her.
552320	557920	There's a lot of fans in green, but yeah, ACES is, see, because my last two laptops
557920	562400	were ACES, and they're good and they're bad at the same time.
562400	566760	It's like, they have pretty decent specs, but their driver support is fucking terrible.
566760	575580	For example, my laptop has an AMD APU in it, along with a dedicated Radeon GPU.
575580	583360	And if I want, it does like the dual GPU thing, but if I want to select only one GPU, like
583360	589320	to say, running just a dedicated GPU on it and not the one on the APU, fuck you.
589320	590320	You can't do that.
590320	592680	You can only run the one on the APU by itself.
592680	594480	The slower of the two.
595480	597280	What the fuck?
597280	598280	That doesn't make any sense.
598280	604480	Oh, hey, you want updated drivers for your AMD chip that we made specially for this laptop?
604480	605960	Fuck you, those are a year old.
605960	608360	So yeah.
608360	610480	But they make decent boards sometimes.
610480	613360	But then what's been keeping this going for like three days?
613360	619600	Like Shane's computer hasn't been working in three days, and one day was the hard drive
619600	621200	wasn't compatible or something?
621200	626080	Yeah, we needed to get a different hard drive, and there were just other things that weren't
626080	627080	booting up right.
627080	632640	And then yesterday, I don't remember, but there were things yesterday.
632640	640160	And then last night, my fans, two of my blue lights were not lighting up, and so I figured
640160	643920	out that the fans weren't working, a couple of them, actually five of them.
643920	647240	Well, heaven forbid your blue lights don't work, that's the most important part.
647280	652400	And to Ranma's question, how big is a hard drive, he has a standard hard drive and a
652400	653400	solid state drive in there.
653400	654400	Yeah.
654400	658840	Didn't you have like a three terabyte drive, and then what you're saying was like, I don't
658840	659840	know what this is.
659840	660840	No, and I took it back.
660840	661840	That's funny.
661840	662840	And that's it.
662840	667520	All right, I know we're spending an awful lot of time talking about specs on a new computer
667520	668520	here.
668520	672280	I'm going to be honest, it's kind of a slower news week in gaming this week, so we are going
672280	673280	to invite...
673280	675920	So just talk about the Konami hate, that's all you need to do.
676520	678400	Funny enough, we're going to get into that right at the top of the room.
678400	680600	Well, then maybe I'll say something, because it's fun.
680600	684200	With our kickoff topic for the third week in a row, I want to talk about that a little
684200	685200	bit.
685200	689200	But I just want to say, we had a great interview last week on the show, and if you missed last
689200	691080	week's show, you should go back and check that out.
691080	693760	It did make last week's show pretty long, it was about a three and a half hour show
693760	694760	last week.
694760	700480	So this week may be a little bit shorter just because we don't have as much stuff to talk
700480	703680	about tonight with as little as going on in the gaming world.
703680	707200	But we are going to open it up for you guys to ask your own questions.
707200	711200	So if you have questions and you want to fill our suggestion box with topics for us to talk
711200	713440	about tonight, or...
713440	714440	Don't do it via email.
714440	715440	I'm kidding.
715440	716440	No, yeah, don't do it via email.
716440	718080	Actually, you can tweet them to us.
718080	720920	For Ask Orange Lounge, send us a tweet at O-L-R.
720920	722760	But if you want to email me something, go ahead.
722760	725160	Yeah, you can also email Dark Sakura.
725160	729600	We'll take things in chat a little later on too, and you can ask gaming related things.
729600	733480	You can ask personal related things, as long as it's not too personal.
733480	735720	So we'll get into those questions a little later on.
735720	739200	Again, don't put them in chat right now because I'll lose them, but we'll ask for those questions
739200	740200	a little later on.
740200	744080	If you want to email us, you can do that.
744080	745080	Or tweet us.
745080	749800	Anyhow, so as I promised here at the top of the show, we could, for the third week in
749800	754080	a row, talk about this Konami and PT situation.
754080	758040	Now hold on, because I'm sure some of you out there are like, God damn it, get over
758040	759040	it.
759040	760040	Stop talking about it.
760040	762760	This is the third week in a row you're talking about the same damn thing.
762760	769760	However, you have to understand, this drama keeps unfolding by the week, and we have an
769760	772600	obligation to discuss.
772600	775960	I agree with that, I'm not over PT.
775960	776960	Some of us will probably-
776960	781240	We're having PTSD.
781240	782240	That's very accurate.
782240	786160	We are having PTSD.
786160	788160	So here it is.
788160	791880	The news that came out this week about PT, you remember last week?
791880	798760	Last week, once the demo was taken offline, there were some tests being done by different
798760	803920	websites that you could still download the demo as long as you'd flagged it on your account.
803920	806160	We all breathed a sigh of relief.
806160	809360	Those of us that don't own PS4s yet, thank God we still flagged it on our account.
809360	812960	I'll be able to check out PT whenever I eventually get a PS4.
812960	823480	And then earlier this week, JK, LOL, the file has been deleted from Sony's servers.
823480	827400	And even an alert went out to all the PT owners.
827400	828920	I got one because I have it.
828920	834240	An alert came in in the notifications menu in PS4 that said, this item is no longer available
834240	835360	in the store.
835360	839800	I'm paraphrasing here, but if you delete it, you will no longer be able to download it.
839800	847120	So in other words, back up your PS4 if you are interested in keeping that PT demo.
847120	849480	I wonder if there's a way to get the data off.
849480	852080	Well, you know what they say, hackers gonna hack.
852080	854000	So I'm sure they're gonna figure it out somehow.
854000	855000	And I would think...
855000	856000	Get on it, hackers.
856000	861720	I think it would be very easy to, let's say, I back up to my drive, and then I run the
861720	864200	restore on somebody else's PS4.
864200	870560	However, obviously, that would be tied to my gamer tag, or, oops, wrong console, whoops,
870560	873040	my gamer name or whatever, what do they call it on?
873040	874040	ID.
874040	875040	ID, thank you.
875040	876040	PlayStation ID.
876040	877040	But if it's on the...
877040	879320	It's a fucking gamer tag, it's just Sony's version of it.
879320	880320	Come on.
880320	884640	But if it's on the computer, and my account is flagged for it.
884640	886360	I don't know, because I think...
886360	887800	It's not gonna work, you can't do that.
887800	890560	Your gamer ID is like embedded in those files.
890560	893140	It knows, like if you go into the more, it knows who owns it.
893140	894740	So I think that's the problem.
894740	900140	But I would wonder if I sign into your PS4, then we could play it, but you wouldn't be
900140	902260	able to like always have it.
902260	907340	Anyway, Dungeon Buster says, I just got that message from Sony about PT when I booted my
907340	908700	PS4 today.
908700	911840	It is gone, and if you delete it from your system, it will be gone forever.
911840	916340	Sony thanks you for your participation, but we cannot compensate you for your tears of
916340	917340	sadness.
917340	918340	I have a feeling though...
918340	919340	He's paraphrasing too.
919340	923300	I'm pretty sure why it's removed though, like that, like it is.
923300	930260	Because it contains the likeness of someone now no longer licensing his likeness for said
930260	931260	event.
931260	932660	Yeah, that's exactly what it boils down to.
932660	933660	Absolutely.
933660	934660	It's the normal reader's issue.
934660	938400	Unless they did, you know, like a different ending to it, I mean it's not his face throughout
938400	939400	the game.
939400	940400	Right.
940400	941400	So...
941400	942400	But was his voice in it?
942400	943400	No.
943400	949840	He recut it with, what's his name, the fake VP that they had there for a while.
949840	952680	Or what about that frog, Pepe, the frog that's a tumbler?
952680	954400	Oh god, it'll be Frogger!
954400	955400	Fucking Frogger!
955400	956400	It's like, fuck you!
956400	961000	And there'll be frog fractions too, you know.
961000	966400	You also have to remember that in the statement after they pulled it, Konami seems to have
966400	970840	some sort of hatred towards it too, because they called it the embryonic Silent Hills,
970840	973540	like saying it never really got anywhere.
973540	977840	So I think they just are terrible people and should die.
977840	979400	That's pretty strong language.
979400	981740	Well, it's Konami.
981740	982740	They deserve it.
982740	984640	They aborted the PT.
984640	987960	I don't know how I feel about such strong language throughout the program.
987960	990840	I just, I don't think anyone should die, I just think...
990840	994840	Well the company, the company, if the company as a whole, not any specific people.
994840	998920	I don't think the company's gonna die, I just think it's, you know, they're just gonna do
998920	999920	their own thing.
1000840	1002040	That thing is not Silent Hills.
1002040	1006680	Well, it'll be just like, you know, they'll go the route of like Atari, where Atari's
1006680	1009180	just kinda hardly there anymore.
1009180	1013240	Maybe the next Silent Hill will be as hilarious as Driver 3, if that's the case.
1013240	1017860	You know what I want someone to do is I want someone to pull the data, and then make an
1017860	1020600	emulator that's just called PT Emulator.
1020600	1021600	You never know, anything's possible.
1021600	1024280	Or we can make a kart racing game called PT Cruiser.
1024280	1029560	Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying it's just a video game.
1029560	1032160	Nobody needs to die over a video game.
1032160	1034240	Ask Pyramid Head how he feels.
1034240	1035240	Just saying.
1035240	1037960	Alright, no, I absolutely agree with that.
1037960	1039760	Shane's just being dramatic.
1039760	1040760	Don't listen to him.
1040760	1043720	So you know how like, you know, in Silent Hill, a lot of the monsters and everything
1043720	1047720	are the manifestations of like people's fears or whatever and stuff.
1047720	1050460	So what about people being depressed about PT being deleted?
1050460	1053360	What exactly would that manifest itself in Silent Hill?
1053360	1056620	Again, no one has to die, just the company.
1056620	1057620	That's all I meant.
1057620	1060460	It would be the rabbit.
1060460	1066820	Well, corporations are people now too, so I mean, I guess it could...
1066820	1068820	Okay, enough, enough.
1068820	1076540	No more PT talk unless somebody's, we're going to have zombie PT that comes out from Kojima
1076540	1081180	and Guillermo del Toro get together at some future company and make a spiritual successor
1081180	1082340	somehow.
1082340	1083620	We'll see what happens.
1083620	1085420	Anyway, let's move on.
1085420	1088400	We're going to get into how was your gaming week and talk about the video games that we
1088400	1091920	have been playing this week, and then we'll get into the news.
1091920	1094020	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1094020	1096020	It was kind of eventful.
1096020	1098700	I played some Final Fantasy 14.
1098700	1105400	I played some, what else did I play, oh yeah, I'm still playing through Jaws of Hakkon because
1105400	1108940	I've had to take my time with it because of, you know, real life stuff.
1108940	1115780	And I watched the PT walk through eight times.
1115780	1118840	Did you burn a candle in memory and cry?
1118840	1123980	And I did some flipping off and screaming in disgust.
1123980	1126360	It's just a video game, Jamie, it's just a video game.
1126360	1129460	And I played a game on my Apple watch.
1129460	1131580	I played Tamagotchi.
1131580	1134620	The Tamagotchi on my watch sucked.
1134620	1138500	I mean, it was kind of cool because like, it's like the whole little egg baby thing
1138500	1143820	and it's looking neat, but the watch app version needs some work before I can play
1143820	1145640	any more of it.
1145640	1150300	But I did Shazam a bunch of songs on my watch and that was cool.
1150300	1154780	I played some Bejeweled.
1154780	1158580	I broke a million in butterfly mode, again.
1158580	1162100	They've changed Bejeweled so many times they have all these like silly modes and things
1162100	1163100	like I have no idea.
1163100	1164100	I love butterfly mode.
1164100	1171380	I sign in and it's like, get the new sparkle fart for 50,000 gems and then you can get
1171380	1177460	rainbow pooping for a hundred thousand gems and it will cause just unicorns to defecate
1177460	1178660	all over your screen.
1178660	1183940	The butterfly mode is actually really fun because you have like the jeweled spider that
1183940	1184940	eats the butterflies.
1184940	1187180	Okay, see what I'm saying?
1187180	1188180	Not that far off from the truth.
1188180	1189180	It doesn't make any sense anymore.
1189180	1190180	I know.
1190260	1195340	I actually like the music in that part of it because it makes me think of like almost
1195340	1197420	a fairy solitaire almost.
1197420	1202860	Why can't it just be matching three of the same shape and color with space background?
1202860	1204700	That's just not enough anymore.
1204700	1205700	That's not enough.
1205700	1206700	It's 2015.
1206700	1207700	Get with the program.
1207700	1212900	The butterfly mode is actually a really neat variation of the puzzle.
1212900	1214100	I've gotten pretty good at it.
1214100	1217300	Just that's all.
1217300	1218300	Was that a sparkle fart?
1218300	1219300	Thank you.
1219420	1220420	That's a sparkle fart.
1220420	1221420	Alright, it matches your shirt there.
1221420	1226220	She's wearing a reading rainbow shirt but it's got like nyan cat or something.
1226220	1227220	It's all pixely.
1227220	1228220	It's all pixely.
1228220	1229220	Love it.
1229220	1231220	I think it's supposed to be a book.
1231220	1232220	Take a look.
1232220	1233220	It's a book.
1233220	1234220	It's on her shirt.
1234220	1235220	Alright.
1235220	1236220	It's the butterfly book.
1236220	1237220	Let's move on.
1237220	1238220	Butterfly in the sky.
1238220	1239220	To Loki.
1239220	1240220	Talk of butterflies today.
1240220	1241220	I don't know what that's all about.
1241220	1242220	It's spring.
1242220	1247360	Alright, well this week I didn't play a whole ton of stuff.
1247420	1248420	More oculus rift things.
1248420	1253040	In fact, actually that headset makes a nice little indent on my face.
1253040	1256920	Looks like I've been wearing ski goggles or something like that.
1256920	1259040	So that's kind of fun.
1259040	1261920	I did play some stuff on my Xbox 360.
1261920	1268720	I finally booted it up to download Goat Simulator for it because Goat Simulator doesn't run
1268720	1269720	very well on my laptop.
1269720	1274720	I mean it runs okay but I thought, oh hey, they have an update to Goat Simulator.
1274720	1279280	I'm going to check it out on the Xbox 360 but come to find out they don't update the
1279280	1283480	360 version so it's actually about two or three updates behind.
1283480	1284920	Oh well.
1284920	1289180	But it's still fun and ran a lot better than it did on my PC.
1289180	1291520	So there's that.
1291520	1294160	And then, what else?
1294160	1297720	I worked a little bit on my game.
1297720	1304360	I was getting the cat animation, like the walking thing down, and I finally got that
1304360	1309240	working now but I had split it off into its own separate script and now I'm just kind
1309240	1314280	of incorporating it back into the script that once you fling the cat it stops moving, it
1314280	1316800	pops back up so it's standing.
1316800	1317800	So now there.
1317800	1321160	But it's ridiculously stupid.
1321160	1323400	The way it looks is just dumb.
1323400	1328840	I can't wait for everyone to see it because it's terribly stupid and I love it.
1328840	1330160	Well good luck finishing that up.
1330160	1331160	Can't wait to play.
1331160	1333320	Let's see, my gaming week.
1333320	1335760	Again, a lot of the same stuff I've been playing.
1335760	1339980	More Final Fantasy XIV, I finally got my ninja to 50 so now I'm working on my marauder for
1339980	1340980	no good reason.
1340980	1341980	Leveling that up.
1341980	1346120	I think I just want every class at level 30 or above and maybe if I have the time before
1346120	1350100	Heaven's Word I'm going to get them all to 50 so I can get that crown so I can wear my
1350100	1354660	crown everywhere I go and say worship me for the queen that I am because I play a female
1354660	1357020	toon in Final Fantasy XIV.
1357020	1360740	So there's that and I've also been playing Heroes of the Storm a little bit.
1360740	1363980	I hadn't played that in a while but all the talk we had about it on the show last week
1363980	1368420	kind of and the fact that I'd given Jamie a beta key and then I inadvertently gave the
1368420	1369420	entire chat room a beta key.
1369420	1370420	You know what?
1370420	1371420	I already had it.
1371420	1372420	Oh really?
1372420	1373420	I already had the beta.
1373420	1374420	Well there you go.
1374420	1376100	I mean seriously, does anybody not have the beta yet who doesn't want to play?
1376100	1377100	Who wants a key?
1377100	1378580	Rob gave me one.
1378580	1379780	I've got like two more.
1380460	1387860	I think it's to the point there's more keys than people that want to play but Heroes of
1387860	1391940	the Storm I had some fun with that and I just like playing co-op in that because it's way
1391940	1396700	less stressful in the PvP and people don't like lose their crap because in PvP people
1396700	1402760	get crazy and they say things that they shouldn't say and yeah it's just unfortunate.
1402760	1407100	So yeah I like to stick to co-op in Heroes of the Storm and that's plenty of fun.
1407100	1412300	Something new that I played this week as I think many of you around the globe played
1412300	1417860	for the very limited time that you were able to play it this week was the Splatoon global
1417860	1419580	test that they did.
1419580	1423740	If you've been watching the Nintendo Direct or were paying attention on social media you
1423740	1428380	caught wind that Nintendo released a special demo that was basically a stress test and
1428380	1434620	because it was a stress test for the multiplayer servers it was only open for a one hour window
1434620	1439800	three separate times and one of them was Friday night at eight o'clock our time.
1439800	1444620	Another time was at four in the morning and then the third time was I think at noon on
1444620	1445620	Saturday.
1445620	1446620	I think those are the three times.
1446620	1450380	I'm glad that they feel that three hours of preparation is enough.
1450380	1451700	Well here's the thing.
1451700	1456660	A I'm pretty sure each of those one hour windows was one for the U.S. one for Japan one for
1456660	1457660	Europe.
1457660	1458660	I'm pretty sure what.
1458660	1461140	Oh I'm sorry one hour windows.
1461140	1467060	But you know considering it was a stress test or whatever I got on there and I played and
1467060	1468140	it worked fine.
1468140	1472780	I played a few matches and I got to say I like the game.
1472780	1477380	I thought it was a neat little twist on the typical shooter variety.
1477380	1481820	The fact that it's judged not by necessarily how many kills you get and so forth but how
1481820	1485460	much paint you've spread around the arena for your team.
1485460	1491020	And of course I played the paint roller person as I think a lot of you were playing too when
1491060	1494980	you kind of figured out the paint roller was a little OP because you just run over somebody
1494980	1495980	and they're like done.
1495980	1498100	It's like you literally steamroll over somebody.
1498100	1501700	So that one was a lot of fun to play but I wonder if they're not going to be doing some
1501700	1505340	balancing issues last minute and looking at some of the feedback that comes out of this
1505340	1509180	test and doing a little bit of balancing before the game goes live.
1509180	1513180	But it did convince me enough that it is a game I want to pick up when it comes out.
1513180	1517180	I was a little bit on the fence but I had a good enough time where I was like I've let
1517180	1518180	me put it this way.
1518180	1521380	I've never come in first place in a shooter game until I played Splatoon.
1521380	1527580	I was like wow this is not a feeling I'm used to experiencing but that'll be fun so I'm
1527580	1528900	going to pick that up.
1528900	1532460	However just to address the elephant in the room this is something everybody's talking
1532460	1536660	about right now and has been talking about for a couple months with Splatoon is the fact
1536660	1539500	that there's no voice chat in the game.
1539500	1544380	And I have to admit it's a little silly that there's no voice chat and it's something that
1544380	1545380	the game could benefit from.
1546380	1552060	Think of the children that could hear profanity for the first time ever because outside there's
1552060	1554500	just no profanity.
1554500	1556580	Did we read Destiny for the same problem?
1556580	1559660	Because Destiny did the same thing out the gate for the same reason.
1559660	1561680	So let's get that clear for starters.
1561680	1562680	They're not doing anything different.
1562680	1564980	I think it's even worse that Destiny did it.
1564980	1570620	But Destiny realized that instead of the way they set it up what they should have done
1570620	1576580	is done opt-in instead of it's on by default so that everybody has to hear what could potentially
1576580	1579480	be you know bad language.
1579480	1583580	It's opt-in and when you're playing with your friends it's something that you can use.
1583580	1588280	And I really think Splatoon could benefit from that same type of model and it's really
1588280	1594380	hard to give the whole argument of well toxic people when it's going to be opt-in and you're
1594380	1598940	going to use it with your friends and that's kind of what Mario Kart 8 does.
1598940	1599980	Which works fine.
1599980	1604180	So I just again it's not like I'm not going to sit here and be all like I'm not going
1604180	1606940	to buy the game because it doesn't have voice chat.
1606940	1607940	Fine.
1607940	1609060	You can use Skype.
1609060	1610060	You can use cell phones.
1610060	1611980	Why can't they just like have...
1611980	1612980	But it's silly.
1612980	1617540	It's I mean come on I know there's a lot of Nintendo loyalists out there so come on.
1617540	1618540	Come on.
1618540	1622520	Why can't they just have like you know they have an Xbox of the parties where you join
1622520	1629340	a party with your friends yeah and you talk over whoa was this any game I want?
1629340	1630340	Really?
1630340	1634660	Or hey I could be in a completely separate game and I can still talk to my friends.
1634660	1637140	That's just like makes sense.
1637140	1640800	So why don't they do that?
1640800	1643180	Some folks in chat disagree on the voice chat thing.
1643180	1647420	Dar Tetsuya saying I didn't feel like I needed voice chat except maybe one instance where
1647420	1649660	I was pinned down with no way out.
1649660	1653980	Kaijuto says you can jump to where your teammates are and it has preset chat so it should be
1653980	1654980	fine.
1654980	1657940	And Act F saying yeah I didn't miss the voice chat.
1657940	1662640	It was you know in the stress test you couldn't play with friends.
1662640	1666340	It was a very bare bones and I understand they don't want to give it away they want
1666340	1669200	you to buy the game so I'm not like really like them out of shape about it.
1669200	1671620	It played very much like an E3 demo.
1671620	1675740	So it was just like you turn it on and you you get the whatever people you get dealt
1675740	1677060	in the random and so forth.
1677060	1680800	But I just like I could see playing this with friends it would be so much more entertaining
1680800	1685540	if we could talk to each other and talk a little bit of trash with friends would be
1685540	1690620	fun like not not to a disgusting level but you know I think I think that is an experience
1690620	1696060	that you know again it's in Mario Kart 8 so I don't understand why I can't be here.
1696060	1701260	I just I think that decision is a little silly and I'm sorry I'm not willing to just say
1701260	1711900	oh well I'm just you know I'm I'm it was a really weird thing to cut out anyway.
1711900	1716780	So that was the Splatoon thing otherwise that aside that's actually a minor complaint
1716780	1719660	in the scope of things because I do think the game you know played well.
1719660	1725260	I like the fact that you could have the motion controls turned off although I didn't find
1725260	1726860	the motion controls to be terrible.
1726860	1730420	I know some people were like I'm turning that off the minute I download this demo I'm going
1730420	1731980	in the option menu and turn it off.
1731980	1735260	I didn't find it to be so horrible once you kind of got used to it it was actually like
1735260	1739220	I felt like I almost had more control when I had the motion thing on than I did with
1739220	1742700	the thumb stick.
1742700	1747940	But I did find I was like constantly having to reset the camera because your whole motion
1747940	1755060	is just basically based on your default position for your holding the Wiimote or the Wii U
1755060	1759860	gamepad or whatever but that seems to always change when you're in the excitement of a
1759860	1764100	fast-paced multiplayer game so that's that.
1764100	1768620	And act-deft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying a lot of people love the motion controls
1768620	1772020	yeah I didn't think they were that bad at all so and darktattoo is saying I thought
1772020	1776360	the motion controls helped with fine-tuning your aim so yeah I would say if you were one
1776360	1779540	of those people that was like nope I'm turning motion controls off first thing because it's
1779540	1785940	a gimmick I would say hold up hold up give it a try try it once play through the tutorial
1785940	1790580	with it and then see what you think because you might be pleasantly surprised.
1790580	1794780	Kajudo saying it felt like a mouse yeah I think that's a good way to good way to phrase
1794780	1797020	it it felt like a mouse.
1797060	1801260	The one other thing that I played this week on Wii U was and I forgot this came out a
1801260	1807860	couple weeks ago but this is silly the amiibo tap game what's it called Nintendo's greatest
1807860	1813340	bits I think it's called and it's the amiibos I think it should have been Nintendo's greatest
1813340	1818460	biddies or something I don't know just show me your biddies their bits they're showing
1818460	1824780	us their lady bits and their boy bits their bits but anyway if you haven't heard of this
1824780	1829960	I think most of you have it's just a silly little free download where you can tap your
1829960	1836880	amiibo to the screen whichever ones you have and you will unlock three minute micro demos
1836880	1844020	basically from a random game but it's different scenes from said random game so as an example
1844020	1849520	the first one I did was my Mario amiibo I touched to the screen and logically what did
1849520	1855600	I get Legend of Zelda Link to the Past was the demo I got from my Mario amiibo but each
1855600	1861320	time you tap the amiibo to the screen it loads like a different save state from the ROM but
1861320	1866200	there's nine different places within the ROM so the first time is like the very beginning
1866200	1871360	of the game the second time you tap it you can I think it's the first boss fight with
1871360	1876880	all the little bouncing night guys that bounce around the room so you can play different
1876880	1881680	scenes from the game and the cool thing is the timer does reset every time you tap the
1881680	1885520	amiibo so you're not limited to three minutes for the whole thing so you can play three
1885520	1889160	minutes from each scene but if you want to play more than that of course please visit
1889160	1895800	the virtual console shop but my Wii Fit Trainer from Japan the one that Akuma JP got me thank
1895800	1900020	you thank you my Wii Fit Trainer gave me what I thought was the best one that I unlocked
1900020	1904520	I got Super Mario Kart from the Wii Fit Trainer and the reason why I thought that was good
1904560	1910720	is because it you can do an entire race in Mario Kart in three minutes so it's basically like you
1910720	1916120	tap it once you can play Mario Circuit you tap it again you can play one of the boo houses and
1916120	1921200	Rainbow Road of course is in there the only time I ran out of time was playing Rainbow Road because
1921200	1926040	the very last scene I think there's like eight scenes in Mario Kart and number eight is Rainbow
1926040	1935280	Road 150 CC as Mario and it's like the original Mario Kart didn't have drifting so it is really
1935280	1941120	hard I forgot how hard the old Mario Kart game is especially after playing Mario Kart 8 so much
1941120	1947600	but you know what for quote-unquote free I thought it was a cute little added value for the amiibo
1947600	1952880	that I already had you know it's hard to complain about something free I think a lot of times when
1952880	1958840	folks play emulated games and all that I think there's a lot of people that have the worst
1958840	1963000	ADD when playing those old games that probably don't play them for more than three minutes at
1963000	1967400	a time anyway so I think it's enough to get a little bit of a taste so I was like whatever
1967400	1974960	it's kind of cute it's cool act deft in chat says it was a neat concept but it failed not that bad
1974960	1981360	but not good either amiibo tap could have been something more like NES remix yeah that would
1981360	1986640	have been even better if you know not only did you unlock like the classic game but maybe it was
1986640	1991400	like a skin that you could use in another game or something where you can mix and match a little bit
1991400	1995520	I don't know I guess that'd be too complicated though for something that's kind of a free
1995520	2002160	concept that's essentially a demo for virtual console games but there you go all right let's
2002160	2007120	move on to some housekeeping tonight for housekeeping tonight I want to make sure at
2007120	2012440	some point during the show because it is Mother's Day after all today so a very happy Mother's Day
2012440	2019280	to all the mothers mother figures mother type people that are out there whether that be to
2019280	2028160	people or to our furry friends Happy Mother's Day to all y'all out there and of course I always like
2028160	2033080	to plug during our housekeeping segment our Twitter twitter.com slash olr and our Facebook
2033080	2039440	facebook.com slash orange lounge radio we will still be here for the coming weeks I don't think
2039440	2044240	we have a week off planned I am NOT going to e3 this year which we talked about in a previous
2044240	2052360	week so we should be here during those nights episode 600 is coming up though it will be if I
2052360	2059400	did the math right episode 600 would be June no may 31st to be the very very very last day of May
2059400	2066920	so we'll look forward to having you all here then let's get into some news tonight video game news
2066920	2073200	what little what little there is but we'll talk about it Loki so I you know I was reading this
2073200	2079800	I'm like Jesus like Sega to gonna be going their way of Konami as well Sega is not gonna have a
2079800	2087840	booth at e3 this year basically you know I don't know if it's not surprising but I don't even know
2087840	2091960	if they have what do you have coming out I mean I don't even know what's on Sega slate right now
2091960	2098760	because I don't know I don't even know what they have the Atlas stuff too right that was the part
2098760	2105040	I thought Atlas still had stuff coming so that's what kind of surprised me persona says Shane I
2105040	2110760	wonder if maybe the Atlas is having their own Atlas is its own thing I thought didn't I don't
2110760	2117200	think that Sega didn't buy Atlas out why am I yeah they did yeah yeah I just maybe they're just
2117200	2122920	running it as a separate thing I think they have their own booth Atlas usually did but you know
2122920	2128440	basically saying you know with the majority of our bigger bigger titles launching later in 2015 or
2128440	2133800	2016 perfectly particularly those from our triple-a studios relic entertainment sports
2133800	2138040	interactive and creative assembly we are concentrating our efforts for some of these
2138040	2144680	major announcements after our relocation because the relocating to Southern California
2144680	2152200	um so I guess I'm fine with that I don't know want to see what they have I guess what maybe
2152200	2156480	they'll make announcements but just won't show anything Atlas does have a booth by the way yeah
2156480	2163720	I said that show yeah and they kind of go along with that Sega has announced that they're removing
2163720	2173200	some of their back catalog games off of mobile and then list exactly what yet but some of them
2173240	2180000	are gonna be gone soon I'll be including both on the Google Play Store Samsung App Store Amazon
2180000	2188440	App Store and the App Store on iOS I heard down this is a quality related thing that they were
2188440	2194080	basically taking games that they believed were not good which was weird that you know well obviously
2194080	2197920	they didn't say it that way but that's basically what it means is that games that aren't up to a
2197920	2203160	certain standard or games that people were like this game sucks they're gonna just pull from the
2203160	2207320	mobile and they're basically cleaning it up so that way when you go visit Sega yeah on whatever
2207320	2211240	school here's here's how they put it they put it you know it is important for us to ensure that all
2211240	2215600	of our fans regardless of the platform or operating system have a great playing experience and after
2215600	2219960	evaluating our complete list of titles we have determined that a number of them no longer meet
2219960	2227080	our standards as a result we'll be removing these titles and in our chat there's some folks trying
2227080	2232200	to clarify the whole what's the Sega and Atlas relationship Rama saying Atlas is a subsidiary
2232240	2237720	of Sega and Game Guru says Sega owns Atlas but it's ran like a separate company kind of like
2237720	2242000	the relationship with Disney and Marvel and Lucasfilm so that's how it all works that's why
2242000	2247720	Atlas has its own booth but Sega doesn't but I mean hypothetically there still could be crossover
2247720	2252680	I mean you still see Marvel and Lucasfilm characters at Disney parks so you know there could be some of
2252680	2260440	that but I I get what you guys are saying so yeah and you know knowing that the PC stuff is gonna
2260520	2264160	have a big presence and Sega has been doing more and more with PC maybe that's what they'll they'll
2264160	2268960	show stuff I wish Phantasy Star Online 2 would be one of them but I'm not gonna hold my breath yeah
2268960	2275720	I just like it why does Sega continue to deny me Phantasy Star Online 2 I do not understand which
2275720	2282560	you can actually get with translation patches and I thought they weren't clamped it down said it was
2282560	2287480	harder to get in from a IP over here in the States not that I've noticed huh I thought there was
2287520	2293400	something of course I haven't played it in like a year or so I want to check it out be fun it was
2293400	2302360	okay it would just was more of the same well isn't that always what it was all right I mentioned
2302360	2306960	earlier in the show that I was checking out the Splatoon demo this week the little stress test
2306960	2312240	and very interesting kind of follow-up to that is that after the stress test was conducted on
2312240	2318280	Friday the game shot up to the top of the Wii U bestsellers chart on Amazon but then of course
2318280	2323160	that makes me go well if it's just the Wii U's bestsellers chart what exactly is the competition
2323160	2329960	right now not sure what else is but I guess it's worth noting that pre-orders are even selling
2329960	2336920	faster than say Smash Brothers or Mario Kart 8 or what have you so it does seem like it just it
2336920	2341840	does feel like I got that vibe from Twitter and social media that the demo was convincing people
2342000	2346680	if they didn't already have it pre-ordered okay this is something I want to get I didn't see a
2346680	2351600	lot of negativity about the demo out there that's just my perspective granted and the people I
2351600	2356600	follow on Twitter but that was the feeling I was getting as a reminder the game is out Friday May
2356600	2363200	29th so that's about two and a half weeks from now so we'll see how well the game sells sells
2363200	2368600	at that point is that this is a big thing for Nintendo because it's a new IP but a huge
2368600	2375600	important Wii U title so we'll see what happens big stuff mm-hmm big big big stuff big stuff I
2375600	2380560	want to play it but of course I don't have a Wii U yet well how about a little bit more news about
2380560	2386940	Nintendo they're actually offering their new a membership service is going to include non
2386940	2396520	Nintendo platforms they've included different things for tablets smartphones PCs and you know
2396520	2402760	there's another one on here listed as dedicated game systems now they also do of course include
2402760	2408920	their Wii U and 3ds and I think this is more just going into how it's they're expanding into the
2408920	2415680	mobile market so I guess Club Nintendo is going to be a little bit well I mean this is whatever
2415680	2422560	is going to be the replacement for Club Nintendo but they're really looking to expand yeah the the
2422560	2435040	game con the game system is an X which as far as I'm aware is still in development so all right
2435040	2441280	what do you think could be I mean is it just the tablets you think is whether it's spanning
2441280	2446560	he sees on it too huh yeah that would be weird for Nintendo to dip into PC that's not something
2446560	2450840	we've really talked about before I mean we've heard about the smartphone expansion but Nintendo
2450840	2462320	coming to PC yeah unless now remember the company that's partnering with Nintendo and I forget the
2462320	2471280	name off top my head the D day days crap I can't remember their name DNA so like that DNA the
2471280	2476720	company that's making the mobile versions maybe they are also going to have games that are on PC
2476720	2481920	or something and maybe they would join in so maybe like these partners of Nintendo could possibly
2481920	2486600	have the stuff on the PC that crosses over that could be it but I just thought that was a really
2486600	2491360	weird call-out like we all know that Nintendo is you know taking those steps and dipping their big
2491360	2496760	toe in the water with mobile but the PC part that kind of surprised me that is hear anything about
2496760	2504000	that this year at e3 I almost positive they said in fact this week not to expect it at e3 this year
2504000	2508680	so I don't know what we're getting at e3 this year especially with the whole Star Fox the whole
2508680	2515520	steam I feel like Nintendo's got our Fox more Zelda yeah more 3ds games I don't know I'm no
2515520	2521400	Zelda they said Zelda's not going to be at e3 this year remember okay well cool then my expectations
2521400	2528040	are even lower well hold on negative but remember Splatoon we didn't know about going in the last
2528040	2531760	e3 you know and granted it's taken us what 11 months to get to this point where the game is
2531760	2536880	finally out but Splatoon was nothing I mean you couldn't predict that at all like that was
2536880	2541320	something completely out of left field and new it was a new thing for Nintendo so I kind of think
2541320	2545600	that's where we're going with this e3 is that even though we're all sitting here going well it looks
2545600	2552120	like Metroid awesome I I wish that would be the case now the fanboy me would love the Metroid thing
2552120	2557360	to be true but I kind of think if Nintendo is playing with these new IPs maybe that's what
2557360	2564440	we're gonna see I kind of think one of those Miyamoto touch concept things maybe one of them
2564440	2569560	has been fleshed out into a fuller game and that's going to be a new IP that we see this e3 so I
2569560	2574160	think that's what is making Nintendo a little harder to predict this year otherwise I think
2574160	2579640	the 3ds I think you'll see a lot of push behind the new 3ds going to holidays and probably some
2579640	2587320	more games on new 3ds that will get people to buy the new system because it only works on the new
2587320	2595280	3ds but I fully expect at least bravely second and Final Fantasy Monster Hunter or whatever that
2595280	2600800	game was called I fully explorers then you have fully expect those games are gonna be 83 for the
2600800	2611800	western audiences we'll see anyhow let's move on more news Loki so talk about nostalgia but there
2611800	2617800	is a brand new Kickstarter yes I know Kickstarter brand new Kickstarter by the co-creators of Nick
2617800	2625760	arcade to create a new game show very similar Nick arcade they're calling it nth level and it
2625760	2633840	like the original series is going to basically merge they're saying like virtual reality with
2633840	2640160	like you know actual contestants and everything so filming it on the green screen they have like
2640160	2644680	these suits and everything they're wearing and so now they're launching their Kickstarter they
2644680	2651240	have a $350,000 goal and that's really just for phase one they basically create the sets and then
2651240	2656480	they're needing more money for phase two which I believe is doing the actual production and then
2656480	2662920	the actual art for developing the games and then for developing you know the actual broadcast TV
2662920	2672560	show but that's pretty awesome I don't know I I'm pretty excited to see what they do with that
2672560	2680040	well the only thing that sucks is we're all too old to be contestants now whatever you need to
2680040	2685040	raise your children to be on this show says it says right here it says it will be a team
2685040	2692760	based like the original where teens through adults of any age okay okay well then team vog
2692760	2699720	team vog yes I'd love that absolutely for your consideration it's kind of cool though they're
2699720	2703320	like talking about some of the other things that they're gonna incorporate with it like VR so
2703320	2711320	you'll be able to check out you know some of this I guess in virtual reality as well it's kind of
2711320	2717560	funny on you a little off topic though I was reading you about discovery digital doing some
2717560	2723800	VR stuff like the new season of Mythbusters are filming in VR as well oh really I'm like I like
2723800	2731440	that I'll check that out but I'm kind of curious to see how how this works and you know hopefully
2731440	2736240	hopefully they make their goal right now I believe they weren't sitting on too much from
2736240	2742440	what I checked last year just over just under $2,000 hmm so we'll see how much they have to
2742440	2753720	make $350,000 little boy so we'll see I don't know I kind of wonder though like I mean I don't know
2753720	2759120	what it costs to make a TV show but I think that they'd be able to do that cheaper than that I
2759120	2763160	don't know maybe it's because somebody has to build the programming for some of those like
2763160	2768720	games you know well yeah they have to develop the games but executives got to get paid well
2768720	2773000	they're doing three separate this isn't gonna be the only crowdfunding for this this is just for
2773000	2777920	phase one which is you know part of it I think they're seeing in their stretch goals that they're
2777920	2786840	gonna need what was like I think almost three million dollars it was yeah so the first stretch
2786840	2794320	goal is one and a quarter million dollars and that's where they're gonna be doing completing
2794320	2799280	the custom game development as well as having you know shipping full game downloads and box
2799280	2804720	games and stuff like that and then they're looking for almost two and three quarter million dollars
2804720	2811560	or more to get into the television production part of it I'd like a quarter of a million dollars
2811560	2817440	right now just to pay off my house payments I feel like we could do olr the TV show for like
2817440	2825880	250 like I mean two dollars and fifty cents like I just you know enough to buy us ramen to eat
2825880	2831840	during the show that's I have some in my car there you go there it is donate a thing of instant udon
2831840	2839040	we can all three eat it there it is oh now now you're okay with olr the TV show I have to be the
2839040	2845520	mysterious hooded figure you'll wear a costume to every episode that'll be I'll be what it is
2845520	2852000	what's up bitches I mean costumes you actually just you will be Freddy fazbear every week
2852000	2861120	sitting here stalking us and a pretty sweet short video I watched earlier today of from
2861120	2865280	five nights at Freddy's that someone did for like that almost like a trailer for a horror movie
2865480	2870360	it's pretty cool well if it's gonna actually become a horror movie I'm sure there's lots of
2870360	2876400	people there's lots of stuff on YouTube I'm sure official trailer click here and it's not the
2876400	2881320	official trailer okay I have to interrupt this for a moment college students wank project speaking of
2881320	2886440	horror flicks the new poltergeist better be fucking good I now return you to your regular schedule
2886440	2891540	are doing five nights at Freddy's for I mean I thought they were wrapping it up in three is it
2891540	2896460	you know we kind of go on Spaceballs two with this now where it's like you know we need more
2896460	2901940	money maybe it's the new it's the new generation well maybe it's in the future or like that was
2901940	2906940	at the the mad TV bit with OJ Simpson we almost caught him that time almost got the killer but
2906940	2914820	we ran out of money maybe it was close but we ran out of money tiger claws says in chat what
2914820	2921220	would olr the TV show be like I had a concept for one my response well I had a concept for it was
2921220	2926460	a reboot of Starrcade actually so I had it all written down that has nothing to do with the show
2926460	2931740	we do now but that's that's cool I kind of imagine olr the TV show would be kind of like Sabato
2931740	2937540	Higante because with the the tangents this show has like I would fully expect that like we'd be
2937540	2942460	sitting here talking about a game and then all of a sudden dancing tacos tacos come out on stage
2942460	2948660	and dance and and all that and then like random episodes of Monty Python's flying circus now we're
2948660	2954340	gonna do a random game show and then and now for something completely different here's a skit where
2954340	2958180	we're gonna make fun of something in gaming I think that's what the olr TV show would be like
2958180	2967060	to be honest we need Shane for a special segment Shane Shane's trying to leave no come here if you
2967060	2973500	were on an olr TV show would you be our resident complaining corner person that's you no I don't
2973500	2977900	complain all the time I'm nice I don't complain that much I just don't care that much I just like
2977900	2983780	it when you do complain because it's awesome well I can't complain more it's fun it's gonna be Shane
2983780	2987620	sits on the stump and bitches no you know what I'm doing whenever Shane's on the show you remember
2987620	2991820	and you can't do that on television ever somebody says I don't know they get slimed yeah I think
2991820	2996380	they say water you get one whenever somebody said that does not compute it's gray slime I think if
2996380	3001260	Shane says whatever he should get like a pie in the face or something no cuz there'd be constant
3001260	3008020	pie in my face I don't want that how about if Shane says whatever he has to eat a piece of pie
3008020	3013980	do I get to pick the no cuz then I'd throw up that would be a lot too did you explain the amiibo
3013980	3018420	thing we just did with my Pikachu and what you named it no you would tell the story because I
3018420	3026580	asked if you want to go for it no you are the worst radio get out of the studio he named it
3026580	3030100	whatever cuz he asked me what we should name it I was like whatever I don't care so he named it
3030100	3035300	whatever there it is because he had a pikachu amiibo still in the box he's like he's like tap
3035300	3038540	it and see what game you get so I was like well I have to register it what do you want to name
3038540	3043500	me goes whatever so I named it whatever and what did we get so we got Super Mario Brothers the
3043500	3049780	original I can just imagine that the poke a Pokemon named whatever whatever whatever whatever
3049780	3056140	that's better than like Mario Brothers you know like remember with the old DS games it's like hey
3056180	3062300	this game has a bonus Mario Brothers I I love the original why brothers though I really old
3062300	3067740	arcade machine it's okay but it gets so boring so fast it doesn't get a little repetitive but a lot
3067740	3074500	of the old games I should have this segment called Jamie reads bad fan fiction or just Jamie yells
3074500	3078420	out something completely nonsensical when there's a complete other just I would really rather it
3078420	3082740	would be Gilbert Gottfried reads bad fanfiction but you know that's just how it'd be great can
3082740	3088660	we afford Gilbert Gottfried maybe doing nothing without Bobcat probably has a podcast everybody
3088660	3096780	has a podcast no we need Gilbert Gottfried and Bobcat gold wait go go go wait do a debate oh if
3096780	3100820	something going on in gaming culture like they could debate I don't know gamergate or something
3100820	3104620	we get them on the show and do that that would be that would be great I'd be so appropriate to
3104620	3109620	that would be awesome it would be awesome all right we'll do that well just that's when we
3109620	3114220	become super rich and we'll just replace the cast for like our April 1st episode when these
3114220	3121460	years I want drag queen mud wrestling see what I mean about the nonsensical alright look back to
3121460	3126460	reality actually I can't believe this is a reality but you might soon be able to get in the game in a
3126460	3132740	whole nother way because Nintendo and Universal are teaming up for a theme park and this is not
3132740	3139300	fanfic this is something that's actually happening Nintendo and Universal are partnering together to
3139300	3143700	offer and this is a quote from their press release incredibly popular innovative themed
3143700	3148460	family entertainment experiences based on compelling stories and characters using powerful
3148460	3154540	storytelling and innovative technology it's a roller coaster and it has Mario on it essentially
3154540	3159660	that's probably what it's going to be but it could be I mean there's a lot of interesting things they
3159660	3164700	could do with this I mean I I love the idea of bumper cars as Mario Kart and you could actually
3164700	3172820	have shells but anyway what about like a little kitty area that's themed after Pokemon that seems
3172820	3178700	really likely you know like you know VR Mario Kart be pretty awesome you think like a full like VR
3178700	3183380	like yeah you just days of Thunder right you know like the arcade stuff where you sit down but like
3183380	3187180	you know how they have a really shitty arcade driving cabinets and stuff where you just sit
3187180	3191500	down like a box I want something it's like a go-kart but it's got screens around me and
3191500	3197580	stuff and so it's you know full surround and you're like launching shit at people and you spin out
3197580	3202100	when you get hit and stuff like that like I want it like that that would be pretty awesome I mean
3202100	3207820	it doesn't move or maybe can like tilt or something like that but that would be pretty immersive give
3207820	3213580	me that then I'll go to your stupid Park but I only like Universal like I know our Universal
3213580	3220260	Hollywood's like such a waste it's just like so small and say okay I just did a full 360 I saw
3220260	3225500	everything that this park has to offer I mean it's like that small well it's gonna the Harry
3225500	3231260	Potter thing they tore down the thing the place I used to do the MTV Awards the Gibson am to hear
3231260	3235060	what it was called the Gibson theater something that they tore that down to build Harry Potter
3235060	3242380	wizarding world here on the West Coast so yeah it's gonna get bigger yeah you're right over there
3242380	3249260	no no my wife knew about that and we're gonna go of course you are some kids will be just about the
3249260	3253340	right age and is it open this summer I don't know if it's open the summer but she wants to go for
3253340	3258860	herself she's like fuck that kids out of the way I'm getting my wand yeah it's like good for her
3258860	3266020	good for her I think I like the rides the I had a good time extra fur from courthouse and myself
3266020	3273180	and his partner we all went to Universal Studios and we rode the mummy and I had no idea what the
3273180	3277700	mummy ride was I was just like oh there's a ride based off the money Brendan Fraser like whining
3277700	3285340	about okay no it's a super fast roller coaster that goes forwards and then goes backwards and
3285340	3290220	extrovert I we had no idea what we were expecting we were like getting in the seats were like does
3290220	3294700	this thing say it goes upside down like what what is happening why are we having it oh like what the
3294700	3301260	hell did we just sign up for we get in the ride and it's like screaming like children at the top
3301260	3305340	of our lungs because you have to ride a roller coaster with extra fur at some point in your life
3305340	3311980	going a great America what ride were we on the grizzly or something where we're going downhill
3311980	3320220	and he's like it's killing me and there's like children around good times good times so we will
3320220	3326380	definitely have to take extra fur to the Nintendo theme park whenever that happens we'll see Bobby
3326380	3331500	Black Wolf in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says only thing we can expect our characters
3331500	3335900	walking around the park that would certainly seem like something they can implement rather
3335900	3341420	quickly and I want to say when Disney got the Marvel thing that was one of the first things
3341420	3348980	they did too is not only did they have the Iron Man thing at the interventions which badly needed
3348980	3353220	something new they started dabbling then they had Captain America in there and now I think they're
3353220	3358060	gonna shut it all down and make it all a Marvel thing I think is what I heard so that's you know
3358300	3363220	they were experimenting with the Marvel characters and then it was Marvel merchandise showed up in
3363220	3369940	the parks just as fast so I'm Marvel pin trading oh have we seen pins with Marvel characters yet
3369940	3373780	I'm sure that has to be a thing if it isn't already I want a Black Widow pin like you wouldn't believe
3373780	3378820	and I want a Scarlet Witch pin and I don't want any of the guys except Hawkeye I want one of Hawkeye's
3378820	3385980	butt anyway so I would expect the Nintendo merchandise will show up at Universal Studios
3385980	3393940	pretty soon uh you know they're running a room to build more stuff at Disneyland so maybe maybe
3393940	3398580	they'll build a full-on helicarrier to just add Marvel world to or whatever the fuck they're gonna
3398580	3403220	be more great I would love for Disney to do a thrill ride park but I don't know I don't know
3403220	3407260	if that would really be a thing but then again they do have some they have more thrill rides in
3407260	3412460	Orlando than they do out here I mean they have California screaming in Tower of Terror but you
3412460	3417300	know in Orlando they have the Aerosmith thing they have the Mars ride the test track seems like
3417300	3421660	they have more of a room can they like bulldoze some more stuff to like build more park I don't
3421660	3427780	know are they gonna add a third part Disney owns land for either a new parking lot or a third park
3427780	3433180	but it's not I think the tricky thing is it's not adjacent to the other two it's near the other two
3433180	3440740	so I mean and technically they could always take like the Toy Story lot and the employee
3440820	3445300	parking lot is a pretty big they could do something with that if they really wanted to and then build
3445300	3450380	another parking structure or something I mean do you know the ground make it also underground I
3450380	3454460	mean I know they have their tunnels and everything but it's true make it even deeper they don't have
3454460	3462180	that many tunnels though it California's make it full full-on like you know Hunger Games District
3462180	3470420	13 shit you know where that shit's going down it's so tons of room all right well we'll see we'll
3470420	3474340	see what develops with this in the coming years I hope you know I'm kind of sitting here going
3474340	3479300	things like this are gonna take a lot of time and I'm like am I gonna get to see this before
3479300	3485500	I'm 40 and the answer is probably not dark tech see it says how about a high-speed f-zero themed
3485500	3491860	coaster ha ha ha ha that'll never happen no no here's the thing is that the Nintendo theme park
3491860	3496020	it's gonna be something everybody wants to go to everybody's gonna want to go but they're only
3496020	3500660	gonna sell 200 tickets a day oh they'll have f-zero but it'll be one of those fucking kitty
3500660	3504980	merry-go-rounds you know the ones that they have out in front like the supermarkets and something
3504980	3510140	one of the Mario Kart vehicles will just have like a paint for f-zero on it that'll be it
3510140	3515420	you'll just you'll hear a big blue X in the background and that's about it in like a bathroom
3515420	3523580	or something like that anyhow to register participation for this week's episode of orange
3523580	3529940	on radio at vog network comm use the passphrase tune all right let's move on dark soccer you have
3529940	3536340	something else on a different note well this is sadness sad I need sad music Rob sad music but
3536340	3543940	who remembers reclaim your game I don't I had no idea it was a thing well reclaim your game was a
3543940	3550380	company that was supposed to be pushing back against intrusive DRM and working with different
3550540	3556620	companies to make digital rights management a little bit more palatable but they are shutting
3556620	3564420	down and here's part of the letter that was written all our YG wanted to do was fight for
3564420	3569460	gamers but most gamers don't care enough to fight for their rights her name is Lisa fan by the way
3569460	3574700	that started this most publishers and developers don't care about gamers enough to not shove DRM
3574700	3579700	into their games and force online registrations and online connections to release half-made or
3579700	3586340	badly broken games to not fill games with paid DLCs etc whatever we do it hasn't made a difference
3586340	3591460	to any of that so there's no point including with our YG I've given up my home and have been away
3591460	3595780	from my family for long enough I made some great friends along the way I've lost them too but now
3595780	3600700	it's time to say goodbye it sounds a little bit like a rage quit to me which you know and I don't
3600700	3607260	I don't mean to sound disrespectful or whatever like I I totally get it like you pour so much into
3607300	3611260	something and then it just seems like you're you're spinning in circles or whatever that could
3611260	3616100	be extraordinarily frustrating so like I don't mean a little bit it does kind of sound like this
3616100	3623900	whole like I'm just I'm I quit I walk away I'm done people honestly if it requires effort the
3623900	3631220	average person doesn't want to do anything that's just how the world is and I I honestly I did I did
3631220	3638660	think they were doing a really good thing it's just that it's people just sitting by and accepting
3638660	3644480	that that's how thing is and the fact that there's more people willing to accept it then I would be
3644480	3648900	angry at the same thing too well I was trying to aim for something that I thought would make things
3648900	3654620	better for everybody I think there has to be more people out there not willing to have thing if you
3654620	3659820	feel really strongly that such-and-such game is doing something that's setting gaming backwards
3659940	3665140	you have to not buy it and you have to make sure other people understand you know what's going on
3665140	3669780	and why you're not buying it so they can make an educated decision for themselves as well you know
3669780	3676780	and I I would actually argue and some would disagree with me but that's fine that's what we
3676780	3682980	do on this show I would say that this type of thing about I'm not gonna support so-and-so is
3683500	3690060	kind of exhibited by what happened with the Xbox one when the Xbox one announced that you know the
3690060	3695060	discs were gonna be tied to the console and they that used games were gonna be a thing I mean they
3695060	3701060	paid the price for that and that console didn't sell and I would say in that regard this site has
3701060	3705620	something to celebrate I mean it sounds really weird to say to celebrate a failure so I'm not
3705620	3712020	sure I feel weird phrasing it that way but I think they were more talking about the fact that
3712140	3720580	there's still especially in terms of a PC gaming there's still way too much of the shit going on
3720580	3726700	sure but I'm just saying like at the end of the day the the wallet speaks the loudest and you know
3726700	3731420	Microsoft had to backpedal on a lot of that and change some things when they you know we're we're
3731420	3734460	really seeing where people were putting their money in their pre-orders when it was coming down
3734460	3738180	between PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and you know obviously there were other things that came into
3738180	3746660	play as well but at the end of the day if you really strongly believe something is wrong then
3746660	3751380	you have to not buy it no matter how much the other cool kids are getting it you have to really
3751380	3758900	resist that so going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com game guru says people don't
3758900	3769300	want nice DRM they want DRM free or Steam's DRM actf says isn't Steam nice DRM so and some folks
3769300	3773580	talking about good old games galaxy which I do have a story coming up on this later but I'll
3773580	3779460	entertain this now saying zero DRM for all the games they offer and they're using Witcher 3 as
3779460	3784740	a big launch title to help promote it and we'll talk more about the open beta for that a little
3784740	3790740	later in the show but yeah I don't I mean I don't know you know I don't know what specifically this
3790740	3794900	you know because again I really didn't know about this website until the story came up tonight so I
3794900	3799460	don't know what specific movements this thing was targeting but I think there are some success
3799460	3803620	stories out there as far as you know the gamers being heard about things that they don't like and
3803620	3809340	I can tell you nothing ticks me off more than when a company gets up there on stage and announces
3809340	3815460	some type of BS thing about you know more DLC and they say this is what the consumers want because
3815460	3820300	they're telling me this is what I want and then sitting there going no this is not what I want
3820300	3826940	you're wrong and that like nothing turns me off on a game or a product faster to be fair anyway
3826940	3831660	let's travel around the world and check out some release dates some games that you can choose to
3831660	3837300	buy or not buy coming out soon there's a whole lot this week this week it's basically Final Fantasy
3837300	3846660	X or 10 and 10 to HD limited edition on PlayStation 4 and project cars on PlayStation 4 and Xbox one
3846660	3854900	that's it awesome traveling over to Japan honestly it's it's pretty slow over there as well but there
3854900	3860220	are a few things coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 4 on May the 14th they are also
3860220	3866460	getting the 10 and 10 to HD remaster in Japan also the Borderlands double deluxe collection
3866460	3870180	at least that's what they're calling it in Japan I imagine this is the same thing that we got with
3870180	3875020	handsome Jack it's just called double deluxe there in Japan those are both coming out on the
3875020	3881500	14th on PlayStation 4 Xbox one also getting the Borderlands collection but not the Final Fantasy
3881500	3886020	you know I was just kind of looking ahead here just just to take us completely out of topic here
3886020	3891460	okay I just noticed that there's actually a new Hatsune Miku game that's coming to the 3ds in a
3891460	3898900	couple weeks that you might be interested in yeah project Mirai DX that is actually a US release
3898900	3904620	so that's coming out not just in Japan but in the US as well yeah so yeah and that's a Sega release
3904620	3908060	that's something they could be showing me through oh well I guess it's gonna come out before III so
3908060	3914740	maybe not maybe not project future yeah so yeah I'd I'd be curious about that sure I like I like
3914740	3921380	Hatsune Miku those games are fun why not nothing to mention on the Wii U but Splatoon is getting
3921380	3927140	its Japanese release on May the 28th so essentially getting it right about the same time we are I will
3927140	3933620	mention though on the Vita there's actually nothing until the 21st so this week is actually kind of
3933620	3939380	quiet on the Vita which is a change for Japan but on the 3ds this week codenamed steam Lincoln
3939380	3943860	vs. alien I think I mentioned this last week and there was like nothing coming out but codenamed
3943860	3947460	steam is coming out in Japan this week and I love the title over there has a different name
3947460	3953460	Lincoln vs. alien Japan there it is Japanese releases how about the UK dark Sakura on the

3989060	3994980	remaster so those are both coming out there you go just a couple more stories for you guys and
3995140	4001060	then the classic game of the week Loki all right and so this week there was the big announcement
4001060	4006500	that well I mean we kind of knew like a time frame sort of but it's been officially announced
4006500	4015620	that the oculus rift consumer edition will be hitting stores early 2016 and they kind of showed
4015620	4022420	off what the prototype or the prototype the actual final version looks like on their website
4022420	4029300	it's interesting I don't know it looks definitely more comfortable than the one I'm been using but
4030180	4035220	it should be giving us some more information regarding specs and that sort of thing this
4035220	4044660	week actually but for now they've been just you know saying more to come I'm excited I I can't
4044660	4049380	wait to pick up the consumer version of one of these I'm hoping it's a reasonable amount of money
4049380	4054100	it's the one thing that I'm concerned about but ditto and and also that I have a computer that's
4054660	4057780	fast enough to run it by then though I'd hope that I would have built my new
4058740	4065620	computer by then you know we'll see uh all right lastly uh for this half of the show before we get
4065620	4071140	to the classic game of the week let's talk about HD remasters you know um Loki mentioned and
4071140	4075300	actually we all mentioned because I think it's worldwide this week the Final Fantasy 10 remaster
4075300	4080660	makes its way to the PlayStation 4 this week after last year's PlayStation 3 remaster
4080660	4089460	well Capcom is looking into doing more HD remasters of popular older games this was when
4089460	4093300	they were talking about their financial results as we had a few companies report those this week
4093300	4098020	we'll talk about through the night and they were talking about that they plan to quote utilize
4098020	4104500	existing intellectual property such as by selling HD remastered versions of popular older games
4104500	4110740	during this fiscal year um of course we know Devil May Cry Definitive Edition and Resident Evil HD
4110740	4115060	came out during the last financial year uh and there's supposed to be a PlayStation 4
4115060	4122260	Xbox One and PC remaster of Devil May Cry 4 for this summer could there be more uh apparently
4122260	4128100	Resident Evil 0 from the GameCube is rumored to be in development but nothing has been confirmed
4128100	4132020	um so who knows you could have more Resident Evil games I'm sure there's a lot of people
4132020	4138100	foaming at the mouth going Mega Man you sons of bitches Mega Man you know the last Mega Man
4138100	4141780	collection wasn't that bad actually that was really awesome despite the whole like I think
4141780	4145860	there was like a button mapping issue on GameCube or something but I mean it was a really good uh
4145860	4151540	collection so it'd be nice to see something like that I wouldn't mind them doing an HD version of
4151540	4157460	you know Mega Man Legends but I just don't think that that's ever gonna happen oh yeah well you
4157460	4163140	know we had the um and it's not on our show world tonight but uh that really rare Adventures of
4163140	4171300	Tron Bond game um is out uh now on PlayStation and you can get it for like seven dollars I think
4171300	4177060	maybe five seven dollars um and this was something that it was so rare it was getting like 200 on
4177060	4182420	eBay at one point that's really cool I just wish that they would fucking have that support for the
4182420	4186980	PlayStation 4 you know so I could play these PlayStation 4 PlayStation 2 games really or
4186980	4191380	PlayStation 1 PlayStation 2 games where the hell is that that would that was like I'm sorry the
4191380	4195780	PlayStation 3 is powerful enough to do that PlayStation 4 just completely different
4195780	4201780	architecture yes I understand that but to be fair they did have a software emulator running on the
4201780	4206580	PlayStation 3 for PlayStation 1 games I understand that maybe a little bit too difficult for PlayStation
4206580	4212740	2 although they did do it on the PlayStation 3 I'm just thinking that they could probably work
4212740	4218020	up something maybe maybe that's something in the can for E3 I would I thought PlayStation now was
4218020	4223700	how they're but I don't want to stream that shit I know I know I would rather download it and be
4223700	4231540	able to play it yeah uh game guru in chat says Mega Man anniversary collection HD with Mega Man
4231540	4238580	and base Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10 now and Eric RPG correct me on the name it's the misadventures
4238580	4242980	of trauma I I knew I was screwing up the name but I couldn't remember the official title I hadn't
4242980	4249940	played it so or you know let's say okay Mega Man there's you know no one's really going to do
4249940	4256740	Mega Man okay Power Stone give me some fucking Power Stone that that series has been dormant
4257540	4263860	too boom done they did it on PSP let's let's do it again a million dollars on Kickstarter instantly
4263860	4270900	do it why not all right let's uh let's take a trip down memory lane they have to have the same
4270900	4277540	announcer if they can get them sure why not all right well let's oh yeah a new Power Stone fuck
4277540	4281540	just a new Power Stone game my new Power Stone game hey anything's possible you never know
4281540	4286660	all right well we are going to take a trip down memory lane because every week here on the show
4286660	4290420	Dark Sakura steps into the vault and finds a game that she thinks hey
4290420	4293540	you guys out there you should be playing this game this week
4294900	4301220	it's a segment we call the classic video game of the week Dark Sakura did one last week that I
4301220	4305700	think everybody in the world has already played but needed to be acknowledged at some point here
4305700	4311220	on the show indeed this week I'm not so sure this way I think it's a great game no but that's okay
4311220	4315380	I'm just saying we sometimes we do mainstream sometimes we do obscure and this one is a little
4315380	4319940	more obscure I think but it's a very everybody knows the franchise I just don't think they know
4319940	4324740	the game because it's like my second favorite game series ever let's get to it what is the classic
4324740	4331300	game of the week Fantasy Zone The Maze or as it was known in Japan Opa Opa after the little
4331860	4339780	winged spaceship of adorableness um this one it was published by Sega in 1987 in the arcades
4340420	4347620	um it came out on home console for the Sega Master System some fans call it Fantasy Zone 3 but that
4347620	4355300	is a misnomer this is actually not a uh shooter the way that Fantasy Zone was or as I'd be pissed
4355300	4362180	if this was Fantasy Zone 3 it's it's a spin-off thing well as I was gonna say it's also not in
4362260	4370500	the cute em up genre although it is adorable um it's a maze game where it plays I mean basically
4370500	4376180	you can't say maze game without comparing it to pac-man but instead of the dots you get different
4376180	4381860	coins so you can spend them for your power-ups in the game um or like or in the shop before the
4381860	4387300	stage starts you know how in Fantasy Zone you get all the little um places to get the uh the goodies
4387300	4394900	and um you uh the enemies will spawn in there and it's all the same enemies from Fantasy Zone
4395780	4403460	um you also if you don't catch a particular they will spawn by a dot and if it's completely red
4403460	4409860	and energy will spawn but you can pass through the dot and it makes the dot recolor so um you
4409860	4415780	can also pick up different power-ups um hanging out at different points like uh you can get the
4415780	4420340	invincibility rocket that lets you shoot all the way through things or you can get you know
4420340	4426980	the little blaster or you can get the big wing um and then after you get all of the tiny coins
4426980	4433780	all the enemies turn into big coins and you can catch them um but uh you can also play two player
4433780	4439220	where you have two separate characters you get oppa oppa and you get oppa oppa which is the blue uh
4439220	4446900	version of oppa oppa uh i you know i have uh um uh oppa oppa on my cubicle ball
4446900	4453140	oh fun made out of the little uh pearlers things um so yeah the only versions of these that have
4453140	4460260	ever come out apart from the Sega Master System uh version there was a system uh e version as
4460260	4466740	well and then there was the Fantasy Zone complete collection for ps2 it's just a real it's really
4466820	4471940	a simple game but of course all the music in it is if you can turn it up a little bit it's all
4471940	4476580	all i hear are the ding ding dings of the uh things getting picked up here i'll turn it up
4483380	4491060	sees all the music from the previous games yeah so uh on top of that now this is one of the
4491060	4497540	Master System games that Dan and I discovered had the FM chip uh compatibility with it um when
4497540	4503860	we plugged it in Dan picked up a uh power base converter that includes the FM chip set in it
4504580	4510420	and uh it actually really does just sound pretty amazing it's another one of those games like
4510420	4514740	R-Type was another really good one that sounds so much better with the FM chip so
4515300	4518420	uh that's it Fantasy Zone The Maze that's the classic game
4520100	4525300	go play it everybody now right now drop everything you're doing we have a break

4602020	4607700	little bit slower of a gaming news week as e3 is uh really a month away at this point
4607700	4611540	and i think you're going to start to see after memorial day uh all the companies are going to
4611540	4615460	start to flood us with the news of what we're going to be seeing at e3 and then of course the
4615460	4620020	surprises that come out of the show so of course we'll be here at olr every sunday night over the
4620020	4625300	next couple months to discuss uh what is going on with all of you and uh share some opinions and
4625300	4630740	maybe encourage you to think differently about some things uh anyway let's get into the forum
4630740	4634820	feedback we had to skip this segment for time last week but i want to get into tonight's forum
4634820	4643780	feedback uh every week we invite you guys to continue the conversation on our forums over
4643780	4649460	at vog network.com forums which you can also access from the main menu of vog network.com
4649460	4655140	and olr has its own forum and if you want to post a follow-up topic there or something you'd like us
4655140	4660100	to get into on a later episode of the show the movie didn't get into in depth enough for you
4660100	4667620	uh we can do that and sometimes over there we get follow-ups as well such as we got a follow-up
4667620	4673460	um to a post from several weeks ago which had to do with the whole and i called this the quote
4674420	4680660	the bimani issue and uh this was the one remember yyr did a whole little like correspondent thing
4680660	4685300	he did a very good job with that and this was talking about the issue where um konami had shut
4685300	4691300	down uh that service that was allowing beatmedia 2dx machines to run in the us and there was talk
4691300	4696020	about the emu service going global and all this other stuff well yyr wanted to give us an update
4696020	4699380	on this and he posted that last week and i didn't get around to reading it on last week's show
4699380	4704740	because of um we ran really long last week but why i want to give us an update saying yesterday
4704740	4709780	konami updated their announcement regarding e amusement global service of course they did it in
4709780	4715620	japanese here's the google translate this website and so he apologized because it's coming through
4715620	4720340	google translate so it's going to sound really like non-grammatically correct this website but
4720340	4725380	had we have been the service subject to japan only this time we will start the service delivery of
4725380	4730100	e amusement site towards the countries and regions other than japan e amusement service
4730100	4736100	target area of the arcade game is not changed to the conventional april 27th 2015 from countries
4736100	4741140	and regions other than japan are not available the site and paid services please understand april 27
4741140	4747300	2015 so unfortunately it appears that there are no plans to offer e amusement service outside of asia
4747300	4752900	right now thus for the foreseeable future round one will be the only place where we can play
4752980	4758900	current bamani games in north america sigh with the official silent hills cancellation and they're
4758900	4764180	voluntarily delisting from the new york stock exchange it really seems that konami wants little
4764180	4769540	due with north america anymore outside of the mobile games market it looks like their 2015
4769540	4775780	strategy and planning referenced above is coming on along as scheduled and what yyr is referencing
4775780	4780020	is a slide i'm sure you've seen around the internet and twitter it's a fun little photoshop
4780020	4785460	where someone's doctored a konami internal use only slide that says 2015 strategy and planning
4786020	4792660	fuck hideo kojima fuck metal gear fuck silent hill fuck it and fuck you there it is
4794100	4799140	but i don't see fuck pachinko in there anywhere people pachinko it's the future
4800260	4803300	all right there it is for the forum follow-up this week if you have more i want to continue
4803300	4808420	the conversation you can over at the vog network forums meanwhile let's get into some rapid fire
4808420	4815860	news tonight loki all right um so this is not going to be a surprise to anyone but hey minecraft
4815860	4822340	still selling and uh on microsoft platforms including the you know the xbox um xbox one
4822340	4829940	or xbox 360 xbox one 20 million copies it's moved already that's ridiculous and to kind of
4830980	4835140	commemorate that they also have some birthday skin packs that they're offering for free
4836100	4841860	so go check it out if you haven't already i gotta actually pick that up on ps4 i'm meaning to do
4841860	4849380	that so i probably will do that um as i mentioned this week i had played some goat simulator why
4849380	4854660	did i play some goat simulator because i just heard that they did an update to goat simulator
4855380	4863700	to bring us goat z it's free dlc and it's basically um thought for a minute there he said
4864020	4872100	goat say no goat z like daisy you know thank you um so goat z is kind of poking fun at other
4873380	4881700	zombie survivor um crafting games since there's a ton of them on steam early access and so you know
4882660	4888820	basically you can craft stuff you survive um against zombies you can turn people into zombies
4889540	4899700	all that fun stuff and um it is i believe uh a free dlc although they're saying though goat
4899700	4906580	z will release on windows mac and linux may 7th for 4.99 so maybe i have to download that again
4907540	4914260	but um yeah that's pretty awesome so go check that out if you haven't already and with that
4914900	4923380	goat simulator um decided that it would be nice and add kojima and kojima productions
4923380	4929140	to their special thanks section on their credits for goat simulator basically say me
4929140	4934260	adeo kojima kojima productions and silent hills pt please bring it back pretty please
4936660	4943300	so i think that's pretty cool even even people who make games are begging for pt to not go away
4943380	4950340	that's great exactly and then also uh yet another strange game that has even stranger dlc
4952180	4960020	i am bread has spaceships now thanks to may the fourth and this it's in the new expansion
4960020	4968180	called starch wars which obviously is a parody on star wars and i don't know but that's pretty
4968260	4972500	pretty good though i was wondering what that update was but um i'll have to check it out
4974020	4980260	all right awesome uh i have some other news for you guys one of them has to do with ea you know
4980260	4985220	we talked about a lot of financial information came through this week and ea gave a presentation
4985220	4992100	which in part actually showed some of their fiscal year 2016 announced console and pc titles and when
4992100	4997140	they're coming out so for the second quarter and remember this is for the fiscal year so
4997140	5002420	fiscal year is usually end what in april so uh when we talk about quarter two this is going to
5002420	5010740	be like towards the end of the year uh we have uh fifa madden nhl rory mcgillroy pga tour those
5010740	5016420	are all you know sports games coming out then quarter three nba live 16 need for speed uh and
5016420	5021300	then star wars battlefront which we all knew about that that's probably october through exactly
5021300	5026980	through the end of the year but then quarter four plants versus zombies tba so something in that
5027860	5036260	uh and then mirror's edge is noted for quarter four so mirrors early 2016 early 2016 but not
5036260	5042980	2015 and that is certainly one i expect to hear more about at uh e3 uh good old games we brought
5042980	5048340	this up earlier in the show but if you've been wanting to check out their uh galaxy uh system
5048340	5053700	which is kind of their answer in some ways to steam's front-end system uh it is now in open
5053780	5059700	beta but you can't just go and download it you have to sign up for it then wait for your invite
5059700	5065220	which i don't understand the logic behind it but i guess it's making sure it's not flooding with
5065220	5070180	people all at once or what have you uh but you can check that out uh i signed up for it but i
5070180	5075220	haven't got the invite or whatever to get in there yet so there's not a lot i can add to it but you
5075220	5082740	can check out it's showing off all the future features at gog.com that's gog.com slash galaxy
5082820	5087140	and they are talking about things like rollback is something they want to put into it where you can
5087140	5090980	restore your game to a prior state with just a single click that's something they want to build
5090980	5096580	into it uh they want to be able to make auto updates optional so if you don't like the if you
5096580	5101620	don't like updating uh you're getting forced to update you can basically turn updates off which
5101620	5106340	is kind of rare to hear a company like that but that's something where i don't think on steam you
5106340	5111700	have a choice with that stuff so i think wherever they can kind of poke at steam they probably will
5112260	5118580	uh lastly speaking of steam uh there was some type of issue with the mortal kombat x patch
5118580	5124260	that went up on or sorry oh yeah patch that went up on steam for the game it was actually corrupting
5124260	5129940	save data files and people were losing their save data so what happened a rep from warner brothers
5129940	5134660	actually posted on the mortal kombat x forums on steam we are temporarily removing the patch until
5134660	5139060	we can pinpoint the cause of the saved data loss we're working on this and we'll keep everyone
5139060	5145540	posted as we work towards a fix we sincerely apologize for this disruption um but no word on
5145540	5150660	the uh consoles they seem to be fine that's something that is just affecting the pc version
5150660	5159220	of the game ouch dark sira sorry i was actually watching something that i'm going to be addressing
5159220	5167220	in just a moment um it made me laugh a lot but first let's go on to portal um zen pinball is uh
5167860	5174740	going to be uh having a uh portal themed uh pinball coming out they've actually just have
5174740	5180420	a teaser for it right now it's aperture science heuristic portal pinball device or just portal
5180420	5186100	pinball so that's going to be on may 25th as an add-on for pinball fx2 and zen pinball 2
5186100	5196020	that will be 299 on pc and a dollar 99 on mobile platforms i will have it also uh play tonic games
5196020	5202500	is talking about why they picked the name ukulele for the uh their new kickstarter game and just
5202500	5211700	because the two names together sounded good together and it was uh ukulele sounded good
5211700	5218100	so yeah that was it it just sounded good i thought it was something like it meant something in hawaiian
5218100	5223620	or something too well in the hawaiian dictionary yuku means a small-brained person and lele means
5223620	5231700	to fly or to get off a device so that also what played into it as well but and then in other news
5231700	5239300	arena net did what i wish every mmo would do when they find someone really cheating like majorly
5239300	5248580	cheating basically there was a player named dark side who was using um basically put up video
5248580	5251940	you know basically bragging how he had these uh different applications
5252500	5257460	that were letting him cheat so it wasn't just cheating but going to youtube and bragging
5257460	5262340	about cheating yeah it was using basically the third-party programs um to increase the speed
5262340	5267060	power and teleport ability into enemy structures without using the game mechanic so basically he
5267060	5273460	was breaking the game and so they took control of his character stripped him naked put him at the
5273460	5281220	top of the uh talus tower in the public square and threw him off of it then deleted his account
5281220	5286980	and they deleted the character then deleted the account and they put the whole thing up on youtube
5286980	5294180	under rip dark side i will be sharing this with the chat room which is an appropriate response
5294180	5298420	to somebody who is bragging on youtube now if we just do that with all the gold sellers on final
5298420	5304340	fantasy 14 right i hate all of them i know very i did tell off one of them and he apologized
5306980	5313220	you actually you actually engaged one in conversation i was so annoyed and finally
5313220	5318180	i'm like i want you and everyone like you to leave me alone it was i was just you know
5318180	5320260	being stupid he's like oh i'm sorry
5320260	5330500	it was in mordona that's random i just random slash busy but then nobody can send you tells
5330500	5338340	but yeah that's how i do it slash busy anyway oh my gosh uh let's get into the frugal question
5338340	5341460	i just can't believe you responded to a gold seller
5344420	5345860	let's get into the frugal question of the week
5350340	5357540	every week we ask a question of our facebook and our google plus communities you slam those
5357540	5362740	words together and you get frugal and i gotta say we didn't get a whole lot of response this week
5362740	5367940	but maybe because the topic was a little trickier but uh here it is uh we were this is a follow-up
5367940	5372980	to the reclaim your game issue that dark sakura brought up earlier and so we asked have you ever
5372980	5378820	had a concern with a game that you took to the developer or publisher uh what was it that upset
5378820	5385220	you and made you demand change did it work did you get a reply so over on facebook azhp said not
5385220	5390020	exactly answering the question well then i'm not exactly reading the answer now am i next no all
5390020	5395540	right i'm kidding we'll read it uh but i disagree the gamers don't care enough to fight for their
5395540	5400420	rights they just didn't happen to be passionate about this issue specifically gamers are super
5400420	5405300	vocal when their rights or perceived rights are infringed upon such as with konami and the pt demo
5405300	5411780	or programmed world or skyrim paid mods but if people don't notice or don't care about intrusive
5411780	5417860	drm it just means it wasn't that big of an issue to begin with rage nader says well this kind of
5417860	5422020	sort of answers the question but a few years ago when i still had a playstation 3 and on several
5422020	5426580	occasions within quick succession i had to send it in for repairs as any long time lister will
5426580	5431380	remember i had a good deal of video content from psn's video store and the video stores drm is
5431380	5436340	extremely restrictive on both occasions i had to fight tooth and nail with sony to get my content
5436340	5442980	back degenerate johnny's replies and says back in the day of balder's gate 2 players were bioware
5442980	5448180	stated they could import their balder's gate 2 characters into neverwinter nights unfortunately
5448180	5453620	that was not true due to the transition between dnd second edition and third edition i emailed
5453620	5459140	bioware to see if they could at least import rpg character stats strength con and etc into
5459140	5463540	neverwinter nights surprisingly they did reply to me and said although we would have loved to
5463540	5468580	fulfill our promise to our loyal bg players importing stats would require changes to the
5468580	5473780	core mechanics of neverwinter nights unfortunately such changes are ultimately impossible to make at
5473780	5478900	this time now that the game has been released we apologize if this caused any inconveniences
5478900	5483780	we are confident that you will have as much enjoyment if not more enjoyment you had with bg
5484740	5489300	thanks for your concerns and loyalty from your friends at bioware that was cool that they at
5489300	5496500	least responded um sha100 matt says i actually had an incident two weeks ago recently i've been
5496500	5501380	playing the forest which is in beta still i encountered a glitch where i was swimming on land
5501380	5505860	and i couldn't get out of the animation all i could do was swim up i reloaded my save and it
5505860	5510500	happened again i posted details of the glitch in the devs forum on the steam community page to see
5510500	5515460	if they could fix it the developers responded a few hours later saying that it they were able
5515460	5519540	to replicate it and posted a youtube of it they didn't have a fix for it right away but it would
5519540	5523540	be fixed in the next update while they didn't fix my save i've since avoided that glitch from
5523540	5530340	happening again here's a picture and he posted a picture over there on facebook um going over to
5530340	5534660	google plus i don't think we had a lot of answers on google plus but i think we had at least one
5535220	5540500	kind of funny one over there at google.com plus orange lounge radio yes we have a reply from
5540500	5548660	prince peach fuzz who said i usually just let my wallet do the talking well stated well stated
5548660	5553380	there uh there you go our frugal question of the week from our facebook and our google plus
5553380	5558100	communities and some uh thoughts on interacting with developers when things are going wrong
5559060	5565220	let's move on with some more news loki all right so there's uh a yet another
5566020	5575060	tv show coming um this time being based off of an old old pc game mist that's right mist is
5575060	5584660	going to become a drama now on hulu and this is being i guess um produced by matt tolmak and
5584740	5590340	evan dordy um matt did i guess the amazing spider-man and the sinister six i want to say
5590340	5597540	i think that's upcoming and divergent was the one evan dordy worked on um basically just saying
5597540	5602580	they're gonna blend you know this is going to be sci-fi fantasy it's supposed to explore the
5602580	5610580	origins of the island from the game and also about how you know the guy got there so pretty
5610660	5618820	interesting i'm not sure uh when this is supposed to be out but i don't know i've never really
5618820	5624500	played the original mist i guess that's kind of a sin right there eh you know there's some big game
5624500	5627860	we actually talked about this a couple weeks ago on the show i think it was in the forums there's
5627860	5632100	a lot of big games that we just for whatever reason sometimes we miss and so it's it's fine
5632100	5638100	if you haven't played mist although you know it was for its time i think like the biggest selling
5638100	5643140	pc game ever like at the time it came out so it's pretty big deal so it's worth checking out
5643140	5648420	at some point if you can get around to it i'm just like wondering now though like do a lot of people
5648420	5657060	know what even mist is like i think people in our generation do you know and uh we're in that you
5657060	5663620	know probably anybody who's in the 30 to 40 range probably knows of mist and and would probably be
5663620	5669700	the same type of audience that would uh devour a tv series like this but if the tv series is good
5669700	5676420	enough it won't matter yeah and i could see kind of a lost vibe coming from it so yeah so you know
5676420	5680260	so they chose and check out one whatever they decide to put it out there's a lot of tv shows
5680260	5683860	out there that are based on a book and people maybe never read the book but they watch it
5683860	5689380	anyway so it could happen uh tiger claw pointing out in chat that evan darty was one of the writers
5689380	5697540	for the 2014 tmnt movie uh but not involved with the sequel so some other uh geekery related media
5697540	5704100	there crossing over uh let's talk about the xbox one uh which i got to admit i still don't own an
5704100	5707780	xbox one and that might surprise some of you but neither well i'm getting to the point with
5707780	5712340	xbox one i still want one you know just to you know complete my like like consumer me like some
5712340	5715460	of the stuff they're like ooh sense that overdrive i gotta have it like now i'm at the point it's
5715460	5721300	like or like titanfall ooh new table sense that overdrive i'm like kind of yeah i'm hoping that
5721300	5725540	sunset overdrive comes to pc someday but well i think this holiday it's going to get harder
5725540	5729300	because you're going to have crackdown probably in rise of the tomb raider so i think it's going
5729300	5734100	to get a little cracked down at least yeah yeah for this holiday so i think of it and i still
5734100	5738740	want to play forza horizon 2 i still haven't played so outside of the you know limited demo
5738740	5744660	i had so uh i still it's on my radar to get an xbox one but now i'm at the point where i'm waiting
5744660	5749540	for e3 because who knows what i don't know if there'd necessarily be a price drop there might
5749540	5755860	be a new bundle so we'll see but uh lots of other interesting things going on with xbox one uh
5755860	5762340	apparently uh xbox one is going to gain the ability this is a rumor to record live tv
5763060	5768260	probably this year uh this was something that microsoft originally envisioned for the console
5768260	5775780	but it doesn't offer yet um so uh yeah there's um the live tv tuner in europe and it's going to
5775780	5781300	come to north america and uh there'll be some play pause rewind support with that but full
5781300	5786180	dvr functionality would be something that would be completely new uh just for comparison's sake
5786180	5793380	the ps4 has this if you have the view but you know that's kind of limited and pricey so uh not
5793380	5797460	everybody has that well and also the thing about it though is like i don't even know if it's a big
5797460	5803140	feature nowadays because a lot of cable boxes if you do have cable have dvrs built into them right
5803140	5811700	um it's not like something that it's not common anymore so kind of wonder why i mean actually
5811700	5816580	i don't have a dvr i don't because comcast wants to charge you extra money a month for it yeah
5816580	5821220	it doesn't mean they're not gonna try to charge you extra money for it when it's on part of the
5821220	5825700	xbox one that's what i'm curious to see that's i'm curious to see because if you know if i do
5825700	5830180	get an xbox one i want one anyway i don't really they're not gonna just all of a sudden go okay
5830180	5834900	well i guess you've got around that one well like that they're gonna be like we'll charge you just
5834900	5841060	a little bit less hypothetically couldn't i buy a tivo today and hook that up and i suppose yeah
5841780	5847300	so i think it'll it'll be hard but i mean again i don't really watch enough tv to justify a dvr
5847300	5854340	anyway but i mean i guess if i to me if you're gonna give it to me free i mean all right maybe
5854340	5859060	maybe i'll start collecting episodes of rupaul's drag race or golden girls reruns that i can watch
5859060	5863700	whenever i want i mean there are a lot of things that are shown on basic cable that aren't on
5863700	5868740	netflix that i wouldn't mind just stockpiling like six episodes of wonder why golden girls has ever
5868740	5875540	come into like netflix right i guess that's tv land rosanne showed up and that was well well
5875540	5881620	isn't that that's tv land which isn't that like comcast which isn't or vicom wouldn't that be
5881620	5887220	like hulu i don't remember who's um i think they do have some stuff on netflix though so
5887220	5892500	it just really depends on you know who made it so or can we get like old nickelodeon shows
5892500	5900340	like guts nick arcade maybe maybe we'll have to uh petition the companies start a change.org
5900340	5905460	petition just kidding all right uh william murderface kind of ranting a little bit about
5905460	5910500	microsoft and chat saying i really don't get why microsoft can't support pc better and get us some
5910500	5915380	of those console games and yes i know about exclusivity and how it is used to sell consoles
5915380	5920180	but i hate it well it'll be interesting to see when windows 10 finally comes out it'll be very
5920180	5923780	interesting to see how the two play to get play along together well they have the streaming
5923780	5928820	already for that with windows 10 and then also um they have been releasing some of their console
5928820	5938740	exclusives on pc like rise and i think rise was on pc um and then also uh dead rising 3 i know
5938740	5945940	that's on pc i think rise was on pc yeah maybe not i don't know all right sunset overdrive i
5945940	5951060	would love sunset overdrive i'm sure i'm sure you'll play it eventually i just don't care
5951060	5959300	anymore all right let's move on dark soccer well there is a research out there this is sort of a
5959300	5965940	big dub but it was put out by texas tech university um for their uh for the communication research
5965940	5973940	journal that said that if you play uh cooperative games you know basically games that force people
5973940	5979540	to work together or that require you work together that leads to pro-social behavior after the game
5979540	5988340	is over basically they compared um players who were doing both violent and non-violent game
5988340	5996260	violent games that included um uh being cooperative in those and they said that
5996260	6002340	actually that the cooperative element eliminated the quote negative effects of violent games on
6002340	6007940	player aggression in the real world so basically having a helpful teammate means that you're going
6007940	6013540	to be a helpful person at least as far as their study showed i mean it's kind of a duh but
6013540	6023060	it's interesting um i mean i i don't know i don't i don't get into all these studies or what have
6023060	6027860	you and and try to understand the science of it all but this also does yeah kind of like what you
6027860	6032020	said it kind of seems like a duh like the more you kind of work together with people it helps you
6032020	6037540	build those social skills that you can use in the real world i mean that's just you know people
6038420	6046180	skills or whatever that's all it is but as long as co-op is because co-op can also be like kind of
6047140	6051860	gross sometimes when people play together you know people might kind of take that to a toilet
6051860	6056420	bowl place and you know that would probably not be as constructive but i don't know
6058020	6064900	some random thoughts uh logi all right so this just in activision blizzard's still making lots
6064900	6072660	of money um as reported by their quarter one uh financial year 15 financials uh they're saying
6072660	6079140	that an estimated 1 billion in revenue has been earned by hearthstone and destiny life to date
6080900	6087700	and that's up almost uh just over half a million or half a yeah half a billion dollars actually
6088260	6095060	um from the last time they reported that which is about six months ago and you know still seeing
6095060	6100980	lots of people registered to play those games you know if they have 15 50 million registered players
6100980	6107060	for destiny and hearthstone i guess thanks to all those was it uh no you're saying heroes of the
6107060	6112420	storm well i'm sure that's gonna be part of you know that's gonna only increase thanks to heroes
6112420	6120420	of the storm and all those beta keys um and of course call of duty still um increasing sales
6121300	6130980	and um yeah um but apparently you know the numbers uh in world of warcraft are starting to decline
6130980	6138180	a little bit it was like three million people that they lost this last uh report i mean it
6138180	6142820	sounds a lot worse than it is um because it's just basically like everybody they gained with
6142820	6146420	the new expansion they lost so they're back at the level that they were at before the expansion
6146420	6153700	came out but you know it's it definitely warcraft peaked during wrath of the lich king and kind of
6153700	6159700	stayed there and now it just peaked and dropped right off but i don't really necessarily see that
6159700	6163300	as a lot of doom and gloom for blizzard because i really think a lot of those people that were
6163300	6168980	playing world of warcraft i think they're playing diablo heroes of the storm hearthstone i think
6168980	6172500	they're still in the blizzard bubble somewhere they're just probably not playing wow and i'm
6172500	6176820	probably one of those people i came back for the expansion and i quit because i was kind of bored
6176820	6182100	but i'm still playing heroes of the storm and diablo so i mean am i really a loss for blizzard
6182100	6189060	no no maybe i'm not spending as much money but i thought well i think some of those people are
6189060	6195700	probably leaving um while maybe going to like something else like heroes of the storm or diablo
6195700	6202740	yeah of course with that they're also not paying that monthly fee but well maybe warcraft someday
6202740	6208180	will lose the monthly fee i bet if they did those numbers would go through the roof yeah i could see
6208180	6211700	the same thing happening in the final fantasy 11 yeah you've been saying that for years it still
6211700	6217140	hasn't happened square enix hey i'll tell you what it would help them too how about this how about
6217140	6221700	this you just throw bones to nintendo you just put final fantasy 11 on the wii u make it free
6221700	6228180	to play there they go they have an mmo now you know because i know that system should be able
6228180	6233460	to run final fantasy 11 should be maybe you could use the touchpad touchpad could just be a built-in
6233460	6237460	keyboard for some of the things you had to use for a chat in that game maybe exactly i don't know
6238340	6243700	anyway um this is interesting that there was a a comment of this nature usually uh when it gets
6243700	6248260	into the video game wars you don't really see comments of this nature from executives
6248260	6255860	but unity ceo john ricatello uh was talking on the whole playstation 4 versus xbox one uh these
6255860	6261700	were some comments made at the games beat summit uh and basically saying uh microsoft failed to
6261700	6267220	put the gamers first uh quote there was a clash of ideas that really separated sony and microsoft
6267220	6271780	they actually had very similar architecture they were trying to bring to the table but microsoft
6271780	6277860	focused a lot on entertainment beyond gaming microsoft was trying to compete against apple
6277860	6282260	they didn't feel gaming was big enough to justify the pent-up desire to have the recognition they
6282260	6288100	wanted as an innovator uh sony just said we made the best fucking game system we could partially
6288100	6293060	because they didn't have the resources to do more about it microsoft was focused on the shot after
6293060	6297700	the one they needed to make putting the seven ball in the corner pocket but they missed the first
6297700	6302580	shot and didn't get another shot after it sony focused the shot they needed to make which was
6302580	6306980	when the hearts and the minds of the gamer the broader scope of entertainment might be a bigger
6306980	6312900	idea but not with an unfocused execution a tight execution on the 50 million people at that matter
6312900	6318820	which are the people currently lapping up consoles sony fucking nailed it and they deserve the victory
6318820	6324900	that's a pretty strong comment there uh from somebody of john ricatello stature um
6325860	6330740	again usually you don't really see them getting involved but you know i don't want to dog on
6330740	6336020	microsoft or kick them what they're while they're down but i think even a microsoft fan could kind
6336020	6342500	of see you know maybe there's some strong acute language in what he's saying there but i think
6342500	6346580	he makes a very good example with that microsoft was setting themselves up very well with the whole
6346580	6351300	like seven ball in the corner pocket where they were looking two steps ahead but they weren't
6351300	6356180	looking one step ahead and that might have been what did him in is that they kind of burned their
6356180	6362740	bridges with people that couldn't see that long-term vision so i don't know uh of course
6362740	6367540	this gets some comment in our chat room over at live dot vog network dot com uh s2100 matt says
6367540	6371140	if i were microsoft and we're smart i would announce that they would start bringing some
6371140	6376660	games to windows the first one would be gears of war remastered and uh you know there's some
6376660	6380900	comment there william murderface saying gears of war collection as jay says that's what i mean the
6380900	6385940	remastered is just what they're rumored to be working on uh kai judo says also microsoft tried
6385940	6391060	to shoot a three-pointer and sony just did a layup then microsoft went for a birdie but sony had par
6391060	6395620	in the fourth but i think if microsoft went for the touchdown they could have ran to home plate
6398660	6401780	oh you and then they smoked the stanley bowl
6404500	6410420	all right uh let's go to the mailbag every week you guys email us participate at orange

6526260	6531540	people being selfish bastard assholes who only think of themselves and then

6541300	6548420	yeah but on the plus i would like to say i love my house i own a house now
6549860	6553860	can you believe that i'm gonna come over and burn it down no you're not
6553940	6558740	because grandpa would be sad too i would never i would because we bought grandpa's house

6564580	6569060	although we um one of the gifts we our first homecoming gift that we received
6569860	6577700	was a box full of beer and it had chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzels in it
6577700	6583300	i should get you a housewarming gift and it'll just be a box and you'll open it up and it'll
6583300	6588500	be fucking nothing and the midna will get in it it'll be a bed for midna it's a midnight toy
6588500	6597860	yeah uh moving on to loki you're a few of the week um i guess just fu to toga is not being open
6597860	6604180	at five on sundays and that kind of extends to f you to nippon for not being open to five on
6604180	6609060	any fucking day anymore they're gone they're they're out of business i don't know if you
6609060	6614420	noticed well it makes sense because you're not open after four o'clock i i meant to tweet you
6614420	6617460	about that i went over there on like thursday or friday because i was going to target that was
6617460	6622900	right there and i was like the sign's down empty i was like oh i'm sad the owners were really nice
6622900	6626260	people they were really nice but no one would ever go in there because their hours are fucking
6626260	6630900	shitty they used to be open till eight i would have gone in almost every single day after work
6630900	6635380	but no you know what though they were getting older i hope they didn't have to scale back the
6635380	6638900	hours because maybe they were in hell i would have hoped they were the only ones running that
6638900	6644100	i mean well they had at least passed the recipe to somebody else for god's sake reopen the fulsome
6644100	6653620	location that plays rock man anyway local issues very important here on olr it's slow news week
6653620	6663620	what can we say uh my fu the week goes to mother fucking traffic on the goddamn bay bridge yesterday
6663620	6669540	but the goddamn san mateo bridge is closed so that put all the traffic on the bay bridge so
6669540	6675780	i got to san francisco yesterday an hour later than i had intended to and even ways ways was
6675780	6681860	like ah you'll get there at 12 30. i fucking pull into victoria's at 120 like an hour delay because
6681860	6687620	of fucking traffic on the bay bridge and and all the crap going on around there but on the bright
6687620	6694260	side i got to see drag queens performing the movie drop dead gorgeous yesterday and i got to
6694260	6704660	meet bendy la creme jinx monsoon impendora box and peaches christ so happy i had a great time
6704660	6709780	drag queens y'all serious business all right just a couple more stories for you guys then we're
6709780	6714340	going to get to uh twitter uh for some ask orange lounge tonight if you want to send us a question
6714660	6720420	at olr we will take some questions in chat root and chat here momentarily and your phone calls
6720420	6729380	at 1877 game olr first loki so um you know as i was talking about grand theft auto glitch videos
6729380	6734100	and stuff like that and i'm using mods a lot of these things are accomplished by filming them
6734100	6740660	with the rock star video editor from grand theft auto 5 on pc well you don't have to buy the pc
6740660	6744900	version anymore to get that wonderful editor you can actually have it on console if you have the
6744900	6749220	playstation 4 and xbox one versions they're going to be getting an update sometime this summer
6749780	6755860	and it'll be as soon as it's ready and then you'll have access to all those wonderful tools to
6756580	6761780	cut your own videos if you will and that might be give me a reason to go back and play that game
6761780	6765860	actually i'm really just looking for a hundred percent save for that because i really want to
6765860	6773620	play through that again i mean it was a great game and all but i just it took so long i don't
6773620	6778820	want to play it again that long i should have just done it the first time on playstation 4
6780420	6784820	i think if you've already played through it as especially as in detailed as you have
6784820	6788740	you're entitled to using a save file that already gives you i just want to cheat my way through it
6788740	6794260	again yeah this time i mean i just unfortunately there's no hacks or mods or anything all i really
6794260	6798020	wanted to do was just get it so that i can have my money that i because i'm supposed to have like
6798020	6801540	some pre-order money so i like five hundred thousand dollars or something that's supposed
6801540	6806500	to go to my account in game but um i haven't done it yet so i'm just still waiting on that
6806500	6811780	whenever that's supposed to happen um although it's been like five months now i just think i
6811780	6818180	think i forgot to download the piece of dlc for that though so i don't do that but uh yeah that's
6818180	6822100	really yeah i'll play through it again at some point um because they have all the animals and
6822100	6827940	stuff in there now so it's worth it i'd still want it on pc though the problem is though i ran that
6827940	6835540	was it the can it run this or whatever and it doesn't detect my graphics uh chip correctly and
6835540	6846260	so it's like well maybe i just uh let's see all right uh lastly kind of bringing it full circle
6846260	6851700	tonight because we started off with uh you know konami having uh pissed some great game makers off
6851700	6858180	and going their own ways and now we're closing it talking about koji igurashi uh also known as
6858180	6864180	just eiga uh and what game to meet him and what game is eiga famous for dark soccer
6864820	6870740	metroidvania specifically at least part of that castle the second half of that mostly he didn't
6870740	6876420	make metroid but he made castlevania uh symphony of the night of course a huge huge game for eiga
6876420	6881380	uh and the continued uh duration of the franchise after that well here's something interesting there
6881380	6887860	is a new teaser site out there called sword or whip dot com quite the decision there dark
6887860	6898020	soccer sword or whip i like the whip oh nasty well or you know i believe that it's because i'm not
6898020	6903060	familiar with the series too well i believe that there is a certain female in soul caliber that
6903060	6909380	say why not both yeah porque no less that's right it's ivy are you thinking yes ivy yes
6909380	6913700	all the boys that have played soul caliber no well they did they may i see they just don't
6913700	6919700	remember her name they just remember her appearance yes i know i know i mean even even
6919700	6925140	jamie you know ivy come on the girls notice ivy too mm-hmm because they probably look at ivy and go
6925140	6933300	ow mm-hmm anyway uh there's been rumors going around that there is going to be an egurashi
6934100	6940340	for this project and it certainly seems like uh this site is setting it up uh you can vote for
6940340	6944660	a weapon on this site if you want i heard there were some other funny things too like apparently
6944660	6948100	you could actually enter the konami code on the website you could actually put in like up up down
6948100	6952180	down left right left right ba and uh it would actually say what makes you think that's gonna
6952180	6959300	work here so there's just some funny here's my thing like i didn't realize that he left konami
6959300	6964980	so did they piss him off too i mean seriously what is konami doing it's like hey we got all
6964980	6972980	these talented people fuck you guys seriously we don't need you uh act deft in chat says cool whip

7113620	7116500	accomplishment in olr history um
7120500	7126180	i i i have an answer but i have a heavy answer so i'm gonna look to my co-host first to see if they
7126180	7131300	want to lighten the mood before i i rob's diva fit my diva fit was that your proudest moment
7131300	7137140	when i stormed off the set and said i'm done i'm through yes when somebody uh for those really for
7137140	7141140	those that weren't around there was an episode of olr that's lost forever it was somewhere in the
7141140	7148260	two to three hundred range um that we were taping and the graphics card on the old computer died
7148260	7152900	mid show so like i was frantically trying to put things together and i don't even remember what
7152900	7158820	it was so long ago but somebody said something in the chat that just like set me off like it was
7158820	7163620	like the wrong thing to say at the wrong moment and that chatter and i are fine now although i
7163620	7168660	haven't talked to that person in years i hope they're okay um but uh i just like it just set
7168660	7175220	me off and i was like fine then i'm not gonna do this stupid show bye and i just left and uh
7176660	7182180	to this day because the archive was on justin tv this is before there was twitch tv we were
7182180	7187460	streaming justin tv the archive was on that site for a while and loki without missing a beat
7188100	7193940	all right well next in the news he just moves right on with the news like nothing had happened
7193940	7198740	like i'm i think loki was just doing that whole i'm not hearing this right now
7198740	7201620	i just gotta keep things moving all right that was a thing so
7203940	7207700	to be perfectly honest though i really i mean i guess getting that award
7208500	7213140	when we were still newbies oh the podcast award the very first year getting to go there while i
7213140	7220340	am sick as a dog yeah but going up there and being you know not five inches away from um
7221300	7228180	well great i can't remember curry adam curry's butt yeah yeah that was pretty great um it was
7228180	7238260	actually a really a really good thing so i it's it's still at my desk at home i polished it off
7238260	7243780	i dust that thing there you go they've given away 10 more of those since we won that and
7244500	7250980	that's the only one we ever got so but it was it was cool to be the first it really was and
7250980	7256420	we're honestly i i don't know if this is true but i would think out of all the shows that probably
7256420	7260420	won that year we're probably the only one still going maybe there's one or two others but we're
7260420	7267060	probably the only one still going thing two president cat that was a really interesting
7267060	7272820	little moment of going viral wasn't it it was fun yeah all right so for me greatest accomplishment
7272820	7278820	noel our history truth um and i've gotten probably two or three of these emails over
7278820	7282820	the years and these are the ones that make it all worthwhile but i've gotten emails from listeners
7282820	7289060	that say rob i've listened to your show and like i know that you're a gay guy who just like happens
7289060	7295380	to enjoy video games and all this and listening to your show like made me like under like helped
7295380	7301460	me come to terms with that like i'm gay too and like i don't have to be a certain mold or whatever
7301460	7306020	like i don't have to be the gay guy i see on tv you know there's there's all different types out
7306020	7312820	there and um to get like feedback like that is like i think the most powerful and they by far
7312820	7318100	the most rewarding thing for me personally on a total selfish level because i know like i know
7318100	7323780	logi's not gay under zagre you know not but just on a total selfish level like that is like when i
7323780	7328500	get those emails that's the reward i get and you know i'm sure there's people out there that
7328500	7334820	have emailed dark soccer saying like you know you're a a smart girl that holds her own amongst
7334820	7340100	those two bitches on that show so you know i'm sure you get things like that and loki i don't
7340100	7344820	know what you get but i'm sure you get things too that are like you're a cool dude i get nothing i
7344820	7350100	get nothing i literally get nothing from anybody somebody send loki a hug this i get spam i get
7350100	7355460	lots of spam loki and e-hug you guys people like his nintendo rants even the nintendo fans come on
7356020	7361860	come on loki admits sometimes that there it is there he goes and look at the chat right there
7361860	7367060	it is that's showing on matt says loki you're a cool dude and act f act f is giving you an e-hug
7367060	7373060	there it is uh so what's my like i can't trade this in for money
7374900	7382020	no it's just like so what's my biggest accomplishment i have no idea um i don't
7382020	7387620	know there's that time that i asked jason ninos so what about in the group for yeah that was well
7387620	7392260	you know maybe just the fact you know to kind of take it a step back from that just the fact we
7392260	7400580	were at e3 yeah like that we got to go so early into this show's infancy and you know i know e3's
7400580	7405700	changed a lot and i've shaded it a little bit this year but like you know 12 when it was the first
7405700	7411380	e3 we went to 2004 right was the first e3 we went to i mean it was so like the fact that we were
7411380	7416820	doing this thing we only like read about in magazines was like so cool so i think that's
7416820	7424660	an accomplishment for all of us that we got to do that yeah um i don't know uh bobby blackwolf
7424660	7431380	suggesting uh loki's favorite moment it's so much fun when you're that's just that's just stupid
7431380	7438180	like that it's typical news reporting crap you know i do like an interview for like i don't know
7438260	7442980	a couple minutes and that's what they use it's like thanks you might as well just have cut me
7442980	7449460	out of that or or hey let's take a picture of uh this podcast group from um sacramento and
7449460	7456260	you'll post this really awesome picture of two people talking and someone's foot who's that foot
7456260	7462740	that would be my foot that's my foot it was going for the action shot i'm sitting there with my old
7462740	7468260	toshiba laptop don't forget in that old news piece which is on youtube somewhere or you or
7468260	7472740	they ask our honest opinion about guitar hero and i saw i give them a rank out of 10
7473700	7479060	and then a certain dark sakura is just not content with sticking within the guidelines of the
7479060	7488660	10-point system and she's decided i give it an 11. i'm like thanks having them at my house that
7488660	7496020	was actually kind of cool yeah when i lived at the old house but um i don't forget loki in that
7496020	7501940	news one and they made me hide my konami guitars oh that's right huh yeah with the so much fun
7501940	7508660	thing um you uh or all of us they never said the name of the show oh yeah and that piece on
7508660	7512100	podcast oh that was on podcasting i don't even remember what that was about like it's about
7512100	7515620	podcasting i was right when that was all taken off and they were like did you know there's people in
7515620	7519460	sacramento that do it you should call them up again did you know we're still doing this show
7519460	7524260	like seriously we're still doing this show and they're gonna be like are you adam corolla or
7524260	7532900	mark maron like who cares we've been doing it longer so all right love it anyway uh let's go
7532900	7538500	to twitter because we got some comments here on twitter as well um we had a few things on the
7538500	7543540	twitters this week and i want to read this one from links fantasy on twitter saying not to be
7543540	7549940	bitchy lol but have you thought about giving loki a nintendo minute to vent his rage on the company
7549940	7554580	and all its problems i don't have like hate for them i just think what they do sometimes is really
7554580	7560660	stupid like you know just kind of you know there's stuff that most companies do now they like
7560660	7565220	technology that's out there that okay you kind of expect this on a console nintendo's like
7565220	7574340	nah we'll just we'll get in the voice chat later the the you know public's not ready for voice
7574340	7580500	chat yeah it's like i actually don't see what you do as anger i see it as frustration exactly i
7580500	7585540	love nintendo very big difference because you wouldn't have painted mario and luigi in your
7585540	7590580	kid's bedroom if you didn't have love for nintendo deep down in there and it also happened to be very
7590580	7595140	colorful and that would fit you know baby's room but yes well yeah but i mean we were going
7595140	7601460	to do uh hogwarts in uh wind waker style you know at one point so but you just never got around to
7601460	7606900	that that would have been harder yeah it would have been but um yeah i just i feel like i get
7606900	7612820	from you frustration not anger because i mean and i don't want to put words in your mouth but i get
7612820	7617620	the sense that like you don't think mario kart 8 is a bad game no and you don't think like the
7617620	7621540	stuff that they do are bad games it's just that some of these decisions and even i kind of go
7621540	7627140	with the voice chat thing and i'm just like what like what i mean and i hear their reasoning but
7627140	7632980	i'm like no i you didn't do that in one of your other here's the problem it was fine it's to a
7632980	7638820	lesser extent from like other companies doing the same thing you know let's look at like you know
7638820	7642820	microsoft for example you know they were saying you know we're going to give you the we're going
7642820	7645780	to have it where you buy all your games digitally you know originally when they're pitching the
7645780	7649300	xbox one you're going to buy all your games digitally or whatever you're not going to be able
7649300	7653380	to you know they'll be tied to your account and all this stuff and this is how you're going to do
7653380	7656580	it and people didn't like it because they wanted options they wanted to be able to purchase their
7656580	7662260	games digitally they wanted to purchase physically they wanted to have this people want options which
7662260	7668820	brings us back to nintendo people want options give them to option to use voice chat if they
7668820	7672740	have friends that they want to use voice chat if you want to save children from this you know you
7672740	7678500	can put restrictions on it or something you know where you have a friend code system already in
7678500	7683860	place why can't you have it where you can talk between friends i mean you you went through the
7683860	7690020	you know hassle of having to share codes with each other but yet you don't want to talk to them i just
7690020	7694180	don't understand their thought behind it i think what it was is they're using this as an excuse
7694180	7699380	it's just fuck we just don't want to have voice servers for this shit so you know we're just not
7699380	7703460	gonna do it yeah and this is one of those rare cases where i'm with you i'll still buy splatoon
7703460	7708500	but it's just like ea and battlefront you know it's like oh well we people don't really want
7708500	7712820	these features no it's fuck they just don't want to fucking adapt their engine to have these
7712820	7718580	features is what it is and that's that is just it they're just making excuses of you don't really
7718580	7722260	want this so that's why we're not doing it but really it's because we're just saving my because
7722260	7724900	if they came out and said well we're just not fucking doing because that costs money and we
7724900	7731060	just want to make more money so whatever i mean that's it is what it is well there you go links
7731060	7735540	fantasy that was a good five minutes there but i i i in all seriousness i don't think logan needs
7735540	7740980	a separate segment because anytime any company frustrates him i think he's gonna let you know
7740980	7746020	so we'll uh we'll just keep doing it the way we're doing thank you yeah right because i was gonna say
7746660	7751380	late lately the ratio of konami to nintendo has probably been a little bit more tilted
7751380	7756340	frustrations with konami why can't we do like uh you know i don't know like um
7756340	7760820	what was the rock band game that they had that like music game rock revolution rock no not rock
7760820	7765540	revolution not not konami i'm talking about like rock was it rock band live or some stupid like uh
7765540	7774020	the oh the xbox uh arcade one yeah it was rock band live and whatever dance dance uh central
7774020	7778500	their thing where basically came with no songs and he purchased songs separately i would love
7778500	7784100	a ddr game like i mean i wouldn't love to pay for all that dlc but i would love a new ddr game
7784100	7792580	i would love a new ddr game period that was an arcade well we'll see i don't know i kind of
7792580	7796260	think it's i think it kind of think it's all done there with konami just one other thing i want to
7796260	7800260	say on all that and the anger and so forth you know one thing i i try not to project although
7800260	7805380	we have a good time on this show we laugh we make fun we poke fun we do get frustrated we get
7805380	7812260	passionate and so forth i don't like the whole like cynical gamer thing and i i kind of like
7812500	7817060	i this is going to sound like i'm calling certain individuals out and i'm really not but i just
7817060	7823140	think like if your angle is i'm gonna talk i'm gonna be a cynical bitch when it comes to video
7823140	7828180	games and that's who i am i'm an angry video game person i think that's all you're really bringing
7828180	7832020	to the table i really don't have interest in what you're putting out there because video games are
7832020	7835700	fun video games are a good thing that doesn't mean they're always perfect that doesn't mean
7835700	7841700	they can't be better so i think we can can get frustrated and can you know present options and
7841700	7847300	ideas on how to do better but like if we just sat here on this show and just said it's shit
7847300	7852660	the whole thing is shit these are shitty games and we're doing a shitty show about our shit games
7852660	7858820	that we shitty play for some shitty reason like it just wouldn't be fun like then it's like why are
7858820	7863860	any of us wasting our time nobody wants that nobody likes what they're talking about you know
7863860	7868100	shows like this are supposed to be fun anyway that's my little side tangent i still i don't
7868100	7872740	ever want to see us turn into that you know i don't and and i don't think loki does i really
7872740	7878260	don't i know some of you all think he's very very passionate about nintendo but i i i see passion
7878260	7882900	frustration is very different than anger and cynicism but that doesn't mean we're not going
7882900	7887220	to throw a little shade once in a while because we do try to make you laugh so we are gonna
7887780	7896980	talk a tiny bit of shit but it's all in good fun anyway um spazzinator psn tweeting us uh what
7896980	7903700	should i name the new kitty i think it's a female this is a big responsibility what should i name
7903700	7908900	the new kitty i think it's a female i see jamie picking up the microphone uh what does the kitty
7908900	7915140	look like possibly to say name it jamie no what does the kitty look like you have to tell us we
7915140	7920420	need a picture looks like we need to tweet a picture uh meantime what are some uh video game
7920420	7926660	related females actually i like what uh ssj100 matt said kitty n kitty n oh that's adorable
7928020	7932820	luna those are some good ideas chatters has some good ideas tonight i know he plays a lot of steam
7932820	7938820	games he's always about steam so maybe what about glados how about bayonetta
7941780	7948900	bayonetta the cat what about shell uh chill shell yeah the test subject chill shell i like that
7949860	7954980	i feel like it should be valve related because uh raginator spazzinator loves the steam stuff
7954980	7962420	i just that's where my mind goes anyway how about i like felicia like the cat and puzzle
7962420	7966820	fighter because then whenever the cat leaves the room bye felicia sandwich
7969700	7974340	all right misnamer miss cat there's some suggestions there from our chat room
7974740	7979540	bryce henry 369 is tweeting us did you get a chance to play the splatoon demo if so
7979540	7985540	thoughts bryce either you turned in late or you tuned in late or you're a podcast listener so
7985540	7989140	we did discuss that earlier in the show so hopefully you caught up on that but thank
7989140	7994180	you for the question nonetheless um i'll just answer it quickly again yes i liked it it was
7994180	7998660	more fun than i was anticipating and i love the new twist on a first-person shooter where it's
7998660	8005140	all about the paint as opposed to murder death kill uh and i liked swimming as a squid in the
8005140	8011060	ink i thought that was a neat little uh neat little um twist on it too all right sg100 matt
8011060	8015220	sends us an ask orange lounge question and this is the last one unless i get another one in the
8015220	8020260	next few minutes this is the last ask orange lounge question for the night sg100 matt says
8021060	8029860	we all love some show tunes which video game series would you want to see become a broadway
8029860	8037460	show which video game series would you want to see become a broadway show this is so damn easy
8037460	8044660	easy what is it buggy saints row i would uh it's not actually the answer i had saints row it should
8044660	8050820	be a musical oh my god that should be the next game buggy saints row should be no i would rather
8050820	8057300	not see them do it it was funny saints row the musical would be hilarious it wasn't hilarious i
8057300	8065300	mean it was okay when they did it and uh got out of hell but it's just it it's it is not that funny
8065300	8069940	afterwards i mean i got the joke and i was like okay haha that's kind of that's cute but like it
8069940	8077940	wasn't that hilarious because they already did that joke my answer is bayonetta fly me to the
8077940	8085620	moon come on bayonetta should be a musical it'll be an awesome darsakha what video game should be
8085620	8096020	a musical portal portal i can see that i can see that too especially since um let your name ellen
8096340	8101220	is an opera singer that's right chel's parts will just be like
8103620	8107460	would just be silent it'd be a silent yeah yeah just that's why i didn't say anything it's just
8107460	8115700	like yeah she signs her parts love it uh there it is those are the questions tonight for ask
8115700	8120820	orange lounge i'm gonna ask one more time if there are any phone calls for tonight 1-877-GAMO-L-R
8120820	8125620	username on skype orange lounge radio if not we'll just wrap up a little early i warned you
8125620	8128420	guys it would probably be a shorter show tonight because there's just not as much news going on
8128420	8131540	i will check in real quick and low-key though and see if there's any last minute stories while we
8131540	8137620	wait for phone calls there is a rumor that they're working on a new paper mario game for the wii u
8138660	8143860	i'd like that i like paper i love paper mario yeah i'll my favorite one is super paper mario
8143860	8148820	on the wii that was awesome that was a really good rap out of that game uh they just put you
8148820	8153460	know to maybe lend a little more to that paper mario just went on virtual console the n64 one
8153460	8158100	don't like the original mario or three weeks ago but i like super paper mario i love the
8158100	8164580	crap out of that more of that please all right anything else um i think we talked about this
8164580	8170740	before um was it retro magazine is making a retro console that or it's called retro it's
8170740	8176980	gonna be a console or cartridge based console funny enough it actually uses the old shells
8176980	8183380	from the atari jaguar and it's gonna play cartridges but they're not like it's not playing
8184100	8189620	you know old games it'll be brand new games that are gonna be on cartridge so like a new platform
8189620	8196020	for people to make retro inspired games to on cartridges for like that whole thing to live on
8196020	8201860	that sounds like an expensive hobby but it sounds really cool like hey if they can make it work
8201860	8206580	financially i think it's a great idea i mean i guess cartridges would be cheaper to make now
8206580	8211780	than they were 20 years ago yeah they had it on kickstarter and it actually was kickstarted so
8211780	8216500	wow um it'd be interesting to see but yes that's funny the atari gyware lives on
8217700	8224020	that's awesome excellent well no phone calls are coming in tonight i guess it's just a slower
8224020	8228180	night you guys i don't know what else is going on right now but these shows happen maybe things
8228180	8232260	will get more exciting in the coming weeks as we get closer to e3 what we'll try to do next week
8232260	8236740	on the show um uh we'll try to do a game i was gonna throw in like a list list or a match game
8236740	8241060	for tonight but i just i didn't have time to put something together so we'll try to do that uh next
8241060	8246340	week if we have another slow news week but um who knows going into the coming weeks uh i imagine
8246340	8249540	there's a lot of people not home tonight as well listening to the show because they probably went
8249540	8254100	out took the mom to dinner or cooked dinner or something so uh you know i imagine there's a lot
8254100	8259700	of people busy tonight so uh it is what it is uh we're about done here at orange launch radio but

8293620	8301460	thought l um my final thought for the night is um well i guess since we finished the show early
8301460	8305140	maybe i can try to go out and do a little walking even though it's getting dark so i don't want to
8305140	8309220	walk far but i do need to get my step count out for the day because i haven't left the house so i
8309220	8314420	think this means i need to go play ingress i don't know um but uh i do want to also say for my final
8314420	8318500	thought that uh some folks have been doing a little fitbit step challenge and it looks like
8318500	8322580	there's going to be another one next week so hopefully i don't get sick next week i didn't
8322580	8327300	even talk about that on tonight's show i got like weird sick allergies thing which i've never had in
8327300	8331700	my life uh in the middle of the week this week and it ruined my step count so i hope to do more
8331700	8337780	stepping next week oh act deft you're too late oh did act deaf try to call he missed the queue yeah
8337780	8344580	i'm sorry well i said like three times sorry guys uh last but not least uh loki your final thought
8345380	8352420	i love this cat animation it's stupid stupid in the good way though yes it it hops it just
8353060	8357860	i mean i guess it'd be better for rabbit animation but it's it's like south park walking you know
8357860	8364260	where they don't move they just kind of hop and move so that's what it does love it love it well
8364260	8367620	that is going to do it for another night here at orange ontario we will be back in seven days to
